<l>He of the poor hut lord and his son, the pair of them peasants:</l>
<l>This with assiduous toil aye works the thicketty herbage</l>
<l>And the coarse water-grass to clear afar from my chapel:</l>
<l>That with his open hand ever brings me offerings humble.</l>
<l>Hung up in honour mine are flowery firstlings of spring-tide,<milestone n="20" unit="line"/></l>
<l>Wreaths with their ears still soft the tender stalklets a-crowning;</l>
<l>Violets pale are mine by side of the poppy-head pallid;</l>

<l>Anon mine altar (this same) with blood (but you will be silent!)<milestone n="15" unit="line"/></l>
<l>Bearded kid and anon some horny-hoofed nanny shall sprinkle.</l>
<l>Wherefore Priapus is bound to requite such honours by service,</l>

<l>Here then, O lads, refrain from ill-mannered picking and stealing:</l>

<l>In spring with vari-coloured wreaths I'm crown'd,</l>

<head>THE ADVENTURES OF ATYS</head>
<l>O'er high deep seas in speedy ship his voyage Atys sped</l>
<l>Until he trod the Phrygian grove with hurried eager tread</l>
<l>And as the gloomy tree-shorn stead, the she-god's home, he sought</l>
<l>There sorely stung with fiery ire and madman's vaguing thought,</l>
<l>Share he with sharpened flint the freight wherewith his form was fraught.</l>
<l>Then as the she-he sensed limbs were void of manly strain</l>
<l>And sighted freshly shed a-ground spot of ensanguined stain,</l>
<l>Snatched she the timbrel's legier load with hands as snowdrops white,</l>
<l>Thy timbrel, Mother Cybele, the firstings of thy rite,</l>
<l>And as her tender finger-tips on bull-back hollow rang</l>
<l>She rose a-grieving and her song to listening comrades sang.</l>
<l>"Up Gallae, hie together, haste for Cybele's deep grove,</l>
<l>Hie to the Dindymnean dame, ye flocks that love to rove;</l>
<l>The which affecting stranger steads as bound in exile's brunt</l>
<l>My sect pursuing led by me have nerved you to confront</l>
<l>The raging surge of salty sea and ocean's tyrant hand</l>
  <l>As your hate of <persName><surname>Venus</surname></persName>' hest your manly forms unmann'd,</l>
<l>Gladden your souls, ye mistresses, with sense of error bann'd.</l>
<l>Drive from your spirits dull delay, together follow ye</l>
<l>To hold of Phrygian goddess, home of Phrygian Cybebe,</l>
<l>Where  loud the cymbal's voice resounds with timbrel-echoes blending,</l>
<l>And where the Phrygian piper drones grave bass from reed a-bending,</l>
<l>Where toss their ivy-circled heads with might the Maenades</l>
<l>Where ply mid shrilly lullilooes the holiest mysteries,</l>
<l>Where to fly here and there be wont the she-god's vaguing train,</l>
<l>Thither behoves us lead the dance in quick-step hasty strain."</l>
<l>Soon as had Atys (bastard-she) this lay to comrades sung</l>
<l>The Chorus sudden lulliloos with quivering, quavering tongue,</l>
<l>Again the nimble timbrel groans, the scooped-out cymbals clash,</l>
<l>And up green Ida flits the Choir, with footsteps hurrying rash</l>
<l>Then Atys frantic, panting, raves, a-wandering, lost, insane,</l>
<l>And leads with timbrel hent and treads the shades where shadows rain,</l>
<l>Like heifer spurning load of yoke in yet unbroken pride;</l>
<l>And the swift Gallae follow fain their first and fleet-foot guide.</l>
<l>But when the home of Cybele they make with toil out-worn</l>
  <l>O'er much, they lay them down to sleep and gifts of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> scorn;</l>
<l>Till heavy slumbers seal their eyelids langourous, drooping lowly,</l>
<l>And raving frenzy flies each brain departing softly, slowly.</l>
<l>But when Dan Sol with radiant eyes that fire his face of gold</l>
<l>Surveyed white aether and solid soil and waters uncontrol'd,</l>
<l>And chased with steeds sonorous-hooved the shades of lingering night,</l>
<l>Then sleep from waking Atys fled fleeting with sudden flight,</l>
<l>By Nymph Pasithae welcomed to palpitating breast.</l>
<l>Thus when his frenzy raging rash was soothed to gentlest rest,</l>
<l>Atys revolved deeds lately done, as thought from breast unfolding,</l>
<l>And what he'd lost and what he was with lucid sprite beholding,</l>
<l>To shallows led by surging soul again the way 'gan take.</l>
<l>There casting glance of weeping eyes where vasty billows brake,</l>
<l>Sad-voiced in pitifullest lay his native land bespake.</l>
<l>"Country of me, Creatress mine, born to thee and bred,</l>
<l>By hapless me abandoned as by thrall from lordling fled,</l>
<l>When me to Ida's groves and glades these vaguing footsteps bore</l>
<l>To tarry 'mid the snows and where lurk beasts in antres frore</l>
<l>And seek the deeply hidden lairs where furious ferals meet!</l>
<l>Where, Country! whither placed must I now hold thy site and seat?</l>
<l>Lief would these balls of eyes direct to thee their line of sight,</l>
<l>Which for a while, a little while, would free me from despite.</l>
<l>Must I for ever roam these groves from house and home afar?</l>
<l>Of country, parents, kith and kin (life's boon) myself debar?</l>
<l>Fly Forum, fly  Palestra, fly the Stadium, the Gymnase?</l>
<l>Wretch, ah poor wretch, I'm doomed (my soul!) to mourn throughout my days,</l>
<l>For what of form or figure is, which I failed to enjoy?</l>
<l>I full-grown man, I blooming youth, I stripling, I a boy,</l>
<l>I of Gymnasium erst the bloom, I too of oil the pride:</l>
<l>Warm was my threshold, ever stood my gateways opening wide,</l>
<l>My house was ever garlanded and hung with flowery freight,</l>
<l>And couch to quit with rising sun, has ever been my fate:</l>
<l>Now must I Cybele's she-slave, priestess of gods, be hight?</l>
<l>I Maenad I, mere bit of self, I neutral barren wight?</l>
<l>I spend my life-tide couch't beneath high-towering Phrygian peaks?</l>
<l>I dwell on Ida's verdant slopes mottled with snowy streaks,</l>
<l>Where homes the forest-haunting doe, where roams the wildling boar?</l>
<l>Now, now I rue my deed foredone, now, now it irks me sore!"</l>
<l>Whenas from out those roseate lips these accents rapid flew,</l>
<l>Bore them to ears divine consigned a Nuncio true and new;</l>
<l>Then Cybele her lions twain disjoining from their yoke</l>
<l>The left-hand enemy of the herds a-goading thus bespoke:</l>
<l>"Up feral fell! up, hie with him, see rage his foot-steps urge,</l>
<l>See that his fury smite him till he seek the forest verge,</l>
<l>He who with over-freedom fain would fly mine empery.</l>
<l>Go, slash thy flank with lashing tail and sense the strokes of thee,</l>
<l>Make the whole mountain to thy roar sound and resound again,</l>
<l>And fiercely toss thy brawny neck that bears the tawny mane!"</l>
<l>So quoth an angered Cybele, and yoke with hand untied:</l>
<l>The feral rose in fiery wrath and self-inciting hied,</l>
<l>A-charging, roaring through the brake with breaking paws he tore.</l>
<l>But when he reached the humid sands where surges cream the shore,</l>
<l>Spying soft Atys lingering near the marbled pave of sea</l>
<l>He springs: the terror-madded wretch back to the wood doth flee,</l>
<l>Where for the remnant of her days a bondmaid's life led she.</l>
<l>Great Goddess, Goddess Cybele, Dindymus dame divine,</l>
<l>Far from my house and home thy wrath and wrack, dread mistress mine:</l>
<l>Goad others on with Fury's goad, others to Ire consign!</l>

<head>Marriage of Peleus and Thetis</head>
<l>Pine-trees gendered whilome upon soaring Peliac summit</l>
  <l>Swam (as the tale is told) through liquid surges of <persName><surname>Neptune</surname></persName></l>
<l>Far as the Phasis-flood and frontier-land Aeetean;</l>
<l>Whenas the youths elect, of <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> vigour the oak-heart,</l>
<l>Longing the Golden Fleece of the Colchis-region to harry,</l>
<l>Dared in a poop swift-paced to span salt seas and their shallows,</l>
<l>Sweeping the deep blue seas with sweeps a-carven of fir-wood.</l>
<l>She, that governing Goddess of citadels crowning the cities,</l>
<l>Builded herself their car fast-flitting with lightest of breezes,</l>
<l>Weaving plants of the pine conjoined in curve of the kelson;</l>
<l>Foremost of all to imbue rude Amphitrite with ship-lore.</l>
<l>Soon as her beak had burst through wind-rackt spaces of ocean,</l>
<l>While the oar-tortured wave with spumy whiteness was blanching,</l>
<l>Surged from the deep abyss and hoar-capped billows the faces</l>
<l>Seaborn, Nereids eyeing the  prodigy wonder-smitten.</l>
<l>There too mortal orbs through softened spendours regarded</l>
<l>Ocean-nymphs who exposed bodies denuded of raiment</l>
<l>Bare to the breast upthrust from hoar froth capping the sea-depths.</l>
<l>Then Thetis Peleus fired (men say) a-sudden with love,</l>
<l>Then Thetis nowise spurned to mate and marry with mortal,</l>
<l>Then Thetis' Sire himself her yoke with Peleus sanctioned.</l>
<l>Oh, in those happier days now fondly yearned-for, you heroes</l>
<l>Born; (all hail!) of the gods begotten, and excellent issue</l>
<l>Bred by your mothers, all hail! and placid deal me your favour.</l>
<l>Oft with the sound of me, in strains and spells I'll invoke you;</l>
<l>You too by wedding-torch so happily, highly augmented,</l>
  <l>Peleus, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>'s ward, in whose favor <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> himself,</l>
<l>The Father of the gods, resigned his passions.</l>
<l>You Thetis, fairest of maids Nereian, vouchsafed to marry?</l>
<l>You did Tethys empower to woo and wed with her grandchild;</l>
<l>Nor less Oceanus, with water compassing th' Earth-globe?</l>
<l>But when ended the term, and wisht-for light of the day-tide</l>
<l>Uprose, flocks to the house in concourse mighty, convened,</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> all, with glad assembly the Palace fulfilling:</l>

<l>Never a pruner's hook thins out the shade of the tree-tufts,</l>
<l>Never a bull up-plows broad glebe with bend of the coulter,</l>
<l>Over whose point unuse displays the squalor of rust-stain.</l>
<l>But in the homestead's heart, where'er that opulent palace</l>
<l>Hides a retreat, all shines with splendour of gold and of silver.</l>
<l>Ivory blanches the seats, bright gleam the flagons a-table,</l>
<l>All of the mansion joys in royal riches and grandeur.</l>
<l>But for the Diva's use bestrewn is the genial bedstead,</l>
<l>Hidden in midmost stead, and its polisht framework of Indian</l>
<l>Tusk underlies its cloth empurpled by juice of the dye-shell.</l>
<l>This be a figured cloth with forms of manhood primeval</l>
<l>Showing by marvel-art the gifts and graces of heroes.</l>
<l>Here upon Dia's strand wave-resonant, ever-regarding</l>

<l>Stands Ariadne with heart full-filled with furies unbated,</l>
<l>Nor can her sense as yet believe she 'spies the espied,</l>
<l>When like one that awakes new roused from slumber deceptive,</l>
<l>Sees she her hapless self lone left on loneliest sandbank:</l>
<l>While as the mindless youth with oars disturbeth the shallows,</l>
<l>Casts to the windy storms what vows he vainly had vowed.</l>
<l>Him through the sedges afar the sad-eyed maiden of Minos,</l>
<l>Likest a Bacchant-girl stone-carven, (O her sorrow!)</l>
<l>'Spies, a-tossing the while on sorest billows of love-care.</l>
<l>Now no more on her blood-hued hair fine fillets retains she,</l>
<l>No more now light veil conceals her bosom erst hidden,</l>
<l>Now no more smooth zone contains her milky-hued paplets:</l>
<l>All gear dropping adown from every part of her person</l>
<l>Thrown, lie fronting her feet to the briny wavelets a sea-toy.</l>
<l>But at such now no more of her veil or her fillet a-floating</l>
<l>Had she regard: on you, Theseus! all of her heart-strength,</l>
<l>All of her sprite, her mind, forlorn, were evermore hanging.</l>
<l>Ah, sad soul, by grief and grievance driven beside you,</l>

<l>Many a chosen youth and the bloom of damsels unmarried</l>
<l>Food for the Minotaur, Cecropia was wont to befurnish.</l>
<l>Seeing his narrow walls in such wise vexed with evils,</l>
<l>Theseus of freest will for dear-loved <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> his body</l>
<l>Offered a victim so that no more to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> be deported</l>
<l>Lives by Cecropia doomed to burials burying nowise;</l>
<l>Then with a swifty ship and soft breathed breezes a-stirring,</l>
<l>Sought he Minos the Haughty where homed in proudest of Mansions.</l>
<l>Him as with yearning glance forthright espied the royal</l>
<l>Maiden, whom pure chaste couch aspiring delicate odours</l>
<l>Cherisht, in soft embrace of a mother comforted all-whiles,</l>
<l>(E'en as the myrtles begot by the flowing floods of Eurotas,</l>
<l>Or as the tincts distinct brought forth by breath of the springtide)</l>
<l>Never the burning lights of her eyes from gazing upon him</l>
<l>Turned she, before fierce flame in all her body conceived she</l>
<l>Down in its deepest depths and burning within her marrow.</l>
<l>Ah, with unmitigate heart exciting wretchedmost furies,</l>
<l>You, Boy sacrosanct! man's grief and gladness commingling,</l>
<l>You too of Golgos Queen and Lady of leafy <placeName key="tgn,7002336">Idalium</placeName>,</l>
<l>Whelm'd you in what manner waves that maiden fantasy-fired,</l>
<l>All for a blond-haired youth suspiring many a singulf!</l>
<l>Whiles how dire was the dread she dreed in languishing heart-strings;</l>
<l><milestone n="100" unit="line"/>How yet more, ever more, with golden splendour she paled!</l>
<l>Whenas yearning to mate his might with the furious monster</l>
<l>Theseus braved his death or sought the prizes of praises.</l>
<l>Then of her gifts to gods not ingrate, nor profiting naught,</l>
<l>Promise with silent lip, addressed she timidly vowing.</l>
<l>For as an oak that shakes on topmost summit of Taurus</l>
<l>Its boughs, or cone-growing pine from bole bark resin exuding,</l>
<l>Whirlwind of passing might that twists the stems with its storm-blasts,</l>
<l>Uproots, deracinates, forthright its trunk to the farthest,</l>
<l>Prone falls, shattering wide what lies in line of its downfall,&mdash;</l>
<l>Thus was that wildling flung by Theseus and vanquisht of body,</l>
<l>Vainly tossing its horns and goring the wind to no purpose.</l>
<l>Thence with abounding praise returned he, guiding his footsteps,</l>
<l>While a fine drawn thread checked steps in wander abounding,</l>
<l>Lest when issuing forth of the winding maze labyrinthine</l>
<l>Baffled become his track by inobservable error.</l>
<l>But for what cause should I, from early subject digressing,</l>
<l>Tell of the daughter who the face of her sire unseeing,</l>
<l>Eke her sister's embrace nor less her mother's endearments,</l>
<l>Who in despair bewept her hapless child that so gladly</l>
<l>Chose before every and each the lively wooing of Theseus?</l>
<l>Or how borne by the ship to the yeasting shore-line of Dia</l>
<l>Came she? or how when bound her eyes in bondage of slumber</l>
<l>Left her that chosen mate with mind unmindful departing?</l>
<l>Often (they tell) with heart inflamed by fiery fury</l>
<l>Poured she shrilling of shrieks from deepest depths of her bosom;</l>
<l>Now she would sadly scale the broken faces of mountains,</l>
<l>Whence she might overglance the boundless boiling of billows,</l>
<l>Then she would  rush to bestem the salt-plain's quivering wavelet</l>
<l>And from her ankles bare the dainty garment uplifting,</l>
<l>Spoke she these words ('tis said) from sorrow's deepest abysses,</l>
<l>While from her tear-drencht face outburst cold shivering sobs.</l>
<l>"Thus from my patrial shore, O traitor, hurried to exile,</l>
<l>Me on a lonely strand hast left, perfidious Theseus?</l>
<l>Thus wise farest, despite the godhead of Deities spurned,</l>
<l>(Reckless, alas!) to your home convoying perjury-curses?</l>
<l>Naught, then, ever availed that mind of cruelest counsel</l>
<l>Alter? No saving grace in you was evermore ready,</l>
<l>That to have pity on me vouchsafed your pitiless bosom?</l>
<l>Nevertheless not in past time such were the promises wordy</l>
<l>Lavished; nor such hopes to me the hapless were bidden;</l>
<l>But the glad married joys, the longed-for pleasures of wedlock.</l>
<l>All now empty and vain, by breath of the breezes bescattered!</l>
<l>Now, let woman no more trust her to man when he sweareth,</l>
<l>Ne'er let her hope to find or truth or faith in his pleadings,</l>
<l>Who when lustful thought forelooks to somewhat attaining,</l>
<l>Never an oath they fear, shall spare no promise to promise.</l>
<l>Yet no sooner they sate all lewdness and lecherous fancy,</l>
<l>Nothing remember of words and reck they naught of fore-swearing.</l>
<l>Certes, you did I snatch from midmost whirlpool of ruin</l>
<l>Deadly, and held it cheap loss of a brother to suffer</l>
<l>Rather than fail your need (O false!) at hour the supremest.</l>
<l>Therefore my limbs are doomed to be torn of birds, and of ferals</l>
<l>Prey, nor shall upheapt Earth afford a grave to my body.</l>
<l>Say me, what lioness bare you 'neath lone rock of the desert?</l>
<l>What sea spued you conceived from out the spume of his surges!</l>
<l>What manner Syrt, what ravening Scylla, what vasty Charybdis?</l>
<l>you who for sweet life saved such meeds are lief of returning!</l>
<l>If never willed your breast with me to mate you in marriage,</l>
<l>Hating the savage law decreed by primitive parent,</l>
<l>Still of your competence 'twas within your household to home me,</l>
<l>Where I might serve as slave in gladsome service familiar,</l>
<l>Laving your snow-white feet in clearest chrystalline waters</l>
<l>Or with its purpling gear your couch in company strewing.</l>
<l>Yet for what cause should I complain in vain to the winds that unknow me,</l>
<l>(I so beside me with grief!) which ne'er of senses endued</l>
<l>Hear not the words sent forth nor aught avail they to answer?</l>
<l>Now be his course well-nigh engaged in midway of ocean,</l>
<l>Nor any mortal shape appears in barrens of sea-wrack.</l>

<l>Nor had yon evil wight, 'neath shape the softest hard purpose</l>

<l>Whither can wend I now? What hope lends help to the lost one?</l>
<l>Idomenean mounts shall I scale? Ah, parted by whirlpools</l>

<l>Aid of my sire can I crave? Whom I willing abandoned,</l>

<l>Who flies me with pliant oars, flies overbounding the sea-depths?</l>
<l>Nay, if this Coast I quit, this lone isle lends me no roof-tree,</l>
<l>Nor aught issue allows begirt by billows of Ocean:</l>
<l>Nowhere is path for flight: none hope shows: all things are silent:</l>
<l>All be a desolate waste: all makes display of destruction.</l>
<l>Yet never close these eyes in latest languor of dying,</l>
<l>Ne'er from my wearied frame go forth slow-ebbing my senses,</l>
<l>Ere from the Gods just doom implore I, treason-betrayed,</l>
<l>And with my breath supreme firm faith of Celestials invoke I.</l>
<l>Therefore, O you who 'venge man's deed with penalties direful,</l>

<l>Foreheads,&mdash;Oh, deign outspeak fierce wrath from bosom outbreathing,</l>

<l>And, as indeed all spring from veriest core of my bosom,</l>
<l>Suffer you not the cause of grief and woe to evanish;</l>
<l>But with the Will wherewith could Theseus leave me in loneness,</l>
<l>Goddesses! bid that Will lead him, lead his, to destruction."</l>
<p></p><l><milestone n="202" unit="line"/>E'en as she thus poured forth these words from anguish of bosom,</l>
<l>And for this cruel deed, distracted, sued she for vengeance,</l>

<l>Meanwhile Theseus himself, obscured in blindness of darkness</l>

<l>Erewhile enjoined and held hereto in memory constant,</l>
<l>Nor for his saddened sire the gladness-signals uphoisting</l>

<l>For 'twas told of yore, when from walls of the Virginal Deess</l>

<p></p><l>"Son! far nearer my heart (you alone) than life of the longest,</l>

<l>But from my soul I'll first express an issue of sorrow,</l>
<l>Soiling my hoary hairs with dust and ashes commingled;</l>
<l>Then will I hang stained sails fast-made to the wavering yard-arms,</l>
<l>So shall our mourning thought and burning torture of spirit</l>
<l>Show by the dark sombre-dye of Iberian canvas spread.</l>
<l>But, grant me the grace Who dwells in Sacred Itone,</l>
<l>(And our issue to guard and ward the seats of Erechtheus</l>
<l>Sware She) that if your right is besprent with blood of the Man-Bull,</l>
<l>Then do you so-wise act, and stored in memory's heart-core</l>
<l>Dwell these mandates of me, no time their traces untracing.</l>

<l>Down from your every mast the ill-omened vestments of mourning,</l>
<l>Then let the twisten ropes upheave the whitest of canvas,</l>
<l>Wherewith splendid shall gleam the tallest spars of the top-mast,</l>
<l>These seeing sans delay with joy exalting my spirit</l>
<l>Well shall I wot boon Time sets you returning before me."</l>
<p></p><l>Such were the mandates which stored at first in memory constant</l>
<l>Faded from Theseus' mind like mists, compelled by the whirlwind,</l>
<l>Fleet from aerial crests of mountains hoary with snow-drifts.</l>
<l>But as the sire had sought the citadel's summit for outlook,</l>
<l>Wasting his anxious eyes with tear-floods evermore flowing,</l>
<l>Forthright e'en as he saw the sail-gear darkened with dye-stain,</l>
<l>Headlong himself flung he from the sea-cliff's pinnacled summit</l>
<l>Holding his Theseus lost by doom of pitiless Fortune.</l>
<l>Thus as he came to the home funest, his roof-tree paternal,</l>
<l>Theseus (vaunting the death), what dule to the maiden of Minos</l>

<l>For did the hapless forget when in loose-girt garment it lurk&egrave;d,</l>
<l>Forth would it leap as she rose, scared by her mother's approach,</l>

<head>(LOQUITUR) BERENICE'S LOCK.</head>
<l>He who every light of the sky world's vastness inspected,</l>

<l>How at the seasons assured vanish the planets from view,</l>
<l>How <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> to lurk thief-like 'neath Latmian stone-fields,</l>

<l>Fulgent in brightness afar, to many a host of the Godheads</l>
<l>Stretching her soft smooth arms she vowed to devoutly bestow,</l>
<l>What time strengthened by joy of new-made wedlock the monarch</l>
<l>Bounds of Assyrian land hurried to plunder and pill;</l>
<l>Bearing of nightly strife new signs and traces delicious,</l>
<l>Won in the war he waged virginal trophies to win. </l>

<l>Poured in profusion amid illuminate genial chamber?</l>
<l>Nay not real the 'groans; ever so help me the Gods!</l>
<l>This truth taught me my Queen by force of manifold 'plainings</l>
<l>After her new groom hied facing the fierceness of fight.</l>
<l>Yet so thou mournedst not for a bed deserted of husband,</l>
<l>As for a brother beloved wending on woefullest way?</l>
<l>How was the marrow of thee consumedly wasted by sorrow!</l>
<l>So clean forth of thy breast, rackt with solicitous care,</l>
<l>Mind fled, sense being reft! But I have known thee for certain</l>
<l>E'en from young virginal years lofty of spirit to be. </l>
<l>Hast thou forgotten the feat whose greatness won thee a royal</l>

<l>Yet how sad was the speech thou spakest, thy husband farewelling!</l>
  <l>(<persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>!) Often thine eyes wiping with sorrowful hand!</l>
<l>What manner God so great thus changed thee? Is it that lovers</l>

<l>Maugr&egrave; my will, I attest, swearing by thee and thy head;</l>
<l>Penalty due shall befall whoso makes oath to no purpose.</l>
<l>Yet who assumes the vaunt forceful as iron to be? </l>
<l>E'en was that mount o'erthrown, though greatest in universe, where through</l>
<l>Th&iacute;a's illustrious race speeded its voyage to end,</l>
<l>Whenas the Medes brought forth new sea, and barbarous youth-hood</l>

<l>Winnowing upper air wi' feathers flashing and quiv'ring,</l>

<l>Whence upraising myself he flies through a&euml;ry shadows,</l>
<l>And in chaste Venus' breast drops he the present he bears.</l>
<l>Eke Zephyritis had sent, for the purpose trusted, her bondsman,</l>
<l>Settler of Grecian strain on the Canopian strand.</l>
<l>So willed various Gods, lest sole 'mid lights of the Heavens</l>

<l>We the consecrate spoils shed by a blond-hued head,</l>
<l>Even as weeping-wet sought I the fanes of Celestials </l>

<l>Radiance with Callisto, maid of Lyc&acute;on beloved, </l>
<l>Wind I still to the west, conducting tardy Bo&ouml;tes,</l>
<l>Who unwilling and slow must into Ocean merge. </l>

<l>(Lend me thy leave to speak such words, Rhamnusian Virgin,</l>

<l>Now do you pair conjoined by the longed-for light of the torches,</l>
<l>Earlier yield not selves unto unanimous wills </l>
<l>Nor wi' the dresses doft your bar&egrave;d nipples encounter,</l>
<l>Ere shall yon onyx-vase pour me libations glad,</l>
<l>Onyx yours, ye that seek only rights of virtuous bed-rite.</l>
<l>But who yieldeth herself unto advowtry impure,</l>
<l>Ah! may her loathed gifts in light dust uselessly soak,</l>
<l>For of unworthy sprite never a gift I desire.</l>
<l>Rather, 0 new-mated brides, be concord aye your companion,</l>
<l>Ever let constant love dwell in the dwellings of you. </l>
<l>Yet when thou sightest, 0 Queen, the Constellations, I pray thee,</l>
<l>Every festal day Venus the Goddess appease;</l>
<l>Nor of thy unguent-gifts allow myself to be lacking,</l>

<l>So might I save thee flung by spuming billows of ocean,</l>
<l>Shipwreckt, rescuing life snatcht from the threshold of death;</l>
<l>Eke neither Venus the Holy to rest in slumber's refreshment</l>
<l>Grants thee her grace on couch lying deserted and lone,</l>
<l>Nor can the Muses avail with dulcet song of old writers</l>
<l>Ever delight thy mind sleepless in anxious care;</l>
<l>Grateful be this to my thought since thus thy friend I'm entitled,</l>
<l>Hence of me seekest thou gifts Muses and Venus can give:</l>
<l>But that bide not unknown to thee my sorrows (0 Manius!)</l>
<l>And lest office of host I should be holden to hate, </l>
<l>Learn how in Fortune's deeps I chance myself to be drown&egrave;d,</l>
<l>Nor fro' the poor rich boons furthermore prithee require.</l>
<l>What while first to myself the pure-white garment was given,</l>
<l>Whenas my flowery years flowed in fruition of spring,</l>
<l>Much I disported enow, nor 'bode I a stranger to Goddess</l>
<l>Who with our cares is lief sweetness of bitter to mix:</l>
<l>Yet did a brother's death pursuits like these to my sorrow</l>
<l>Bid for me cease: Oh, snatcht brother! from wretchedest me.</l>
<l>Then, yea, thou by thy dying hast broke my comfort, 0 brother;</l>
<l>Buried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house;</l>
<l>Perisht along wi' thyself all gauds and joys of our life-tide,</l>
<l>Douce love fostered by thee during the term of our days.</l>
<l>After thy doom of death fro' mind I banish&egrave;d wholly</l>
<l>Studies like these, and all lending a solace to soul;</l>
<l>Wherefore as to thy writ :&mdash;"Verona's home for Catullus</l>
<l>Bringeth him shame, for there men of superior mark</l>
<l>Must on a deserted couch fain chafe their refrigerate limbs:"</l>
<l>Such be no shame (Manius!): rather 'tis matter of ruth.</l>
<l>Pardon me, then, wilt thou an gifts bereft me by grieving</l>
<l>These I send not to thee since I avail not present. </l>
<l>For, that I own not here abundant treasure of writings</l>
<l>Has for its cause, in Rome dwell I; and there am I homed,</l>
<l>There be my seat, and there my years are gathered to harvest;</l>
<l>Out of book-cases galore here am I followed by one. </l>
<l>This being thus, nill I thou deem 'tis spirit malignant</l>
<l>Acts in such wise or mind lacking of liberal mood </l>
<l>That to thy prayer both gifts be not in plenty suppli&egrave;d:</l>
<l>Willingly both had I sent, had I the needed supply.</l>
<l>Nor can I (Goddesses!) hide in what things Allius sent me</l>

<l>Neither shall fugitive Time from centuries ever oblivious</l>
<l>Veil in the blinds of night friendship he lavisht on me.</l>
<l>But will I say unto you what you shall say to the many</l>
<l>Thousands in turn, and make paper, old crone, to proclaim</l>
<l><gap/></l>
<l>And in his death become noted the more and the more,</l>
<l>Nor let spider on high that weaves her delicate webbing</l>
<l>Practise such labours o'er Allius' obsolete name.  </l>
<l>For that ye weet right well what care Amath&uacute;sia two-faced</l>
<l>Gave me, and how she dasht every hope to the ground,</l>
<l>Whenas I burnt so hot as burn Trinacria's rocks or </l>
<l>Mallia stream that feeds &OElig;t&eacute;an Thermopylae;</l>
<l>Nor did these saddened eyes to be dimmed by assiduous weeping</l>
<l>Cease, and my cheeks with showers ever in sadness be wet.</l>
<l>E'en as from a&euml;ry heights of mountain springeth a springlet</l>
<l>Limpidest leaping forth from rocking felted with moss,</l>
<l>Then having headlong rolled the prone-laid valley downpouring,</l>
<l>Populous region amid wendeth his gradual way,  </l>
<l>Sweetest solace of all to the sweltering traveller wayworn,</l>
<l>Whenas the heavy heat fissures the fiery fields; </l>
<l>Or, as to seamen lost in night of whirlwind a-glooming</l>
<l>Gentle of breath there comes fairest and favouring breeze,</l>
<l>Pollux anon being prayed, nor less vows offered to Castor:&mdash;</l>
<l>Such was the aidance to us Manius pleased to afford.</l>
<l>He to my narrow domains far wider limits laid open,</l>
<l>He too gave me the house, also he gave me the dame,</l>
<l>She upon whom both might exert them, partners in love deeds.</l>
<l>Thither graceful of gait pacing my goddess white-hued</l>
<l>Came and with gleaming foot on the worn sole of the threshold</l>
<l>Stood she and prest its slab creakihg her sandals the while;</l>
<l>E'enso with love enflamed in olden days to her helpmate,</l>
<l>Laodam&iacute;a the home Protesil&eacute;an besought,</l>
<l>Sought, but in vain, for ne'er wi' sacrificial blood shed</l>
<l>Victims appeased the Lords ruling Celestial seats:</l>
<l>Never may I so joy in aught (Rhamnusian Virgin!) </l>
<l>That I engage in deed maugr&egrave; the will of the Lords.</l>
<l>How starved altar can crave for gore in piety poured,</l>
<l>Laodamia learnt taught by the loss of her man,</l>
<l>Driven perforce to loose the neck of new-wedded help-mate,</l>
<l>Whenas a winter had gone, nor other winter had come,</l>
<l>Ere in the long dark nights her greeding love was so sated</l>
<l>That she had power to live maugr&egrave; a marriage broke off,</l>
<l>Which, as the Parcae knew, too soon was fated to happen</l>
<l>Should he a soldier sail bound for those llian walls. </l>
<l>For that by Helena's rape, the Champion-leaders of Argives</l>
<l>Unto herself to incite Troy had already begun,</l>
<l>Troy (ah, curst be the name) common tomb of Asia and Europe,</l>
<l>Troy to sad ashes that turned valour and valorous men!</l>
<l>Eke to our brother beloved, destruction ever lamented</l>
<l>Brought she : 0 Brother for aye lost unto wretchedmost me,</l>
<l>Oh, to thy wretchedmost brother lost the light of his life-tide,</l>
<l>Buried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house:</l>
<l>Perisht along wi' thyself forthright all joys we enjoy&egrave;d,</l>
<l>Douce joys fed by thy love during the term of our days;</l>
<l>Whom now art tombed so far nor 'mid familiar pavestones</l>
<l>Nor wi' thine ashes stored near to thy kith and thy kin,</l>
<l>But in that Troy obscene, that Troy of ill-omen, entomb&egrave;d</l>
<l>Holds thee, an alien earth-buried in uttermost bourne.</l>
<l>Thither in haste so hot ('tis said) from allwhere the Youth-hood</l>

<l>Lest with a stolen punk with fullest of pleasure should Paris</l>
<l>Fairly at leisure and ease sleep in the pacific bed.</l>
<l>Such was the hapless chance, most beautiful Laodamia,</l>
<l>Tare fro' thee dearer than life, dearer than spirit itself,</l>
<l>Him, that husband, whose love in so mighty a whirlpool of passion</l>
<l>Whelmed thee absorbed and plunged deep in its gulfy abyss,</l>
<l>E'en as the Grecians tell hard by Phen&eacute;us of Cyll&eacute;ne</l>
<l>Drained was the marish and dried, forming the fattest of soils,</l>
<l>Whenas in days long done to delve through marrow of mountains</l>

<l>What time sure of his shafts he smote Stymphalian monsters</l>
<l>Slaying their host at the hest dealt by a lord of less worth,</l>
<l>So might the gateway of Heaven be trodden by more of the godheads,</l>
<l>Nor might H&eacute;b&eacute; abide longer to maidenhood doomed.</l>
<l>Yet was the depth of thy love far deeper than deepest of marish</l>
<l>Which the hard mistress's yoke taught him so tamely to bear;</l>
<l>Never was head so dear to a grandsire wasted by life-tide</l>
<l>Whenas one daughter alone a grandson so tardy had reared,</l>
<l>Who being found against hope to inherit riches of forbears</l>
<l>In the well-witnessed Will haply by name did appear,</l>

<l>Whenas she came to my house reeking Assyrian scents;</l>
<l>Nay, in the darkness of night her furtive favours she deigned me,</l>
<l>Self-willed taking herself from very mate's very breast.</l>
<l>Wherefore I hold it enough since given to us and us only</l>
