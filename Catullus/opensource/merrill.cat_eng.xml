								<p>1. The beginnings of lyric poetry among the Romans reach
									back to the prehistoric period of the city, and were as
									rude and shapeless as was the life of her people. Amid
									the rough farmer-populace of the turf-walled village by
									the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> the
									Arval Brethren and the Salii chanted their rude
									litanies to the rustic deities, - for even then
									religion was a prime cause in moving men toward poetry.
									In roughly balanced Saturnian verses men spoke regret
									and panegyric for the dead and praises for the valorous
									deeds of the living. The mimetic passion and rude wit
									of the Roman led him also into boisterous personal
									satire and into epigram more pungent than polished. But
									until the last few decades of the Republic these
									products of the Muse are either anonymous or connected
									with names well-nigh forgotten, and the remnants that
									have come down to us display no striking poetic
									excellence. </p>
							</div3>
							<div3 id="s2" type="para" n="2">
								<p>2. The progress of a national literature is perhaps
									rarely by fits and starts, even though it appears so to
									be. But the front advances in such a uniform line, that
									only now and then, when one wave sweeps out far beyond
									the rest, is the general advance of the tide remarked.
									So it would probably be unjust to the unknown poets of
									the Roman Republic to believe that their work did not
									mark a continual advance from period to period in lyric
									feeling and expression. Yet only in the first half of
									the last century before Christ did Latin poetry enter
									upon its first period of brilliancy. Amid the hot
									passions, the vigorous hatreds, the feasts and brawls,
									the beauty and the coarseness of life in the capital
									during this most active period in the history of
									<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
									there arose a school of writers who, though often
									conservatives in politics, were radicals in poetry. The
									tendencies of the traditional Roman past were by them
									utterly disregarded. Inspiration was drawn from the
									stirring life into which they were plunged, as well as
									from the sympathetic study of the sources of poetic art
									among both the earlier Greeks and the Alexandrians. As
									was to be expected, their models of rhythm were not the
									rude hexameters and ruder Saturnians of their Roman
									predecessors, but the more polished versification of
									the Greeks; and their subjects were sometimes their own
									personal experiences and emotions, and sometimes themes
									suggested by their Greek prototypes. So a new school of
									Roman poetry arose and flourished, to be superseded in
									turn by the polished Augustans, who cultivated the
									niceties of elegance, but at the expense of
									<emph>verve</emph>. </p>
							</div3>
						</div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="2">
							<head rend="smallCaps">Catullus.</head>
							<div3 id="s3" type="para" n="3">
								<p>3. Of this new school of poets the most prominent and
									interesting figure is Catullus. It is possible to know
									him personally as only now and then an ancient writer
									can be known to us, and yet he gives us but few
									definite biographical facts concerning himself, while
									still fewer are given by other authors of his own and
									later ages. But the little body of poems that
									constitute his extant works is so replete with his
									intense personality, and shows forth so unreservedly
									his every emotion, that the man stands out before us as
									does no other man of the age with the exception of two
									or three of its political leaders. And all this is
									true, even though we acknowledge, as we are bound to
									do, that in many questions of importance concerning his
									life we must be content with a working hypothesis
									instead of a series of established facts, and that the
									biographer, as the interpreter of the poems of
									Catullus, must be understood to be presenting
									probabilities and not certainties.</p>
							</div3>
							
							<div3 id="s4" type="para" n="4">
								<p>4. With regard to his full name we are left in some
									doubt. He refers to himself by name in his poems
									twenty-five times, but in each case only by the
									cognomen, <name rend="italic">Catullus</name>, while
									the better manuscripts of his writings are inscribed
									simply <name>
										<foreign lang="la" rend="italic">Catulli
											Veronensis Liber</foreign>
									</name>. Yet there is no difficulty in ascertaining his
									gentile name from other writers. <bibl n="Var. L. 7.50">Varro (L. L. VII. 50)</bibl>, <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 73">Suetonius (Iul.73)</bibl><bibl>,
									</bibl><bibl>Porphyrio (on Hor. Sat.
										1.10.19)</bibl>, <bibl n="Charis. 1.97">Charisius
											(1.97)</bibl>, <bibl>Jerome (T Chron. a.
												Abr.1930)</bibl><bibl>, all give it as Valerius.
													There are fewer references to his praenomen. Four
													of the later and interpolated manuscripts give it
													in their titles as Quintus, and until lately it
													was supposed that to this indication might be
													added the testimony of </bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.21">the elder Pliny (N H. XXXVII.
														81)</bibl> - Relying upon such authority Scaliger
									went so far as to emend <bibl n="Catul. 67">c.
										67.12</bibl> so as to bring in for the
									unintelligible words <quote lang="la">qui te
									</quote>the praenomen of the poet in the vocative,
									<quote lang="la">Quinte</quote>; and his
									suggestion won the approval of even so keen a critic as
									Lachmann. But it is now universally conceded that the
									initial <quote>Q.</quote> prefixed to the word <name rend="italic">Catullus</name> in the passage
									specified from Pliny is an interpolation, the best MS.,
									the <foreign lang="la">codex Bambergensis</foreign>,
									containing only the cognomen without prefix. There is,
									moreover, positive evidence in favor of a different
									praenomen. <bibl>Jerome (l.c.)</bibl>, in speaking of
									the birth of the poet, calls him in full <name rend="italic">C. Valerius Catullus</name>, and
									<bibl n="Apul. Apol. 10">Apuleius (Apol.
										10)</bibl>, whose accuracy, however, in the matter
									of names is not above suspicion, calls him <name rend="ital">C. Catullus</name>. In the face, then,
									of the testimony of interpolated manuscripts only, his
									praenomen must stand established as Gaius. </p>
							</div3>
							<div3 id="s5" type="para" n="5">
								<p>5. Concerning the birthplace of <name> Gaius Valerius
									Catullus</name> there is abundant testimony. The
									titles of the best MSS. of his works call him <name rend="ital">Veronensis</name>, and <bibl>Jerome
										(l.c.)</bibl> declares him born at <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>. In this
									testimony concur his admirers among the poets of the
									centuries immediately following (<foreign lang="la" rend="ital">e.g.</foreign>
									<bibl n="Ov. Am. 3.15.7">Ov. Am. 3.15.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart. 1.61.1">Mart. I.61.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart. 10.103.5">X. 103.5</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart. 14.195">XIV. 195</bibl>; <bibl>Auson. Op.
										23. 1</bibl>); and his own writings furnish
									confirmatory evidence of the same fact. He calls
									himself (<bibl n="Catul. 39">c. 39.13</bibl>) <name rend="ital">Transpadanus</name>; he possessed a
									villa at Sirnaio on the shore of <placeName key="tgn,7008869">Lacus Benacus</placeName> near
									<placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>
									(<bibl n="Catul. 31">c. 31</bibl>); he was
									acquainted with Veronese society (<bibl n="Catul. 67">cc. 67</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 100">100</bibl>);
									and he spent part of his time at <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> (<bibl n="Catul. 35">cc. 35</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 68">68a</bibl>). </p>

						<div2 type="section" n="3">
							<head rend="smallCaps">Date of birth and of death.</head>
							
							<div3 id="s6" type="para" n="6">
								<p>6. The year of his birth and that of his death are stated
									by Jerome in his edition of the <bibl>Chronicles of
										Eusebius</bibl>, probably on the authority of the
									<bibl n="Suet. Gram.">De Poetis of
										Suetonius</bibl>. Under date of <date value="-87">the year of Abraham 1930 (= B.C. 87)</date>
									Jerome says, <quote lang="la">Gaius Valerius Catullus
										scriptor lyricus Veronae nascitur</quote>, and
									under that of <date value="-57">1960</date>, or,
									according to some MSS., <date value="-58">1959</date>
									(= <date value="-57">B.C. 57</date>,or <date value="-58">58</date>), he says, <cit>
										<bibl>Jerome, Chronicles of Eusebius</bibl>
										<quote lang="la">Catullus XXX. aetatis anno Romae
											moritur</quote>
									</cit>. There is nothing to contradict Jerome's date
									for the birth of the poet, but unfortunately for our
									belief in his entire accuracy, a number of the poems of
									Catullus were clearly written later than <date value="-57">B.C. 57</date>, - some of them at
									least as late as the end of the year <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>, or the beginning of the year
									<date value="-54">54</date> (<foreign lang="la" rend="italic">e.g.</foreign>
									<bibl n="Catul. 11">cc. 11</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 29">29</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 53">53</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 113">113</bibl>). Jerome is, therefore,
									certainly wrong about the date of the poet's death, and
									hence about at least one of the two other statements,
									the date of his birth and his age at death. The only
									scrap of evidence from other sources on these points is
									the vague statement of Ovid that Catullus died young (<cit>
										<bibl n="Ov. Am. 3.8.62">Am. III.9.62</bibl>
										<quote lang="la">obvius huic [in Elysio] hedera
											iuvenalia cinctus tempora cum Calvo, docte
											Catulle, tuo</quote>
									</cit>).

									written toward the close of <date value="-55">55

									by his epigrams concerning him and Mamurra, a

									after he arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, Catullus met the mastering
									passion of his his life, and beside the verses to which

									<persName><surname>Horace</surname></persName>
									and the elaborated passions of the elegiasts are but as
									tinkling cymbals. To the woman who exercised this
									wonderful power over him he gives the name of
									<persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName>.
									But more often he is not content with a name, and the
									familiar terms of endearment flow from his lips with a
									newer and deeper meaning; for he delights to feel that
									though his experience is on the outside like that of
									other men, his mistress is peerless in virtues and his
									love for her a love passing that of women. On his side
									the passion was sudden and intense. He adopts the words
									of Sappho, and tells <persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName> (<bibl n="Catul. 51">c.
										51</bibl>) of the deadly faintness that seizes
									upon him even while he feels himself a' god, and more

									love. <persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName>
									is a married woman (<bibl n="Catul. 83">c.
										83.1</bibl>), but that consideration demands only
									additional care and diplomacy on his part, and is no
									bar to his efforts. He lays siege to her heart. His
									importunate persistence, youth as he is, commands her
									attention even amid a throng of lovers, but apparently
									only irritates her. What does this youngster, lately
									come to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>,
									hope for amid so many of his betters? He sees that
									victory must be won over this brilliant woman of the

									neat retort (<bibl n="Catul. 83">cc. 83</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 92">92</bibl>). And meanwhile Catullus

									they did not bring Catullus peace. The torment of his

									longed to find freedom, not again in the arms of his

									no doubt, by absence from the country (<ref target="s29" targOrder="U">cf. &sect;

									kept up the struggle within himself. It may well be,

									him that <persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName> had not been led astray by his

									has thus been anticipated in order to indicate the
									course of his struggle with himself, it may be well to
									pause here a few moments longer to ask who this
									<persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName>
									was. That we have in the poems of Catullus a real and
									not an imaginative sketch of a love-episode cannot be
									once doubted by him who reads. <persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName> is not a lay
									figure, a mere peg on which to hang fancies, like the
									shadowy heroines of <persName><surname>Horace</surname></persName>. That she was no <foreign lang="la">libertina</foreign>, but a woman of
									education and of social position, is equially clear
									from the passages already cited. The name <persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName>, therefore,
									is immediately suggestive of a pseudonym; and not only
									the fashions of poetry, but the position of the lady
									herself, appear at once to justify this expedient on
									the part of her poet-lover. To this antecedent
									probability is added the direct testimony of Ovid, who
									says <cit>

										<quote lang="la">sic sua lascivo cantata est saepe

										<quote lang="la">eadem igitur opera accusent C.

								<p>28. It was reserved, however, for the Italian scholars of
									the sixteenth century to identify this Clodia with the
									sister of P. Clodius Pulcher, <persName><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>'s foe, wife
									of Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer, who was praetor B.C.
									63, then governor of Cisalpine Gaul, consul for the
									year 60 B.C., and died in 59, not without suspicion

									of the present century this view has found acceptance,

									lover of this Clodia (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Cael.">Cic.

									within two years became her bitter enemy. There was all
									the more likelihood, then, of the reconciliation
									between him and Catullus marked by <bibl n="Catul. 58">c. 58</bibl>. And if <persName><surname>Lesbia</surname></persName> be this Clodia, then the

									of his absence from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> after the final rupture with
									Lesbia (<ref target="s24" targOrder="U">cf. &sect;

									the poet's friends. The ordinary motive was not only a
									love of adventure, but the desire for acquiring wealth
									at the expense of the provincials in one of the dozen
									ways possible under a friendly and not too
									conscientious official patron. Catullus apparently had
									not been poverty-stricken, however jestingly he claimed
									that common distinction of the society-man at the
									capital, though an increase of income may not have been
									without attractions for him. He had up to this time,

									not cared to leave it for any considerable period of
									time, even that he might visit <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. But now
									there were two motives that might lead him to look with
									desire upon a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>. In the first place, it
									offered him an opportunity to visit the <placeName key="tgn,7002331">Troad</placeName> and to pay the
									final offerings of love at the grave of his brother
									(<ref target="s22" targOrder="U">cf. &sect;
										22</ref>). In the second place, he had been
									passing through a terrible mental struggle that was
									perhaps not yet over, and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had become painful to him. In

									for Lesbia now appears to have succeeded that for a

									ward (<bibl n="Catul. 15">c. 15</bibl>). The result

								<p>38. Yet all this experience appears to have touched him
									in no wise deeply. It was but a passing diversion, and
									his jealousy not the bitter passion felt against his
									rivals with Lesbia. With far more earnestness did he
									throw himself into the political quarrel of his time.
									The year of his return from <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName> (<date value="-56">56 B.C.</date>) had witnessed the
									so-called renewal of the triumvirate at <placeName key="perseus,Luca">Luca</placeName>, and Caesar

									agreement made at the <placeName key="perseus,Luca">Luca</placeName> conference, Pompey and Crassus
									were consuls a second time for <date value="-55">the
										year 55</date>, and the senatorial party was at
									its wits' end. Catullus was apparently not an active
									political worker, but he did not hesitate to join his
									political friends in personal attacks upon the foe.
									Perhaps his earlier shafts were those aimed against
									Mamurra (<ref target="s73" targOrder="U">cf. &sect;
										73</ref>), Caesar's notorious favorite (<bibl n="Catul. 29">cc. 29</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 41">41</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 43">43</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 57">57</bibl>), whom Catullus sometimes
									celebrates under the nickname of Mentula (<bibl n="Catul. 94">cc. 94</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 105">105</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 114">114</bibl>,
									<bibl n="Catul. 115">115</bibl>), and these opened
									the way for the direct attack upon Caesar himself
									(<bibl n="Catul. 54">cc. 54</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 93">93</bibl>). But whatever the order
									of attack, that Caesar was piqued by it we know from
									Suetonius (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 73">Iul. 73</bibl>).
									That he made a successful effort to win over Catullus,
									as he did Calvus, we are also assured from the same
									source. Caesar understood better than most Romans that
									political power in that city and that day must rest
									largely upon personal popularity, and he was not above
									exerting himself to win the good will of individuals of
									high or low degree. And aside from the fascination due
									to his great political and military success, he had
									personal traits that gave him a power over young men.
									It was the mysterious influence of a natural leader of
									men; and in many more than these two instances the
									number of his friends was recruited from the ranks of
									the younger of his fiercest foes. There was another
									element also that must have tended to promote the
									reconciliation between Caesar and Catullus. The father
									of Catullus was resident at <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> within the
									limits of Caesar's Cisalpine province. He may not have
									taken an active part in politics, but at any rate he
									was a personal friend of Caesar, and often his host
									(<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 73">Suet. l.c.</bibl>). This
									intimacy may well have led him to see clearly what the
									result of the approaching struggle for supremacy in
									<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was
									likely to be, and to desire the more eagerly to see his
									son arrayed for Caesar and not against him. </p>
							</div3>
							<div3 id="s39" type="para" n="39">
								<p>39. At all events, the reconciliation was brought about,
									and the lively pen of Catullus ceased to lampoon the
									great commander. Some have thought, however, that
									Mamurra was not included in the peace, and that the

									that his personality should be thereafter thinly veiled

									commander was entertained at his father's house, and
									perhaps even there was making his plans for future
									campaigns. The fortunes of the poet were rising. What
									might he not hope for from his great patron, and why
									should others not share in his success? Furius and
									<persName><surname>Aurelius</surname></persName>,
									scorned by him since their faithlessness in the matter
									of Juventius, were eager to crawl back into his favor.
									And they fancied they could bring him a message that
									would be joyfully greeted, and would secure them the
									favorable reception they sought for their own advances:
									Lesbia was willing to recall her recalcitrant lover.
									She had once before been successful when making the
									first advances herself (<ref target="s19" targOrder="U">cf. &sect; 19</ref>). Why should she fear
									defeat now? But both she and her ill-chosen emissaries
									were speedily undeceived. The broken chain of the old
									love could never be welded again. Catullus had won by
									absence, by self-discipline, and most of all, perhaps,
									by real knowledge of facts in the case, the freedom
									from his passion for which he had prayed (<bibl n="Catul. 76">c. 76</bibl>). He could once more
									believe in the friendship of Caelius Rufus, and to him
									acknowledge, with pain, indeed, but no longer with
									unavailing torture his true view of Lesbia's character
									(<bibl n="Catul. 58">c. 58</bibl>). And these
									proffers now made to him through, and by, Furius and
									<persName><surname>Aurelius</surname></persName>
									were definitely and disdainfully rejected (<bibl n="Catul. 11">c. 11</bibl>), -with a manly, not a

									upon his genius. Part of this difficulty arise from the
									meagreness of the remains of these Greek writers that
									have survived the Middle Ages, andd part from the
									intense fire of his own personality that has
									metamorphosed into its own likeness all the material
									that came into contact with it. Even when he is
									professedly translating Sappho or Callimachus (<bibl n="Catul. 51">cf. cc. 51</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 66">66</bibl>), his translation is full
									of original elements, and is worked out in a personal

									episode, for richness of mythological allusion, for
									striking turns of phrase (cf. especially <bibl n="Catul. 63">cc. 63</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 64">64</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 68">68</bibl>,

									from these references it may be fairly inferred that
									the poetry of Catullus was well and acceptably known
									among his immediate generation of Romans, and had not

									republished, the poems in which Caesar is bitterly
									assailed? For this same reason, if for no other, it is
									also impossible to suppose, with certain critics, that

									both arranged and published, after the author's death,
									by some literary friend of his at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, where he
									ordinarily kept his books and papers (cf. <bibl n="Catul. 68">c.68.33-36</bibl><bibl>). The
										posthumous editor arranged the poems in three
										general groups. First come sixty shorter poems on
										various themes all in iambic or logaoedic rhythms
										Then follows the group of longer poems
										(</bibl><bibl n="Catul. 61">cc. 61-68b</bibl>),

									their Eros accompanied by the Anteros of <bibl n="Catul. 63">c. 63</bibl>; this group of poems
									begins with glyconics (<bibl n="Catul. 61">c.
										61</bibl>), continues with dactylic hexameters (<bibl n="Catul. 62">cc. 62</bibl>, <bibl n="Catul. 64">64</bibl>), divided by passionate galliambics
									(<bibl n="Catul. 63">c. 63</bibl>), and concludes
									with elegiacs (<bibl n="Catul. 65">cc. 65-68b</bibl>).
									It is followed by a third group of shorter poems (<bibl n="Catul. 69">cc. 69-116</bibl>), all in the
									elegiac metre, but as varied in theme as the first
									group. This division was suggested entirely by the
									metres and length of the poems, and not at all by their
									subject-matter; for the third group contains poems
									agreeing in subject and date with others in the first
									group (cf. <foreign lang="la" rend="ital">e.g.</foreign>

									the poems against Caesar, especially if none had yet
									been written in his favor. The editor was doubtless one
									of the circle of literary friends of the poet at
									<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and
									so was, if not, like Catullus, a subject of sudden
									conversion, an anti-Caesarian. Is it possible that he

									sympathies by refraining from the publication of later
									poems favorable to Caesar, and that by this theory, and
									not by that of the speedy death of the poet we are to

									poems saw the light for the first time after the death
									of their author. The manifest point of most of the
									personal poems would have been utterly lost, had they
									not been published immediately after their composition,
									and the passage already cited from Suetonius (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 73">Jul. 73</bibl>) shows clearly
									that Caesar was acquainted before their author's death

						<p>A dedicatory inscription. &mdash; On the return of Catullus

							(see <ref target="s33" targOrder="U">Intr. 33ff</ref>.) to his

							him safely through his perils by sea, and this poem is in the

							as still read, <quote lang="la">praecipua secunda ex iis

						<p>The self-mutilation and subsequent lament of Attis, a priest of
							Cybele. The centre of the worship of the Phrygian <foreign lang="greek">*kube/lh</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">*kubh/bh</foreign>, was in very ancient times the town of
							<placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName> in
							Galatian Phrygia, at the foot of Mt. Dindymus, from which the
							goddess received the name Dindymene. Cybele had early become
							identified with the Cretan divinity Rhea, the Mother of the Gods,
							and to some extent with Demeter, the search of Cyhele for Attis
							being compared with that of Demeter for Persephone. The especial
							worship of Cybele was conducted by emasculated priests called
							Galli (or, as in vv. 12 and 34, with reference to their physical
							condition, Gallae). Their name was derived by the ancients from
							that of the river Gallus, a tributary of the Sangarius, by
							drinking from which men became inspired with frenzy (cf. <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4.361">Ov. Fast. 4.361ff</bibl>.). The worship
							was orgiastic in the extreme, and was accompanied by the sound of
							such frenzy-producing instruments as the <foreign lang="la">tympana, cymbala, tibiae</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">cornu</foreign>, and culminated in scourging,
							self-mutilation, syncope from excitement. and even death from
							hemorrhage or heart-failure (cf. <bibl n="Lucr. 2.598">Lucr.
								2.598ff</bibl>.; <bibl n="Var. Men. 131">Varr. Sat. Men. 131
									B&uuml;ch.ff</bibl>.; <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4.179">Ov.
										Fast. 4.179ff</bibl>.). The worship of the Magna Mater, or
							Mater Idaea, as she was often called (perhaps from identification
							with Rhea of the Cretan Mt. Ida rather than from the Trojan Mt.
							Ida), was introduced into <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in 205 B.C. in accordance with a Sibylline
							oracle which foretold that only so could &lsquo;a foreign
							enemy&rsquo; (i.e. <persName><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>) be driven from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. <bibl n="Liv. 29.10">Livy 29.10</bibl>, <bibl n="Liv. 29.14">Livy 29.14</bibl>)

							divinity, and of the establishment of the Megalensia; cf. also
							<bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4.247">Ov. Fast. 4.247ff</bibl>. The

						<p>The early connection of Attis with the Mother of the Gods seems to
							point to the association of an original male element with an
							original female element as the parents of all things. But in the
							age of tradition Attis appears as a servant instead of an equal,
							and the subordination of the male to the female element is
							further emphasized by the representation of Attis, like the Galli
							of historic times, as an emasculated priest. Greek imagination
							pictured him as a beautiful youth who was beloved by the goddess,
							but wandered away from her and became untrue; but being sought
							and recalled to allegiance by her, in a passion of remorse he not
							only spent his life in her service, but by his own act made
							impossible for the future such infidelity on his part, thus
							setting the example followed by all the Galli after him (cf. Ovid
							Fast. l. c.). Catullus departs from this form of the Attis myth,
							and makes Attis a beautiful Greek youth who in a moment of
							religious frenzy sails across seas at the head of a band of
							companions to devote himself to the already long-established
							service of the goddess (vv. 1-3). On reaching the shores of
							Trojan Ida he consummates the irrevocable act of dedication (vv.
							4-5), and with his companions rushes up the mountain to the
							sanctuary of the goddess (vv. 6-38). But on awaking next morning
							he feels the full awfulness of his act (vv. 39-47), and gazing
							out over the sea toward his lost home, bewails his fate (vv.
							48-73), till the jealous goddess unyokes a lion from her car and
							sends him to drive her wavering votary back to his allegiance
							(vv. 74-fin.). The story is told with a nervous vigor and swing
							of feeling that are unequalled in Latin literature, and to it the
							galliambic meter (<ref target="s85" targOrder="U">Intr.
								85</ref>), the one traditionally appropriated to such themes,
							lends great effect. The date of composition is uncertain, but
							Catullus may have found his immediate inspiration in his contact
							with the Cybelian worship in its original home during his
							residence in <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName> in
							57-56 B.C. (see <ref target="s29" targOrder="U">Intr.
								29ff</ref>.). Or it may have been found in his studies in the
							Alexandrian poets; for Callimachus certainly used the galliambic
							meter, though no distinct title of a poem by him on this theme is
							extant. Caecilius of <placeName key="perseus,Comum">Comum</placeName> was also engaged on a poem based on the
							worship of Cybele (cf. <bibl n="Catul. 35">Catul.
								35.13ff</bibl>.), and Varro and Maecenas both exercised their
							talents in the same direction (cf. Varr. Sat. Men. l. c.;
							<bibl>Maec. in Baehr. Bragm. Poet. Rom. p. 339</bibl>). </p>
						<p>The poem abounds in rhetorical devices to add to its effect; such
							are the frequent employment of alliteration (vv. 2, 6, 7, 8, 9,
							10, 13, etc.), of strange and harsh compounds (vv. 23 <foreign lang="la">hederigerae</foreign>, 34 <foreign lang="la">properipedem</foreign>, 45 sonipedibus, 51 <foreign lang="la">erifugae</foreign>, 72 <foreign lang="la">nemorivagus</foreign>), and the repetition of words of
							agitated movement and feeling (eg. <foreign lang="la">rapidus</foreign> three times, <foreign lang="la">citatus</foreign> four times, <foreign lang="la">citus</foreign> twice, <foreign lang="la">rabidus</foreign>

						<p>This translation of the <foreign lang="greek">*bereni/khs
							*plo/kamos</foreign> of Callimachus, a few fragments of
							which are extant, is quite possibly the poem sent to Hortensius
							with <bibl n="Catul. 65">Catul. 65.1ff</bibl>. It is complex and
							artificial, and, indeed, if the translation was made when
							Catullus was burdened with grief for the loss of his brother, it
							is not strange that his native genius shows so little through it.
							Whether the obscurity of some passages in it is due to lack of
							care on the part of the translator, or to an excessive fidelity
							to the original, cannot be determined; but the general
							characteristics of Alexandrian poetry would lead us to refer the
							fault to Callimachus himself. The theme, a compound of court
							tradition and of astronomical knowledge, is as follows:
							<persName><surname>Berenice</surname></persName>, daughter
							of Magas, king of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, and wife of her cousin Ptolemy Euergetes
							(reigned 247-222 B.C.), king of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, had for her husband's safety vowed to

							the throne and marriage, the king was setting out on an
							expedition against <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. Upon his safe return the vow was paid, and
							the tress deposited in the temple of the deified <persName><surname>Arsinoe</surname></persName> on the promontory of
							<placeName key="perseus,Zephyrion">Zephyrion</placeName>.
							Next morning, however, it had disappeared; but the anger of the
							king was appeased by the court astronomer, <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, who said that he had
							descried it among the stars, where it must have been placed by
							divine agency. To verify his words Conon pointed out the hitherto

						<p>This pasquinade, in the form of a conversation between the poet and
							the door of a certain house, abounds in difficulties of
							interpretation for us, though its directness of personal
							reference must have made it clear enough to the Veronese. Its
							tone of familiarity with, and personal interest in, the
							tittle-tattle of the city seems to indicate that it was composed
							before Catullus left <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> to live at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and not during one of his brief visits to
							his old home. The motive is apparently as follows (see also later
							notes): The Door is that of a house in <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> (v. 34), formerly
							owned by an aged (v. 4) bachelor or widower (v. 6) named Balbus,
							after whose death (v. 6) it came into the possession of his son
							(v. 1) Caecilius, who thereupon married (v. 6) and brought home a
							young and lively widow (v. 20) from <placeName key="perseus,Brixia">Brixia</placeName> (v. 32), who claimed
							to be also a maid (v. 19). Strange rumors about her life soon
							began to spread through <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>, and the poet inquires of the Door why
							it has betrayed its master's confidence (presumably by letting in
							lovers to corrupt the young wife). The Door defends itself by
							saying that it has not betrayed its trust, but the woman was a
							bad lot before she came to <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>, and the current gossip is true of the
							period of her former marriage; for though her husband was
							notoriously impotent, his father stepped in to fill the son's
							place in the household, and the woman moreover was too intimate
							with certain other people named and hinted at. The proof of this
							culpability is found not only in rumors that have followed her
							from <placeName key="perseus,Brixia">Brixia</placeName>, but in
							her own familiar talk with her maids in the presence of the Door,
							which she treated as if it could neither hear nor
							speak.&mdash;The conception of the door as a bar in the way
							of would-be lovers is familiar enough in ancient poetry (cf.
							<bibl n="Catul. 63">Catul. 63.65</bibl> and Plautus, Horace,
							Ovid, Propertius, etc. passim); Propertius (<bibl n="Prop. 1.16">Prop. 1.16ff</bibl>.) also represents the door as speaking

						<p>Over the question of the unity of c.68 students of Catullus have
							long been at variance, some believing that vv. 1-40 have nothing
							to do with vv. 41-160, and others claiming that a more or less
							perfect union exists throughout the two, or perhaps three (cf.
							vv. 149-160), divisions of the poem. On the whole the weight of
							evidence seems to lie in favor of absolute division of vv. 1-40
							from 41-160. &sect;(1) The absence of division indicated by
							the MSS. is paralleled by similar omission in the case of other
							poems: &sect;(2) the person addressed in 68a is Malius (or
							Manlius; cf. <ref target="p68al11" targOrder="U">v. 11 n.</ref>),
							in 68b, Allius, while the use of two <foreign lang="la">nomina</foreign> by one man was at this time unprecedented,
							and there is also no reason why one name should be consistently
							used in vv. 1-40 and the other in vv. 41-160: &sect;(3)
							Malius, in 68a, is in extremest sorrow, which the expressions
							(see notes) show can be only over the death of his wife, while
							Allius, in 68b, is happy with either wife or mistress (cf. v.
							155): &sect;(4) Malius asks for consolation in the shape of
							love-poems, and Catullus explains why he cannot send them; there
							is no reference to any request on the part of Allius, but he
							receives an apparently spontaneous expression of thanks for his
							services to Catullus in the affair with Lesbia, with which is
							incorporated an account of the poet's happiness entirely
							incongruous in 68a: &sect;(5) in 68a the poet is so overcome
							with grief that he waives all reference to his relations with
							Lesbia (vv. 28, 29); in 68b he is happy with her, and is disposed
							to condone her frailties (vv. 135ff.), while his grief is not
							ever-present, but is aroused only by a chance allusion to
							<placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>, and is
							forthwith suppressed: &sect;(6) the repetition of vv. 20ff.
							of 68a in 68b (vv. 92ff.) shows that the two poems were not far
							separated in time, but is more consistent with the theory of
							division than of unity (see also heading 5). 68a was evidently
							written (at <placeName key="tgn,7003262">Verona</placeName> or
							<placeName key="tgn,7005771">Sirmio</placeName>) not long
							before 68b (see 5 above, and later notes), and both before
							Catullus had become thoroughly aware of Lesbia's real character,
							and had finally broken away from her. Perhaps her loose life
							during this period of separation finally opened his eyes. For
							convenience of general reference the continuous numbering of
							verses is retained throughout 68a and 68b. </p>
