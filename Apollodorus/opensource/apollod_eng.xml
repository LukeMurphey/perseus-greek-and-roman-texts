						<p>Sky was the first who ruled over the whole world.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">According
							to Hesiod (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 126">Hes. Th. 126ff.</bibl>), Sky
							&lpar;Uranus&rpar; was a son of Earth &lpar;Gaia&rpar;, but afterwards
							lay with his own mother and had by her Cronus, the giants, the Cyclopes, and so forth.
							As to the marriage of Sky and Earth, see the fragment of <bibl>Eur. Chrys., quoted by
								Sextus Empiricus, Bekker p. 751 (Nauck TGF(2), p. 633, Leipsig, 1889)</bibl>; <bibl n="Lucr. 1.150">Lucretius i.250ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Lucr. 1.991">ii.991ff.</bibl>;
							<bibl n="Verg. G. 2.325">Verg. G. 2.325ff.</bibl> The myth of such a marriage is
							widespread among the lower races. See <bibl>E. B. Tylor, <title>Primitive
								Culture</title> &lpar;London, 1873&rpar;, i.321ff., ii.370ff.</bibl> For
							example, the Ewe people of Togo-land, in West Africa, think that the Earth is the wife
							of the Sky, and that their marriage takes place in the rainy season, when the rain
							causes the seeds to sprout and bear fruit. These fruits they regard as the children of
							Mother Earth, who in their opinion is the mother also of men and of gods, see <bibl>J.
								Spieth, <title>Die Ewe-St&auml;mme</title> &lpar;Berlin, 1906&rpar;, pp.
								464, 548</bibl>. In the regions of the <placeName key="tgn,1000189">Senegal</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,1000181">Niger</placeName> it is
							believed that the Sky-god and the Earth-goddess are the parents of the principal spirits
							who dispense life and death, weal and woe, among mankind. See <bibl>Maurice Delafosse,
								<title>Haut-S&eacute;n&eacute;gal-Niger</title> (Paris, 1912),
								iii.173ff.</bibl> Similarly the Manggerai, a people of West Flores, in the Indian
							Archipelago, personify Sky and Earth as husband and wife; the consummation of their
							marriage is manifested in the rain, which fertilizes Mother
							Earth, so that she gives birth to her children, the produce of the fields
							and the fruits of the trees. The sky is called <hi rend="ital">lang&imacr;t</hi>; it
							is the male power: the earth is called <hi rend="ital">alang</hi>; it is the female
							power. Together they form a divine couple, called <hi rend="ital">Moer&imacr;
								Kra&egrave;ng</hi>. See <bibl>H. B. Stapel, &ldquo;Het Manggeraische Volk
									&lpar;West Flores&rpar;,&rdquo; <title>Tijdschrift voor Indische
										Taal-Landen Volkenkunde</title>, lvi. &lpar;Batavia and the Hague,
									1914&rpar;, p. 163</bibl>.</note> And having wedded Earth, he begat first the
							Hundred-handed, as they are named: Briareus, Gyes, Cottus, who were unsurpassed in size
							and might, each of them having a hundred hands and fifty heads.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl n="Hes. Th. 147">Hes. Th. 147ff.</bibl> Instead of Gyes, some
								MSS. of Hesiod read Gyges, and this form of the name is supported by the <bibl>Scholiast
									on Plat. Laws 7, 795c</bibl>. Compare <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4.593">Ovid, Fasti
										iv.593</bibl>; <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2.17.14">Hor. Carm. 2.17.14</bibl>, <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.4.69">iii.4.69</bibl>, with
								the commentators.</note>
							<milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After these, Earth bore him the Cyclopes,<pb n="5"/>to
							wit, <placeName key="tgn,7002693">Arges</placeName>, Steropes, Brontes,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl n="Hes. Th. 139">Hes. Th. 139ff.</bibl></note> of
							whom each had one eye on his forehead. But them Sky bound and cast into Tartarus, a gloomy
							place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl n="Hes. Th. 617">Hes. Th. 617ff.</bibl> and for
								the description of Tartarus, <bibl n="Hes. Th. 717">Hes. Th. 717ff.</bibl> According to
								Hesiod, a brazen anvil would take nine days and nights to fall from heaven to earth, and
								nine days and nights to fall from earth to Tartarus.</note>
							<milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And again he begat children by Earth, to wit, the Titans
							as they are named: Ocean, Coeus, Hyperion, Crius, Iapetus, and, youngest of all, Cronus;
							also daughters, the Titanides as they are called: Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe,
							Dione, Thia.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl n="Hes. Th. 132">Hes. Th.
								132ff.</bibl> who agrees in describing Cronus as the youngest of the brood. As Zeus, who
								succeeded his father Cronus on the heavenly throne, was likewise the youngest of his
								family &lpar;<bibl n="Hes. Th. 453">Hes. Th. 453ff.</bibl>&rpar;, we may
								conjecture that among the ancient Greeks or their ancestors inheritance was at one time
								regulated by the custom of ultimogeniture or the succession of the youngest, as to which
								see <bibl><title>Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</title>, i.429ff.</bibl> In the secluded
								highlands of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, where ancient customs and
								traditions lingered long, King Lycaon is said to have been succeeded by his youngest
								son. See <bibl n="Apollod. 3.8.1">Apollod. 3.8.1</bibl>.</note>
							<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
						<p>But Earth, grieved at the destruction of her children, who had been cast into Tartarus,
							persuaded the Titans to attack their father and gave Cronus an adamantine sickle. And
							they, all but Ocean, attacked him, and Cronus cut off his father's genitals and threw them
							into the sea; and from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto,
							Tisiphone, and Megaera.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl n="Hes. Th. 156">Hes.
								Th. 156-190</bibl>. Here Apollodorus follows Hesiod, according to whom the Furies
								sprang, not from the genitals of Sky which were thrown into the sea, but from the drops
								of his blood which fell on Earth and impregnated her. The sickle with which Cronus did
								the deed is said to have been flung by him into the sea at Cape Drepanum in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 7.23.4">Paus.
									7.23.4</bibl>&rpar;. The barbarous story of the mutilation of the divine father by
								his divine son shocked the moral sense of later ages. See <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 2.377e">Plat. Rep. 2, 377e-378a</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat. Euthyph. 5e">Plat. Euthyph.
									5e-6a</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2.24.63">Cicero, De natura deorum ii.24.63ff.</bibl>
								Andrew Lang interpreted the story with some probability as one of a worldwide class of
								myths intended to explain the separation of Earth and Sky. See <bibl>Andrew Lang,
									<title>Custom and Myth</title> &lpar;London, 1884&rpar;, pp. 45ff.</bibl>,
								and as to myths of the forcible separation of Sky and Earth, see <bibl>E. B. Tylor,
									<title>Primitive Culture</title>, i.322ff.</bibl></note> And, having dethroned their
							father, they brought up their<pb n="7"/> brethren who had been hurled down to Tartarus,
							and committed the sovereignty to Cronus. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
						<p>But he again bound and shut them up in Tartarus, and wedded his sister Rhea; and since
							both Earth and Sky foretold him that he would be dethroned by his own son, he used to
							swallow his offspring at birth. His firstborn Hestia he swallowed, then Demeter and Hera,
							and after them Pluto and Poseidon.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl n="Hes. Th. 453">Hes. Th. 453-467ff.</bibl></note>
							<milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Enraged at this, Rhea repaired to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, when she was big with Zeus, and brought him forth
							in a cave of Dicte.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">According to Hesiod, Rhea gave birth to
								Zeus in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and the infant god was hidden in
								a cave of Mount Aegeum (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 468">Hes. Th. 468-480</bibl>). <bibl>Diod.
									5.70</bibl> mentions the legend that Zeus was born at Dicte in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and that the god afterwards founded a city on the
								site. But according to Diodorus, or his authorities, the child was brought up in a cave
								on Mount Ida. The ancients were not agreed as
								to whether the infant god had been reared on Mount
								Ida or Mount Dicte. Apollodorus declares for Dicte, and he is supported by
								<bibl n="Verg. G. 4.153">Verg. G. 4.153</bibl>, <bibl n="Serv. A. 3.104">Serv. Verg.
									A. 3.104</bibl>, and the Vatican Mythographers (<bibl>Scriptores rerum mythicarum
										Latini, ed. Bode, i. pp. 34, 79, First Vatican Mythographer 104; Second Vatican
										Mythographer 16</bibl>). On the other hand the claim of Mount Ida is favoured by
								<bibl>Callimachus, Hymn i.51</bibl>; <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4.207">Ovid Fasti
									4.207</bibl>; and <bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius, Theb. iv.784</bibl>. The
								wavering of tradition on this point is indicated by Apollodorus, who, while he calls the
								mountain Dicte, names one of the god's nurses Ida.</note> She gave him to the Curetes
							and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> So these nymphs fed the child on the milk of Amalthea;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">As to the nurture of Zeus by the nymphs, see <bibl>Callimachus,
								Hymn 1.46ff.</bibl>; <bibl>Diod. 5.70.2ff.</bibl>; <bibl>Ovid, Fasti v.111ff.</bibl>;
								<bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 139</bibl>; <bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.13</bibl>; <bibl n="Serv. A. 3.104">Serv. Verg. A. 3.104</bibl>; <bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius,
									Theb. iv.784</bibl>; <bibl>Scriptores rerum mythicarum Latini, ed. Bode, i. pp. 34, 79
										(First Vatican Mythographer 104; Second Vatican Mythographer 16)</bibl>. According to
								Callimachus, Amalthea was a goat. Aratus also reported, if he did not believe, the story
								that the supreme god had been suckled by a goat &lpar;<bibl n="Strab. 8.7.5">Strab.
									8.7.5</bibl>&rpar;, and this would seem to have been the common opinion
								&lpar;<bibl>Diod. 5.70.3</bibl>; <bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.13</bibl>; <bibl>Second
									Vatican Mythographer 16</bibl>&rpar;. According to one account, his nurse Amalthea
								hung him in his cradle on a tree &ldquo;in order that he might be found neither in
								heaven nor on earth nor in the sea&rdquo; &lpar;<bibl>Hyginus, Fab.
									139</bibl>&rpar;. Melisseus, the father of his nurses Adrastia and Ida, is said to
								have been a Cretan king &lpar;<bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.13</bibl>&rpar;; but his
								name is probably due to an attempt to rationalize the story that the infant Zeus was fed
								by bees. See <bibl>Virgil, Geo. 1.149ff.</bibl> with the note of <bibl n="Serv. G.  1.153">Serv. Verg. G. 1.153</bibl>; <bibl>First Vatican Mythographer 104;
									Second Vatican Mythographer 16</bibl>.</note> and the Curetes in arms guarded the<pb n="9"/>babe in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order that Cronus
							might not hear the child's voice.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">As to the Curetes in their
								capacity of guardians of the infant Zeus, see <bibl>Callimachus, Hymn i.52ff.</bibl>;
								<bibl n="Strab. 10.3.11">Strab. 10.3.11</bibl>; <bibl>Diod. 5.70, 2-4</bibl>;
								<bibl>Lucretius ii.633-639</bibl>; <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.150">Verg. G. 3.150ff.</bibl>;
								<bibl>Ovid, Fasti iv.207ff.</bibl>; <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 139</bibl>; <bibl n="Serv. A. 3.104">Serv. Verg. A. 3.104</bibl>; <bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius,

										(First Vatican Mythographer 104; Second Vatican Mythographer 16)</bibl>. The story of
								the way in which they protected the divine infant from his inhuman parent by clashing
								their weapons may reflect a real custom, by the observance of which human parents
								endeavoured to guard their infants against the assaults of demons. See
								<bibl><title>Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</title>, iii.472ff.</bibl></note> But
							Rhea wrapped a stone in swaddling clothes and gave it to Cronus to swallow, as if it were
							the newborn child.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">As to the trick by which Rhea saved Zeus
								from the maw of his father Cronus, see <bibl n="Hes. Th. 485">Hes. Th. 485ff.</bibl>;

										iv.784</bibl>; <bibl>Scriptores rerum mythicarum Latini, ed. Bode, i. pp. 34, 79 (First
											Vatican Mythographer 104; Second Vatican Mythographer 16)</bibl>. The very stone which
								Cronus swallowed and afterwards spewed out was shown at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> down to the second century of our era; oil was daily poured on it,
								and on festival days unspun wool was laid on it &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 10.24.6">Paus.
									10.24.6</bibl>&rpar;. We read that, on the birth of Zeus's elder brother Poseidon,
								his mother Rhea saved the baby in like manner by giving his father Cronus a foal to
								swallow, which the deity seems to have found more digestible than the stone, for he is
								not said to have spat it out again &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 8.8.2">Paus.
									8.8.2</bibl>&rpar;. Phalaris, the notorious tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, dedicated in the sanctuary of Lindian Athena in <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> a bowl which was enriched with a relief
								representing Cronus in the act of receiving his children at the hand of Rhea and
								swallowing them. An inscription on the bowl set forth that it was a present from the
								famous artist Daedalus to the Sicilian king Cocalus. These things we learn from a long
								inscription which was found in recent years at <placeName key="tgn,7011269">Lindus</placeName>: it contains an inventory of the treasures preserved in the temple
								of Athena, together with historical notes upon them. See <bibl>Chr. Blinkenberg,

						<p>But when Zeus was full-grown, he took Metis,

								Metis in administering an emetic, but attributes the
								stratagem to Earth &lpar;Gaia&rpar;.</note> and with their aid Zeus waged the

										goddess was there succeeded by Themis, who was afterwards displaced by Apollo. See <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 1">Aesch. Eum. 1ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 10.5.5">Paus.
											10.5.5ff.</bibl> It is said that of old there was an oracle of Earth at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, but it no longer existed in the second
										century of our era. See <bibl n="Paus. 5.14.10">Paus. 5.14.10</bibl>. At <placeName key="perseus,Aegira">Aegira</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> the oracles of Earth were delivered in a subterranean cave by a
										priestess, who had previously drunk bull's blood as a means of inspiration. See
										<bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxviii.147</bibl>; compare <bibl n="Paus. 7.25.13">Paus.
											7.25.13</bibl>. In the later days of antiquity the oracle of Earth at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> was explained by some philosophers on
										rationalistic principles: they supposed that the priestess was thrown into the prophetic
										trance by natural exhalations from the ground, and they explained the decadence of the
										oracle in their own time by the gradual cessation of the exhalations. The theory is
										scouted by Cicero. See <bibl>Plut. De defectu oraculorum 40ff.</bibl>; <bibl>Cicero, De
											divinatione i.19.38, i.36.79, ii.57.117</bibl>. A similar theory is still held by
										wizards in <placeName key="tgn,1089214">Loango</placeName>, on the west coast of
										<placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>; hence in order to receive the

								There is a widespread belief that if a living person visits the world of the dead and
								there partakes of food, he cannot return to the land of the living. Thus, the ancient
								Egyptians believed that, on his way to the spirit land, the soul of a dead person was
								met by a goddess &lpar;Hathor, Nouit, or Nit&rpar;, who offered him fruits,
								bread, and water, and that, if he accepted them, he could return to earth no more. See
								<bibl>G. Maspero, <title>Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de l'Orient Classiques, les
									Origines</title> &lpar;Paris, 1895&rpar;, p. 184</bibl>. Similarly, the

								say that when a man dies, messengers come from the other world to guide his soul through
								the air and over the sea to the spirit land. Arrived there, he is welcomed by the other
								souls and bidden to a banquet, where he is offered food, especially bananas. If he
								tastes them, his doom is fixed for ever: he cannot return to earth. See the missionary
								<bibl>Gagniere, in <title>Annales de la Propagation de la Foi</title>, xxxii.
									&lpar;Lyons, 1860&rpar;, pp. 439ff.</bibl> The Eastern Melanesians believe
								that living people can go down to the land of the dead and return alive to the upper
								world. Persons who have done so relate how in the nether world they were warned by
								friendly ghosts to eat nothing there. See <bibl>R. H. Codrington, <title>The
									Melanesians</title> &lpar;Oxford, 1891&rpar;, pp. 277, 286</bibl>. Similar
								beliefs prevail and similar tales are told among the Maoris of <placeName key="tgn,1000226">New Zealand</placeName>. For example, a woman who believed that she
								had died and passed to the spirit land, related on her return how there she met with her
								dead father, who said to her, &ldquo;You must go back to the earth, for there is no
								one now left to take care of my grandchild. But remember, if you once eat food in this
								place, you can never more return to life; so beware not to taste anything offered to
								you.&rdquo; See <bibl>E. Shortland, <title>Traditions and Superstitions of the New
									Zealanders</title> &lpar;London, 1856&rpar;, pp. 150-152</bibl>. Again, they
								tell of a great chief named Hutu, who performed the same perilous journey. On reaching
								the place of departed spirits he encountered a certain being called Hine nui te po, that
								is, Great Mother Night, of whom he inquired the way down to the nether world. She
								pointed it out to him and gave him a basket of cooked food, saying, &ldquo;When you
								reach the lower regions, eat sparingly of your provisions that they may last, and you
								may not be compelled to partake of their food, for if you do, you cannot return upwards
								again.&rdquo; See <bibl>R. Taylor, <title>Te Ika A Maui, or New Zealand and its
									Inhabitants</title>, 2nd ed. &lpar;London, 1870&rpar;, p. 271</bibl>. And
								the same rule holds good of fairyland, into which living people sometimes stray or are
								enticed to their sorrow. &ldquo;Wise people recommend that, in the circumstances, a
								man should not utter a word till he comes out again, nor, on any account, taste fairy
								food or drink. If he abstains he is very likely before long dismissed, but if he
								indulges he straightway loses the will and the power ever to return to the society of

									iv.68</bibl>&rpar;. He describes the stalk as about five feet high and three inches
								thick, with knots and branches at intervals of about ten inches, the whole being covered
								with a tolerably hard rind. &ldquo;This stalk is filled with a white pith, which,
								being very dry, catches fire just like a wick; the fire keeps alight perfectly in the
								stalk and consumes the pith only gradually, without damaging the rind; hence people use
								this plant to carry fire from one place to another; our sailors laid in a supply of it.
								This custom is of great antiquity, and may serve to explain a passage in Hesiod, who,
								speaking of the fire which Prometheus stole from heaven, says that he carried it away in
								a stalk of fennel.&rdquo; He tells us, further, that the Greeks still call the plant
								nartheca. See <bibl>P. de Tournefort, <title>Relation d'un Voyage du Levant</title>

									<title>The Cyclades</title> &lpar;London, 1885&rpar;, p. 365</bibl>. Perhaps
								Bent mistook fennel for a reed. The rationalistic Diodorus Siculus explained the myth of
								the theft of fire by saying that Prometheus was the inventor of the fire-sticks, by the
								friction of which against each other fire is kindled. See <bibl>Diod. 5.67.2</bibl>. But

						<p>When the labours had been performed in eight years and a month,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">This period for the completion of the labours of Herakles is mentioned also by

								ii.353ff.</bibl>, both of whom, however, may have had the present passage of Apollodorus
							before them. It is possible that the period refers to the eight years' cycle, which
							figured prominently in the religious calendar of the ancient Greeks; for example, the
							Pythian games were originally held at intervals of eight years. See <bibl>Geminus,
								Element. Astron. viii.25ff., ed. C. Manitius</bibl>; <bibl>Censorinus, De die natali
									18</bibl>. It is to be remembered that the period of service performed by Herakles for
							Eurystheus was an expiation for the murder of his children &lpar;see <bibl n="Apollod. 2.4.12">Apollod. 2.4.12</bibl>&rpar;. Now Cadmus is said to have
							served Ares for eight years as an expiation for the slaughter of the dragon, the
							offspring of Ares &lpar;see <bibl n="Apollod. 3.4.2">Apollod.
								3.4.2</bibl>&rpar;. But in those days, we are told, the &ldquo;eternal
							year&rdquo; comprised eight common years &lpar;<bibl n="Apollod. 3.4.2">Apollod.
								3.4.2</bibl>&rpar;. Now Apollo served Admetus for a year as an expiation for the
							slaughter of the Cyclopes &lpar;<bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.4">Apollod.
								3.10.4</bibl>&rpar;; but according to <bibl n="Serv. A. 7.761">Serv. Verg. A.
									7.761</bibl>, the period of Apollo's service was not one but nine years. In making this
							statement Servius, or his authority, probably had before him a Greek author, who
							mentioned an <foreign lang="greek">e)nneathri/s</foreign> as the period of Apollo's
							service. But though <foreign lang="greek">e)nneathri/s</foreign> means literally
							&ldquo;nine years,&rdquo; the period, in consequence of the Greek mode of
							reckoning, was actually equivalent to eight years &lpar;compare <bibl>Celsus, De die
								natali 18.4</bibl>, &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Octaeteris facta, quae tunc
									enneateris vocitata, quia primus eius annus nono quoque anno
									redibat</foreign>.&rdquo;&rpar; These legends about the servitude of Cadmus,
							Apollo, and Herakles for eight years, render it probable that in ancient times Greek
							homicides were banished for eight years, and had during that time to do penance by
							serving a foreigner. Now this period of eight years was called a &ldquo;great
							year&rdquo; &lpar;<bibl>Censorinus, De die natali 18.5</bibl>&rpar;, and the
							period of banishment for a homicide was regularly a year. See <bibl n="Apollod. 2.8.3">Apollod. 2.8.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 34">Eur. Hipp.34-37</bibl>, <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1643">Eur. Or. 1643-1645</bibl>; <bibl>Nicolaus Damascenus, Frag 20

							the period of a homicide's banishment was a single ordinary year, it may formerly have
							been a &ldquo;great year,&rdquo; or period of eight ordinary years. It deserves
							to be noted that any god who had forsworn himself by the Styx had to expiate his fault
							by silence and fasting for a full year, after which he was banished the company of the
							gods for nine years &lpar;<bibl n="Hes. Th. 793">Hes. Th.
								793-804ff.</bibl>&rpar;; and further that any man who partook of human flesh in the
							rites of Lycaean Zeus was supposed to be turned into a wolf for nine years. See <bibl n="Paus. 8.2">Paus. 8.2</bibl>; <bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. viii.81</bibl>;
							<bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei xviii.17</bibl>. These notions point to a nine years'
							period of expiation, which may have been observed in some places instead of the eight
							years' period. In the present passage of Apollodorus, the addition of a month to the
							eight years' period creates a difficulty which I am unable to explain. Ancient
							mathematicians defined a &ldquo;great year&rdquo; as the period at the end of
							which the sun, moon, and planets again occupy the same positions relatively to each
							other which they occupied at the beginning; but on the length of the period opinions
							were much divided. See <bibl>Cicero, De natura deorum ii.20.51ff.</bibl> Different,
							apparently, from the &ldquo;great year&rdquo; was the
							&ldquo;revolving&rdquo; &lpar;<foreign lang="la">vertens</foreign>&rpar;
							or &ldquo;mundane&rdquo; &lpar;<foreign lang="la">mundanus</foreign>&rpar; year, which was the period at the end of which, not only
							the sun, moon, and planets, but also the so-called fixed stars again occupy the
							positions relatively to each other which they occupied at the beginning; for the
							ancients recognized that the so-called fixed stars do move, though their motion is
							imperceptible to our senses. The length of a &ldquo;revolving&rdquo; or
							&ldquo;mundane&rdquo; year was calculated by ancient physicists at fifteen
							thousand years. See <bibl>Cicero, Somnium Scipionis 7, with the commentary of Macrobius,

								bears to that of Apollodorus seems to show that here, as in many other places, our
								author followed Pherecydes. The account given by Pherecydes of the origin of the golden
								apples is as follows. When Zeus married Hera, the gods brought presents to the bride.
								Among the rest, Earth brought golden apples, which Hera so much admired that she ordered
								them to be planted in the garden of the gods beside Mount Atlas. But, as the daughters
								of Atlas used to pilfer the golden fruit, she set a huge serpent to guard the tree. Such
								is the story told, on the authority of Pherecydes, by Eratosthenes, <bibl>Hyginus, Astr.

								instituted by Busiris. Their account may be derived from Pherecydes, who is the
								authority cited by the <bibl>Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.1396</bibl>.
								<bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 56</bibl> adds that the seer Phrasius, who advised the sacrifice,

								the ground that human sacrifices were utterly alien to the spirit of Egyptian religion
								&lpar;<bibl n="Hdt. 2.45">Hdt. 2.45</bibl>&rpar;. Isocrates also discredited

								<bibl n="Isoc. 11.15">Isoc. 11.15</bibl>. Yet there are grounds for thinking that the
								Greek tradition was substantially correct. For Manetho, our highest ancient authority,
								definitely affirmed that in the city of Ilithyia it was customary to burn alive
								&ldquo;Typhonian men&rdquo; and to scatter their ashes by means of winnowing
								fans &lpar;<bibl>Plut. Isis et Osiris 73</bibl>&rpar;. These
								&ldquo;Typhonian men&rdquo; were red-haired, because Typhon, the Egyptian
								embodiment of evil, was also redhaired &lpar;<bibl>Plut. Isis et Osiris 30,
									33</bibl>&rpar;. But redhaired men would commonly be foreigners, in contrast to the
								black-haired natives of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and it was just
								foreigners who, according to Greek tradition, were chosen as victims. Diodorus Siculus
								points this out &lpar;<bibl>Diod. 1.88.5</bibl>&rpar; in confirmation of the
								Greek tradition, and he tells us that the redhaired men were sacrificed at the grave of
								Osiris, though this statement may be an inference from his etymology of the name
								Busiris, which he explains to mean &ldquo;grave of Osiris.&rdquo; The etymology
								is correct, Busiris being a Greek rendering of the Egyptian Asir &ldquo;place of
								Osiris.&rdquo; See <bibl>A. Wiedemann, <title>Herodots Zweites Buch</title>
									&lpar;Leipsic, 1890&rpar;, p. 213</bibl>. Porphyry informs us, on the
								authority of Manetho, that the Egyptian custom of sacrificing human beings at the City
								of the Sun was suppressed by Amosis &lpar;Amasis&rpar;, who ordered waxen
								effigies to be substituted for the victims. He adds that the human victims used to be
								examined just like calves for the sacrifice, and that they were sealed in token of their
								fitness for the altar. See <bibl>Porphyry, De abstinentia iii.35</bibl>. Sextus
								Empiricus even speaks of human sacrifices in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> as if they were practised down to his own time, which was about 200

								&lpar;<bibl>Athenaeus iv.72, p. 172 D</bibl>&rpar;. In view of these facts,
								the Greek tradition that the sacrifices were offered in order to restore the fertility
								of the land or to procure rain after a long drought, and that on one occasion the king
								himself was the victim, may be not without significance. For kings or chiefs have been
								often sacrificed under similar circumstances &lpar;see <bibl n="Apollod. 3.5.1">Apollod. 3.5.1</bibl>; <bibl><title>Adonis, Attis, Osiris</title>, 3rd ed.

								chains, Prometheus on obtaining his freedom was ordered to wear on his finger a ring
								made out of his iron fetters and of the rock to which he had been chained; hence, in
								memory of their saviour's sufferings, men have worn rings ever since. The practice of
								wearing crowns or garlands was explained by some people in the same way. See

								regaining his liberty was doomed to wear was a crown of willow; and the Carians, who
								used to crown their brows with branches of willow, explained that they did so in
								imitation of Prometheus. See <bibl>Athenaeus xv.11-13, pp. 671-673 EB</bibl>. In the
								present passage of Apollodorus, if the text is correct, Herakles, as the deliverer of
								Prometheus, is obliged to bind himself vicariously for the prisoner whom he has
								released; and he chooses to do so with his favourite olive. Similarly he has to find a
								substitute to die instead of Prometheus, and he discovers the substitute in Chiron. As
								to the substitution of Chiron for Prometheus, see <bibl n="Apollod. 2.5.4">Apollod.

								warned by the oracle that his daughter would bear a son who would kill his maternal
								uncles, the sons of Aleus. To guard against this catastrophe, Aleus hurried home and
								appointed his daughter priestess of Athena, declaring that, should she prove unchaste,
								he would put her to death. As chance would have it, Herakles arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> on his way to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, where he purposed to make war on Augeas. The king entertained him
								hospitably in the sanctuary of Athena, and there the hero, flushed with wine, violated
								the maiden priestess. Learning that she was with child, her father Aleus sent for the
								experienced ferryman Nauplius, father of Palamedes, and entrusted his daughter to him to
								take and drown her. On their way to the sea the girl &lpar;Auge&rpar; gave birth
								to Telephus on Mount Parthenius, and instead of drowning her and the infant the ferryman
								sold them both to king Teuthras in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, who,
								being childless, married Auge and adopted Telephus. See <bibl>Alcidamas, Od. 14-16, pp.
									179ff., ed. Blass</bibl> &lpar;appended to his edition of Antiphon&rpar;. This
								version, which represents mother and child as sold together to Teuthras, differs from
								the version adopted by Apollodorus, according to whom Auge alone was sold to Teuthras in
								<placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, while her infant son Telephus was left

								Telephus seems to have been proverbial. For the comic poet Alexis, speaking of a greedy
								parasite who used to gobble up his dinner without exchanging a word with anybody, says
								that, &ldquo;he dines like speechless Telephus, answering all questions put to him
								only with nods&rdquo; &lpar;<bibl>Athenaeus x.18, p. 421 D</bibl>&rpar;. And
								another comic poet, Amphis, describing the high and mighty airs with which fish-mongers
								treated their customers in the market, says that it was a thousand times easier to get
								speech of a general than of a fish-monger; for if you addressed one of these gentry and,
								pointing to a fish, asked &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; he would not at first deign to
								look at you, much less speak to you, but would stoop down, silent as Telephus, over his
								wares; though in time, his desire of lucre overcoming his contempt of you, he would slap
								a bloated octopus and mutter meditatively, as if soliloquizing, &ldquo; Sixpence for
								him, and a bob for the hammerfish.&rdquo; This latter poet explains incidentally why
								Telephus was silent; he says it was very natural that fish-mongers should hold their
								tongue, &ldquo;for all homicides are in the same case,&rdquo; thus at once
								informing us of a curious point in Greek law or custom and gratifying his spite at the
								&ldquo;cursed fish-mongers,&rdquo; whom he compares to the worst class of
								criminals. See <bibl>Athenaeus vi.5, p. 224 DE</bibl>. As Greek homicides were supposed
								to be haunted by the ghosts of their victims until a ceremony of purification was
								performed which rid them of their invisible, but dangerous, pursuers, we may conjecture
								that the rule of silence had to be observed by them until the accomplishment of the
								purificatory rite released them from the restrictions under which they laboured during
								their uncleanness, and permitted them once more to associate freely with their fellows.
								As to the restrictions imposed on homicides in ancient <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, see <bibl><title>Psyche's Task</title>, 2nd ed. pp.

								The motive of the homicide's silence may have been a fear lest by speaking he should
								attract the attention, and draw down on himself the vengeance, of his victim's ghost.
								Similarly, among certain peoples, a widow is bound to observe silence for some time
								after her husband's death, and the rule appears to be based on a like dread of exciting
								the angry or amorous passions of her departed spouse by the sound of the familiar voice.

								was not burned to death on a pyre, but, tortured by the agony of the poisoned robe,
								which took fire in the sun, he flung himself into a neighbouring stream to ease his pain
								and was drowned. The waters of the stream have been hot ever since, and are called

								took fire and burned Herakles. That it was thought to be kindled by exposure to the heat
								of the sun appears from the narrative of <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 36</bibl>; compare <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 684">Soph. Trach. 684-704</bibl>; <bibl>Seneca, Herakles Oetaeus

							it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it.
							On him Hercules bestowed his bow. While the pyre was burning, it is said that a cloud

								vein <bibl>Diod. 4.38.4</bibl> relates that, as soon as a light was set to the pyre, a
								thunderstorm burst, and that when the friends of the hero came to collect his bones they
								could find none, and therefore supposed he had been translated to the gods. As to the
								traditional mode of Herakles's death, compare <bibl>Alberuni's <title>India</title>,
									English ed. by E. C. Sachau, ii.168</bibl>: &ldquo;Galenus says in his commentary
								to the apothegms of Hippocrates: &lsquo;It is generally known that Asclepius was
								raised to the angels in a column of fire, the like of which is also related with regard
								to Dionysos, Heracles, and others, who laboured for the benefit of mankind. People say
								that God did thus with them in order to destroy the mortal and earthly part of them by
								the fire, and afterwards to attract to himself the immortal part of them, and to raise
								their souls to heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo; So Lucian speaks of Herakles becoming a god
								in the burning pile on Mount Oeta, the human element in him, which he had inherited from
								his mortal mother, being purged away in the flames, while the divine element ascended
								pure and spotless to the gods. See <bibl>Lucian, Hermotimus 7</bibl>. The notion that

								4.57.6</bibl>, in agreement with Apollodorus, says that all the sons of Eurystheus were

								According to <bibl n="Strab. 8.6.19">Strab. 8.6.19</bibl>, Eurystheus marched against

								Gargettus, but his head was cut off and buried separately in Tricorythus, under the high
								road, at the spring Macaria, and the place was hence called &ldquo;the Head of
								Eurystheus.&rdquo; Thus Strabo lays the scene of the battle and of the death of
								Eurystheus at Marathon. From <bibl n="Paus. 1.32.6">Paus. 1.32.6</bibl> we know that the
								spring Macaria, named after the heroine who sacrificed herself to gain the victory for
								the Heraclids, was at Marathon. The name seems to have been applied to the powerful
								subterranean springs which form a great marsh at the northern end of the plain of
								Marathon. The ancient high road, under which the head of Eurystheus was buried, and of
								which traces existed down to modern times, here ran between the marsh on the one hand
								and the steep slope of the mountain on the other. At the northern end of the narrow
								defile thus formed by the marsh and the mountain stands the modern village of
								Kato-Souli, which is proved by inscriptions to have occupied the site of the ancient
								Tricorythus. See <bibl>W. M. Leake, <title>The Demi of Athens</title>, 2nd ed.
									&lpar;London, 1841&rpar;, pp. 95ff.</bibl>, and <bibl>Frazer, commentary on
										Pausanias, vol. ii. pp. 432, 439ff.</bibl> But <placeName key="perseus,Pallene">Pallene</placeName>, at or near which, according to Euripides, the body of Eurystheus
								was buried, lay some eighteen miles or so away at the northern foot of Mount <placeName key="tgn,7010826">Hymettus</placeName>, in the gap which divides the high and steep
								mountains of Pentelicus and <placeName key="tgn,7010826">Hymettus</placeName> from each other. That gap, forming the only gateway
								into the plain of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> from the north
								east, was strategically very important, and hence was naturally the scene of various
								battles, legendary or historical. Gargettus, where, according to Strabo, confirmed by
								Hesychius and Stephanus Byzantius &lpar;s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*garghtto/s</foreign>&rpar;, the headless trunk of Eurystheus was interred, seems
								to have lain on the opposite side of the gap, near the foot of Pentelicus, where a small
								modern village, Garito, apparently preserves the ancient name. See <bibl>W. M. Leake,
									op. cit. pp. 26ff., 44-47</bibl>; <bibl><title>Karten von Attika,

									Haussoullier, i. &lpar;Paris, 1896&rpar;, pp. 204ff.</bibl> Thus the
								statements of Euripides and Strabo about the place where the body of Eurystheus was
								buried may be reconciled if we suppose that it was interred at Gargettus facing over
								against <placeName key="perseus,Pallene">Pallene</placeName>, which lay on the opposite
								or southern side of the gap between Pentelicus and <placeName key="tgn,7010826">Hymettus</placeName>. For the battles said to have been fought at various times in this

								head to Alcmena, who gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins, is repeated by
								<bibl>Zenobius, Cent. ii.61</bibl>, who probably here, as so often, simply copied our
								author without acknowledgment. According to <bibl n="Pind. P. 9">Pind. P.
									9.79(137)ff., &lpar;with the Scholia&rpar;</bibl>, the slayer of Eurystheus
								was not Hyllus but Iolaus; and this seems to have been the common tradition. Can we
								explain the curious tradition that the severed head and body of the foeman Eurystheus
								were buried separately many miles apart, and both of them in passes strategically
								important? According to <bibl n="Eur. Heraclid. 1026">Eur. Heraclid. 1026ff.</bibl>,
								Eurystheus, before being killed by the order of Alcmena, announced to the Athenians
								that, in gratitude for their merciful, though fruitless, intercession with Alcmena, he
								would still, after his death, lying beneath the sod, be a friend and saviour to
								<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but a stern foe to the descendants
								of the Heraclids&mdash;that is, to the Argives and Spartans, both of whom traced the
								blood of their kings to Herakles. Further, he bade the Athenians not to pour libations
								or shed blood on his grave, for even without such offerings he would in death benefit
								them and injure their enemies, whom he would drive home, defeated, from the borders of
								<placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. From this it would seem that the
								ghost of Eurystheus was supposed to guard <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> against invasion; hence we can understand why his body should be
								divided in two and the severed parts buried in different passes by which enemies might
								march into the country, because in this way the ghost might reasonably be expected to do
								double duty as a sentinel or spiritual outpost in two important places at the same time.
								Similarly the dead Oedipus in his grave at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was believed to protect the country and ensure its welfare. See
								<bibl n="Soph. OC 576">Soph. OC 576ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Soph. OC 1518">Soph. OC

										Or. xlvi. vol. ii. p. 230, ed. G. Dindorf</bibl>. So Orestes, in gratitude for his
								acquittal at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is represented by
								Aeschylus as promising that even when he is in his grave he will prevent any <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> leader from marching against <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. See <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 732">Aesch. Eum.
									732(762)ff.</bibl> And Euripides makes Hector declare that the foreigners who had
								fought in defence of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> were &ldquo;no
								small security to the city&rdquo; even when &ldquo;they had fallen and were
								lying in their heaped-up graves.&rdquo; See <bibl n="Eur. Rh. 413">Eur. Rh.
									413-415</bibl>. These examples show that in the opinion of the Greeks the ghosts even of
								foreigners could serve as guardian spirits of a country to which they were attached by
								ties of gratitude or affection; for in each of the cases I have cited the dead man who
								was thought to protect either <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> or
								<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was a stranger from a strange land.
								Some of the Scythians in antiquity used to cut off the heads of their enemies and stick
								them on poles over the chimneys of their houses, where the skulls were supposed to act
								as watchmen or guardians, perhaps by repelling any foul fiends that might attempt to
								enter the dwelling by coming down the chimney. See <bibl n="Hdt. 4.103">Hdt.
									4.103</bibl>. So tribes in <placeName key="tgn,1000107">Borneo</placeName>, who make a
								practice of cutting off the heads of their enemies and garnishing their houses with
								these trophies, imagine that they can propitiate the spirits of their dead foes and
								convert them into friends and protectors by addressing the skulls in endearing language
								and offering them food. See <bibl><title>Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild</title>,
									i.294ff.</bibl> The references in Greek legend to men who habitually relieved
								strangers of their heads, which they added to their collection of skulls, may point to
								the former existence among the Greeks of a practice of collecting human skulls for the
								purpose of securing the ghostly protection of their late owners.

									ii.178, iii.1186</bibl>. Among the authorities whose divergent views are reported in

								<bibl>Moschus ii.40, 42</bibl> agrees with Apollodorus that the mother of Europa was

								According to <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 6, 178</bibl>, the mother who bore Cadmus and Europa to

								son of Agenor &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 5.25.12">Paus. 5.25.12</bibl>&rpar;. In

								which the historian had visited &lpar;<bibl n="Hdt. 6.46">Hdt.

								&lpar;<bibl n="Hdt. 7.91">Hdt. 7.91</bibl>&rpar; represents Cilix as a son of

								Athena at <placeName key="tgn,7011269">Lindus</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, there was a tripod of ancient style bearing a
								Phoenician inscription. The statement has been confirmed in recent years by the
								discovery of the official record of the temple of Lindian Athena in <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. For in this record, engraved on a marble slab,
								there occurs the following entry: &ldquo;Cadmus &lpar;dedicated&rpar; a

								that we can safely infer is that the Greeks traced a blood relationship between the
								Phoenicians and Cilicians, and recognised a Phoenician element in some of the Greek
								islands and parts of the mainland. If Europa was, as seems possible, a personification

								Hyginus, Servius, and the First Vatican Mythographer, the furious king, in attempting to

								god's leafy emblems the buglers blew blasts which, startling the stillness and darkness
								of night, were believed to summon up the lost Dionysus from the watery depths. See
								<bibl>Plut. Isis et Osiris 35</bibl>. Perhaps in answer to this bugle call an actor,
								dressed in the vine-god's garb, may have emerged dripping from the pool to receive the
								congratulations of the worshippers on his rising from the dead. However, according to

								exhaling a delicious, an intoxicating, perfume, while all about it the souls of the

								stillness of noon reigned in the mountains, the goddess and the nymph had stripped and
								were enjoying a cool plunge in the fair-flowing spring of Hippocrene on Mount Helicon.
								But the youthful Tiresias, roaming the hills with his dogs, came to slake his thirst at
								the bubbling spring and saw what it was not lawful to see. The goddess cried out in
								anger, and at once the eyes of the intruder were quenched in darkness. His mother, the
								nymph, reproached the goddess with blinding her son, but Athena explained that she had
								not done so, but that the laws of the gods inflicted the penalty of blindness on anyone
								who beheld an immortal without his or her consent. To console the youth for the loss of
								his sight the goddess promised to bestow on him the gifts of prophecy and divination,
								long life, and after death the retention of his mental powers undimmed in the world
								below. See <bibl>Callimachus, Baths of Pallas 57-133</bibl>. In this account Callimachus
								probably followed Pherecydes, who, as we learn from the present passage of Apollodorus,
								assigned the same cause for the blindness of Tiresias. It is said that Erymanthus, son

								Eustathius and Tzetzes, it was by killing the female snake that Tiresias became a woman,
								and it was by afterwards killing the male snake that he was changed back into a man.
								According to Ovid, the seer remained a woman for seven years, and recovered his male sex
								in the eighth; the First Vatican Mythographer says that he recovered it after eight
								years; the Third Vatican Mythographer affirms that he recovered it in the seventh year.

								the precise mathematical proportion expressed in it. Further, they all, except Antoninus
								Liberalis, agree that the blindness of Tiresias was a punishment inflicted on him by
								Hera &lpar;Juno&rpar; because his answer to the question was displeasing to her.
								According to Phlegon, Hyginus, Lactantius Placidus, and the Second Vatican Mythographer
								the life of Tiresias was prolonged by Zeus &lpar;Jupiter&rpar; so as to last
								seven ordinary lives. The notion that it is unlucky to see snakes coupling appears to be

									ta/fon</foreign> refers to the fencing in of the grave. So the tomb of Semele, who was
								also killed by lightning, seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure. See <bibl n="Eur. Ba. 6">Eur. Ba. 6-11</bibl>. Yet, inconsistently with the foregoing passage,
								Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre
								&lpar;<bibl n="Eur. Supp. 1000">Eur. Supp. 1000ff.</bibl>&rpar;. The rule that
								a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried, not burnt, is stated by <bibl>Pliny,

								An ancient Roman law, attributed to Numa, forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies
								for a man who had been killed by lightning. See <bibl>Festus, s.v.
									&ldquo;Occisum,&rdquo; p. 178, ed. C. O. M&uuml;ller</bibl>. It is true
								that these passages refer to the Roman usage, but the words of <bibl n="Eur. Supp. 934">Eur. Supp. 934-938</bibl> seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar, and this
								is confirmed by Artemidorus, who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning
								were not removed but buried on the spot &lpar;<bibl>Artemidorus, Onirocrit.
									ii.9</bibl>&rpar;. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not
								deemed to be disgraced, nay, he was honoured as a god; even slaves killed by lightning
								were approached with respect, as honoured by Zeus, and their dead bodies were wrapt in
								fine garments. Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself
								descended in the flash of lightning; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally
								regarded as holy. Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender
								&lpar;<foreign lang="greek">*zeu\s kataiba/ths</foreign> &rpar; and were

								a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky, for they believe that he
								has been taken by St. Elias to himself. So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and
								dance about him. His relations think it their duty to join in these dances and
								rejoicings, for any appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias
								and therefore punishable. The festival lasts eight days. The deceased is dressed in new
								clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact attitude in which he was struck and in the
								same place where he died. At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much
								festivity and feasting, a high cairn is erected on his grave, and beside it they set up
								a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it, and another pole, on which
								hang the best clothes of the deceased. The grave becomes a place of pilgrimage. See

								Similarly the Kafirs of <placeName key="tgn,1000193">South Africa</placeName>
								&ldquo;have strange notions respecting the lightning. They consider that it is
								governed by the <foreign lang="kafir">umshologu</foreign>, or ghost, of the greatest and
								most renowned of their departed chiefs, and who is emphatically styled the <foreign lang="kafir">inkosi</foreign>; but they are not at all clear as to which of their
								ancestors is intended by this designation. Hence they allow of no lamentation being made
								for a person killed by lightning, as they say that it would be a sign of disloyalty to
								lament for one whom the <foreign lang="kafir">inkosi</foreign> had sent for, and whose
								services he consequently needed; and it would cause him to punish them, by making the
								lightning again to descend and do them another injury.&rdquo; Further, rites of
								purification have to be performed by a priest at the kraal where the accident took
								place; and till these have been performed, none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal
								or have intercourse with other people. Meantime their heads are shaved and they must
								abstain from drinking milk. The rites include a sacrifice and the inoculation of the
								people with powdered charcoal. See <bibl>&ldquo;Mr. Warner's Notes,&rdquo; in
									Col. Maclean's <title>Compendium of Kafir Laws and Customs</title> &lpar;Cape
									Town, 1866&rpar;, pp. 82-84</bibl>. Sometimes, however, the ghosts of persons who
								have been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous. Hence the Omahas used to slit
								the soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent their ghosts from walking about. See

								he said that Zeus constantly visited him in the likeness of a stranger to view the
								righteous and the unrighteous. And once, as he himself said, being about to receive the
								god, he offered a sacrifice. But of his fifty sons, whom he had, as they say, by many
								women, there were some present at the sacrifice, and wishing to know if they were about
								to give hospitality to a real god, they sacrificed a child and mixed his flesh with that
								of the victim, in the belief that their deed would be discovered if the visitor was a
								god indeed. But they say that the deity caused great storms to burst and lightnings to
								flash, and that all the murderers of the child perished.&rdquo; A similar version of
								the story is reported by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 176</bibl>, who adds that Zeus in his wrath
								upset the table, killed the sons of Lycaon with a thunderbolt, and turned Lycaon himself
								into a wolf. According to this version of the legend, which Apollodorus apparently
								accepted, Lycaon was a righteous king, who ruled wisely like his father Pelasgus before
								him &lpar;see <bibl n="Paus. 8.1.4">Paus. 8.1.4-6</bibl>&rpar;, but his virtuous
								efforts to benefit his subjects were frustrated by the wickedness and impiety of his
								sons, who by exciting the divine anger drew down destruction on themselves and on their
								virtuous parent, and even imperilled the existence of mankind in the great flood. But
								according to another, and perhaps more generally received, tradition, it was King Lycaon
								himself who tempted his divine guest by killing and dishing up to him at table a human
								being; and, according to some, the victim was no other than the king's own son Nyctimus.

								Zeus. See <bibl>Eratosthenes, Cat. 8</bibl>; <bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.4</bibl>;
								<bibl>Scholia in Caesaris Germanici Aratea, p. 387 &lpar;in Martianus Capella, ed.

									xi.128</bibl>; <bibl>Scriptores rerum mythicarum Latini, ed. Bode, i.5 (First Vatican
										Mythographer 17)</bibl>. For this crime Zeus changed the wicked king into a wolf,
								according to Hyginus, Ovid, the Scholiast on Caesar Germanicus, and the First Vatican
								Mythographer; but, on the other hand, Clement of Alexandria, Nonnus, Eratosthenes, and
								Arnobius say nothing of such a transformation. The upsetting of the table by the
								indignant deity is recorded by <bibl>Eratosthenes, Cat. 8</bibl> as well as by
								<bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.4</bibl> and Apollodorus. A somewhat different account of the
								tragical occurrence is given by Pausanias, who says &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 8.2.3">Paus. 8.2.3</bibl>&rpar; that Lycaon brought a human babe to the altar of Lycaean
								Zeus, after which he was immediately turned into a wolf. These traditions were told to
								explain the savage and cruel rites which appear to have been performed in honour of
								Lycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus down to the second century of our era or later. It seems
								that a human victim was sacrificed, and that his inward parts &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">spla/gxnon</foreign>&rpar;, mixed with that of animal victims, was
								partaken of at a sort of cannibal banquet by the worshippers, of whom he who chanced to
								taste of the human flesh was believed to be changed into a wolf and to continue in that
								shape for eight years, but to recover his human form in the ninth year, if in the
								meantime he had abstained from eating human flesh. See <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 8.565d">Plat.
									Rep. 8.565d-e</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 8.2.6">Paus. 8.2.6</bibl>. According to another
								account, reported by Varro on the authority of a Greek writer Euanthes, the werewolf was
								chosen by lot, hung his clothes on an oak tree, swam across a pool, and was then
								transformed into a wolf and herded with wolves for nine years, afterwards recovering his
								human shape if in the interval he had not tasted the flesh of man. In this account there
								is no mention of cannibalism. See <bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. viii.81</bibl>;
								<bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei xviii.17</bibl>. A certain Arcadian boxer, named
								Damarchus, son of Dinnytas, who won a victory at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, is said to have been thus transformed into a wolf at the
								sacrifice of Lycaean Zeus and to have been changed back into a man in the tenth year
								afterwards. Of the historical reality of the boxer there can be no reasonable doubt, for
								his statue existed in the sacred precinct at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, where it was seen by Pausanias; but in the inscription on it,
								which Pausanias copied, there was no mention made of the man's transformation into a
								wolf. See <bibl n="Paus. 6.8.2">Paus. 6.8.2</bibl>. However, the transformation was
								recorded by a Greek writer, Scopas, in his history of Olympic victors, who called the
								boxer Demaenatus, and said that his change of shape was caused by his partaking of the
								inward parts of a boy slain in the Arcadian sacrifice to Lycaean Zeus. Scopas also spoke
								of the restoration of the boxer to the human form in the tenth year, and mentioned that
								his victory in boxing at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> was
								subsequent to his experiences as a wolf. See <bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. viii.82</bibl>;
								<bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei xviii.17</bibl>. The continuance of human sacrifice
								in the rites of Lycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus is hinted at by <bibl n="Paus. 8.38.7">Paus. 8.38.7</bibl> in the second century of our era, and asserted by <bibl>Porphyry,
									&lpar;De abstinentia ii.27: Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelii,
									iv.16.6&rpar;</bibl> in the third century. From these fragmentary notices it is
								hardly possible to piece together a connected account of the rite; but the mention of
								the transformation of the cannibal into a wolf for eight or nine years suggests that the
								awful sacrifice was offered at intervals either of eight or of nine years. If the
								interval was eight years, it would point to the use of that eight years' cycle which
								played so important a part in the ancient calendar of the Greeks, and by which there is
								reason to think that the tenure of the kingship was in some places regulated. Perhaps
								the man who was supposed to be turned into a wolf acted as the priest, or even as the
								incarnation, of the Wolf God for eight or nine years till he was relieved of his office
								at the next celebration of the rites. The subject has been learnedly discussed by
								<bibl>A. B. Cook (<title>Zeus</title>, i.63-99);</bibl>. He regards Lycaean Zeus as a
								god of light rather than of wolves, and for this view there is much to be said. See
								Frazer on Paus. 8.38.7 &lpar;vol. iv. pp. 385ff.&rpar;. The view would be
								confirmed if we were sure that the solemn sacrifice was octennial, for the octennial
								period was introduced in order to reconcile solar and lunar time, and hence the
								religious rites connected with it would naturally have reference to the great celestial
								luminaries. As to the octennial period, see the note on <bibl n="Apollod. 2.5.11">Apollod. 2.5.11</bibl>. But with this view of the festival it is difficult to
								reconcile the part played by wolves in the myth and ritual. We can hardly suppose with
								some late Greek writers, that the ancient Greek word for a year, <foreign lang="greek">luka/bas</foreign>, was derived from <foreign lang="greek">lu/kos</foreign>,

								<bibl>Diod. 4.65.4</bibl>, <bibl n="Paus. 8.35.10">Paus. 8.35.10</bibl>, Hyginus, and

								name on his authority. According to Euripides, as we learn from Apollodorus
								&lpar;see below&rpar;, the name of the heroine's father was Maenalus. The
								suckling of Atalanta by the bear, and the unsuccessful assault on her by the two
								centaurs, Hylaeus and Rhoecus, are described, with a wealth of picturesque detail, by
								Aelian &lpar;<bibl>Ael., Var. Hist. xiii.1</bibl>&rpar;, who does not, however,

							father, because he desired male children; and a she bear came often and gave her suck,
							till hunters found her and brought her up among themselves. Grown to womanhood, Atalanta
							kept herself a virgin, and hunting in the wilderness she remained always under arms. The
							centaurs Rhoecus and Hylaeus tried to force her, but were shot down and killed by her. She
							went moreover with the chiefs to hunt the Calydonian boar, and at the games held in honor
							of Pelias she wrestled with<pb n="401"/> Peleus and won. Afterwards she discovered her
							parents, but when her father would have persuaded her to wed, she went away to a place
							that might serve as a racecourse, and, having planted a stake three cubits high in the
							middle of it, she caused her wooers to race before her from there, and ran herself in
							arms; and if the wooer was caught up, his due was death on the spot, and if he was not
							caught up, his due was marriage. When many had already perished, Melanion came to run for

								repeat the sin of which they had been guilty. For this curious piece of natural history

								to the number of the Pleiades, it was generally agreed that there were seven of them,
								but that one was invisible, or nearly so, to the human eye. Of this invisibility two
								explanations were given. Some thought that Electra, as the mother of Dardanus, was so
								grieved at the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> that she hid her
								face in her hands; the other was that Merope, who had married a mere man, Sisyphus, was
								so ashamed of her humble, though honest, lot by comparison with the guilty splendour of
								her sisters, who were all of them paramours of gods, that she dared not show herself.
								These alternative and equally probable theories are stated, for example, by Ovid and
								Hyginus. The cause of the promotion of the maidens to the sky is said to have been that
								for seven or even twelve years the hunter Orion pursued them with his unwelcome
								attentions, till Zeus in pity removed pursuer and pursued alike to heaven, there to
								shine as stars for ever and to continue the endless pursuit. The bashful or mournful
								Pleiad, who hid her light, is identified by modern astronomers with Celaeno, a star of
								almost the seventh magnitude, which can be seen now, as in antiquity, in clear moonless
								nights by persons endowed with unusually keen sight. See <bibl>A. von Humboldt,

								of cattle by the infant Hermes was the subject of Sophocles's satyric drama
								<title>Ichneutae, or The Trackers</title>, of which some considerable fragments have
								been discovered in recent years. The scene of the play is laid on Mount Cyllene. Apollo
								appears and complains of the loss of the cattle, describes how he has come from
								<placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and through <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> in search of them, and offers a reward to anyone
								who will help him to find the missing beasts. The proclamation reaches the ears of
								Silenus, who hurries to the scene of action and warmly proffers the services of himself
								and his Satyrs in the search, only stipulating that the reward shall take the solid
								shape of cash down. His offer being accepted, the Satyrs at once open on the scent like
								sleuth-hounds and soon discover confused tracks of cattle pointing in different
								directions. But in the very heat of this discovery they are startled by a strange sound,
								the like of which they had never heard before. It is, in fact, the muffled sound of the
								lyre played by the youthful Hermes in the cave. At this point the nymph Cyllene issues
								from the cavern and upbraids the wild creatures with the hubbub they are raising in the
								stillness of the green wooded hills. The Satyrs tender a humble apology for their
								intrusion, but request to know the meaning of the strange sounds that proceed from the
								bowels of the earth. In compliance with their request the nymph explains how Zeus had
								secretly begotten Hermes on Maia in the cave,
								how she herself was acting temporarily as nurse to the child, how the infant grew at an
								astonishing and even alarming rate, and how, being detained in the cave by his father's
								orders, he devoted his leisure hours to constructing out of a dead beast a curious toy
								which emitted musical notes. Being pressed for a fuller explanation she describes how
								Hermes made the lyre out of a tortoise shell, how the instrument was &ldquo;his only
								balm of grief, his comforter,&rdquo; and how the child was transported with delight
								at the ravishing sweetness of the tones which spoke to him from the dead beast. Unmoved
								by this touching description, the Satyrs at once charge the precocious infant with
								having stolen the cattle. His nurse indignantly repels the charge, stoutly declaring
								that the poor child had inherited no propensity to thieving either from its father or
								from its mother, and recommending his accusers to go and look for the thief elsewhere,
								since at their age, with their long beards and bald heads, they ought to know better
								than to trump up such ridiculous accusations, for which they may yet have to smart. The
								nurse's passionate defence of her little charge makes no more impression on the Satyrs
								than her previous encomium on his musical talent: indeed their suspicions are quickened
								by her reference to the hides which the infant prodigy had used in the construction of
								the lyre, and they unhesitatingly identify the skins in question with those of the
								missing cattle. Strong in this conviction, they refuse to budge till the culprit has
								been made over to them. At this point the Greek text begins to fail; we can just catch a
								few disjointed fragments of a heated dialogue between the nurse and the satyrs; the
								words &ldquo;cows,&rdquo; &ldquo;thief,&rdquo;
								&ldquo;rascal,&rdquo; and so forth, occur with painful iteration, then all is
								silence. See <bibl><title>The Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C. Pearson, vol. i.
									pp. 224-270</bibl>. From this seemingly simple piece of mild buffoonery Miss J. E.
								Harrison would extract a ritual of serious and indeed solemn significance, of which,
								however, she admits that the author of the play was himself probably quite unconscious.

								claim of Arsinoe, quotes in favour of Coronis a
								Delphic oracle, which he regards as decisive: for who should know the true mother of
								Aesculapius better than his own father Apollo? The testimony of the deity for once was
								quite unambiguous. It ran thus:&mdash; &ldquo;O born to be the world's great
								joy, Aesculapius, Offspring of love, whom Phlegyas' daughter, fair Coronis, bore to me
								in rugged <placeName key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</placeName>.&rdquo; See <bibl n="Paus. 2.26.7">Paus. 2.26.7</bibl>. In modern times the stones of <placeName key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</placeName>, if we may say so, have risen up to testify to
								the truth of this oracle. For in the course of the modern excavations at the great
								Epidaurian sanctuary of Aesculapius there was discovered a limestone tablet inscribed
								with a hymn in honour of Apollo and Aesculapius, in which the family tree of the junior
								god is set out with the utmost precision, and it entirely confirms the Delphic oracle.
								The author of the hymn was a certain native of <placeName key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</placeName>, by name Isyllus, a man of such scrupulous accuracy that before
								publishing his hymn he took the precaution of submitting it to the fount of knowledge at
								<placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> with an inquiry whether the god
								would sanction its publication. The deity granted his permission in very cordial terms;
								hence we may look on the hymn as an authentic document bearing the imprimatur of the
								Delphic Apollo himself. In it the pedigree of Aesculapius is traced as follows: Father
								Zeus bestowed the hand of the Muse Erato on Malus in holy matrimony &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">o(si/oisi ga/mois.</foreign>&rpar; The pair had a daughter Cleophema,

								Aeolus, and this tradition had the support of Hesiod &lpar;quoted by <bibl>Tzetzes,
									Scholiast on Lycophron 284</bibl>&rpar;. On the other hand Tzetzes represents
								Perieres as the son of Cynortes &lpar;<bibl>Scholiast on Lycophron
									511</bibl>&rpar;. Apollodorus here and elsewhere &lpar;<bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.5">Apollod. 1.9.5</bibl>&rpar; mentions both traditions without deciding between
								them. In two passages &lpar;<bibl n="Apollod. 1.7.3">Apollod. 1.7.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.5">Apollod. 1.9.5</bibl>&rpar; he asserts or implies that the
								father of Perieres was Aeolus; in another passage &lpar;<bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.3">Apollod. 3.10.3</bibl>&rpar; he asserts that the father of Perieres was Cynortes.
								In the present passage he seems to say that according to one tradition there were two
								men of the name of Perieres: one of them was the son of Aeolus and father of Aphareus
								and Leucippus; the other was the son of Cynortes and father of Oebalus, who married the
								nymph Batia and became by her the father of
								Tyndareus, Hippocoon, and Icarius. Pausanias says that Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus,
								first married Perieres and had by him two sons, Aphareus and Leucippus, and that after
								his death she married Oebalus, son of Cynortas &lpar;Cynortes&rpar;, and had by
								him a son Tyndareus. See <bibl n="Paus. 2.21.7">Paus. 2.21.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 3.1.4">Paus. 3.1.4</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 4.2.4">Paus. 4.2.4</bibl>.
								Apollodorus, on the other hand, represents Perieres as the father not only of Aphareus
								and Leucippus, but also of Tyndareus and Icarius by Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus. See
								above, <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.5">Apollod. 1.9.5</bibl>; <bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.3">Apollod. 3.10.3</bibl>. Tzetzes &lpar;<bibl>Scholiast on Lycophron
									511</bibl>&rpar; agrees with him as to the sons, but makes Perieres the son of
								Cynortas instead the son of Aeolus. Thus there were two traditions as to the father of
								Tyndareus; according to one, his father was Perieres, according to the other, he was
								Oebalus. But the two traditions were agreed as to the mother of Tyndareus, whom they
								represented as Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus. According to another account, which may
								have been intended to reconcile the discrepant traditions as to the father of Tyndareus,
								Oebalus was the son of Perieres and the father of Tyndareus, Icarius,
								Arene, and the bastard Hippocoon, whom he had by
								Nicostrate. See <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 457</bibl>; <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il.
									ii.581</bibl>. This account is mentioned, but apparently not accepted, by Apollodorus
								in the present passage, though he says nothing about the daughter
								Arene and the bastardy of Hippocoon. If we accept this
								last version of the genealogy, Tyndareus was descended both from Oebalus and Perieres,
								being the son of Oebalus and the grandson of Perieres. In a recently discovered fragment
								of the <title>Catalogues</title> of Hesiod, that poet calls Tyndareus an Oebalid,

								According to Apollodorus, however, the fight between the cousins was occasioned by a

									10.60(112)ff.</bibl>&rpar; he speaks only of anger about cattle as the motive that

								priestesses, like the goddesses, were two in number, and that they were called
								&ldquo;the colts of the Leucippides.&rdquo; Further, since the name of
								Leucippus, the legendary father of the goddesses, means simply &ldquo;White
								Horse,&rdquo; it is tempting to suppose that the Leucippides, like their
								priestesses, were spoken of and perhaps conceived as white horses. More than that,
								Castor and Pollux, who carried off these white-horse maidens, if we may call them so,
								were not only constantly associated with horses, but were themselves called White Horses
								&lpar;<foreign lang="greek">leuko/pwloi&rpar;</foreign>&rpar; by <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">Pind. P. 1.66(126)</bibl> and &ldquo;White Colts of

								to various expedients. They said, for example, that an exact copy of the Palladium had

								According to <bibl>Dictys Cretensis v.5</bibl>, the image fell from heaven at the time

								sacred edifice. <bibl>Clement of Alexandria, Protrept. iv.47, p. 42, ed. Potter</bibl>,
								mentions a strange opinion that the Palladium &ldquo;was made out of the bones of
								Pelops, just as the Olympian &lpar;image of Zeus was made&rpar; out of other
								bones of an Indian beast,&rdquo; that is, out of ivory. Pherecydes discussed the
								subject of <hi rend="ital">palladia</hi> in general; he described them as
								&ldquo;shapes not made with hands,&rdquo; and derived the name from <foreign lang="greek">pa/llein</foreign>, which he considered to be equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ba/llein</foreign>, &ldquo;to throw, cast,&rdquo; because these

								what seems to have been the more generally accepted view he was Peleus. &lpar;So
								Diodorus, Pausanias, the Scholiast on Homer, one of the <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Andr.
									687</bibl>, Ovid, and in one passage Lactantius Placidus&rpar;. If Pherecydes was
								right in denying any relationship between Telamon and Peleus, and in representing
								Telamon as a Salaminian rather than an Aeginetan &lpar;see above&rpar;, it
								becomes probable that in the original tradition Peleus, not Telamon, was described as
								the murderer of Phocus. Another version of the story was that both brothers had a hand
								in the murder, Telamon having banged him on the head with a quoit, while Peleus finished
								him off with the stroke of an axe in the middle of his back. This was the account given
								by the anonymous author of the old epic <title>Alcmaeonis</title>; and the same division
								of labour between the brothers was recognized by the Scholiast on Pindar and Tzetzes,
								though according to them the quoit was handled by Peleus and the cold steel by Telamon.
								Other writers &lpar;Antoninus Liberalis and Hyginus&rpar; lay the murder at the
								door of both brothers without parcelling the guilt out exactly between them. There seems
								to be a general agreement that the crime was committed, or the accident happened, in the
								course of a match at quoits; but Dorotheus &lpar;quoted by <bibl>Plut. Parallela
									25</bibl>&rpar; alleged that the murder was perpetrated by Telamon at a boar hunt,
								and this view seems to have been accepted by Lactantius Placidus in one place
								&lpar;<bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius, Theb. ii.113</bibl>&rpar;, though
								in other places &lpar;<bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius, Theb. vii.344 and
									xi.281</bibl>&rpar; he speaks as if the brothers were equally guilty. But perhaps
								this version of the story originated in a confusion of the murder of Phocus with the
								subsequent homicide of Eurytion, which is said to have taken place at a boar-hunt,
								whether the hunting of the Calydonian boar or another. See below, <bibl n="Apollod. 3.13.2">Apollod. 3.13.2</bibl> with the note. According to Pausanias the
								exiled Telamon afterwards returned and stood his trial, pleading his cause from the deck
								of a ship, because his father would not suffer him to set foot in the island. But being
								judged guilty by his stern sire he sailed away, to return to his native land no more. It
								may have been this verdict, delivered against his own son, which raised the reputation
								of Aeacus for rigid justice to the highest pitch, and won for him a place on the bench

								Apollodorus in the present passage. Pindar calls the wicked wife Hippolyta or Hippolyta

								Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, calls her Cretheis or Hippolyte; and the Scholiast on
								Aristophanes, calls her first Hippolyte and afterwards Astydamia. The sword of Peleus,
								which his faithless host hid in the cows' dung while the hero lay sleeping in the wood,
								was a magic sword wrought by the divine smith Hephaestus and bestowed on Peleus by the
								pitying gods as a reward for his chastity. With this wondrous brand the chaste hero,
								like a mediaeval knight, was everywhere victorious in the fight and successful in the
								chase. Compare <bibl>Zenobius, Cent. v.20</bibl>. The episode of the hiding of the sword

								Peleus in the house of Acastus and in the forest reads like a fairy tale, and we can

						<p>When Thetis had got a babe by Peleus, she wished to make it immortal, and unknown to

								and the seventh son, Achilles, would have perished in like manner, if his father Peleus
								had not snatched him from the fire at the moment when as yet only his anklebone was
								burnt. To supply this missing portion of his body, Peleus dug up the skeleton of the
								giant Damysus, the fleetest of all the giants, and, extracting from it the anklebone,
								fitted it neatly into the ankle of his little son Achilles, applying drugs which caused
								the new, or rather old, bone to coalesce perfectly with the rest. See <bibl>Ptolemy

								when Thetis was interrupted by Peleus in her effort to make Achilles immortal, she threw
								the infant screaming on the floor, and rushing out of the house plunged angrily into the
								sea, and never returned again. In the Iliad Homer represents Thetis dwelling with her
								old father Nereus and the sea-nymphs in the depths of the sea &lpar;<bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.357">Hom. Il. 1.357ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.35">Hom. Il.

								would seem to have been acquainted with the story of the quarrel and parting of the

								which led to their separation. In this, as in many other places, Homer passes over in
								silence features of popular tradition which he either rejected as incredible or deemed
								below the dignity of the epic. Yet if we are right in classing the story of Peleus and
								Thetis with the similar tales of the marriage of a man to a mermaid or other marine
								creature, the narrative probably always ended in the usual sad way by telling how, after
								living happily together for a time, the two at last quarrelled and parted for
								ever.</note> Peleus brought the child to Chiron, who received him and fed him on the
							inwards of lions and wild swine and the marrows of bears,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Compare <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. xvi.37</bibl>. According to <bibl>Statius
								&lpar;Achill. ii.382ff.&rpar;</bibl>, Chiron fed the youthful Achilles not on
								ordinary victuals, but on the flesh and marrows of lions. Philostratus says that his
								nourishment consisted of honeycombs and the marrows of fawns
								&lpar;<bibl>Philostratus, Her. xx.2</bibl>&rpar;, while the author of the
								<bibl>Etymologicum Magnum, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*)axilleu/s</foreign>, p.
									181</bibl> says that he was nurtured on the marrows of deer. Compare <bibl>Eustathius on
										Hom. Il. 1.1, p. 14</bibl>. The flesh and marrows of lions, wild boars, and bears were
								no doubt supposed to impart to the youthful hero who partook of them the strength and
								courage of these animals, while the marrows of fawns or deer may have been thought to
								ensure the fleetness of foot for which he was afterwards so conspicuous. It is thus that
								on the principle of sympathetic magic many races seek to acquire the qualities of
								certain animals by eating their flesh or drinking their blood; whereas they abstain from
								eating the flesh of other animals lest they should, by partaking of it, be infected with
								the undesirable qualities which these creatures are believed to possess. For example, in
								various African tribes men eat the hearts of lions in order to become lionhearted, while
								others will not eat the flesh of tortoises lest they should become slow-footed like
								these animals. See <bibl><title>Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild</title>,
									ii.138ff.</bibl> On the same principle the ancients believed that men could acquire the
								art of divination by eating the hearts of ravens, moles, or hawks, because these
								creatures were supposed to be endowed with prophetic powers. See <bibl>Porphyry, De
									abstinentia ii.48</bibl>; <bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxx.19</bibl>. So Medea is said to

								sacrifice or purification designed to ensure the safety of the army in the midst of a
								hostile people. In <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> a form of public
								purification was to cut a dog in two and pass between the pieces. See <bibl>Plut.

								dog was cut in two: the head and fore part were placed on the right, the hinder part,

								instances there cited may be added another. When the Algerine pirates were at sea and in
								extreme danger, it was their custom to sacrifice a sheep, cut off its head, extract its
								entrails, and then throw them, together with the head, overboard; afterwards
								&ldquo;with all the speed they can &lpar;without skinning&rpar; they cut the
								body in two parts by the middle, and then throw one part over the right side of the

								Cecrops sent to inquire of Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>
								what these portents might signify. The oracle answered that the olive and the water were

								would worship. Accordingly the question was submitted to a general assembly of the
								citizens and citizenesses; for in these days women had the vote as well as men. All the
								men voted for the god, and all the women voted for the goddess; and as there was one
								more woman than there were men, the goddess appeared at the head of the poll. Chagrined
								at the loss of the election, the male candidate flooded the country with the water of
								the sea, and to appease his wrath it was decided to deprive women of the vote and to
								forbid children to bear their mother's names for the future. See <bibl>Augustine, De

								that the crime was perpetrated at the time when the Thracian women were celebrating the

								poo! &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">pou=, pou=</foreign>, &ldquo;Where?

								Philomela the songstress nightingale.</note> Tereus had by her a son Itys,<pb n="101"/>and having fallen in love with Philomela, he seduced her also saying that Procne was
							dead, for he concealed her in the country. Afterwards he married Philomela and bedded with

								ancients are not agreed as to the exact mode in which the ruffian Sinis despatched his

								pine-trees to the ground, tied the extremities of his victim to both trees, and then let
								the trees go, which, springing up and separating, tore the wretch's body in two. This
								atrocious form of murder was at a later time actually employed by the emperor Aurelian
								in a military execution. See <bibl>Vopiscus, Aurelian, 7.4</bibl>. A Ruthenian pirate,
								named Botho, is said to have put men to death in similar fashion. See <bibl>Saxo
									Grammaticus, Historia Danica, bk. vii. vol. i. pp. 353ff., ed. P. E.
									M&uuml;ller</bibl>. According to Hyginus, Sinis, with the help of his victim,
								dragged down a pine-tree to the earth; then, when the man was struggling to keep the
								tree down, Sinis released it, and in the rebound the man was tossed up into the air and
								killed by falling heavily to the ground. Apollodorus seems to have contemplated a
								similar mode of death, except that he does not mention the cooperation of Sinis in
								bending the tree to the earth. According to the <title>Parian Chronicle</title>
								&lpar;<bibl>Marmor Parium 35ff.</bibl>&rpar; it was not on his journey from
								<placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> that Theseus killed Sinis, but at a later time, after he had come

								under a single government; he then returned to the Isthmus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, killed Sinis, and celebrated the Isthmian
								games. This tradition seems to imply that Theseus held the games as a funeral honour
								paid to the dead man, or more probably as an expiation to appease the angry ghost of his
								victim. This implication is confirmed by the Scholiast on Pindar, who says that
								according to some people Theseus held the Isthmian games in honour of Sinis, whom he had
								killed. Plutarch tells us <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 8.2">Plut. Thes. 8.2</bibl> that when
								Theseus had killed Sinis, the daughter of the dead man, by name Perigune, fled and hid
								herself in a bed of asparagus; that she bore a son Melanippus to Theseus, and that
								Melanippus had a son Ioxus, whose descendants, the Ioxids, both men and women, revered
								and honoured asparagus and would not burn it, because asparagus had once sheltered their
								ancestress. This hereditary respect shown by all the members of a family or clan for a
								particular species of plant is reminiscent of totemism, though it is not necessarily a
								proof of it.</note></p>

								Curiously enough, the Second Vatican Mythographer attributes the despatching of Sciron,
								not to Theseus, but to the artist Daedalus. The Megarians, as we learn from Plutarch,
								indignantly denied the defamatory reports current as to the character and pursuits of
								their neighbour Sciron, whom they represented as a most respectable man, the foe of
								robbers, the friend of the virtuous, and connected by marriage with families of the
								highest quality; but their efforts to whitewash the blackguard appear to have been
								attended with little success. The Scironian Rocks, to which Sciron was supposed to have
								given his name, are a line of lofty cliffs rising sheer from the sea; a narrow,
								crumbling ledge about half way up their face afforded a perilous foothold, from which
								the adventurous traveller looked down with horror on the foam of the breakers far below.
								The dangers of the path were obviated about the middle of the nineteenth century by the
								construction of a road and railway along the coast. See Frazer's note on Paus. 1.44.6

								call him Damastes; but Apollodorus says that some people called him Polypemon, and this
								latter name is supported by Pausanias, who adds that he was surnamed Procrustes. Ovid in
								two passages &lpar;<bibl n="Ov. Met. 7.438">Ov. Met. 7.438, Her. ii.
									69</bibl>&rpar; calls him simply Procrustes, but in a third passage
								&lpar;<bibl>Ovid, Ibis 407</bibl>&rpar; he seems to speak of him as the son of
								Polypemon. The <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Hipp. 977</bibl> wrongly names him Sinis. The
								reference of Bacchylides to him is difficult of interpretation. Jebb translates the
								passage: &ldquo;The mighty hammer of Polypemon has dropt from the hand of the Maimer
								&lsqb;Prokoptes&rsqb;, who has met with a stronger than himself.&rdquo; Here
								Jebb understands Prokoptes to be another name for Procrustes, who received the hammer
								and learned the use of it from Polypemon, his predecessor, perhaps his father. But other
								translations and explanations have been proposed. See the note in <bibl>Jebb's Appendix,
									pp. 490ff.</bibl>; <bibl>W. H. Roscher, <title>Lexikon der griech. und r&ouml;m.
										Mythologie</title>, iii.2683, 2687ff.</bibl> The hammer in question was the
								instrument with which Procrustes operated on the short men, beating them out till they
								fitted the long bed, as we learn from the Scholiast on Euripides as well as from
								Apollodorus; a handsaw was probably the instrument with which he curtailed the length of
								the tall men. According to Apollodorus, with whom Hyginus agrees, Procrustes had two
								beds for the accommodation of his guests, a long one for the short men, and a short one
								for the long men. But according to Diodorus Siculus, with whom the Scholiast on
								Euripides agrees, he had only one bed for all comers, and adjusted his visitors to it
								with the hammer or the handsaw according to circumstances.</note><pb n="133"/>He had his
							dwelling beside the road, and made up two beds, one small and the other big; and offering

								<bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 990</bibl> agree closely with each other and with that of
								Apollodorus, which they may have copied. They agree with him and with the Scholiast on
								Pindar in alleging an incestuous passion of Oenomaus for his daughter as the reason why
								he was reluctant to give her in marriage; indeed they affirm that this was the motive
								assigned for his conduct by the more accurate historians, though they also mention the
								oracle which warned him that he would perish at the hands of his in-law. The fear of
								this prediction being fulfilled is the motive generally alleged by the extant writers of
								antiquity. Diodorus Siculus mentions some particulars which are not noticed by other
								authors. According to him, the goal of the race was the altar of Poseidon at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and the suitor was allowed a start; for before
								mounting his chariot Oenomaus sacrificed a ram to Zeus, and while he was sacrificing the
								suitor drove off and made the best of his way along the road, until Oenomaus, having
								completed the sacrifice, was free to pursue and overtake him. The sacrifice was offered
								at a particular altar at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, which
								some people called the altar of Hephaestus, and others the altar of Warlike Zeus

								in the presence of an image of Zeus; among them were Hippodamia and her mother Sterope.
								These sculptures were found, more or less mutilated, by the Germans in their excavation

								enough, the scene of the story is transposed by the <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or.
									990</bibl>, who affirms that Oenomaus reigned in <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, though at the same time he says, in accordance with the usual
								tradition, that the goal of the race was the Isthmus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>. The connexion of Oenomaus with <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> is to a certain extent countenanced by a story for which the

								<placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, and that his ghost appeared to Pelops
								in a dream, lamenting his sad fate and begging to be accorded funeral honours. So Pelops
								burned the dead man's body, buried his ashes under a barrow, and founded a sanctuary of
								Cillaean Apollo close by. See the <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. i.38</bibl>

							it to Thyestes, by whom she had been debauched. For the Mycenaeans had received an oracle

								certainly a mistake for Apollodorus. Probably Tzetzes and the Scholiasts drew on the
								present passage of Apollodorus, or rather on the passage as it appeared in the
								unabridged text instead of in the <title>Epitome</title> which is all that we now
								possess of the last part of the <title>Library</title>. Euripides told the story

									Vatican Mythographer 147)</bibl>. From these various accounts and allusions it would
								seem that in their dispute for the kingdom, which Atreus claimed in right of birth as
								the elder &lpar;<bibl>Tzetzes, Chiliades i.426</bibl>&rpar;, it was agreed that
								he who could exhibit the greatest portent should be king. Atreus intended to produce the
								golden lamb, which had been born in his flocks; but meanwhile the lamb had been given by
								his treacherous wife Aerope to her paramour Thyestes, who produced it in evidence of his
								claim and was accordingly awarded the crown. However, with the assistance of Zeus, the
								rightful claimant Atreus was able to exhibit a still greater portent, which was the sun
								and the Pleiades retracing their course in the sky and setting in the east instead of in
								the west. This mighty marvel, attesting the divine approbation of Atreus, clinched the
								dispute in his favour; he became king, and banished his rival Thyestes. According to a
								different account, which found favour with the Latin poets, the sun reversed his course
								in the sky, not in order to demonstrate the right of Atreus to the crown, but on the
								contrary to mark his disgust and horror at the king for murdering his nephews and
								dishing up their mangled limbs to their father Thyestes at table. See <bibl>Tzetzes,

								<title>Atreus</title>. See <bibl><title>The Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C.
									Pearson, i.93</bibl>. In later times rationalists explained the old fable by saying

								<bibl n="Strab. 1.2.15">Strab. 1.2.15</bibl>; <bibl>Lucian, De astrologia 12</bibl>. A
								fragment of Euripides appears to show that he put in the mouth of Atreus this claim to
								astronomical discovery. See <bibl>TGF (Nauck 2nd ed.), p. 639, frag. 861</bibl>. A still
								more grandiose explanation of the myth was given by Plato l.c., who adduced it, with
								grave irony, as evidence that in alternate cycles of vast duration the universe revolves
								in opposite directions, the reversal of its motion at the end of each cycle being
								accompanied by a great destruction of animal life. This magnificent theory was perhaps
								suggested to the philosopher by the speculations of Empedocles, and it bears a

						<p>The daughters of Anius, the son of Apollo, to wit,<pb n="181"/>Elais, Spermo, and Oeno,

								produce olive oil; Spermo, who took her name from <foreign lang="greek">spe/rma</foreign>, &ldquo;seed,&rdquo; could produce corn; and Oeno, who took

								of prophecy from his divine sire &lpar;<bibl>Diod. 5.62.2</bibl>&rpar;, foretold
								that <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> would not be taken for ten years,
								and invited them to stay with him for nine years, promising that his daughters would
								find them in food all the time. This hospitable offer was apparently not accepted at the
								moment; but afterwards, when the Greeks were encamped before <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, Agamemnon sent for the young women and ordered
								them peremptorily to feed his army. This they did successfully, if we may believe
								Tzetzes; but, to judge by Ovid's account, they found the work of the commissariat too
								exacting, for he says that they took to flight. Being overtaken by their pursuers, they
								prayed to Dionysus, who turned them into white doves. And that, says Servius, is why
								down to this day it is deemed a sin to harm a dove in <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. From Tzetzes we learn that the story of these prolific damsels was
								told by Pherecydes and by the author of the epic <title>Cypria</title>, from whom
								Pherecydes may have borrowed it. Stesichorus related how Menelaus and Ulysses went to

								of Apollodorus, we may conjecture that in his full text he described how their services
								were requisitioned to victual the fleet and army assembling at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>. The conjecture is confirmed by the statement of
								Dictys Cretensis, that before the Greek army set sail from <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, it had received a supply of corn, wine, and
								other provisions from Anius and his daughters. It may have been in order to ensure these

								with an image of him; and there the hero was said to dwell immortal with Helen for his

								According to <bibl>Zenobius, Cent. i.43</bibl>, Ajax in his frenzy scourged two rams,

								<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 237">Soph. Aj. 237-244</bibl>&rpar;.</note> And Agamemnon

								placed in a coffin &ldquo;on account of the wrath of the king.&rdquo; See
								<bibl>Eustathius on Hom. Il. ii.557, p. 285</bibl>. Philostratus tells us that the
								body was laid in the earth by direction of the seer Calchas, &ldquo;because suicides
								may not lawfully receive the burial by fire&rdquo; &lpar;<bibl>Philostratus,
									Her. xiii.7</bibl>&rpar;. This was probably the true reason for the tradition that
								the corpse was not cremated in the usual way. For the ghosts of suicides appear to be
								commonly dreaded; hence unusual modes of disposing of their bodies are adopted in order
								to render their spirits powerless for mischief. For example, the Baganda of Central
								Africa, who commonly bury their dead in the earth, burn the bodies of suicides on waste
								land or at crossroads in order to destroy the ghosts; for they believe that if the ghost
								of a suicide is not thus destroyed, it will tempt other people to imitate its example.
								As an additional precaution everyone who passed the place where the body of a suicide
								had been burnt threw some grass or a few sticks on the spot, &ldquo;so as to prevent
								the ghost from catching him, in case it had not been destroyed.&rdquo; For the same
								reason, if a man took his life by hanging himself on a tree, the tree was torn up by the
								roots and burned with the body; if he had killed himself in a house, the house was
								pulled down and the materials consumed with fire; for &ldquo;people feared to live
								in a house in which a suicide had taken place, lest they too should be tempted to commit
								the same crime.&rdquo; See <bibl>J. Roscoe, <title>The Baganda</title>
									&lpar;London, 1911&rpar;, pp. 20ff., 289</bibl>. Similar customs prevailed
								among the Banyoro, a neighbouring nation of Central Africa. &ldquo;It was said to be
								necessary to destroy a tree upon which a person had hanged himself and to burn down a
								house in which a person had committed suicide, otherwise they would be a danger to
								people in general and would influence them to commit suicide.&rdquo; See <bibl>J.
									Roscoe, <title>The Northern Bantu</title> &lpar;Cambridge, 1915&rpar;, pp.
									24ff.</bibl> &lpar;where, however, the burning of the body is not expressly
								mentioned&rpar;. In like manner the Hos of <placeName key="tgn,7016577">Togoland</placeName>, in West Africa, are much afraid of the ghost of a suicide. They
								believe that the ghost of a man who has hanged himself will torment the first person who
								sees the body. Hence when the relations of such a man approach the corpse they protect
								themselves against the ghost by wearing magical cords and smearing their faces with a
								magical powder. The tree on which a man hanged himself is cut down, and the branch on
								which he tied the fatal noose is lopped off. To this branch the corpse is then tied and
								dragged ruthlessly through the woods, over stones and through thorny bushes, to the
								place where &ldquo;men of blood,&rdquo; that is, all who die a violent death,
								are buried. There they dig a shallow grave in great haste and throw the body in. Having
								done so they run home; for they say that the ghosts of &ldquo;men of
								blood&rdquo; fling stones at such as do not retreat fast enough, and that he who is
								struck by one of these stones must die. The houses of such men are broken down and
								burnt. A suicide is believed to defile the land and to prevent rain from falling. Hence
								the district where a man has killed himself must be purified by a sacrifice offered to
								the Earth-god. See <bibl>J. Spieth, <title>Die Ewe-St&auml;mme</title>
									&lpar;Berlin, 1906&rpar;, pp. 272, 274, 276ff. 756, 758</bibl>. As to the

								Sophocles the rites of burial are at first refused, but afterwards conceded, to the dead
								body of Ajax; and though these ceremonies are not described, we may assume that they
								included the burning of the corpse on a pyre. This variation from what appears to be the
								usual tradition may have been introduced by Sophocles out of deference to the religious
								feelings of the Athenians, who worshipped Ajax as a hero, and who would have been
								shocked to think of his remains being denied the ordinary funeral honours. See

								suggests that Ulysses had the principal share
								in the exploit. But according to another and seemingly more prevalent tradition it was
								Diomedes who really bore off the image. This emerges particularly from Conon's account.
								Diomedes, he tells us, mounted on the shoulders of
								Ulysses, and having thus scaled the wall, he refused to draw his comrade up
								after him, and went in search of the Palladium. Having secured it, he returned with it
								to Ulysses, and together they retraced their
								steps to the Greek camp. But by the way the crafty Ulysses conceived the idea of
								murdering his companion and making himself master of the fateful image. So he dropped
								behind Diomedes and drew his sword. But the moon shone full; and as he raised his arm to
								strike, the flash of the blade in the moonlight caught the eye of the wary Diomedes. He
								faced round, drew his sword, and, upbraiding the other with his cowardice, drove him
								before him, while he beat the back of the recreant with the flat of his sword. This
								incident gave rise to the proverb, &ldquo;Diomedes's compulsion,&rdquo; applied
								to such as did what they were forced to do by dire necessity. The proverb is similarly
								explained by the other Greek proverb-writers and lexicographers cited above, except
								that, instead of the flash of the sword in the moonlight, they say it was the shadow of
								the sword raised to strike him which attracted the attention of Diomedes. The
								picturesque story appears to have been told in the <title>Little Iliad</title>
								&lpar;<bibl>Hesychius, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*diomh/deios
									a)na/gkh</foreign></bibl>&rpar;. According to one account, Diomedes and Ulysses made
								their way into the Trojan citadel through a sewer &lpar;<bibl n="Serv. A. 2.166">Serv. Verg. A. 2.166</bibl>&rpar;, indeed a narrow and muddy sewer, as Sophocles
								called it in the play which he composed on the subject. See <bibl>Julius Pollux,
									ix.49</bibl>; <bibl><title>The Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C. Pearson, ii.36,

									Hom. Il. vi.311</bibl>; <bibl>Suidas, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*palla/dion</foreign></bibl>&rpar;; to this step she was said to have been

								was no doubt fully told by Lesches and Arctinus, though of their narratives we possess
								only the brief abstracts of Proclus. The accounts of later writers, such as
								Virgil, Quintus Smyrnaeus, Tryphiodorus, Tzetzes, and
								Apollodorus himself, are probably based on the works of these early cyclic poets. The
								poem of Arctinus, if we may judge by Proclus's abstract, opened with the deliberations
								of the Trojans about the Wooden Horse, and from the similarity of the abstract to the
								text of Apollodorus we may infer that our author followed Arctinus generally, though not
								in all details; for instance, he differed from Arctinus in regard to the affair of
								Laocoon and his sons. See below. With the stratagem of the Wooden Horse we may compare
								the stratagem by which, in the war of Independence waged by the <placeName key="tgn,7016845">United Provinces</placeName> against <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, Prince Maurice contrived to make himself master of <placeName key="tgn,7006827">Breda</placeName>. The city was then held by a Spanish garrison,
								which received its supply of fuel by boats. The master of one of these boats, Adrian
								Vandenberg by name, noticed that in the absence of the governor there was great
								negligence in conducting the examination to which all boats were subjected before they
								were allowed to enter the town. This suggested to Vandenberg a plan for taking the
								citadel by surprise. He communicated his plan to Prince Maurice, who readily embraced
								it. Accordingly the boat was loaded in appearance with turf as usual; but the turf was
								supported by a floor of planks fixed at the distance of several feet from the bottom;
								and beneath this floor seventy picked soldiers were placed under the command of an able
								officer named Harauguer. The boat had but a few miles to sail, yet through unexpected
								accidents several days passed before they could reach <placeName key="tgn,7006827">Breda</placeName>. The wind veered against them, the melting ice &lpar;for it was
								the month of February&rpar; retarded their course, and the boat, having struck upon
								a bank, was so much damaged that the soldiers were for some time up to their knees in
								water. Their provisions were almost spent, and to add to their anxieties one of their
								number was seized with a violent cough, which, if it had continued, would inevitably
								have betrayed them to the enemy. The man generously entreated his comrades to kill him,
								offering them his own sword for the purpose; but they as generously refused, and happily
								the soldier's cough left him before they approached the walls. Even the leak in the boat
								was stopped by some accident. On reaching the fortifications the boat was searched, but
								only in the most superficial manner. Still the danger was great, for the turf was
								immediately purchased and the soldiers of the garrison set to work to unload it. They
								would soon have uncovered the planks and detected the ambush, if the ready-witted master
								of the boat had not first amused them with his discourse and then invited them to drink
								wine with him. The offer was readily accepted. The day wore on, darkness fell, and the
								Spanish soldiers were all drunk or asleep. At dead of night Harauguer and his men issued
								from the boat, and dividing into two bodies they attacked the guards and soon made
								themselves masters of two gates. Seized with a panic, the garrison fled the town. Prince
								Maurice marched in and took possession of the citadel. These events happened in the year

								Laocoon, the two serpents killed Laocoon himself and one of his sons. According to
								Virgil, Hyginus, and Servius, they killed Laocoon and both his sons. According to
								Quintus Smyrnaeus, the serpents killed the two sons but spared the father, who lived to
								lament their fate. This last seems to have been the version followed by Apollodorus. The
								reason of the calamity which befell Laocoon is explained by Servius on the authority of
								Euphorion. He tells us that when the Greek army landed in the <placeName key="tgn,7002331">Troad</placeName>, the Trojans stoned the priest of Poseidon to
								death, because he had not, by offering sacrifices to the sea god, prevented the
								invasion. Accordingly, when the Greeks seemed to be departing, it was deemed advisable
								to sacrifice to Poseidon, no doubt in order to induce him to give the Greeks a stormy
								passage. But the priesthood was vacant, and it was necessary to choose a priest by lot.
								The lot fell on Laocoon, priest of the Thymbraean Apollo, but he had incurred the wrath
								of Apollo by sleeping with his wife in front of the divine image, and for this sacrilege
								he perished with his two sons. This narrative helps us to understand the statement of
								Apollodorus that the two serpents were sent by Apollo for a sign. According to Tzetzes,
								the death of Laocoon's son took place in the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo, the scene
								of the crime thus becoming the scene of the punishment. Sophocles wrote a tragedy on the
								subject of Laocoon, but though a few fragments of the play have survived, its contents
								are unknown. See <bibl>TGF (Nauck 2nd ed.), pp. 211ff.</bibl>; <bibl><title>The
									Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C Pearson, vol. ii. pp. 38ff.</bibl> In
								modern times the story of Laocoon is probably even better known from the wonderful group
								of statuary in the <placeName key="tgn,7001168">Vatican</placeName> than from the verses
								of Virgil. That group, the work of three Rhodian sculptors, graced the palace of the

								other work either of sculpture or painting &lpar;<bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist.

									his grandfather Peleus had been expelled by Acastus; hence he departed for home in
									haste, taking Andromache with him. The Scholiast on this passage of Euripides (<date value="1128">1128</date>) says that Peleus was expelled by Acastus's two sons,
									Archander and Architeles, and that the exiled king, going to meet his grandson
									Neoptolemus, was driven by a storm to the island of Cos, where he was entertained by a
									certain Molon and died. As to an early connexion between <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and Cos, see <bibl>W. R. Paton and E. L. Hicks, <title>The
										Inscriptions of Cos</title>, pp. 344ff.</bibl> A different and much more detailed
									account of the exile of Peleus is furnished by <bibl>Dictys Cretensis vi.7-9</bibl>.
									According to it, when Neoptolemus was refitting his shattered ships in Molossia, he
									heard that Peleus had been deposed and expelled by Acastus. Hastening to the aid of his
									aged grandfather, he found him hiding in a dark cave on the shore of one of the Sepiades
									Islands, where he eagerly scanned every passing sail in hopes that one of them would
									bring his grandson to his rescue. By disguising himself Neoptolemus contrived to attack
									and kill Acastus's two sons, Menalippus and Plisthenes, when they were out hunting.
									Afterwards, disguising himself as a Trojan captive, he lured Acastus himself to the cave
									and would have slain him there, if it had not been for the intercession of Thetis, who
									had opportunely arrived from the sea to visit her old husband Peleus. Happy at his
									escape, Acastus resigned the kingdom on the spot to Neoptolemus, and that hero at once
									took possession of the realm in company with his grandfather, his divine grandmother
									Thetis, and the companions of his voyage. This romantic narrative may be based on a lost
									Greek tragedy, perhaps on the <title>Peleus</title> of Sophocles, a play in which the
									dramatist appears to have dealt with the fortunes of Peleus in his old age. See
									<bibl><title>The Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C. Pearson, vol. ii. pp.
										140ff.</bibl> The statement of Dictys Cretensis that Peleus took refuge in one of the
									Sepiades Islands suggests that in the <bibl>Scholium on Eur. Tro. 1126-1130</bibl> the
									name Icos should be read instead of Cos, as has been argued by several scholars
									&lpar;<bibl>A. C. Pearson, op. cit. ii.141</bibl>&rpar;; for Icos was a small
									island near <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> &lpar;<bibl>Stephanus
										Byzantius, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*)iko/s</foreign></bibl>&rpar;, and would be
									a much more natural place of refuge for Peleus than the far more distant island of Cos.
									Moreover, we have the positive affirmation of the poet Antipater of <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName> that Peleus was buried in Icos
									&lpar;<bibl>Anth. Pal. vii.2.9ff.</bibl>&rpar;. The connexion of Peleus with
									the Sepiades Islands is further supported by Euripides; for in his play
									<title>Andromache</title> &lpar;<bibl n="Eur. Andr. 1253">Eur. And.
										1253-1269</bibl>&rpar; he tells how Thetis bids her old husband Peleus tarry in a

									that he might dwell with her as a god for ever in the depths of the sea. In the same
									play &lpar;<bibl n="Eur. Andr. 22">Eur. And. 22ff.</bibl>&rpar; Euripides says
									that Neoptolemus refused to accept the sceptre of Pharsalia in the lifetime of his

								Apollodorus appears to follow the account given by Euripides in his
								<title>Andromache</title>, (<bibl n="Eur. Andr. 967">Eur. And. 967-981</bibl>).
								According to that account, Menelaus gave his daughter
								Hermione in marriage to her cousin Orestes, the son of Agamemnon and
								Clytaemnestra. But in the Trojan war he afterwards promised the hand of
								Hermione to Neoptolemus, if Neoptolemus should
								succeed in capturing <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Accordingly on his
								return from the war Neoptolemus claimed his bride from her husband Orestes, who was then
								haunted and maddened by the Furies of his murdered mother Clytaemnestra. Orestes
								protested, but in vain; Neoptolemus insolently reproached him with his crime of
								matricide and with the unseen avengers of blood by whom he was pursued. So Orestes was
								obliged to yield up his wife to his rival, but he afterwards took his revenge by
								murdering Neoptolemus at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. This
								version of the legend is followed also by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 123</bibl>. An obvious
								difficulty is presented by the narrative; for if Menelaus had given his daughter in
								marriage to Orestes, how could he afterwards have promised her to Neoptolemus in the
								lifetime of her first husband? This difficulty was met by another version of the story,
								which alleged that Hermione was betrothed
								or married to Orestes by her grandfather Tyndareus in the absence of her father
								Menelaus, who was then away at the Trojan war; that meantime, in ignorance of this
								disposal of his daughter, Menelaus had promised her hand to Neoptolemus before
								<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and that on his return from the war
								Neoptolemus took her by force from Orestes. See <bibl>Eustathius on Hom. Od. iv.3, p.

										viii.31ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Serv. A. 3.330">Serv. Verg. A. 3.330,
											compare on 297</bibl>. According to the tragic poet Philocles, not only had
								Hermione been given in marriage by Tyndareus to
								Orestes, but she was actually with child by Orestes when her father afterwards married
								her to Neoptolemus. See <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Andr. 32</bibl>. This former marriage of
								Hermione to Orestes, before she became
								the wife of Neoptolemus, is recognized by <bibl n="Verg. A. 3.330">Verg. A.
									3.330</bibl>, and <bibl>Ovid, Heroides, viii. passim</bibl>, but it is unknown to Homer.

									Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C. Pearson, vol. ii. pp. 141ff.</bibl> Euripides does not
								appear to have been consistent in his view that Neoptolemus forcibly deprived Orestes of
								Hermione and married her himself; for in
								his play Orestes &lpar;<bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1653">Eur. Or.
									1653-1657</bibl>&rpar; he makes Apollo prophesy to Orestes that he shall wed
								Hermione, but that Neoptolemus shall
								never do so.</note>; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes<pb n="255"/>at
							<placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. But some say that he went to
							<placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to demand satisfaction from Apollo
							for the death of his father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the
							temple, and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Phocian.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The murder of Neoptolemus at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, as Apollodorus observes, was variously related. According to
								Euripides, Neoptolemus paid two visits to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. On the first occasion he went to claim redress from Apollo, who had
								shot his father Achilles at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> &lpar;see

								he went to excuse himself to the god for the rashness and impiety of which he had been
								guilty in calling the deity to account for the murder; and it was then that Orestes,
								enraged at having been robbed of his wife
								Hermione by Neoptolemus, waylaid and murdered his rival in the temple of
								Apollo, the fatal blow being struck, however, not by Orestes but by &ldquo;a
								Delphian man.&rdquo; See <bibl n="Eur. Andr. 49">Eur. And. 49-55</bibl>, <bibl n="Eur. Andr. 1086">Eur. And. 1086-1165</bibl>; compare <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1656">Eur. Or. 1656ff.</bibl> This is the version of the story which Apollodorus appears to

									i.1.3</bibl>, <bibl n="Serv. A. 3.297">Serv. Verg. A. 3.297, 330</bibl>, and
								somewhat ambiguously by <bibl>Dictys Cretensis vi.12ff.</bibl> The murder of Neoptolemus
								by Orestes is mentioned, but without any motive assigned, by <bibl>Heliodorus
									ii.34</bibl> and <bibl>Justin xvii.3.7</bibl>. A different account is given by Pindar.
								He says that Neoptolemus went to consult the god at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, taking with him first-fruit offerings of the Trojan spoil; that
								there he was stabbed to death by a man in a brawl concerning the flesh of the victim,
								and that after death he was supposed to dwell within the sacred precinct and to preside
								over the processions and sacrifices in honour of heroes. See <bibl n="Pind. N. 7">Pind. N. 7.34(50)-47(70)</bibl>; compare <bibl>Pind. Pa. 6.117ff.</bibl>P The
								Scholiast on the former of these passages of Pindar, <bibl>Scholiast on Pind. Pa.
									42(62)</bibl>, explains the brawl by saying that it was the custom of the Delphians to
								appropriate &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">a(rpa/zein</foreign>&rpar; the
								sacrifices; that Neoptolemus attempted to prevent them from taking possession of his
								offerings, and that in the squabble the Delphians despatched him with their swords. This
								explanation seems to be due to Pherecydes, for a <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 1655</bibl>
								quotes the following passage from that early historian: &ldquo;When Neoptolemus
								married Hermione, daughter of Menelaus, he
								went to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to inquire about offspring;
								for he had no children by Hermione. And
								when at the oracle he saw the Delphians scrambling for &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">diarpa/zontas</foreign>&rpar; the flesh, he attempted to take it from them. But
								their priest Machaereus killed him and buried him under the threshold of the
								temple.&rdquo; This seems to have been the version of the story followed by
								Pausanias, for he mentions the hearth at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> on which the priest of Apollo slew Neoptolemus &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 10.24.4">Paus. 10.24.4</bibl>&rpar;, and elsewhere he says that
								&ldquo;the Pythian priestess ordered the Delphians to kill Pyrrhus
								&lpar;Neoptolemus&rpar;, son of Achilles&rdquo; &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 1.13.9">Paus. 1.13.9</bibl>; compare <bibl n="Paus. 4.17.4">Paus.
									4.17.4</bibl>&rpar;. That the slayer of Neoptolemus was called Machaereus is
								mentioned also by a <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Andr. 53</bibl> and by <bibl n="Strab. 9.3.9">Strab. 9.3.9</bibl>, who says that Neoptolemus was killed
								&ldquo;because he demanded satisfaction from the god for the murder of his father,
								or, more probably, because he had made an attack on the sanctuary.&rdquo; Indeed,
								Asclepiades, in his work <title>Tragodoumena</title>, wrote as follows: &ldquo;About
								his death almost all the poets agree that he was killed by Machaereus and buried at
								first under the threshold of the temple, but that afterwards Menelaus came and took up
								his body, and made his grave in the precinct. He says that Machaereus was a son of
								Daetas.&rdquo; See <bibl>Scholiast on Pind. N. 7.42(62)</bibl>. The story that
								Neoptolemus came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to plunder the
								sanctuary, which is noticed by Apollodorus and preferred by Strabo, is mentioned by
								<bibl n="Paus. 10.7.1">Paus. 10.7.1</bibl> and a <bibl>Scholiast on Pind. N. 7.58,
									Boeckh</bibl>. It is probably not inconsistent with the story that he went to demand
								satisfaction from, or to inflict punishment on, the god for the death of his father; for
								the satisfaction or punishment would naturally take the shape of a distress levied on
								the goods and chattels of the defaulting deity. The tradition that the slain Neoptolemus
								was buried under the threshold of Apollo's temple is remarkable and, so far as I
								remember, unique in Greek legend. The statement that the body was afterwards taken up
								and buried within the precinct agrees with the observation of <bibl n="Paus. 10.24.6">Paus. 10.24.6</bibl> that &ldquo;quitting the temple and turning to the left you
								come to an enclosure, inside of which is the grave of Neoptolemus, son of Achilles. The
								Delphians offer sacrifice to him annually as to a hero.&rdquo; From <bibl n="Pind. N. 7">Pind. N. 7.44(65)ff.</bibl> we learn that Neoptolemus even enjoyed a
								preeminence over other heroes at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>,
								being called on to preside over the processions and sacrifices in their honour. The
								Aenianes of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> used to send a grand
								procession and costly sacrifices to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>
								every fourth year in honour of Neoptolemus. The ceremony fell at the same time as the
								Pythian games. See <bibl>Heliodorus, Aeth. ii.34-iii.6</bibl>. It is a little difficult
								to understand how a man commonly accused of flagrant impiety and sacrilege should have
								been raised to such a pitch of glory at the very shrine which he was said to have
								attacked and robbed. The apparent contradiction might be more intelligible if we could
								suppose that, as has been suggested, Neoptolemus was publicly sacrificed as a scapegoat,
								perhaps by being stoned to death, as seems to have been the fate of the human victims at
								the Thargelia, whose sacrifice was justified by a legend that the first of their number
								had stolen some sacred cups of Apollo. See <bibl>Harpocration, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">fa/rmakos</foreign></bibl>; and as to the suggestion that Neoptolemus
								may have been sacrificed as a scapegoat, see <bibl>J. Toepffer,

								in which both combatants perished. Their bodies were buried in graves which could not be

								rivals, who had fought each other in life, might not scowl at each other in death.
								However, their rivalry did not prevent them working an oracle in partnership after their
								decease. In the second century of our era the oracle enjoyed the highest reputation for
								infallibility &lpar;<bibl n="Paus. 1.34.3">Paus. 1.34.3</bibl>&rpar;. The

								two obols, or about twopence halfpenny. See <bibl>Lucian, Alexander 19</bibl>;
								<bibl>Lucian, Deorum concilium 12</bibl>. The ancients seem to have been divided in
								opinion on the important question whether the oracular Amphilochus at <placeName key="tgn,7002594">Mallus</placeName> was the son or the grandson of Amphiaraus.
								Apollodorus calls him the son of Alcmaeon, which would make him the grandson of
								Amphiaraus, for Alcmaeon was a son of Amphiaraus. But Tzetzes, in reporting what he
								describes as the usual version of the story, calls Amphilochus the son, not the grandson

								In a little island off Cos a Greek skipper told Dr. W. H. D. Rouse a similar story about

								fisherman who, long buffeted by storms, conceived a horror of the sea, and, putting an
								oar on his shoulder, took to the hills and walked till he met a man who did not know
								what an oar was. There the prophet planted his oar in the ground, and there he resolved
								to abide. That is why all the prophet's chapels are on the tops of hills. This legend
								was published by Dr. Rouse in <title>The Cambridge Review</title> under the heading of
								&ldquo;A Greek skipper.&rdquo; This and the remaining part of Apollodorus are
								probably drawn from the epic poem <title>Telegony</title>, a work by Eugammon of
								<placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, of which a short abstract by Proclus
								has been preserved. See <bibl>Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta, ed. G. Kinkel, pp.

								the suitors &ldquo;Ulysses sacrificed to the nymphs and sailed to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> to inspect the herds. And he was entertained by
								Polyxenus and received a present of a bowl. And after that followed the episodes of
								Trophonius, and Agamedes, and Augeas. Then he sailed home to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and offered the sacrifices prescribed by
								Tiresias. And after these things he went to the Thesprotians and married Callidice,
								queen of the Thesprotians. Then the Thesprotians made war on the Brygians, under the
								leadership of Ulysses. There Ares put Ulysses and his people to flight, and Athena
								engaged him in battle; but Apollo reconciled them. And after Callidice's death,
								Polypoetes, son of Ulysses, succeeded to the kingdom, and Ulysses himself went to
								<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Meanwhile Telegonus, sailing in
								search of his father, landed in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and
								ravaged the island; and marching out to repel him Ulysses was killed by his son in
								ignorance. Recognizing his error, Telegonus transported his father's body, and
								Telemachus, and Penelope to his mother, and she made them immortal. And Telegonus
								married Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe.&rdquo; The tradition, mentioned also
								by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 127</bibl>, that one son of Ulysses &lpar;Telegonus&rpar;
								married his father's widow &lpar;Penelope&rpar;, and that another son
								&lpar;Telemachus&rpar; married his father's concubine &lpar;Circe&rpar;,
								is very remarkable, and may possibly point to an old custom according to which a son
								inherited his father's wives and concubines, with the exception of his own mother.
