<argument><p>Cneius Fulvius, pro-consul, defeated by Hannibal and slain; the consul,
Claudius Marcellus, engages him with better success. Hannibal, raising
his camp, retires; Marcellus pursues, and forces him to an engagement.
They fight twice; in the first battle, Hannibal gains the advantage; in
the second, Marcellus. Tarentum betrayed to Fabius Maximus, the
consul. Scipio engages with Hasdrubal, the son of Hamilcar, at Baetula,
in Spain, and defeats him. Among other prisoners, a youth of royal
race and exquisite beauty is taken; Scipio sets him free, and sends him,
enriched with magnificent presents, to his uncle Masinissa. Marcellus
and Quintus Crispinus, consuls, drawn into an ambuscade by Hannibal;
Marcellus is slain, Crispinus escapes. Operations by Publius Sulpicius,
praetor, against Philip and the Achaeans. A census held; the
number of citizens found to amount to one hundred and thirty-seven
thousand one hundred and eight: from which it appears how great a
loss they had sustained by the number of unsuccessful battles they had
of late been engaged in. Hasdrubal, who had crossed the Alps with a
reinforcement for Hannibal, defeated by the consuls, Marcus Livius and
Claudius Nero, and slain; with him fell fifty-six thousand men.</p></argument>



<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SUCH was the state of affairs in Spain. In Italy, the consul Marcellus, after regaining Salapia, which was betrayed into his hands, took Maronea and Meles from the Samnites by force.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As many as three thousand of the soldiers of Hannibal, which were left as a garrison, were here surprised and overpowered. The booty, and there was a considerable quantity of it, was given up to the troops. Also, two hundred and forty thousand pecks of wheat, with a hundred and ten thousand peeks of barley, were found here.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The joy, however, thus occasioned, was by no means so great as a disaster sustained a few days afterwards, not far from the town Herdonea.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Cneius Fulvius, the consul, was lying encamped there, in the hope of regaining <pb id="p.1090" n="1090"/>Herdonea, which had revolted from the Romans after the defeat at Cannae, his position being neither sufficiently secure, from the nature of the place, nor strengthened by guards.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The natural negligence of the general was now increased by the hope that their attachment to the Carthaginians was shaken, when they had heard that Hannibal, after the loss of Salapia, had retired from that neighbourhood into Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Intelligence of all these circumstances being conveyed to Hannibal by secret messengers from Herdonea, at once excited an anxious desire to retain possession of a city in alliance with him, and inspired a hope of attacking the enemy when unprepared. With a lightly equipped force he hastened to Herdonea by forced marches, so as almost to anticipate the report of his approach; and in order to strike greater terror into the enemy, came up with his troops in battle-array.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Roman, equal to him in courage, but inferior in strength, hastily drawing out his troops, engaged him.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fifth legion and the left wing of the allied infantry commenced the battle with spirit. But Hannibal ordered his cavalry, on a signal given, to ride round, as soon as the foot forces had their eyes and thoughts occupied with the contest before

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> them, and one half of them to attack the camp of the enemy, the other half to fall upon their rear, while busily engaged in fighting.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He himself, sarcastically alluding to the similarity of the name Fulvius, as he had defeated Cneius Fulvius, the praetor, two years ago, in the same country, expressed his confidence that the issue of the battle would be similar.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nor was this expectation vain; for after many of the Romans had fallen in the close contest, and in the engagement with the infantry, notwithstanding which they still preserved their ranks and stood their ground; the alarm occasioned by the cavalry on their rear, and the enemy's shout, which was heard at the same time from their camp, first put to flight the sixth legion, which being posted in the second line, was first thrown into confusion by the Numidians;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and then the fifth legion, and those who were posted in the van.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Some fled precipitately, others were slain in the middle space, where also Cneius Fulvius himself, with eleven military tribunes, fell. Who can state with certainty how many thousands of the Romans and their allies were slain in this battle, when I find in some accounts that thirteen, in others that not more than seven, thousand were slain?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The <pb id="p.1091" n="1091"/>conquerors got possession of the camp and the spoil. Finding that Herdonea would have revolted to the Romans, and was not likely to continue faithful to him if he departed thence, he removed all its inhabitants to Metapontum and Thurium, and burnt it.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He put to death the chief men who were found to have held secret conferences with Fulvius. Such of the Romans as escaped this dreadful carnage, fled half-armed, by different roads, into Samnium, to the consul Marcellus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, who was not much discouraged at this so great a disaster, sent a letter to the senate at Rome, with an account of the loss of the general and army at Herdonea;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> observing, however, <quote>that he who, after the battle of Cannae, had humbled Hannibal when elated with victory, was now marching against him, and that he would cause that his present joy and exultation should not continue long.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Rome, indeed, the grief occasioned by what had occurred, and the fears entertained for the future, were excessive.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul passing out of Samnium into Lucania, pitched his camp at Numistro, on a plain within view of Hannibal, who occupied a hill.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He added also another demonstration of his confidence; for he was the first to lead out his troops to battle, nor did Hannibal decline fighting when he saw the standards carried out from the gates. However, they drew up their forces so that the right wing of the Carthaginians was extended up the hill, while the left wing of the Romans was contiguous to the town.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For a long time neither side had any advantage; but the battle having continued from the third hour till night, and the first lines, which consisted, on the part of the Romans, of the first legion and the right wing of the allied infantry, on the part

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> of Hannibal, of the Spanish soldiers, the balearic slingers, and the elephants, which were driven into the field after the commencement of the battle, being fatigued with fighting, the first legion was relieved by the third, and the right wing of allied infantry by the left;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> while on the part of the enemy fresh troops took up the battle in place of those who were tired.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A new and desperate conflict suddenly arose, instead of that which was so feebly maintained, their minds and bodies being unimpaired by fatigue; but night separated the combatants while the victory was undecided. The following day the Romans stood drawn up for battle from sunrise till <pb id="p.1092" n="1092"/>late in the day; but none of the enemy coming out against them, they gathered the spoils at their leisure, and collecting the bodies of their own troops into a heap, burnt them.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The following night Hannibal decamped in silence, and moved off into Apulia. As soon as daylight discovered the flight of the enemy, Marcellus, leaving his wounded under the protection of a small garrison at Numistro, in command of which he placed Lucius Furius Purpureo, a military tribune, commenced a close pursuit of Hannibal, and overtook him at Venusia.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Here, during several days, parties of troops sallying from the outposts, battles took place between foot and horse promiscuously, rather irregular than important, but which for the most part were favourable to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The armies were marched thence through Apulia without any engagement worth recording; for Hannibal marched by night, seeking an opportunity for ambuscade, but Marcellus never followed him except in broad daylight, and after having explored the country.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the mean time, while Flaccus was detained at Capua in selling the property of the nobles, and letting out the lands which had been forfeited, all of which he let for a rent to be paid in corn, lest occasions for exercising severity towards the Campanians should be wanting, a new piece of iniquity, which had been ripening in secret, was brought out in evidence.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He had compelled his soldiers, withdrawn from the houses, to build for themselves huts after the military manner, near the gates and walls; at once, that the houses of the city might be let and occupied together with the land, and also through fear, lest the excessive luxury of the city should enervate his troops as it had those of Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now most of these were formed of hurdles or boards, others of reeds interwoven, all being covered with straw, as if combustible materials had been employed on purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A hundred and seventy Campanians, headed by the Blosii who were brothers, had formed a conspiracy to set fire to all these at one hour of the night;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but information of the conspiracy having been given by one of the slaves of the Blosii, the gates were suddenly closed by the command of the proconsul, and after the soldiers had been assembled under arms, on a signal given, all who were implicated in the guilt were seized, and, after a rigorous examination, were condemned and executed.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The <pb id="p.1093" n="1093"/>informers were rewarded with liberty and ten thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each. The people of Nuceria and Acerra, who complained that they had no where to dwell, Acerra being partly burnt, and Nuceria demolished, Fulvius sent to Rome to the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Permission was given to the people of Acerra to rebuild what had been destroyed by fire.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The people of Nuceria were removed to Atella, as they preferred; the people of Atella being ordered to migrate to Calatia. Among the many and important events, sometimes prosperous, sometimes adverse, which occupied men's thoughts, not even the citadel of Tarentum was forgotten.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Ogulnius and Publius Aquillius went into Etruria as commissioners to buy up corn to be conveyed to Tarentum; and one thousand men out of the city troops, an equal number of Romans and allies, were sent to the same place, together with the corn, for its protection.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The summer was now on the close, and the time for the election of consuls drew nigh; but a letter from Marcellus, in which he stated, that it would not be for the interest of the state that he should depart a single step from Hannibal, whom he was

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> severely pressing while retreating before him and evading an engagement, had excited anxiety, lest they must either recall the consul from the war at that time when he was most actively employed, or consuls should not be appointed for the year.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The best course appeared to be to recall in preference the consul Valerius from Sicily, although he was out of Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A letter was sent to him by Lucius Manlius, the city praetor, by order of the senate, together with the letter of Marcus Marcellus, the consul, that he might learn from it what reason the senate had for recalling him from his province rather than his colleague.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Much about this time ambassadors came to Rome from king Syphax with accounts of the successful battles which he had fought with the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They assured the senate that there was no people to whom the king was more hostile than the Carthaginians, and none to whom he was more friendly than the Romans. They said, that <quote>he had before sent ambassadors into Spain, to Cneius and Publius Cornelius, the Roman generals, but that he was now desirous to solicit the friendship of the Romans, as it were, from the fountain-head itself.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate not only returned a gracious answer to the ambassadors, but also sent as ambassadors to the king, with presents, Lucius Genucius, Publius P&oelig;telius, and Publius Popillius.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The presents <pb id="p.1094" n="1094"/>they carried were a purple gown and vest, an ivory chair, and a bowl formed out of five pounds of gold.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They received orders to proceed forthwith to other petty princes of Africa, carrying with them as presents for them gowns bordered with purple, and golden bowls weighing three pounds each.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcus Atilius and Manius Acilius were also sent as ambassadors to Alexandria, to king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra, to revive and renew the treaty of friendship with them, carrying with them as presents a gown and purple tunic, with an ivory chair for the king, and an embroidered gown and a purple vest for the queen. During the summer in which these transactions took place, many prodigies were reported from the country and cities in the neighbourhood; at Tusculum it was said that a lamb was yeaned with its dug full of milk; that the roof of the temple of Jupiter was struck with lightning and almost stripped of its entire covering.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Much about the same time it was reported that the ground in front of the gate at Anagnia was struck, and that it continued burning for a day and a night without any thing to feed the fire;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that at Compitum, in the territory of Anagnia, the birds had deserted their nests in the trees in the grove of Diana;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that snakes of amazing size had leaped up, like fishes sporting, in the sea at Tarricina, not far from the port;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> at Tarquinii, that a pig was produced with a human face; that in the territory of Capena, at the grove of Feronia, four statues had sweated blood profusely for a day and a night.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> These prodigies were expiated with victims of the greater kind, according to a decree of the pontiffs, and a supplication was fixed to be performed for one day at Rome at all the shrines, and another in the territory of Capena at the grove of Feronia.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>




















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcus Valerius, the consul, having been summoned by letter, gave the command of the province and his army to Cincius the praetor, sent Marcus Valerius Messala, commander of the fleet, with half of the ships to Africa, at the same time to plunder the country and observe what

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the Carthaginians were doing, and what preparations they were making, and then set out himself with ten ships for Rome; where, having arrived in safety, he immediately convened the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here he made a recital of his services. That <quote>after hostilities had been carried on, and severe losses often sustained, both by sea and land, through a period of almost sixty years, he had completely terminated the business of the province.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That <pb id="p.1095" n="1095"/>there was not one Carthaginian in Sicily, nor one Sicilian absent of those who through fear had been compelled to go into exile and live abroad;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that all of them were brought back to their cities and fields, and were employed in ploughing and sowing;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that the land which was deserted was now again inhabited, not only yielding its fruits to its cultivators, but forming a most certain resource for the supply of provisions to the Roman people in peace and war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After this, Mutines and such others as had rendered any services to the Roman people were introduced into the senate, and all received honorary rewards in fulfilment of the consul's engagement.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Mutines was also made a Roman citizen, a proposition to that effect having been made to the commons by a plebeian tribune, on the authority of the senate. While these things were going on at Rome, Marcus Valerius Messala, arriving on the coast of Africa before daylight, made a sudden descent on the territory of Utica;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and after ravaging it to a great extent, and taking many prisoners, together with booty of every kind, he returned to his ships and sailed over to Sicily. He returned to Lilybaeum on the thirteenth day from the time he left it.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From the prisoners, on examination, the following facts were discovered, and all communicated in writing to the consul Laevinus in order, so that he might know in what state the affairs of Africa were.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That "five thousand Numidians, with Masinissa, the son of Gala, a youth of extraordinary spirit, were at Carthage, and that other troops were hiring throughout all Africa, to be passed over into Spain to Hasdrubal; in order that he might, as soon as possible, pass over into Italy, with as large a force as could be collected, and form a junction with Hannibal. That the Carthaginians considered their success dependent on this measure.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That a very large fleet

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> was also in preparation for the recovery of Sicily, which they believed would sail thither in a short time.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The recital of these facts had such an effect upon the senate, that they resolved that the consul ought not to wait for the election, but that a dictator should be appointed to hold it, and that the consul should immediately return to his province.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> A difference of opinion delayed this, for the consul declared that he should nominate as dictator Marcus Valerius Messala, who then commanded the fleet in Sicily; but the fathers denied that a person could be appointed dictator who was not in the Roman territory, and this was limited by Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Marcus <pb id="p.1096" n="1096"/>Lucretius, a plebeian tribune, having taken the sense of the senate upon the question, it was decreed, <quote>that the consul, before he quitted the city, should put the question to the people, as to whom they wished to be appointed dictator, and that he should nominate whomsoever they directed. If the consul were unwilling that the praetor should put the question, and if even he were unwilling to do it, that then the tribunes should make the proposition to the commons.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The consul refusing to submit to the people what lay in his own power, and forbidding the praetor to do so, the plebeian tribunes put the question, and the commons ordered that Quintus Fulvius, who was then at Capua, should be nominated dictator.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But on the night preceding the day on which the assembly of the people was to be held for that purpose, the consul went off privately into Sicily; and the fathers, thus deserted, decreed that a letter should be sent to Marcus Claudius, in order that he might come to the support of the state, which had been abandoned by his colleague, and appoint him dictator whom the commons had ordered.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Thus Quintus Fulvius was appointed dictator by Marcus Claudius, the consul, and in conformity with the same order of the people, Publius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff, was appointed master of the horse by Quintus Fulvius, the dictator.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>




















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the dictator had arrived at Rome, he sent Cneius Sempronius Blaesus, who had acted under him as lieutenant-general at Capua, into the province of Etruria, to take the command of the army there, in the room of the praetor, Caius Calpurnius, whom he had summoned by letter to take the command of Capua and his own army.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He fixed the first day he could for the election; which, however, could not be brought to a conclusion, in consequence of a dispute which arose between the tribunes and the dictator.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The junior century of the Galerian tribe, to whose lot it fell to give their votes first, had named Quintus Fulvius and Quintus Fabius as consuls;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and the other centuries, on being called upon to vote according to their course, would have inclined the same way, had not the plebeian tribunes, Caius and Lucius Arennius, interposed.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They said, <quote>that it was hardly constitutional that a chief magistrate should be continued in office; but that it was a precedent still more shocking, that the very person who held the election should be appointed.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That, therefore, if the dictator should allow his own name to appear, <pb id="p.1097" n="1097"/>they would interpose against the election; but if the names of any other persons besides himself were put up, they should not impede it.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The dictator defended the election by the authority of the fathers, the order of the common, and precedents.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For, <quote>in the consulate of Cneius Servilius, when the other consul, Caius Flaminius, had fallen at Trasimenus, it was proposed to the people on the authority of the fathers, and the people had ordered, that as long as the war continued in Italy, it should be lawful for the people to elect to the consulship whomsoever they pleased, out of those persons who had been consuls, and as often as they pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That he had a precedent of ancient date, which was to the point, in the case of Lucius Posthumius Megellus, who, while he was interrex, had been created consul with Caius Junius Bubulcus, at an election over which he himself presided; and a precedent of recent date, in Quintus Fabius, who certainly would never have allowed himself to be re-elected, had it not been for the good of the state.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After the contest had been continued for a long time, by arguments of this kind, at length the tribunes and the dictator came to an agreement, that they should abide by what the senate should decide.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The fathers were of opinion, that such was then the condition of the

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> state, that it was necessary that its affairs should be conducted by old and experienced generals, who were skilled in the art of war; and, therefore, that no delay should take place in the election.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The tribunes then withdrew their opposition, and the election was held. Quintus Fabius Maximus was declared consul for the fifth time, and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The praetors were then created; Lucius Veturius Philo, Titus Quintus Crispinus, Caius Hostilius Tubulus, and Caius Aurunculeius. The magistrates for the year being appointed, Quintus Fulvius resigned the dictatorship. At the end of this summer, a Carthaginian fleet of forty ships, under the command of Hamilcar, passed over to Sardinia.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At first it laid waste the territory of Olbia, and then Publius Manlius Vulso, with his army, making his appearance, it sailed round thence to the other side of the island, and devastating the territory of Caralis, returned to Africa with booty of every kind.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Several Roman priests died this year, and others were substituted. Caius Servilius was appointed pontiff, in the place of Titus Otacilius Crassus. Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Tiberius, was appointed as augur, in the place of Titus <pb id="p.1098" n="1098"/>Otacilius Crassus; and Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Tiberius, was appointed decemvir for the performance of sacred rites, in the room of Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Caius.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Marcus Marcius, king of the sacred rites, and Marcus Aemilius Papus, chief curio, died; but no priests were appointed to succeed them this year. The censors this year were Lucius Veturius Philo, and Publius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Licinius Crassus had neither been consul nor praetor before he was appointed censor, he stepped from the aedileship to the censorship. These censors neither chose a senate, nor transacted any public business.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> the death of Lucius Veturius prevented it; on this Licinius also gave up his office. The curule aediles, Lucius Veturius and Publius Licinius Varus, repeated the Roman games during one day. The plebeian aediles, Quintus Catius and Lucius Porcius Licinius, furnished brazen statues for the temple of Ceres, out of the money arising from fines, and exhibited games with great pomp and splendour, considering the circumstances of the times.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the close of this year, Caius Laelius, the lieutenant-general of Scipio, came to Rome on the thirty-fourth day after he set out from Tarraco, and entering the city accompanied by a train of captives, drew together a great concourse of people.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The next day, on being brought into the senate, he stated that Carthage, the capital of Spain, had been captured in one day, that several cities which had revolted were regained, and that fresh ones had been received into alliance.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From the prisoners, information was gained, corresponding for the most part with what was contained in the letter of Marcus Valerius Messala. What produced the greatest effect upon the fathers, was the march of Hasdrubal into Italy, which was with difficulty resisting Hannibal and his forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Laelius also, who was brought before the general assembly, gave a particular statement of the same things. The senate decreed a supplication for one day, on account of the successes of Publius Scipio, and ordered Caius Laelius to return as soon as possible to Spain, with the ships he had brought with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I have laid the taking of Carthage in this year, on the authority of many writers, although aware that some have stated that it was

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> taken the following year, because it appeared to me hardly probable that Scipio should have spent an entire year in Spain in doing nothing.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quintus Fabius Maximus for the fifth time, and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth, <pb id="p.1099" n="1099"/>having entered on their offices of consuls on the ides of March, on the same day, Italy was decreed as the province of both, their command, however, was distributed to separate districts. Fabius was appointed to carry on the war at Tarentum; Fulvius in Lucania and Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Marcus Claudius was continued in command for the year. The praetors thin cast lots for their provinces. Caius Hostilius Tubulus obtained the city jurisdiction; Lucius Veturius Philo the foreign, with Gaul; Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Capua; Caius Aurunculeius, Sardinia.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The troops were thus distributed through the provinces: Fulvius received the two legions which Marcus Valerius Laevinus had in Sicily; Quintus Fabius, those which Caius Calpurnius had commanded in Etruria.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The city troops were to succeed those in Etruria; Caius Calpurnius commanding the same province and the army. Titus Quinctius was to take the command of Capua, and the army which had served under Quintus Fulvius there.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lucius Veturius was to succeed Caius Laetorius, propraetor, in his province and the command of the army, which was then at Ariminum. Marcus Marcellus had the legions with which he had been successful when consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To Marcus Valerius together with Lucius Cincius, for these also were continued in command in Sicily, the troops which had fought at Cannae were given, with orders to recruit them out of the surviving soldiers of the legions of Cneius Fulvius.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These were collected and sent by the consuls into Sicily, and the same ignominious condition of service was added, under which the troops which had fought at Cannae served, and to those troops belonging to the army of Cneius Fulvius, the praetor, which had been sent thither by the senate through displeasure occasioned by a similar flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Caius Aurunculeius was appointed to command, in Sardinia, the same legions with which Publius Manlius Vulso had occupied that province.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Publius Sulpicius was continued in command for the year, with orders to hold Macedonia with the same legion and fleet. Orders were given to send thirty quinqueremes from Sicily to Tarentum, to the consul Fabius.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> With the rest of the ships, orders were given that Marcus Valerius Laevinus should either pass over himself into Africa to ravage the country, or send either Lucius Cincius or Marcus Valerius Messala.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> With regard to Spain, no alteration was made, except that Scipio and Silanus were continued in command, not for the year, but until they <pb id="p.1100" n="1100"/>should be recalled by the senate. In such manner were the provinces and the commands of the armies distributed for this year.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>




















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amid concerns of greater importance, an old dispute was revived at the election of a chief curio, when a priest was appointed to succeed Marcus Aemilius;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the patricians denying that Caius Mamilius Vitulus, who was a plebeian candidate, ought to be allowed to stand, because no one before his time had held that priesthood who was not a patrician. The tribunes, on being appealed to, referred the matter to the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate left it to the decision of the people. Thus Caius Mamilius Vitulus was the first plebeian created chief curio.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Publius Licinius, chief pontiff, compelled Caius Valerius Flaccus to be inaugurated flamen of Jupiter, against his will. Caius Valerius Laetorius was created decemvir for the performance of sacred rites, in the room of Quintus Mucius Scaevola, deceased. I should willingly have passed over in silence the reason of a flamen's being compelled to be inaugurated, had he not become a good, from having been a bad character.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In consequence of having spent his youth in idleness and debauchery, vices for which he had incurred the displeasure of his own brother, Lucius Flaccus, and the rest of his kinsmen, Caius Flaccus was chosen flamen by Publius Licinius, chief pontiff.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As soon as his mind became occupied with the care of the sacred rites and ceremonies, he soon so completely divested himself of his former habits, that no one among all the youth was more esteemed, or enjoyed in a greater degree the approbation of the chief of the patricians, whether relations or aliens.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Being raised by this general good character to a proper confidence in himself, he claimed to be admitted into the senate; a thing intermitted for many years, on account of the worthlessness of former flamens.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On entering the senate, Lucius Licinius, the praetor, led him out; on which the flamen appealed to the tribunes of the people. He demanded back the ancient privilege of his priesthood, which was given, together with the purple-bordered robe, and the curule chair, to the office of flamen.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The praetor wished the question to rest not on the precedents contained in the annals, which were obsolete from their antiquity, but on the usual practice in all the cases of most recent date; urging, that no flamen of Jupiter, in the memory of their fathers or their grandfathers, had taken up that privilege.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The tribunes <pb id="p.1101" n="1101"/>giving it as their opinion, that justice required, that as the obliteration of the privilege was occasioned by the negligence of the flamens, the consequences ought to fall upon the flamens themselves, and not upon the office, led the flamen into the senate, with the general approbation of the fathers, and without any opposition, even from the praetor himself;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> while all were of opinion that the flamen had obtained his object more from the purity of his life, than any right appertaining to the priesthood. The consuls, before they departed to their provinces, raised two legions for the city, and as many soldiers as were necessary to make up the numbers of the other armies.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consul Fulvius appointed his brother, Caius Fulvius Flaccus, lieutenant-general, to march the old city army into Etruria, and to bring to Rome the legions which were in Etruria.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And the consul Fabius ordered his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus, to lead the remains of the army of Fulvius, which had been collected, amounting to three thousand three hundred and thirty-six, into Sicily to Marcus Valerius, the proconsul, and to receive from him two legions and thirty quinqueremes.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The withdrawing of these legions from the island did not at all diminish the force employed for the protection of that province, either in effect or appearance;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> for though, in addition to two veteran legions which were most effectively reinforced, he had a great number of Numidian deserters, both horse and foot, he raised also a body of Sicilian troops, consisting of men who had served in the armies of Epicydes and the Carthaginians, and were experienced in war.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Having added these foreign auxiliaries to each of the Roman legions, he preserved the appearance of two armies. With one he ordered Lucius Cinctius to protect that portion of the island which had formed the kingdom of Hiero, with the other he himself guarded the rest of the island, which was formerly divided by the boundary of the Roman and Carthaginian dominions.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> He divided also the fleet of seventy ships, in order that it might protect the sea-coast, through the entire extent of its shores.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> He himself went through the island with the cavalry of Mutines to inspect the lands, observe those which were cultivated and those which were not, and, accordingly, either praise or reprove the owners.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> By this diligence so large a quantity of corn was produced, that he both sent some to Rome, and collected at Catana corn which might serve as a <pb id="p.1102" n="1102"/>supply for the army, which was about to pass the summer at Tarentum.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the transportation of the soldiers into Sicily, and they consisted chiefly of Latins and allies, had very nearly caused a serious commotion; from such trifling circumstances do events of great importance frequently arise.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A murmuring arose among the Latins and allies at their meetings. They said, that <quote>they had been drained by levies and contributions for ten years. That almost every year they fought with the most disastrous consequences.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That some of them were slain in the field, others were carried off by disease. That a countryman of theirs who was enlisted by the Romans, was more lost to them than one who was taken prisoner by the Carthaginians; for the latter was sent back to his country by the enemy without ransom, while the former was sent beyond the limits of Italy, into exile rather than military service.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That the troops which fought at Cannae were growing old there, for eight years, and would die there before the enemy, who was now more than ever flourishing and vigorous, would depart from Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If the old soldiers did not return to their country, and fresh ones were enlisted, that in a short time there would be no one left. That, therefore, they must refuse to the Roman people, before they came to utter desolation and want, what shortly their very condition would refuse.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If the Romans saw their allies unanimous on this point, that they would then certainly think of making peace with the Carthaginians; otherwise, Italy would never be without war while Hannibal was alive.</quote> Thus they discoursed in their meetings. The Roman people had at that time thirty colonies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Twelve of these, for they all had embassies at Rome, told the consuls that they had not whence to furnish either men or money. The twelve were, Ardea, Nepete, Sutrium, Alba, Carseoli, Cora, Suessa, Cerceii, Setia, Cales, Narnia, Interamna.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls, astonished at this new proceeding, were desirous to deter them from so hateful a measure; and, considering that they could effect this better by censure and remonstrance than by mild means, said that <quote>they had dared to say to the consuls what the consuls could not bring their minds to declare in the senate; for that this was not a refusal to perform military service, but an open defection from the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They desired, therefore, that they <pb id="p.1103" n="1103"/>would return to their colonies speedily, and

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> that, considering the subject as untouched, as they had only spoken of, but not attempted, so impious a business, they would consult with their countrymen.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That they would warn them that they were not Campanians or Tarentines, but Romans; that from thence they derived their origin, and thence were sent out into colonies and lands captured from the enemy, for the purpose of increasing the population. That they owed to the Romans what children owed to parents, if they possessed any natural affection, or any gratitude towards their mother country.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That they should, therefore, consider the matter afresh; for that certainly what they then so rashly meditated, was the betraying the Roman empire, and putting the victory in the hands of Hannibal.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consuls having spent a long time in exchanging arguments of this kind, the ambassadors, who were not at all moved by what they said, declared, that <quote>they had nothing which they could carry home, nor had their senate any thing fresh to devise, having neither men to be enlisted, nor money to be furnished for pay.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consuls, seeing that they were inflexible, laid the matter before the senate; where the alarm excited in the minds of all was so great, that <quote>the greater part declared it was all over with the empire; that the rest of the colonies would take the same course, and that all the allies had conspired to betray the city of Rome to Hannibal.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls endeavoured to encourage and console the senate, telling them that <quote>the other colonies would maintain their allegiance, and continue in their former state of dutiful obedience, and that those very colonies who had renounced their allegiance, would be inspired with respect for the empire, if ambassadors were sent round to them to reprove and not entreat them.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate having given them permission to do and to act as they might conceive best for the state; after sounding the intentions of the other colonies, the consuls summoned their ambassadors, and asked them whether they had their soldiers ready according to the roll?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcus Sextilius of Fregellae replied, in behalf of the eighteen colonies, that <quote>they both had their soldiers ready according to the roll, and if more were wanting would furnish more, and would perform with all diligence whatever else the Roman people commanded and wished;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that to do this they wanted not means, and of inclination they had more than enough.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.1104" n="1104"/>The consuls, having first told them that any praises bestowed by themselves alone seemed too little for their deserts, unless the whole body of the fathers should thank them in the senate-house, led them before the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate, having voted an address to them conceived in the most honourable terms, charged the consuls to take them before the assembly of the people; and, among the many other distinguished services rendered to themselves and their ancestors, to make mention also of this recent obligation conferred upon the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor even at the present day, after the lapse of so many ages, let their names be passed over in silence, nor let them be defrauded of the praise due to them. They were the people of Signia, Norba, Saticulum, Brundusium, Fregellae, Luceria, Venusia, Adria, Firma, Ariminum; on the other sea, Pontia, Paestum, and Cosa; and in the inland parts, Beneventum, Aesernia, Spoletum, Placentia, and Cremona.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By the support of these colonies the empire of the Roman people then stood; and the thanks both of the senate and the people were given to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As to the twelve other colonies which refused obedience, the fathers forbade that their names should be mentioned, that their ambassadors should either be dismissed or retained, or be addressed by the consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Such a tacit reproof appeared most consistent with the dignity of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While the consuls were getting in readiness all the other things which were necessary for the war, it was resolved that the vicesimary gold, which was preserved in the most sacred part of the treasury as a resource in cases of extreme exigency, should be drawn out.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There were drawn out as many as four thousand pounds of gold, from which five hundred pounds each were given to the consuls, to Marcus Marcellus and Publius Sulpicius, proconsuls, and Lucius Veturnius, the praetor, who had by lot obtained Gaul as his province; and in addition, one hundred pounds of gold were given to the consul Fabius, as an extraordinary grant to be carried into the citadel of Tarentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The rest they employed in contracts, for ready money, for clothing for the army which was carrying on the war in Spain, to their own and their general's glory.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was resolved also, that the prodigies should be expiated before the consuls set out from the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the Alban mount, the statue of Jupiter and a tree near the temple were struck by lightning; at Ostia, a grove; at Capua, a wall and <pb id="p.1105" n="1105"/>the temple of Fortune; at Sinuessa, a wall and a gate.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some also asserted, that water at Alba had flowed tinged with blood. That at Rome, within the cell of Fors Fortuna, an image, which was in the crown of the goddess, had fallen spontaneously from her head into her hands. At Privernum, it was satisfactorily established that an ox spoke, and that a vulture flew down into a shop, while the forum was crowded.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And that a child was born at Sinuessa, of ambiguous sex, between a male and female, such as are commonly called Androgynes, a term derived from the Greek language, which is better adapted, as for most other purposes, so for the composition of words;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> also that it rained milk, and that a boy was born with the head of an elephant.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These prodigies were then expiated with victims of the larger kind, and a supplication at every shrine, and an offering up of prayers, was proclaimed for one day. It was also decreed, that Caius Hostilius, the praetor, should vow and perform the games in honour of Apollo as they had of late years been vowed and performed.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During the same time, Quintus Fulvius, the consul, held an election for the creation of censors. Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, both of whom had not yet been consuls, were created censors. The question was put to the people on the authority of the fathers, and the people ordered that these censors should let to farm the Campanian lands.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The choosing of the senate was delayed by a dispute which arose between the censors about the selection of a chief of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The choice belonged to Sempronius; but Cornelius contended that the custom handed down by their fathers must

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> be followed, which was, that they should choose him as chief of the senate who was first censor of those who were then alive; this was Titus Manlius Torquatus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Sempronius rejoined, that to whom the gods had given the lot of choosing, to him the same gods had given the right of exercising his discretion freely. That he would act in this affair according to his own free will, and would choose Quintus Fabius Maximus, whom he would prove to be the first ma in the Roman state, even in the judgment of Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After a long verbal dispute, his colleague giving up the point, Quintus Fabius Maximus, the consul, was chosen, by Sempronius, chief of the senate. Another senate was then chosen, and eight names were passed over; among which was that of <pb id="p.1106" n="1106"/>Lucius Caecilius Metellus, disrespected as the adviser of the abandonment of Italy, after the defeat at Cannae. In censuring those of the equestrian order, the same ground was acted upon, but there were very few to whom that disgrace belonged.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> All of the equestrian order belonging to the legions who had fought at Cannae, and were then in Sicily, were deprived of their horses.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> To this severe punishment they added another relating to time, which was, that the past campaigns which they had served on horses furnished at the public expense should not be reckoned to them, but that they should serve ten campaigns on horses furnished at their own expense.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> They also searched for, and discovered, a great number of those who ought to have served in the cavalry; and all those who were seventeen years old at the beginning of the war, and had not served, they disfranchised.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They then contracted for the restoration of the seven shops, the shambles, and the royal palace, situated round the forum, and which had been consumed by fire.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having finished every thing which was to be done at Rome, the consuls set out for the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fulvius first went in advance to Capua; in a few days Fabius followed. He had implored his colleague in person, and Marcellus by a letter, to use the most vigorous measures to detain Hannibal, while he was making an attack upon Tarentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That when that city was taken from the enemy, who had been repulsed on all sides, and had no place where he might make a stand or look back upon as a safe retreat, he would not then have even a pretext for remaining in Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He also sent a messenger to Rhegium, to the prefect of the garrison, which had been placed there by the consul Laevinus, against the Bruttians, and consisted of eight thousand men, the greater part of whom had been brought from Agathyrna in Sicily, as has been before mentioned, and were men who had been accustomed to live by rapine.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To these were added fugitives of the Bruttians, natives of that country, equal to them in daring, and under an equal necessity of braving every thing.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This band he ordered to be marched, first, to lay waste the Bruttian territory, and then to attack the city Caulonia. After having executed the order, not only with alacrity, but avidity, and having pillaged and put to flight the cultivators of the land, they attacked the city with the utmost vigour.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcellus, <pb id="p.1107" n="1107"/>incited by the letter of the consul, and because he had made up his mind that no Roman general was so good a match for Hannibal as himself, set out from his winter quartets as soon as there was plenty of forage in the fields, and met Hannibal at Canusium. The Carthaginian was then endeavouring to induce the Canusians to revolt, but as soon as he heard that Marcellus was approaching, he decamped thence.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The country was open, without any covers adapted for an ambuscade; he therefore began to retire thence into woody districts. Marcellus closely pursued him, pitched his camp close to his, and when he had completed his works, led out his troops into the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hannibal engaged in slight skirmishes, and sent out single troops of horse and the spearmen from his infantry, not considering it necessary to hazard a general battle. He was, however, drawn on to a contest of that kind which he was avoiding.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hannibal had decamped by night, but was overtaken by Marcellus in a plain and open country. Then, while encamping, Marcellus, by attacking the workmen on all hands, prevented the completion of his works. Thus a pitched battle ensued, and all their forces were brought into action; but night coming on, they retired from an equal contest. They then hastily fortified their camps, which were a small space apart, before night.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day, as soon as it was light, Marcellus led out his troops into the field; nor did Hannibal decline the challenge, but exhorted his soldiers at great length, desiring them <quote>to remember Trasimenus and Cannae, and thus quell the proud spirit of their enemies.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He said, <quote>the enemy pressed upon him, and trod upon their heels; that he did not allow them to pass unmolested, pitch their camp, or even take breath and look around them; that every day, the rising sun and the Roman troops in battle-array were to be seen together on the plains. But if in one battle he should retire from the field, not without loss of blood, he would then prosecute the war more steadily and quietly.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Fired by these exhortations, and at the same time wearied with the presumption of the enemy, who daily pressed upon them and provoked them to an engagement, they commenced the battle with spirit.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The battle continued for more than two hours, when the right wing of the allies and the chosen band began to give way on the part of the Romans; which Marcellus perceiving, led the eighteenth legion to the front.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> While some were retiring in <pb id="p.1108" n="1108"/>confusion, and others were coming up reluctantly, the whole line was thrown into disorder, and afterwards completely routed; while their fears getting the better of their sense of shame, they turned their backs.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In the battle and in the flight there fell as many as two thousand seven hundred of citizens and allies; among which were four Roman centurions, and two military tribunes, Marcus Licinius and Marcus Helvius.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Four military standards were lost by the wing which first fled, and two belonging to the legion which came up in place of the retiring allies.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, on his return to the camp, delivered an address to his soldiers so severe and acrimonious, that the words of their exasperated general were more painful to them than what they had suffered in the unsuccessful battle during the whole day.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>I praise and thank the immortal gods,</quote> said he, <quote>that in such an affair the victorious enemy did not assault our very camp, when you were hurrying into the rampart and the gates with such consternation. There can be no doubt but you would have abandoned the camp with the same cowardice with which you gave up the battle. What panic is this? What terror?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What sudden forgetfulness of who you are, and who the persons with whom you were fighting, took possession of your minds? Surely these are the same enemies in conquering and pursuing whom when conquered you spent the preceding summer; whom latterly you have been closely pursuing while they fled before you night and day;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> whom you have wearied by partial battles; whom yesterday you would not allow either to march or encamp. I pass over those things in which you might be allowed to glory; I will mention a circumstance which of itself ought to fill you with shame and remorse.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Yesterday you separated from the enemy on equal terms. What alteration has last night, what has this day, produced?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Have your forces been diminished by them, or theirs increased? I verily do not seem to be talking to my own troops, or to Roman soldiers. The bodies only and the arms are the same. Had you possessed the same spirit, would the enemy have seen your backs? Would he have carried off a standard from any company or cohort?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hitherto he was wont to boast of having cut to pieces the Roman legions, but yesterday you gave him the glory, for the first time, of having put to flight an army.</quote> On this, the <pb id="p.1109" n="1109"/>soldiers began to call upon him to pardon them for that day, and entreat that he would now, whenever he pleased, make trial of the courage of his soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <quote>I will indeed make trial of you,</quote> said he, <quote>and to-morrow I will lead you into the field, that in the character of conquerors, rather than conquered men, you may obtain the pardon you seek.</quote> To the cohorts which had lost their standards, he ordered that barley should be given.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The centurions of the Campanians, whose standards were lost, he left to stand without their girdles and with their swords drawn; and gave orders that all, both horse and foot, should be ready under arms on the following day.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus the assembly was dismissed; the soldiers confessing that they had been justly and deservedly rebuked; and that there was no one in the whole Roman army who had acquitted himself like a man, except the general, to whom they were bound to make atonement, either by their death or a glorious victory. The next day they appeared in readiness, according to the order, armed and equipped.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The general praised them, and gave out, that <quote>he should lead into the first line those who had commenced the flight on the preceding day, and those cohorts which had lost their standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He now charged them all to fight and conquer, and exert every efforts one and all, that the intelligence of yesterday's flight might not arrive at Rome before that of this day's victory.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They were then ordered to refresh themselves with food, in order that, if the fight should continue longer than might be expected, their strength might not fail. After every thing had been done and said, by which the courage of the soldiers might be roused, they advanced into the field.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, on receiving intelligence of this, said, <quote>surely the enemy we have to do with can neither bear good nor bad fortune. If he is victorious, he fiercely pursues the vanquished. If conquered, he renews the contest with the victors.</quote> He then ordered the signal to be given, and led out his forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The battle was fought on both sides with much more spirit than the day before. The Carthaginians exerting themselves to the utmost, to keep the glory they had acquired yesterday; the Romans, to remove their disgrace.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the side of the Romans, the left wing, and the cohorts which had lost their standards, fought in the first line, and the twentieth legion was drawn up on the right wing.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lucius Cornelius <pb id="p.1110" n="1110"/>Lentulus and Caius Claudius Nero, lieutenant-generals, commanded the wings, Marcellus gave vigour to the centre by his presence, as an encourager and a witness. On the part of Hannibal, the Spaniards, who were the flower of his whole army, occupied the front line.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After the battle had continued doubtful for a long time, Hannibal ordered the elephants to be advanced into the front line, if by that means any confusion or panic could be created.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first, they threw the troops into confusion and broke their ranks, and treading some under foot, and dispersing others who were round

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> them by the alarm they created, had made an opening in one part of the Roman line; and the flight would have spread more widely had not Caius Decimus Flavius, a military tribune, seizing the standard of the first maniple of the spearmen, ordered that maniple to follow him.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He led them to the spot where the elephants, collected in a body, were creating the greatest confusion, and ordered them to discharge their javelins at them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As there was no difficulty in hitting such bulky bodies at a short distance, and where so many were crowded together, all their javelins stuck in them. But as they were not all wounded, so those in whose hides the javelins stuck, as that race of animals is not to be depended on, betaking themselves to flight, drove away those also which were untouched.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At that moment not only one maniple, but all the soldiers who could but overtake the body of retreating elephants, threw their javelins at them, each man exerting himself to his utmost. With so much greater impetuosity did the animals rush upon their own men, and so much greater a carnage did they make amongst them than they had made amongst their enemies, in proportion as the violence with which they are impelled, and the consternation produced in them when under the influence of fear, is greater than when they are ruled by their masters seated on their backs.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Roman infantry bore their standards against the line of the enemy when thrown

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> into disorder by the elephants which had crossed over to them, and, thus scattered and confused, put them to flight without any great opposition. Marcellus then sent his cavalry after them as they fled; nor did they desist from the pursuit till they were driven in consternation to their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For in addition to the other causes which had occasioned terror and dismay, two elephants had fallen just in <pb id="p.1111" n="1111"/>the gate, and the soldiers were compelled to rush into the camp over the ditch and rampart. Here the greatest slaughter of the enemy occurred.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There fell as many as eight thousand men and five elephants. Nor did the Romans gain a bloodless victory; about seventeen hundred of the two legions, and thirteen hundred of the allies, were slain; a great number of the Romans and allies were wounded.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The following night Hannibal decamped. The great number of the wounded prevented Marcellus from following him, as he desired.</p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The spies who were sent to watch his movements brought word back the next day that Hannibal was making for Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Much about the same time the Hirpinians, Lucanians, and Volcentes surrendered themselves to the consul, Quintus Fulvius, delivering up the garrisons of Hannibal which they had in their cities. They were mildly received by the consul, with only a verbal reproof for their past error.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the Bruttians also similar hopes of pardon were held out, when two brothers, Vibius and Pactius, by far the most illustrious persons of that nation, came from them to solicit the same terms of surrender which had been given to the Lucanians. Quintus Fabius, the consul, took by storm Manduria, a town in the territory of Sallentum, where as many as four thousand men were made prisoners, and much booty taken besides.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Proceeding thence to Tarentum, he pitched his camp in the very mouth of the harbour: of the ships which Livius had employed for protecting convoys, some he loaded with engines and implements for attacking walls, others he furnished with machines for discharging missiles, and with stones and missiles of every kind;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> not only those which were impelled with oars, but the storeships also, in order that some might carry the engines and ladders to the

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> walls, while others might wound the defenders of the walls by discharging missiles from the ships at a distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These ships were fitted up and prepared to attack the town from the open sea; and the sea was free from the Carthaginian fleet, which had crossed over to Corcyra on account of Philip's preparing to attack the Aetolians. Meanwhile, those who were attacking Caulon, in the territory of Bruttium, fearful lest they should be overpowered, had retired on the approach of Hannibal to an eminence, secure from an immediate attack.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While <pb id="p.1112" n="1112"/>Fabius was besieging Tarentum, he received assistance in the accomplishment of that great object by a circumstance which, in the mere mention, is unimportant.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Tarentum was occupied by a garrison of Bruttians, given them by Hannibal; the commander of that garrison was desperately in love with a girl, whose brother was in the army of the consul Fabius.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Being informed, by a letter from his sister, of the new acquaintance she had formed with a wealthy stranger and one so honoured among his countrymen, and conceiving a hope that the lover, by means of his sister, might be induced to any thing she pleased, he acquainted the consul with the hopes he had formed.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> His reasoning appeared not altogether unfounded, and he was desired to go to Tarentum as a deserter; and having gained the confidence of the prefect by means of his sister, he began by sounding his disposition in a covert manner, and then, having sufficiently ascertained his weakness, induced him, by the aid of female fascinations, to the betrayal of that custody of the place to which he was appointed.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After the method to be pursued and the time for putting the plan into effect had been agreed upon, a soldier, who was sent out of the city by night clandestinely, through the intervals between the guards, related to the consul what had been done, and what had been agreed upon to be done.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At the first watch, Fabius, on a signal given to those who were in the citadel, and those who had the custody of the harbour, went himself round the harbour, and took up a position in concealment, on the side of the city which faced the east.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then the trumpets began to sound at once from the citadel, the harbour, and the ships which had been brought to the shore from the open sea, and a shout was purposely raised, accompanied with the greatest confusion, in whatever quarter there was the least danger. Meanwhile, the consul kept his men in silence.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Democrates, therefore, who had formerly commanded the fleet, and happened to be in command in that quarter, seeing that all was quiet around him, while other parts of the city resounded with such a din that sometimes a shout like that of a captured city was raised, and fearing lest, while he hesitated, the consul should make some attack and

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> advance his standards, led his party over to the citadel, from which the most alarming noise proceeded. Fabius, concluding that the guard was withdrawn, both from the time which had <pb id="p.1113" n="1113"/>elapsed and from the silence

<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> which prevailed, for not a voice met the ear from a quarter where a little while ago the noise and bustle of men resounded, rousing and calling each other to arms, ordered the ladders to be carried to that part of the wall where the person who had contrived the plot or betraying the city, had informed him that the Bruttian cohort kept guard.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The wall was first captured in that quarter, the Bruttians aiding and receiving the Romans; and here they got over into the city: after which the nearest gate was broken open in order that the troops might enter in a large body.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Then raising a shout, they proceeded to the forum, where they arrived much about daybreak, without meeting a single armed man; and drew upon themselves the attention of all the troops in every quarter, which were fighting at the citadel and at the harbour.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A battle was fought in the entrance of the forum, with greater impetuosity than perseverance. The Tarentines were not equal to the Romans in spirit, in their arms, in tactics, in activity or strength of body.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, having just discharged their javelins, they turned their backs almost before they had joined battle, and escaped in different directions through the streets of the city, with which they were acquainted, to their own houses and those of their friends. Two of their leaders, Nico and Democrates, fell while fighting bravely.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philomenus, who was the author of the plot for betraying the city to Hannibal, rode away from the battle at full speed. Shortly after, his horse, which was loose and straying through the city, was recognised, but his body could not be found any where. It was generally believed that he had pitched headlong from his horse into an open well.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Carthalo, the praefect of the Carthaginian garrison, while coming to

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the consul unarmed, to put him in mind of a connexion of hospitality which subsisted between their fathers, was put to death by a soldier who met him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The rest were put to the sword on all hands, armed and unarmed indiscriminately, Carthaginians and Tarentines without distinction. Many of the Bruttians also were slain either by mistake or on account of an old grudge entertained against them, or else with a view to the report that the city was betrayed; in order that Tarentum might rather appear to have been captured by force of arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The troops then ran off in all directions from the slaughter, to <pb id="p.1114" n="1114"/>plunder the city. Thirty thousand slaves are said to have been captured; an immense quantity of silver, wrought and coined; eighty-three thousand pounds of gold; of statues and pictures so many that they almost equalled the decorations of Syracuse.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But Fabius, with more magnanimity than Marcellus, abstained from booty of that kind. When his secretary asked him what he wished to be done with the statues of their gods, which are of immense size and represented as fighting, each having his peculiar habit, he gave orders that their angry gods should be left in the possession of the Tarentines.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After this, the wall which separated the city from the citadel was razed and demolished. While things were going on thus at Tarentum, Hannibal, to whom the troops engaged in the siege of Caulonia had surrendered themselves, hearing of the siege of Tarentum, marched with the greatest expedition both night and day; but hearing that the city was taken, as he was hastening to bring assistance to it, he exclaimed, <quote>the Romans too have their Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> We have lost Tarentum by the same arts by which we took it.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> However, that he might not appear to have turned his army in the manner of a fugitive, he encamped where he had halted, about five miles from the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After staying there a few days, he retired to Metapontum, from which place he sent two Metapontines with letters from the principal men in the state to Fabius at Tarentum, to the effect, that they would accept of his promise that their past conduct should be unpunished, on condition of their betraying Metapontum together with the Carthaginian garrison into his hands.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Fabius, who supposed that the communication they brought was genuine, appointed a day on which he would go to Metapontum, and gave the letters to the nobles, which were put into the hands of Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He, forsooth, delighted at the success of his stratagem, which showed that not even Fabius was proof against his cunning, planted an ambuscade not far from Metapontum.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But when Fabius was taking the auspices, before he took his departure from Tarentum, the birds more than once refused approval. Also, on consulting the gods after sacrificing a victim, the aruspex forewarned him to be on his guard against hostile treachery and ambuscade.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> After the day fixed for his arrival had passed without his coming, the Metapontines were sent again to encourage him, delaying, but they were instantly seized, and, from ap- <pb id="p.1115" n="1115"/>prehension of a severer mode of examination, disclosed the plot.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the summer during which these events occurred, after Publius Scipio had employed the whole of the winter in Spain in regaining the affections of the barbarians, partly by presents, and partly by sending home their hostages and prisoners, Edesco, a man distinguished among the Spanish commanders, came to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His wife land children were in the hands of the Romans; but besides this motive, he was influenced by that apparently fortuitous turn in the state of feeling which had converted the whole of Spain from the Carthaginian to the Roman cause.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The same motive induced Indibilis and Mandonius, who were undoubtedly the principal men in all Spain, to desert Hasdrubal and withdraw with the whole body of their countrymen to the eminences which overhung his camp, from which they had a safe retreat along a chain of hills to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hasdrubal, perceiving that the strength of the enemy was increasing by such large accessions, while his own was diminishing, and that events would continue to flow in the same course they had taken, unless by a bold effort he effected some alteration, resolved to come to an engagement as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Scipio was still more eager for a battle, as well from hope which the success attending his operations had increased, as because he preferred, before the junction of the enemy's forces, to fight with one general and one army, rather than with their united troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> However, in case he should be obliged to fight with more armies than one at the same time, he had with some ingenuity augmented his forces; for seeing that there was no necessity for ships, as the whole coast of Spain was clear of Carthaginian fleets, he hauled his ships on shore at Tarraco and added his mariners to his land forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He had plenty of arms for them, both those which had been captured at Carthage, and those which he had caused to be made after its capture, so large a number of workmen having been employed.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With these forces, setting out from Tarraco at the commencement of the spring, for Laelius had now returned from Rome, without whom he wished nothing of very great importance to be attempted, Scipio marched against the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Indibilis and Mandonius, with their forces, met him while on his march; passing through every place without molestation, his allies receiving him courteously, and <pb id="p.1116" n="1116"/>escorting him as he passed the boundaries of each district.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Indibilis, who spoke for both, addressed him by no means stupidly and imprudently like a barbarian, but with a modest gravity, rather excusing the change as necessary, than glorying that the present opportunity had been eagerly seized as the first which had occurred.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>For he well knew,</quote> he said, <quote>that the name of a deserter was an object of execration to former allies, and of suspicion to new ones; nor did he blame the conduct of mankind in this respect, provided, however, that the cause, and not the name, occasioned the twofold hatred.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then recounted the services they had rendered the Carthaginian generals, and on the other hand their rapacity and insolence, together with the injuries of every kind committed against themselves and their countrymen. <quote>On this account,</quote> he said, <quote>his person only up to that time had been with them, his heart had long since been on that side where he believed that right and justice were respected.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That people sought for refuge, as suppliants, even with the gods when they could not endure the oppression and injustice of men.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What he had to entreat of Scipio was, that their passing over to him might neither be the occasion of a charge of fraud nor a ground for respect, but that he would estimate their services according to what sort of men he should find them to be from experience from that day.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Roman replied, that <quote>he would do so in every particular; nor would he consider those men as deserters who did not look upon an alliance as binding where no law, divine or human, was unviolated.</quote> Their wives and children were then brought before them and restored to them; on which occasion they wept for joy.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> On that day they were conducted to a lodging; on the following they were received as allies, by a treaty, after which they were sent to bring up their forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> From that time they had their tents in the same camp with the Romans, until under their guidance they had reached the enemy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The army of Hasdrubal, which was the nearest of the Carthaginian armies, lay near the city Baecula.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before his camp he had outposts of cavalry. On these the light-armed, those who fought before the standards and those who composed the vanguard, as they came up from their march, and before they chose the ground for their camp, commenced an attack in so contemptuous a manner, that it was perfectly evi- <pb id="p.1117" n="1117"/>dent what degree of spirit each party possessed.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The cavalry were driven into their camp in disorderly flight, and the Roman standards were advanced almost within their very gates.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their minds on that day having only been excited to a contest, the Romans pitched their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At night Hasdrubal withdrew his forces to an eminence, on the summit of which extended a level plain. There was a river on the rear, in front and on either side a kind of steep bank completely surrounded its extremity.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Beneath this and lower down was another plain of gentle declivity, which was also surrounded by a similar ridge equally difficult of ascent.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Into this lower plain Hasdrubal, the next day, when he saw the troops of the enemy drawn up before their camp, sent his Numidian cavalry and light-armed Baleares. Scipio riding out to the companies and battalions, pointed out to them, that "the enemy having abandoned, beforehand, all hope of being able to withstand them on level ground, had resorted to hills; where they stood in view, relying on the strength of their position, and not on their valour and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the walls of Carthage, which the Roman soldiers had scaled, were still higher. That neither hills, nor a citadel, nor even the sea itself, had formed an impediment to their arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That the heights which the enemy had occupied would only have the effect of making it necessary for them to leap down crags and precipices in their flight, but he would even cut off that kind of retreat.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He accordingly gave orders to two cohorts, that one of them should occupy the entrance of the valley down which the river ran, and that the other should block up the road which led from the city into the country, over the side of the hill. He himself led the light troops, which the day before had driven in the advanced guard of the enemy, against the light-armed troops which were stationed on the lower ridge.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At first they marched through rugged ground, impeded by nothing except the road; afterwards, when they came within reach of the darts, an immense quantity of weapon of every description was showered upon them;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> while on their part, not only the soldiers, but a multitude of servants mingled with the troops, threw stones furnished by the place, which were spread about in every part, and for the most part convenient as missiles.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But though the ascent was difficult, and they were almost overwhelmed with stones and darts, yet from their practice in approaching walls and their inflexibility of <pb id="p.1118" n="1118"/>mind, the foremost succeeded in getting up.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> These, as soon as they got upon some level ground and could stand with firm footing, compelled the enemy, who were light-armed troops adapted for skirmishing, and could defend themselves at a distance, where an elusive kind of fight is carried on by the discharge of missiles, but yet wanted steadiness for a close action, to fly from their position; and, killing a great many, drove them to the troops which stood above them on the higher eminence.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Upon this Scipio, having ordered the victorious troops to mount up and attack the centre of the enemy, divided the rest of his forces with Laelius; whom he directed to go round the hill to the right till he could find a way of easier ascent, while he himself, making a small circuit to the left, charged the enemy in flank.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In consequence of this their line was first thrown into confusion, while they endeavoured to wheel round and face about their ranks towards the shouts which resounded from every quarter around them.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> During this confusion Laelius also came up, and while the enemy were retreating, that they might not be exposed to wounds from behind, their front line became disjoined, and a space was left for the Roman centre to mount up;

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> who, from the disadvantage of the ground, never could have done so had their ranks stood unbroken with the elephants stationed in front.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> While the troops of the enemy were being slain on all sides, Scipio, who with his left wing had charged the right of the enemy, was chiefly employed in attacking their naked flank.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> And now there was not even room to fly; for parties of the Roman troops had blocked up the roads on both sides, right and left, and the gate of the camp was closed by the flight of the general and principal officers; added to which was the fright of the elephants, who, when in consternation, were as much feared by them as the enemy were. There were, therefore, slain as many as eight thousand men.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal, having seized upon the treasure before he engaged, now sent the elephants in advance, and collecting as many of the flying troops as he could, directed his course along the river Tagus to the Pyrenees.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio, having got possession of the enemy's camp, and giving up all the booty to the soldiers, except the persons of free condition, found, on counting the prisoners, ten thousand foot and two thousand horse. Of these, all who were Spaniards he sent home without ransom; the Africans he ordered the quaestor to sell.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After this, <pb id="p.1119" n="1119"/>a multitude of Spaniards, consisting of those who had surrendered to him before and those whom he had captured the preceding day, crowding around, one and all saluted him as king;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> when Scipio, after the herald had obtained silence, declared that <quote>in his estimation the most honourable title was that of general, which his soldiers had conferred upon him. That the name of king, which was in other countries revered, could not be endured at Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That they might tacitly consider his spirit as kingly, if they thought that the highest excellence which could be attributed to the human mind, but that they must abstain from the use of the term.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even barbarians were sensible of the greatness of mind which could from such an elevation despise a name, at the greatness of which the rest of mankind were overawed.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Presents were then distributed to the petty princes and leading men of the Spaniards, and out of the great quantity of horses which were captured, he desired Indibilis to select those he liked best to the number of three hundred.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While the quaestor was selling the Africans, according to the command of the general, he found among them a full-grown youth remarkably handsome; and hearing that he was of royal blood, he sent him to Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On being asked by Scipio <quote>who he was, of what country, and why at that age he was in the camp?</quote> he replied, <quote>that he was a Numidian, that his countrymen called him Massiva; that being left an orphan by his father, he was educated by his maternal grandfather, Gala, the king of the Numidians. That he had passed over into Spain with his uncle Masinissa, who had lately come with a body of cavalry to assist the Carthaginians. That having been prohibited by Masinissa on account of his youth, he had never before been in battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That the day on which the battle took place with the Romans, he had clandestinely taken a horse and arms, and, without the knowledge of his uncle, gone out into the field, where his horse falling forward, he was thrown headlong, and taken prisoner by the Romans.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Scipio, having ordered that the Numidian should be taken care of, completed the business which remained to be done on the tribunal, and returning to his pavilion, asked him, when he had been called to him, whether he wished to return to Masinissa?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Upon his replying, with tears of joy, that he did indeed desire it, he presented the youth with a gold ring, a vest with a broad purple <pb id="p.1120" n="1120"/>border, a Spanish cloak with a gold clasp, and a horse completely caparisoned, and then dismissed him, ordering a party of horse to escort him as far as he chose.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A council was then held respecting the war; when some advised that he should endeavour to overtake Hasdrubal forthwith.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But thinking that hazardous, lest Mago and the other Hasdrubal should unite their forces with his, he sent a body of troops to occupy the pass of the Pyrenees, and employed the remainder of the summer in receiving the states of Spain into his alliance.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A few days after the battle of Baecula, when Scipio on his return to Tarraco had now cleared the pass of Castulo, the generals, Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, and Mago came from the farther Spain and joined Hasdrubal; a late assistance after the defeat he had sustained, though their arrival was somewhat seasonable, for counsel with respect to the further prosecution of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They then consulted together as to what was the feeling of the Spaniards in the quarters where their several provinces were situated, when Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, alone gave it as his opinion, that the remotest tract of Spain which borders on the ocean and Gades, was, as yet, unacquainted with the Romans, and might therefore be somewhat friendly to the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Between the other Hasdrubal and Mago it was agreed, that <quote>Scipio by his good offices had gained the affections of all, both publicly and privately; and that there would be no end of desertions till all the Spanish soldiers were removed to the remotest parts of Spain, or were marched over into Gaul.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That, therefore, though the Carthaginian senate had not decreed it, Hasdrubal must, nevertheless, march into Italy, the principal seat and object of the war; and thus at the same time lead away all the Spanish soldiers out of Spain far from the name of Scipio. That the army, which had been diminished by desertions and defeats, should be recruited by Spanish soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That Mago, having delivered over his army to Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, should himself pass over to the Baleares with a large sum of money to hire auxiliaries; that Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, should retire with the army into the remotest part of Lusitania, and avoid an encounter with the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That a body of three thousand horse should be made up for Masinissa, the flower of the whole cavalry; and that he, shifting about from place to place throughout hither <pb id="p.1121" n="1121"/>Spain, should succour their allies and commit depredations upon the towns and lands of their enemies.</quote> Having adopted these resolutions, the generals departed to put in execution what they had resolved on. Such were the transactions in Spain of this year. At Rome the reputation of Scipio increased daily.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The capture of Tarentum, though elected by artifice more than valour, was considered honourable to Fabius. The fame of Fulvius was on the wane.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcellus was even under an ill report, not only because he had failed in his first battle, but further, because while Hannibal was going wherever he pleased throughout Italy, he had led his troops to Venusia in the midst of summer to lodge in houses.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Caius Publicius Bibulus, a tribune of the people, was hostile to him. This man, ever since the time of his first battle which had failed, had in constant harangues made Claudius obnoxious and odious to the people; and now his object was to deprive him of his command.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The connexions of Marcellus, however, then obtained leave that Marcellus, leaving a lieutenant-general at Venusia, should return to Rome to clear himself of the charges which his enemies were urging, and that the question of depriving him of his command should not be agitated during his absence.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It happened that nearly at the same time, Marcellus, and Quintius Fulvius the consul, came to Rome, the former to exonerate himself from ignominy, the latter on account of the elections.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question touching Marcellus's command was debated in the Flaminian circus, in the presence of an immense concourse of plebeians and persons of every rank.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The plebeian tribune accused, not only Marcellus, but the nobility generally. <quote>It was owing,</quote> he said, <quote>to their dishonesty and dilatory conduct, that Hannibal occupied Italy, as though it were his province, for now ten years; that he had passed more of his life there than at Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That the Roman people were enjoying the fruits of the prolonged command of Marcellus; that his army, after having been twice defeated, was now spending the summer at Venusia lodged in houses.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcellus so completely destroyed the effect of this harangue of the tribune, by the recital of the services he had rendered, that not only the bill for depriving him of his command was thrown out, but the following day he was created consul by the votes of all the centuries with wonderful unanimity.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.1122" n="1122"/>Titus Quinctius Crispinus, who was then praetor, was joined with him as his colleague. The next day Publius Licinius Crassus Dives, then chief pontiff, Publius Licinius Varus, Sextus Julius Caesar, and Quintus Claudius Flamen were created praetors.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the very time of the election, the public were thrown into a state of anxiety relative to the defection of Etruria.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Caius Calpurnius, who held that province as propraetor, had written word that the Arretians had originated such a scheme. Accordingly Marcellus, consul elect, was immediately sent thither to look into the affair, and if it should appear to him of sufficient consequence, to send for his army and transfer the war from Apulia to Etruria.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Tuscans, checked by the alarm thus occasioned, desisted. To the ambassadors of Tarentum, who solicited a treaty of peace securing to them their liberty and the enjoyment of their own laws, the senate answered, that they might return when the consul Fabius came to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Roman and plebeian games were this year repeated each for one day. The curule aediles were, Lucius Cornelius Caudinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba; the plebeian aediles, Caius Servilius and Quintus Caecilius Metellus.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was asserted that Servilius was not qualified to be plebeian tribune or aedile, because it was satisfactorily established that his father, who, for ten years, was supposed to have been killed by the Boii in the neighbourhood of Mutina, when acting as triumvir for the distribution of lands, was alive and in the hands of the enemy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the eleventh year of the Punic war, Marcus Marcellus, for the fifth time, reckoning in the consulate in which he did not act in consequence of an informality in his creation, and Titus Quinctius Crispinus entered upon the office of consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To both the consuls the province of Italy was decreed, with both the consular armies of the former year; (the third was then at Venusia, being that which Marcus Marcellus had commanded.)

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That out of the three armies the consuls might choose whichever two they liked, and that the third should be delivered to him to whose lot the province of Tarentum and the territory of Sallentum fell. The other provinces were thus distributed among the praetors: Publius Licinius Varus had the city jurisdiction, Publius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff, the foreign, and wherever the senate thought proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Sextus Julius Caesar had Sicily, and Quintus Claudius <pb id="p.1123" n="1123"/>Flamen, Tarentum. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was to continue in command for a year, and hold the province of Capua, which had been held by Titus Quinctius, with one legion.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Caius Hostilius Tubulus was also continued in command, with orders to go into Etruria, in the capacity of propraetor, and succeed Caius Calpurnius in the command of the two legions there.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Veturius Philo was also continued in command, to hold in the capacity of proprietor the same province of Gaul with the same two legions with which he had held it as praetor. The senate decreed the same with respect to Caius Aurunculeius, who, as praetor, had held the province of Sardinia with two legions, which it did in the case of Lucius Veturius, and the question of the continuation of his command was proposed to the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He had in addition, for the protection of the province, fifty ships which Publius Scipio had sent from Spain. To Publius Scipio and Marcus Silanus, their present province of Spain and their present armies were assigned.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of the eighty ships which he had with him, some taken from Italy and others captured at Carthage, Scipio was ordered to send fifty to Sardinia, in consequence of a report that great naval preparations were making at Carthage that year; and that the intention of the Carthaginians was to blockade the whole coasts of Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia with two hundred ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In Sicily also the following distribution was made: to Sextus Caesar the troops of Cannae were assigned; Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who was also continued in command, was to have the fleet of seventy ships which was at Sicily, adding to it the thirty ships which the preceding year were stationed at Tarentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With this fleet of a hundred ships he was ordered to pass over into Africa, if he thought proper, and collect booty. Publius Sulpicius was also continued in command for a year, to hold the province of Macedonia and Greece, with the same fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> No alteration was made with regard to the two legions which were at Rome. Permission was given to the consuls to enlist as many troops as were necessary to complete the numbers.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This year the Roman empire was defended by twenty-one legions. Publius Licinius Varus, the city praetor, was also commissioned to repair the thirty old men of war which lay at Ostia, and to man twenty new ones with full complements, in order that he might defend the sea-coast in the neighbour- <pb id="p.1124" n="1124"/>hood of Rome with a fleet of fifty ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Caius Calpurnius was ordered not to move his army from Arretium till his successor had arrived. Both he and Tubulus were ordered to be particularly careful, lest any new plots should be formed in that quarter.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetors set out for their provinces. The consuls were detained by religious affairs; for receiving intelligence of several prodigies, they could not easily obtain a favourable appearance from the victims.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was reported from Campania, that two temples, those of Fortune and Mars, and several sepulchres, had been struck by lightning. From Cumae, so does superstition connect the deities with the most trifling circumstances, that mice had gnawed some gold in the temple of Jupiter. That an immense swarm of bees had settled in the forum at Casinum.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That at Ostia a wall and gate had been struck by lightning. At Caere, that a vulture had flown into the temple of Jupiter.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That blood had flowed from a lake at Volsinii. On account of these prodigies, a supplication was performed for one day. For several days, victims of the larger kind were sacrificed without any favourable appearance, and for a long time the good will of the gods could not be obtained.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The fatal event indicated by these portents pointed to the persons of the consuls, the state being unaffected. The Apollinarian games were first celebrated by Publius Cornelius Sulla, the city praetor, in the consulate of Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius; from that time all the city praetors in succession had performed them; but they vowed them for one year only, and fixed no day for their performance.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This year a grievous pestilence attacked the city and the country; it showed itself, however, in protracted rather than fatal diseases.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On account of this pestilence a supplication was performed in every street throughout the city; and Publius Licinius Varus, the city proctor, was ordered to propose to the people a law to the effect, that a vow should be made to perform these games on a stated day for ever. He himself was the first who vowed them in this manner, and he celebrated them on the third day of the nones of July, a day which was henceforth kept sacred.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The reports respecting the people of Arretium became daily more serious, and the anxiety of the fathers increased. A letter was therefore written to Caius Hostilius, directing him not to delay taking hostages from that people; and Caius <pb id="p.1125" n="1125"/>Terentius Varro was sent, with a command, to receive from him the hostages and convey them to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On hi arrival, Hostilius immediately ordered one legion, which was encamped before the city, to march into it; and having posted guards in suitable places, he summoned the senate into the forum and demanded hostages of them.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the senate's requesting a delay of two days to consider the matter, he declared that they must themselves give them forthwith, or he would the next day take all the children of the senators. After this the military tribunes, the praefects of the allies, and the centurions, were ordered to keep watch at the gates, that no one might go out by night.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This duty was not performed with sufficient care and attention, for seven of the principal senators, with their children, escaped before night, and before the guards were posted at the gates.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The next day, as soon as it was light, the senate began to be summoned into the forum, when they were missed and their goods were sold. From the rest of the senators one hundred and twenty hostages, consisting of their own children, were taken and delivered over to Caius Terentius to be conveyed to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Before the senate he made every thing more suspected than before. Considering, therefore, that there was imminent danger of a commotion in Tuscany, they ordered Caius Terentius himself to lead one of the city legions to Arretium, and to employ it for the protection of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was also resolved, that Caius Hostilius, with the other army, should traverse the whole province, and use precautions, that no opportunity might be afforded to those who were desirous of altering the state of things.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On his arrival at Arretium with the legion, Terentius asked the magistrates for the keys of the gates, when they declared they could not be found; but he, believing that they had been put out of the way with some bad intention rather than lost through negligence, took upon himself to have fresh locks put upon all the gates, and used diligent care to keep every thing in his own power.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He earnestly cautioned Hostilius to rest his hope in this; that the Tuscans would remain quiet, if he should take care that not a step could be taken.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The case of the Tarentines was then warmly debated in the senate, Fabius being present, and himself defending those whom he had subdued by force of arms, while others <pb id="p.1126" n="1126"/>entertained an angry feeling towards them; the greater part comparing them with the Campanians in guilt and punishment.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A decree of the senate was passed conformably to the opinion of Manius Acilius, that the town should be guarded by a garrison, and that all the Tarentines should be kept within their walls; and further, that the question touching their conduct should be hereafter laid before the senate afresh, when the state of Italy should be more tranquil.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The case of Marcus Livius, prefect of the citadel of Tarentum, was also debated with no less warmth;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> some proposing a vote of censure against the prefect on the ground that Tarentum was betrayed to the enemy through his negligence, others proposing rewards for having defended the citadel for five years, and because Tarentum had been recovered chiefly by his single efforts;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> while some, adopting an intermediate course, declared that it appertained to the censors, and not to the senate, to take cognizance of his case; and of this latter opinion was Fabius, who added, however, <quote>that he admitted that the recovery of Tarentum was owing to the efforts of Livius, as his friends openly boasted in the senate, but

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> that there would have been no necessity for its recovery, had it not been lost.</quote> One of the consuls, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, set out for Lucania, with soma troops to make up the numbers, to take the command of the army which had served under Quintus Fulvius Flaccus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcellus was detained by a succession of religious scruples, which presented themselves to his mind. One of which was, that when in the Gallic war at Clastidium he had vowed a temple to Honour and Valour, its dedication was impeded by the pontiffs.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> who said, that one shrine could not with propriety be dedicated to two deities; because if it should be struck with lightning or any kind of portent should happen in it, the expiation would be attended with difficulty, as it could not be ascertained to which deity sacrifice ought to be made; nor could one victim be lawfully offered to two deities, unless in particular cases.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly another temple to Virtue was erected with all speed. Nevertheless, these temples were not dedicated by Marcellus himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then at length he set out, with the troops raised to fill up the numbers, to the army he had left the preceding year at Venusia. Crispinus, who endeavoured to reduce Locri in Bruttium by a siege, because he considered that the affair of Tarentum had <pb id="p.1127" n="1127"/>added greatly to the fame of Fabius, had sent for every kind of engine and machine from Sicily;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> he also sent for ships from the same place to attack that part of the city which lay towards the sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But this siege was raised by Hannibal's bringing his forces to Lacinium, and in consequence of a report, that his colleague, with whom he wished to effect a junction, had now led his army from Venusia.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He therefore returned from Bruttium into Apulia, and the consuls took up a position in two separate camps, distant from each other less than three miles, between Venusia and Bantia.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Hannibal, after diverting the war from Locri, returned also into the same quarter. Here the consuls, who were both of sanguine temperament, almost daily went out and drew up their troops for action, confidently hoping, that if the enemy would hazard an engagement with two consular armies united, they might put an end to the war.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As Hannibal, who gained one and lost the other of the two battles which he fought the preceding year with Marcellus, would have equal grounds for hope and fear, should he encounter the same general again; so was he far from thinking himself a match for the two consuls together.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Directing his attention, therefore, wholly to his own peculiar arts, he looked out for an opportunity for planting an ambuscade.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Slight battles, however, were fought between the two camps with varying success. But the consuls, thinking it probable that the summer would be spun out in engagements of this kind, and being of opinion that the siege of Locri might be going on notwithstanding, wrote to Lucius Cincius to pass over to Locri with his fleet from Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And that the walls might be besieged by land also, they ordered one half of the army, which formed the garrison of Tarentum, to be marched thither.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hannibal having found from certain Thurians that these things would be done, sent a body of troops to lie in ambush on the road leading from Tarentum. There, under the hill of Petelia, three thousand cavalry and two thousand foot were placed in concealment.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans, who proceeded without exploring their way, having fallen into the ambuscade, as many as two thousand soldiers were slain, and about twelve hundred made prisoners. The others, who were scattered in flight through the fields and forests, returned to Tarentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was a rising ground covered with wood situated between the Punic and Roman camps, <pb id="p.1128" n="1128"/>which was occupied at first by neither party, because the Romans were unacquainted with its nature on that side which faced the enemy's camp, while Hannibal had supposed it better adapted for an ambuscade than a camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly, he had sent thither, by night, several troops of Numidians, concealing them in the midst of the wood. Not one of them stirred from his position by day, lest their arms or themselves should be observed from a distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was a general murmur in the Roman camp, that this eminence ought to be occupied and secured by a fort, lest if it should be seized by Hannibal they should have the enemy, as it were, immediately over their heads.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcellus was moved by this consideration, and observed to his colleague, <quote>Why not go ourselves with a few horsemen and reconnoitre?

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The matter being examined with our own eyes, will make our measures more certain.</quote> Crispinus consenting, they set out with two hundred and twenty horsemen, of which forty were Fregellans, the rest Tuscans.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Marcus Marcellus, the consul's son, and Aulus Manlius, military tribunes, together with two prefects of the allies, Lucius Arennius and Manius Aulius, accompanied them.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Some historians have recorded, that Marcellus had offered sacrifices on that day, and that in the first victim slain, the liver was found without its head; in the second, that all the usual parts were present, and that there was also an excrescence in the head.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> That the aruspex was not, indeed, pleased that the entrails should first have appeared mutilated and foul, and then too exuberant.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the consul Marcellus was influenced by so ardent a desire of engaging with Hannibal, that he never thought their camps close enough.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At that time also, as he quitted the rampart, he gave orders that the troops should be ready when occasion required, in order that if the hill, which they were going to examine, were thought convenient, they might collect their baggage and follow them.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Before the camp there was a small plain; the road thence to the hill was open and exposed to view on all sides. A watchman who was stationed, not under the expectation of so important an event, but in order that they might be able to intercept any stragglers who had gone too far from the camp in search of wood or forage, gave a signal to the Numidians to rise simultaneously one and all from their concealment.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Those who were to rise from the very summit of the hill, and meet the <pb id="p.1129" n="1129"/>enemy, did not show themselves until those whose business it was to intercept their passage in the rear, had gone round. Then they all sprang up from every side, and, raising a shout, commenced an attack.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although the consuls were in such a position in the valley that they could neither make good their way up the hill, which was occupied by the enemy, nor retreat, as they were intercepted in the rear, yet the contest might have been continued longer had not a retreat, commenced by the Tuscans, dismayed the rest of the troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Fregellans, however, did not give over fighting, though deserted by the Tuscans, while the consuls, uninjured, kept up the battle by encouraging their men and fighting themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But when they saw both the consuls wounded, and Marcellus transfixed with a lance and falling lifeless from his horse, then they too, and but a very few survived, betook themselves to flight, together with Crispinus the consul, who had received two javelin wounds, and young Marcellus, who was himself also wounded.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Aulus Manlius, a military tribune, was slain, and of the two prefects of allies, Manius Aulius was slain, Lucius Arennius made prisoner. Five of the consul's lictors fell into the enemy's hands alive, the rest were either slain or fled with the consul. Forty-three horsemen fell in the battle or in the flight, and eighteen were taken alive.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> An alarm had been excited in the camp, and the troops were hastening to go and succour the consuls, when

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> they saw one of the consuls and the son of the other wounded, and the scanty remains of this unfortunate expedition returning to the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The death of Marcellus was an event to be deplored, as well from other circumstances which attended it, as because that in a manner unbecoming his years, for he was then more than sixty, and inconsistently with the prudence of a veteran general, he had so improvidently plunged into ruin himself, his colleague, and almost the whole commonwealth.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> I should launch out into too many digressions for a single event, were I to relate all the various accounts which authors give respecting the death of Marcellus.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> To pass over others Lucius Caelius gives three narratives ranged under different heads; one as it is handed down by tradition; a second, written in the panegyric of his son, who was engaged in the affair; a third, which he himself vouched for, being the result of his own investigation.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The accounts, however, though varying <pb id="p.1130" n="1130"/>in other points, agree for the most part in the fact, that he went out of the camp for the purpose of viewing the ground; and all state that he was cut off by an ambuscade.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, concluding that the enemy were greatly dismayed by one of their consuls being slain and the other wounded, that he might not be wanting on any opportunity presenting itself, immediately transferred his camp to the eminence on which the battle had been fought.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Here he found the body of Marcellus, and interred it. Crispinus, disheartened by the death of his colleague and his own wound, set out during the silence of the following night, and encamped upon the nearest mountains he could reach, in a position elevated and secured on all sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here the two generals exerted their sagacity, the one in effecting, the other in guarding against, a deception. Hannibal got possession of the ring of Marcellus, together with his body.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Crispinus, fearing lest any artifice should be practised by the Carthaginian's employing this signet as the means of deception, had sent round messengers to the neighbouring states, informing them, that <quote>his colleague had been slain, and that the enemy were in possession of his seal, and that they must not give credit to any letters written in the name of Marcellus.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This message of the consul arrived at Salapia a little before a letter was brought from Hannibal, written in the name of Marcellus, to the effect, that <quote>he should come to Salapia on the night which followed that day; that the soldiers in the garrison should hold themselves in readiness, in case he might want to employ them on any service.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Salapians were aware of the fraud, and concluding that an opportunity for punishing them was sought by Hannibal, from resentment, not only on account of their defection, but also because they slew his

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> horsemen, sent his messenger, who was a deserter from the Romans, back again, in order that the soldiers might do what was thought necessary, without his being privy to it, and then placed the townsmen in parties to keep guard along the walls, and in convenient parts of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The guards and watches they formed with extraordinary care for that night, and on each side of the gate at which they supposed the enemy would come, they opposed to them the choicest of the troops in the garrison.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> About the fourth watch, Hannibal approached the city. His vanguard was composed of Roman deserters, with <pb id="p.1131" n="1131"/>Roman arms. These, all of whom spoke the Latin language, when they reached the gate, called up the guards, and ordered the gate to be opened, for the consul had arrived.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The guards, as if awakened at their call, began to be in a hurry and bustle, and exert themselves in opening the gate, which was closed by letting down the portcullis; some raised this with levers, others drew it up with ropes to such a height that the men could come in without stooping.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The opening was scarcely wide enough, when the deserters eagerly rushed through the gate, and after about six hundred had got in, the rope being let go by which it was suspended, the portcullis fell with a loud noise.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some of the Salapians fell upon the deserters, who were carrying their arms carelessly suspended upon their shoulders, as is customary after a march, as if among friends; others frightened away the enemy by discharging stones, pikes, and javelins from the tower adjoining the gate and from the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thus Hannibal withdrew, having been caught by his own stratagem, and proceeded to raise the siege of Locri, which Cincius was carrying on with the greatest vigour, with works and engines of every kind, which were brought from Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Mago, who by that time almost despaired of retaining and defending the town, derived his first gleam of hope on the death of Marcellus being reported.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> This was followed by a message, that Hannibal had despatched his Numidian cavalry in advance, and was himself following them with all possible speed with a body of infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> As soon, therefore, as he was informed, by a signal displayed from the watch-towers, that the Numidians were drawing near, suddenly throwing open the gate he sallied out boldly upon the enemy, and at first, more because he had done it unexpectedly than from the equality of his strength, the contest was doubtful;

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> but afterwards, when the Numidians came up, the Romans were so dismayed that they fled on all hands to the sea and their ships, leaving their works and the engines with which they battered the walls. Thus the siege of Locri was raised by the approach of Hannibal.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Crispinus found that Hannibal had gone into Bruttium, he ordered Marcus Marcellus, a military tribune, to march the army, which his colleague had commanded, to Venusia.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having set out himself with his own legions for Capua, though scarcely able to endure the motion of the <pb id="p.1132" n="1132"/>litter, from the severity of his wounds, he sent a letter to Rome stating the death of his colleague, and in how great danger he himself was.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He said, "it was impossible for him to go to Rome to hold the election, both because he did not think he could bear the fatigue of the journey, and because he was anxious about Tarentum, lest Hannibal should direct his course thither from Bruttium. That it was expedient that commissioners should be sent to him, men of sound judgment, with whom he might communicate, when he pleased, respecting the commonwealth.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The reading of this letter excited great grief for the death of one of the consuls, and apprehension for the safety of the other. They therefore sent Quintus Fabius the younger to Venusia to the army; and to the consul three commissioners, Sextus Julius Caesar, Lucius Licinius Pollio, and Lucius Cincius Alimentus, though but a few days before he had returned from Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These were directed to convey a message to the consul, to the effect, that if he could not himself go to Rome to hold the election, he should nominate a dictator within the Roman territory for that purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If the consul should have gone to Tarentum, that it was the pleasure of the senate that Marcus Claudius, the praetor, should march off his legions to that quarter in which he could protect the greatest number of the cities of the allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same summer Marcus Valerius crossed over from Sicily into Africa with a fleet of a hundred ships, and making a descent near the city Clupea, devastated the country to a wide extent, scarcely meeting with a single person in arms. Afterwards the troops employed in making these depredations were hastily led back to their ships, and a report had suddenly reached them that a Carthaginian fleet was drawing near.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It consisted of eighty-three ships. With these the Romans fought successfully, not far from the city Clupea, and after taking eighteen and putting the rest to flight, returned to Lilybaeum with a great deal of booty gained both by land and sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The same summer also Philip gave assistance to the suppliant Achaeans. They were harassed by Machanidas, tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, with a war in their immediate neighbourhood; and the Aetolians, having passed over an army in ships through the strait which runs between Naupactus and Patrae, called by the neighbouring people Rhion, had devastated their country.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was reported also, that Attalus, king of Asia, <pb id="p.1133" n="1133"/>would pass over into Europe, because the Aetolians, in their last council, had offered to him the office of chief magistrate of their nation.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, when marching down into Greece, for these reasons, was met at the city Lamia by the Aetolians, under the command of Pyrrhias, who had been created praetor that year jointly with Attalus, who was absent.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had with them also auxiliaries from Attalus, and about a thousand men sent from the Roman fleet by Publius Sulpicius. Against this general and these forces, Philip fought twice successfully, and slew full a thousand of his enemies in each battle. Whence, as the Aetolians were compelled by fear to keep themselves under the walls of Lamia, Philip led back his army to Phalara. This place is situated in the Malian bay, and was formerly thickly inhabited on account of its excellent harbour, the safe anchorage in its neighbourhood, and other conveniences of sea and land.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hither came ambassadors from Ptolemy, king of Egypt, the Rhodians, Athenians, and Chians, to put a stop to hostilities between the Aetolians and Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Aetolians also called in one of their neighbours as a mediator, Amynander, king of the Athamanians.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But all these were less concerned for the Aetolians, whose arrogance of disposition exceeded that of any other nation of Greece, than lest Philip and his empire, which was likely to prove injurious to the cause of liberty, should be intermixed with the affairs of Greece. The deliberations concerning a peace were put off, to a council of the Achaeans, for which a place and certain day were fixed upon; for the mean time a true of thirty days was obtained.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king, setting out thence, went through Thessaly and B&oelig;otia to Chalcis in Eub&oelig;a, to prevent Attalus, who he

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> heard was about to come to Eub&oelig;a with a fleet, from entering the harbours and approaching the coasts.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Leaving a force to oppose Attalus, in case he should cross over in the mean time, he set out thence with a small body of cavalry and light-armed troops, and came to Argos.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Here the superintendence of the Heraean and Nemaean games having been conferred upon him by the suffrages of the people, because the kings of the Macedonians trace their origin from that state, after completing the Heraean games, he set out directly after the celebration for Aegium, to the council of allies, fixed some time before.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Here measures were proposed <pb id="p.1134" n="1134"/>for putting an end to the Aetolian war, in order that neither the Romans nor Attalus might have a pretext for entering Greece; but they were all upset by the Aetolians, before the period of the truce had

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> scarcely expired, after they heard that Attalus had arrived at Aegina, and that a Roman fleet was stationed at Naupactus.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For when called into the council of the Achaeans, where the same embassies were present which had negotiated for peace at Phalara, they at first complained of some trifling acts committed during the period of the truce, contrary to the faith of the convention;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> but at last they asserted, that it was impossible the war could be terminated unless the Achaeans gave back Pylus to the Messenians, unless Atintania was restored to the Romans, and Ardyaea to Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But Philip, conceiving it an indignity that the vanquished should presumptuously dictate terms to him the victor, said, <quote>that he did not before either listen to proposals for peace, or agree to a truce, from any hope he entertained that the Aetolians would remain quiet, but in order that he might have all the allies as witnesses that he was desirous of peace, and that they were the occasion of this war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Thus, without effecting a peace, he dismissed the council; and leaving four thousand troops for the protection of the Achaeans, and receiving five men of war, with which, if he could

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> have joined them to the fleet of the Carthaginians lately sent to him, and the ships which were coming from Bithynia, from king Prusias, he had resolved to challenge the Romans, who had long been masters of the sea in that quarter, to a naval battle, the king himself went back from the congress to Argos;

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> for now the time for celebrating the Nemaean games was approaching, which he wished to be celebrated in his presence.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the king was occupied with the exhibition of the games, and was indulging himself during the days devoted to festivity with more freedom than in time of war, Publius Sulpicius, setting out from Naupactus, brought his fleet to the shore, between Sicyon and Corinth, and devastated without restraint a country of the most renowned fertility.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Intelligence of this proceeding called Philip away from the games. He set out hastily with his cavalry, ordering his infantry to follow him closely; and attacking the Romans as they were scattered through the fields and loaded with booty, like men who feared nothing of the kind, drove them to their ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.1135" n="1135"/>The Roman fleet returned to Naupactus by no means pleased with their booty. The fame of a victory gained by Philip over the Romans, of whatever magnitude, increased the celebrity of the remaining part of the games.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The festival was celebrated with extraordinary mirth, the more so as the king, in order to please the people, took the diadem off his head, and laid aside his purple robe with the other royal apparel, and placed himself, with regard to appearance, on an equality with the rest, than which nothing is more gratifying to free states.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By this conduct he would have afforded the strongest hopes of the enjoyment of liberty, had he not debased and marred all by his intolerable lust; for he ranged night and day through the houses of married people with one or two companions, and in proportion as he was less conspicuous by lowering his dignity to a private level, the less restraint lie felt;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> thus converting that empty show of liberty, which he had made to others, into a cover for the gratification of his own unbounded desires.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For neither did he obtain his object in all cases by money or seductive arts, but he also employed violence in the accomplishment of his flagitious purposes; and it was dangerous both to husbands and parents to have presented any impediment to the gratification of royal lust, by an unseasonable strictness.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From one man, Aratus, of the highest rank among the Achaeans, his wife, named Polycratia, was taken away and conveyed into Macedonia under the hope of a matrimonial connexion with royalty.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After passing the time appointed for the celebration of the Nemaean games, and a few days more, in the commission of these profligate acts, he set out for Dymae to expel the garrison of the Aetolians, which had been invited by the Eleans, and received into the town.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Cycliadas, who had the chief direction of affairs, met the king at Dymae, together with the Achaeans, who were inflamed with hatred against the Eleans, because they had disunited themselves from the rest of the Achaeans, and were incensed against the Aetolians, because they considered that they had stirred up a Roman war against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Setting out from Dymae, and uniting their forces, they passed the river Larissus, which separates the Elean from the Dymaean territory.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first day on which they entered upon the enemy's confines, they employed in plundering. The following day they <pb id="p.1136" n="1136"/>approached the city in battle-array, having sent their cavalry in advance, in order that, by riding up to the gates, they might provoke the Aetolians to make a sally, a measure to which they were naturally inclined.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were not aware that Sulpicius had passed over from Naupactus to Cyllene with fifteen ships, and landing four thousand armed men, had entered Elis during the dead of night, that his troops might not be seen.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, when they recognised the Roman standards and arms among the Aetolians, so unexpected an event occasioned the greatest terror;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and at first the king had wished to withdraw his troops; but afterwards, an engagement having taken place between the Aetolians and Trallians, a tribe of Illyrians, when he saw his men hard pressed, the king himself with his cavalry charged a Roman cohort.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Here his horse being pierced with a javelin threw the king, who fell over his head; when a conflict ensued, which was desperate on both sides; the Romans making a furious attack upon the king, and the royal party protecting him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His own conduct was highly meritorious, when though on foot he was obliged to fight among horsemen. Afterwards, when the contest was unequal, many were falling and being wounded around him, he was snatched away by his soldiers, and, being placed upon another horse, fled from the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On that day he pitched his camp five miles from the city of the Eleans, and the next day led out all his forces to a fort called Pyrgus, whither he had heard that a multitude of rustics had resorted through fear of being plundered.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This unorganized and unarmed multitude he took immediately on his approach, from the first effects of alarm; and by this capture compensated for the disgrace sustained at Elis.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> While engaged in distributing the spoil and captives, and there were four thousand men and as many as twenty thousand head of cattle of every kind, intelligence reached him from Macedonia that one Eropus had gained possession of Lychnidus by bribing the praefect of the citadel and garrison; that he held also certain towns of the Dassaretians, and that he was endeavouring to incite the Dardanians to arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Desisting from the Achaean war, therefore, but still leaving two thousand five hundred armed troops of every description under the generals Menippus and Polyphantas for the protection of his allies, he

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> set out <pb id="p.1137" n="1137"/>from Dymae, and passing through Achaea, B&oelig;otia, and Eub&oelig;a, arrived on the tenth day at Demetrias in Thessaly.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Here he was met by other messengers with intelligence of still greater commotions; that the Dardanians, having poured into Macedonia, were in possession of Orestis, and had descended into the Argestaean plain; and that there was a general report among the barbarians that Philip was slain.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In that expedition in which he fought with the plundering party near Sicyon, being carried by the fury of his horse against a tree, he broke off the extremity of one of the horns of his helmet against a projecting branch;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> which being found by a certain Aetolian and carried into Aetolia to Scerdilaedus, who knew it to be the ornament of his helmet, spread the report that the king was killed.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After the king had departed from Achaea, Sulpicius, going to Aegina with his fleet, formed a junction with Attalus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Achaeans fought successfully with the Aetolians and Eleans not far from Messene. King Attalus and Publius Sulpicius wintered at Aegina.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the close of this year Titus Quinctius Crispinus, the consul, after having nominated Titus Manlius Torquatus dictator for the purpose of holding the election and celebrating the games, died of his wound.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some say that he died at Tarentum, others in Campania. The death of the two consuls, who were slain without having fought any memorable battle, a coincidence which had never occurred in any former war, had left the commonwealth in a manner orphan. The dictator, Manlius, appointed as his master of the horse Caius Servilius, then curule aedile.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the first day of its meeting the senate ordered the dictator to celebrate the great games which Marcus Aemilius, the city praetor, had celebrated in the consulship of Caius Flaminius and Cneius Servilius, and had vowed to be repeated after five years. The dictator then both performed the games and vowed them for the following lustrum.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But as the two consular armies without commanders were so near the enemy, disregarding every thing else, one especial care engrossed the fathers and the people, that of creating the consuls as soon as possible; and that they might create those in preference whose valour was least in danger from Carthaginian treachery;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> since, through the whole period of the war, the precipitate and hot tempers of their generals had been detrimental, and this very year the consuls had fallen <pb id="p.1138" n="1138"/>into a snare for which they were not prepared, in consequence of their excessive eagerness to engage the enemy, but the immortal gods, in pity to

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the Roman name, had spared the unoffending armies, and doomed the consuls to expiate their temerity with their own lives.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the fathers' looking round to see whom they should appoint as consuls, Caius Claudius Nero appeared preeminently.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They then looked out for a colleague for him, and although they considered him a man of the highest talents, they also were of opinion that he was of a more forward and vehement disposition than the circumstances of the war, or the enemy, Hannibal,

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> required, they resolved that it would be right to qualify the impetuosity of his temper by uniting with him a cool and prudent colleague.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The person fixed upon was Marcus Livius, who, many years ago, was, on the expiration of his consulship, condemned in a trial before the people; a disgrace which he took so much to heart, that he retired into the country, and for many years absented himself from the city, and avoided all public assemblies.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Much about the eighth year after his condemnation, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Marcus Valerius Laevinus, the consuls, had brought him back into the city; but he appeared in a squalid dress, his hair and beard allowed to grow, and exhibiting in his countenance and attire the deep impression of the disgrace he had sustained.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Veturius and Publius Licinius, the censors, compelled him to have his beard and hair trimmed, to lay aside his squalid garb, to come into the senate, and discharge other public duties.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But even then he either gave his assent by a single word, or signified his vote by walking to one side of the house, till the trial of Marcus Livius Macatus, a kinsman of his, whose character was at stake, obliged him to deliver his sentiments in the senate upon his legs.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On being heard in the senate on this occasion, after so long an interval, he drew the eyes of all upon him, and gave occasion to conversations to the following effect: <quote>That the people had injuriously disgraced a man who was undeserving of it, and that it had been greatly detrimental to the state that, in so important a war, it had not had the benefit of the services and counsels of such a man.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That neither Quintus Fabius nor Marcus Valerius Laevinus could be given to Caius Nero as colleagues, because it was not allowed for two patricians to <pb id="p.1139" n="1139"/>be elected. That the same cause precluded Titus Manlius, besides that he had refused a consulship when offered to him, and would refuse it.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That they would have two most distinguished consuls if they should add Marcus Livius as a colleague to Caius Claudius.</quote> Nor did the people despise a proposal, the mention of which originated with the fathers.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The only person in the state who objected to the measure was the man to whom the honour was offered, who accused his

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> countrymen of inconstancy, saying, <quote>that, having withheld their pity from him when arrayed in a mourning garment and a criminal, they now forced upon him the white gown against his will; that honours and punishments were heaped upon the same person.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If they esteemed him a good man, why had they thus passed a sentence of condemnation upon him as a wicked and guilty one? If they had proved him a guilty man, why should they thus trust him with a second consulate after having improperly committed to him the first?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> While thus remonstrating and complaining, the fathers rebuked him, putting him in mind, that <quote>Marcus Furius too, being recalled from exile, had reinstated his country when shaken from her very base. That we ought to soothe the anger of our country as we would that of parents, by patience and resignation.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All exerting themselves to the utmost, they succeeded in uniting Marcus Livius in the consulate with Caius Claudius.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The third day afterwards the election of praetors was held. The praetors created were, Lucius Porcius Licinus, Caius Mamilius, Aulus Hostilius Cato, and Caius Hostilius Cato. The election completed, and the games celebrated, the dictator and master of the horse abdicated their offices.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Caius Terentius Varro was sent as proprietor into Etruria, in order that Caius Hostilius might quit that province and go to Tarentum to that army which Titus Quinctius, the consul, had commanded, and that Lucius Manlius might go as ambassador across the sea, and observe what was going on there;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and at the same time, as the games at Olympia, which were attended by the greatest concourse of persons of any solemnity in Greece, were about to take place that summer, that if he could without danger from the enemy, he might

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> go to that assembly, in order that any Sicilians who might be there, having been driven away by the war, or any Tarentine citi- <pb id="p.1140" n="1140"/>zens banished by Hannibal, might return to their homes, and be informed that the Roman people would restore to them every thing which they had possessed before the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As a year of the most dangerous character seemed to threaten them, and there were no consuls to direct the government, all men fixed their attention on the consuls elect, wishing them to draw lots for their provinces, as soon as possible, and determine beforehand what province and what enemy each should have.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate also took measures, at the instance of Quintus Fabius Maximus, to effect a reconciliation between them.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the enmity between them was notorious; and in the case of Livius his misfortunes rendered it more inveterate and acrimonious, as he considered that in that situation he had been treated with contempt.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was, therefore, the more inexorable, and said, <quote>that there was no need of a reconciliation, for that they would use greater diligence and activity in every thing they did for fear lest they should give their colleague, who was an enemy, an opportunity of advancing himself at their expense.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> However, the authority of the senate prevailed; and, laying aside their private differences, they conducted the affairs of the state in friendship and unanimity.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Their provinces were not districts bordering upon each other, as in former years, but quite separate, in the remotest confines of Italy. To one was decreed Bruttium and Lucania, to act against Hannibal; to the other Gaul, to act against Hasdrubal, who, it was reported, was now approaching the Alps;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and that he to whose lot Gaul fell should choose whichever he pleased of the two armies, one of which was in Gaul, the other in Etruria, and receive the city legions in addition;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and that he to whose lot Bruttium fell, should, after enlisting fresh legions for the city, take the army of whichever of the consuls of the former year he pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That Quintus Fulvius, proconsul, should take the army which was left by the consul, and that his command should last for a year.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> To Caius Hostilius, to whom they had given the province of Tarentum in exchange for Etruria, they gave Capua instead of Tarentum, with one legion which Fulvius had commanded the preceding year.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The anxiety respecting the approach of Hasdrubal to Italy increased daily. At first, ambassadors from the Massilians had brought word that he had passed over into Gaul, <pb id="p.1141" n="1141"/>and that

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the expectations of the Gauls were raised by his coming, as he was reported to have brought a large quantity of gold for the purpose of hiring auxiliaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Afterwards, Sextus Antistius and Marcus Raecius, who were sent from Rome, together with these persons, as ambassadors, to look into the affair, had brought word back that they had sent persons with Massilian guides, who, through the medium of Gallic chieftains connected with them by hospitality, might bring back all ascertained particulars;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that they found that Hasdrubal, who had already collected an immense army, would cross the Alps the ensuing spring; and that the only cause which delayed him there was, that the passage of the Alps was closed by winter.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Publius Aelius Paetus was created and inaugurated in the office of augur in the room of Marcus Marcellus, and Cneius Cornelius Dolabella was inaugurated king of

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the sacred rites in the room of Marcus Marcius, who had died two years before.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This same year, for the first time since Hannibal came into Italy, the lustrum was closed by the censors Publius Sempronius Tuditanus and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The citizens numbered in the census were one hundred and thirty-seven thousand one hundred and eight, a number considerably smaller than before the war. This year it is recorded that the Comitium was covered, and that the Roman games were repeated once by the curule aediles, Quintus Metellus and Caius Servilius; and that the plebeian games were repeated twice by Quintus Mamilius and Marcus Caecilius Metellus, plebeian aediles.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The same persons also gave three statues for the temple of Ceres, and there was a feast in honour of Jupiter on occasion of the games.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After this Caius Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius a second time entered upon their consulate; and as they had already, while consuls elect, drawn lots for their provinces, they ordered the praetors to draw lots for theirs.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Caius Hostilius had the city jurisdiction, to which the foreign was added, in order that three praetors might go out to the provinces. Aulus Hostilius had Sardinia, Caius Mamilius, Sicily, Lucius Porcius, Gaul.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The total amount of legions employed in the provinces was twenty-three, which were so distributed that the consuls might have two each; Spain, four; the three praetors in Sicily, Sardinia, and Gaul, two each;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Caius Terentius, two in Etruria; Quintus Fulvius, two in Bruttium; Quintus Clau- <pb id="p.1142" n="1142"/>dius two in the neighbourhood of Tarentum and the territory of Sallentum; Caius Hostilius Tubulus, one at Capua; and two were ordered to be enlisted for the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For the first four legions the people elected tribunes, the consuls sent those for the rest.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the consuls set out, the nine days' sacred rite was performed, as a shower of stones had fallen from the sky at Veii.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the mention of one prodigy, others also were reported, as usual. At Minturnae, that the temple of Jupiter and the grove of Marica, and at Atella also that a wall and gate, had been struck by lightning.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The people of Minturnae added what was more alarming, that a stream of blood had flowed at their gate. At Capua, a wolf, which had entered at the gate by night, had torn a watchman.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These prodigies were expiated with victims of the larger kind, and a supplication for one day was made, according to a decree of the pontiffs. The nine days' sacred rite was then performed again, because a shower of stones had been seen to fall in the armilustrum.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After the people's minds had been freed from superstitious fears, they were again disturbed by intelligence that an infant had been born at Frusino as large as a child of four years old, and not so much an object of wonder from its size, as that it was born without any certain mark of distinction whether it was male or female, which was the case two years before at Sinuessa.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Aruspices, called in from Etruria, declared this to be indeed a foul and ill-omened prodigy, which ought to be removed out of the Roman territory, and, being kept far from coming in contact with the earth, to be plunged into the deep.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They shut it up alive in a chest, and carrying it away, threw it into the sea. The pontiffs also decreed, that thrice nine virgins should go through the city singing a hymn.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While in the temple of Jupiter Stator they were learning this hymn, which was composed by the poet Livius, the temple of Juno Regina, on the Aventine, was struck by lightning;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and the aruspices, on being consulted, having replied that that prodigy appertained to the matrons, and that the goddess must be appeased by a present, such of the matrons as dwelt within the city and within the tenth milestone from it, were summoned to the Capitol by an edict of the curule aediles;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> when they themselves chose twenty-five out of their own body, to whom they paid a contribution out <pb id="p.1143" n="1143"/>of their dowries, from which a golden basin was made, as a present, and carried to the Aventine, where a sacrifice was performed by the matrons in a pure and chaste manner.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Immediately a day was given out by the decemviri for another sacrifice to the same goddess, which was performed in the following order: two white heifers were led from the temple of Apollo into the city through the Carmental gate;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> after these, two cypress images of Juno Regina were carried; after these went seven and twenty virgins, arrayed in white vestments, and singing in honour of Juno Regina a hymn, which to the uncultivated minds of that time might appear to have merit, but if repeated now would seem inelegant and uncouth.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The train of virgins was followed by the decemvirs, crowned with laurel, and in purple-bordered robes.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From the gate they proceeded by the Jugarian street into the forum: in the forum the procession stopped, and the virgins, linked together by a cord passed through their hands, moved on, beating time with their feet to the music of their voices.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> They then proceeded by the Tuscan street and the Velabrum, through the cattle market, up the Publician hill, and to the temple of Juno Regina; where two victims were immolated by the decemviri, and the cypress images carried into the temple.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the deities were appeased in due form, the consuls made the levy with greater diligence and strictness than any one remembered it to have been made in former years;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for the war was now doubly formidable, in consequence of the advance of a new enemy into Italy, while the number of the youth from which they could enlist soldiers was diminished.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They therefore resolved to compel the settlers upon the seacoast, who were said to possess an exemption from service solemnly granted, to furnish soldiers; and on their refusing to do so, appointed that they should severally lay before the senate, on a certain day, the grounds on which they claimed exemption.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the appointed day the following people tame to the senate: the people of Ostia, Alsia, Antium, Anxur, Minturnae, and Sinuessa, and, on the upper sea, Sena.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After each people had stated their grounds of exemption, the exemption of none was allowed, as the enemy was in Italy, except those of Antium and Ostia, and of these colonies the young men were bound by oath that they would not lodge without the walls of their colony, while the enemy was in <pb id="p.1144" n="1144"/>Italy, more than thirty days.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although it was the opinion of all that the consuls ought to proceed to the war as soon as possible, (for Hasdrubal ought to be met on his descent from the Alps, lest he might seduce the Cisalpine Gauls and Etruria, which was anxiously looking forward to a revolution;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> while it was necessary to occupy Hannibal with a war in his own quarters, lest he should emerge from Bruttium, and advance to meet his brother;) yet Livius delayed, not having sufficient confidence in the armies destined for his provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He said his colleague had his option to take which he pleased out of two excellent consular armies, and a third which Quintus Claudius commanded at Tarentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He also made mention of recalling the volunteer slaves to their standards. The senate gave the consuls unrestricted liberty of filling up their numbers from what source they pleased, of selecting out of all the armies such as they liked, and of exchanging and removing from one province to another, as they thought conducive

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> to the good of the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In all these affairs the consuls acted with the most perfect harmony. The volunteer slaves were enlisted into the nineteenth and twentieth legions. Some authors state that very efficient auxiliaries were sent out of Spain also to Marcus Livius by Publius Scipio; namely, eight thousand Spaniards and Gauls, two thousand legionary soldiers, a thousand horse of Numidians and Spaniards together.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That Marcus Lucretius brought these forces in ships, and that Caius Mamilius sent as many as four thousand bowmen and slingers out of Sicily.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A letter which was brought out of Gaul from Lucius Porcius, the praetor, increased the alarm at Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It stated that Hasdrubal had quitted his winter quarters, and was now crossing the Alps; that eight thousand Ligurians had been enlisted and armed, which would join him when he had crossed over into Italy, unless some general were sent into Liguria to engage them with a war. That he would himself advance as far as he thought it safe with his small forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This letter obliged the consuls hastily to conclude the levy, and go earlier than they had determined into their provinces, with the intention that each should keep his enemy in his own province, and not allow them to form a junction or concentrate their forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This object was much aided by an opinion possessed by Hannibal; for although he felt assured that his brother <pb id="p.1145" n="1145"/>would cross over into Italy that summer, yet when he recollected what difficulties he had himself experienced through a period of five months, first in crossing the Rhone, then the Alps, contending against men, and the nature of the ground, he was far from expecting that his transit would be so easy and expeditious,

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> and this was the cause of his moving more slowly from his winter quarters.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But all things were done by Hasdrubal with less delay and trouble than he himself or any others expected. For the Arverni, and after them the other Gallic and Alpine nations in succession, not only gave him a friendly reception, but followed him to the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and not only had roads been formed during the passage of his brother in most of the countries through which he marched, and which were before impassable, but also as the Alps had been passable for a period of twelve years, he marched through tribes of less ferocious dispositions.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For before that time, being never visited by foreigners, nor accustomed, themselves, to see a stranger in their country, they were unsociable to the whole human race. And at first, not knowing whither the Carthaginian was going, they had imagined that their own rocks and forts, and the plunder of their cattle and people, were his objects;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but afterwards, the report of the Punic war with which Italy was being desolated for now ten years, had convinced them that the Alps were only a passage, and that two very powerful nations, separated from each other by a vast tract of sea and land, were contending for empire and power. These were the causes which opened the Alps to Hasdrubal.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But the advantage which he gained by the celerity of his

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> march he lost by his delay at Placentia, while he carried on a fruitless siege, rather than an assault.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had supposed that it would be easy to take by storm a town situated on a plain; and the celebrity of the colony induced him to believe that by destroying it he should strike great terror into the rest.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This siege not only impeded his own progress, but had the effect of restraining Hannibal, who was just on the point of quitting his winter quarters, after hearing of his passage, which was so much quicker than he expected;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> for he not only revolved in his mind how tedious was the siege of towns, but also how ineffectual was his attempt upon that same colony, when returning victorious from the Trebia.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls, on departing from the city in different <pb id="p.1146" n="1146"/>directions, had drawn the attention of the public, as it were, to two wars at once, while they called to mind the disasters which Hannibal's first coming had brought upon Italy, and at the same time, tortured with anxiety, asked themselves what deities would be so propitious to the city and empire as that the commonwealth should be victorious in both quarters at once.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hitherto they had been enabled to hold out to the present time by compensating for their misfortunes by their successes.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the Roman power was laid prostrate at the Trasimenus and at Cannae in Italy, their successes in Spain had raised it up from its fallen condition.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Afterwards, when in Spain one disaster after another had in a great measure destroyed two armies, with the loss of two distinguished generals, the many successes in Italy and Sicily had, as it were, afforded a haven for the shattered state;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and the mere interval of space, as one war was going on in the remotest quarter of the world, gave them time to recover their breath.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Whereas now two wars were received into Italy; two generals of the highest renown were besetting the Roman city; while the whole weight of the danger and the entire burden pressed upon one point. Whichever of these generals should be first victorious, he would in a few days unite his camp with the other.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The preceding year also, saddened by the deaths of two consuls, filled them with alarm. Such were the anxious feelings with which the people escorted the consuls on their departure to their provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is recorded that Marcus Livius, still teeming with resentment against his countrymen, when setting out to the war, replied to Fabius, who warned him not rashly to come to an action till he had made himself acquainted with the character of his enemy, that as soon as ever he had got sight of the troops of the enemy he would engage them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When asked what was his reason for such haste, he said, <quote>I shall either obtain the highest glory from conquering the enemy, or the greatest joy from the defeat of my countrymen, a joy which they have deserved, though it would not become me.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Before the consul Claudius arrived in his province, Caius Hostilius Tubulus, attacking Hannibal with his light cohorts while marching his army through the extreme borders of the territory of Larinum into that of Sallentum, caused terrible confusion in his unmarshalled troops;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> he killed as many as four thousand, and <pb id="p.1147" n="1147"/>captured nine military standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Quintus Claudius, who had his camps distributed through the towns of the Sallentine territory, had quitted his winter quarters on hearing of the enemy; and Hannibal, fearing on that account lest he should have to engage with two armies at once, decamped by night, and retired from the Tarentine to the Bruttian territory.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Claudius turned his army to the Sallentine territory. Hostilius, on his way to Capua, met the consul Claudius at Venusia.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Here forty thousand infantry and two thousand five hundred horse were selected from both armies, with which the consul might carry on the war against Hannibal. The rest of the troops Hostilius was directed to march to Capua to deliver them over to Quintus Fulvius, proconsul.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, having drawn together his forces from all quarters, both those which he had in winter quarters, and those which he had in the garrisons of the Bruttian territory, came to Grumentum in Lucania, with the hope of regaining the towns which through fear had revolted to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the same place the Roman consul proceeded from Venusia, exploring the way as he went, and pitched his camp about fifteen hundred paces from the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The rampart of the Carthaginians seemed almost united with the walls of Grumentum, though five hundred paces intervened.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Between the Carthaginian and Roman camps lay a plain; and overhanging the left wing of the Carthaginians and the right of the Romans were some naked hills, which were not objects of suspicion to either party, as they had no wood upon them, nor any hiding-places for an ambuscade.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the plain which lay between them skirmishes hardly worth mentioning took place between parties sallying from the outposts. It was evident that what the Roman aimed at was to prevent the enemy from going off, while Hannibal, who was desirous of escaping thence, came down with all his forces, and formed in order of battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Upon this the consul, imitating the crafty character of his enemy, ordered five cohorts, with the addition of five maniples, to pass the summit by night and sit down in the valleys on the opposite side; a measure to which he was prompted the more strongly in proportion as he felt that there could exist no suspicion of an ambuscade in hills so uncovered.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of the time for rising up from their retreat and of falling upon the enemy he informed Tiberius Claudius Asellus, <pb id="p.1148" n="1148"/>a military tribune, and Publius Claudius, praefect of the allies, whom he sent with them.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The general himself, at break of day, drew out all his forces, both foot and horse, for battle. Shortly after, the signal for battle was given out by Hannibal, and a noise was raised in the camp, from the troops running hastily to arms; then both horse and foot eagerly rushed through the gates, and spreading themselves over the plain, hastened to the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul perceiving them thus disordered, gave orders to Caius Aurunculeius, a military tribune of the third legion, to send out the cavalry of the legion to charge the enemy with all possible vehemence, for that the enemy had spread themselves

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> like cattle in such disorder throughout the whole plain, that they might be knocked down and trampled under foot before they could be formed.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal had not yet gone out of the camp, when he heard the shout of his troops engaged; and thus roused by the alarm, he hastily led his forces against the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Already had the Roman horse spread terror through the Carthaginian van; the first legion also of the infantry and the right wing were commencing the action, while the troops of the Carthaginians, in disorder, engaged just as chance threw each in the way of horse or foot.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The battle became more general by reinforcements, and the number of those who ran out to the combat.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal, amid the terror and confusion, would have drawn up his troops while fighting, (which would not have been an easy task unless to a veteran general with veteran soldiers,) had not the shouts of the cohorts and maniples, running down from the hills, which was heard in their rear, created an alarm lest they should be cut off from their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After this they were seized with a panic, and a flight commenced in every part; but the number slain was less, because the nearness of the camp offered to the terrified troops a shorter distance to fly.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the cavalry hung upon their rear, and the cohorts, running down the declivities of the hills by an unobstructed and easy path, charged them transversely in flank.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> However, above eight thousand men were slain, above seven hundred made prisoners, and eight military standards taken. Of the elephants also, which had been of no use in such a sudden and irregular action, four were killed and two captured.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The conquerors lost about five hundred Romans and allies. The following day the Car- <pb id="p.1149" n="1149"/>thaginian remained quiet. The Roman having led out his troops into the field, when he saw that no one came out to meet him, gave orders that the spoils of those of the enemy who were slain should be collected, and that the bodies of his own men should be gathered into one place and buried.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After this, for several days following in succession, he came up so near the enemy's gates that he almost seemed to be carrying in his standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But at length Hannibal at the third watch, leaving a number of fires and tents in that part of the camp which faced the enemy, and also a few Numidians who might show themselves in the rampart and the gates, decamped and proceeded towards Apulia.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As soon as it dawned, the Roman army came up to the trenches, and the Numidians, according to the plan concerted, took care to show themselves for a little time on the rampart and in the gates; and having deceived the enemy for some time, rode off at full speed, and overtook their friends on their march.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consul, when all was silence in the camp, and he could now no where see even the few who at break of day had walked up and down, sent two horsemen in advance to reconnoitre;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and after he had ascertained that all was safe enough, ordered his troops to march in;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and after staying there only while his men distributed themselves for plunder, sounded a retreat and led back his forces long before night. The next day he set out as soon as it was light, and following the rumour and the track of the enemy by forced marches, came up with them not far from Venusia.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Here also an irregular battle took place, in which two thousand of the Carthaginians were slain.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Carthaginian quitting this place made for Metapontum, marching by night and over mountainous districts in order to avoid a battle. Thence Hanno, who commanded the garrison of that place, was sent into Bruttium with a small party to raise a fresh army. Hannibal, after adding his forces to his own, went back to Venusia by the same route by which he came, and proceeded thence to Canusium.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Nero had never quitted the enemy's steps, and when he himself went to Metapontum, had sent for Quintus Fulvius into Lucania, lest that region should be left without protection.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile four Gallic horsemen and two Numidians, who were sent to Hannibal with a letter from Hasdrubal, after he had retired from the siege of Placentia, having <pb id="p.1150" n="1150"/>traversed nearly the whole length of Italy through the midst of enemies, while following Hannibal as he was retiring to Metapontum, were taken to Tarentum by mistaking the roads;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> where they were seized by some Roman foragers, who were straggling through the fields, and brought before the propraetor, Caius Claudius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first they endeavoured to baffle him by evasive answers, but threats of applying torture being held out to them, they were compelled to confess the truth; when they fully admitted that they were the bearers of a letter from Hasdrubal to Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were delivered into the custody of Lucius Virginius, a military tribune, together with the letter sealed as it was, to be conveyed to the consul Claudius.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time two troops of Samnites were sent with them as an escort. Having made their way to the consul, the letter was read by means of an interpreter, and the captives were interrogated;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> when Claudius, coming to the conclusion that the predicament of the state was not such as that her generals should carry on the war, each within the limits of his own province, and with his own troops, according to the customary

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> plans of warfare, and with an enemy marked out for him by the senate, but that some unlooked for and unexpected enterprise must be attempted, which, in its commencement, might cause no less dread among their countrymen than their enemies, but which, when accomplished, might convert their great fear into great joy, sent the letter of Hasdrubal to Rome to the senate;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and at the same time informed the conscript fathers what his intentions were; and recommended that, as Hasdrubal had written to his brother that he should meet him in Umbria, they should send for the legion from Capua to Rome, enlist troops at Rome, and oppose the city forces to the enemy at Narnia.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Such was his letter to the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Messengers were sent in advance through the territory of Larinum, Marrucia, Frentana, and Praetutia, where he was about to march his army, with orders that they should all bring down from their farms and towns to the road-side provisions ready dressed for the soldiers to eat; and that they should bring out horses and other beasts of burden, so that those who were tired might have plenty of conveyances.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He then selected the choicest troops out of the whole army of the Romans and allies, to the amount of six thousand infantry and one thousand horse; and gave out that he intended to seize <pb id="p.1151" n="1151"/>on the nearest town in Lucania and the Carthaginian garrison in it, and that they should all be in readiness to march.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Setting out by night he turned off towards Picenum, and making his marches as long as possible, led his troops to join his colleague, having left Quintus Catius, lieutenant-general, in command of the camp.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome the alarm and consternation were not less than they had been two years before, when the Carthaginian camp was pitched over against the Roman walls and gates; nor could people make up their minds whether they should commend, or censure, this so bold march of the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was evident that the light in which it would be viewed would depend upon its success; than which nothing can be more unfair. They said, <quote>that the camp was left near to the enemy, Hannibal, without a general, and with an army from which all the flower and vigour had been withdrawn;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that the consul had pretended an expedition into Lucania, when he was in reality going to Picenum and Gaul, leaving his camp secured only by the ignorance of the enemy, who were not aware that the general and part of his army were away.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What would be the consequence if that should be discovered, and Hannibal should think proper either to pursue Nero with his whole army, who had gone off with only six thousand armed men, or to assault the camp, which was left as a prey for him, without strength, without command, without auspices?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The disasters already experienced in the war, the deaths of two consuls the preceding year, augmented their fears. Besides, all these events had occurred <quote>when there was only one general and one army of the enemy in Italy;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> whereas now they had two Punic wars, two immense armies, and in a manner two Hannibals in Italy, inasmuch as Hasdrubal was descended from the same father, Hamilcar, was a general equally enterprising, having been trained in a Roman war during so many years in Spain, and rendered famous by a double victory, having annihilated two armies with two most renowned generals.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For he could glory even more than Hannibal himself, on account of the celerity with which he had effected his passage out of Spain, and his success in stirring up the Gallic nations to arms,

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> inasmuch as he had collected an army in those very regions in which Hannibal lost the major part of his soldiers by famine and cold, the most <pb id="p.1152" n="1152"/>miserable modes of death.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Those who were experienced in the events which had occurred in Spain, added, that <quote>he would not have to engage with Caius Nero, the general, as an unknown person, whom, when accidentally caught in a difficult defile, he had eluded and baffled like a little child, by drawing up fallacious terms of peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Under the dictation of fear, which always puts the worst construction upon things, they magnified all the advantages which the enemy possessed, and undervalued their own.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Nero had got such a distance from the enemy that his plan might be disclosed without danger, he briefly addressed his soldiers, observing, that <quote>there never was a measure adopted by any general which was in appearance more daring than this, but in reality more safe. That he was leading them on to certain victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For as his colleague had not set out

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to prosecute the war which he conducted, until forces both of horse and foot had been assigned to him by the senate to his own satisfaction, and those greater and better equipped than if he had been going against Hannibal himself, that they would, by joining him, however small the quantity of force which they might add, completely turn the scale.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That when it was only heard in the field of battle (and he would take care that it should not be heard before) that another consul and another army had arrived, it would insure the victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That rumour decided war; and that the most inconsiderable incidents had power to excite hope and fear in the mind. That they would themselves reap almost the entire glory which would be obtained if they succeeded, for it was invariably the case that the last addition which is made is supposed to have effected the whole.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That they themselves saw with what multitudes, what admiration, and what good wishes of men their march was attended.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And, by Hercules, they marched amid vows, prayers, and commendations, all the roads being lined with ranks of men and women, who had flocked there from all parts of the country. They called them the safeguards of the state, the protectors of the city and empire of Rome. They said that the safety and liberty of themselves and their children were treasured up in their arms and right hands.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They prayed to all the gods and goddesses to grant them a prosperous march, a successful battle, and a speedy victory over their enemies; and that they might be <pb id="p.1153" n="1153"/>bound to pay the vows which they had undertaken in their behalf;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> so that as now they attended them off with anxiety, so after a few days' interval they might joyfully go out to meet them exulting in victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then they severally and earnestly invited them to accept, offered them, and wearied them with entreaties, to take from them in preference to another, whatever might be requisite for themselves or their cattle. They generously gave them every thing in abundance, while the soldiers vied with each other in moderation, taking care not to accept any thing beyond what was necessary for use.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They did not make any delay nor quit their ranks when taking food; they continued the march day and night, scarcely giving as much to rest as was necessary to the requirements of the body.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Messengers were also despatched in advance to his colleague, to inform him of his approach, and to ask whether he wished that he should come secretly or openly, by day or night, whether they should lodge in the same or different camps. It appeared most advisable that they should come into the camp secretly by night.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A private signal was sent through the camp by the consul Livius, that each tribune should receive a tribune, each centurion a centurion, each horseman a horseman, each foot-soldier a foot-soldier;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for it was not expedient that the camp should be enlarged, lest the enemy should discover the arrival of the other consul, while the crowding together of several persons, who would have their tents in a confined place, would be attended with less inconvenience, because the army of Claudius had brought with them on their expedition scarcely any thing except their arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Claudius, on the very march, had augmented his numbers by volunteers; for not only veteran soldiers, who had completed their period of service, but young men also offered themselves without solicitation; and, as they vied with each other in giving in their names, he had enlisted those whose personal appearance and bodily strength seemed fit for military service.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The camp of the other consul was near Sena, and Hasdrubal's position was about five hundred paces from it. Nero, therefore, when he was now drawing near, halted under cover of the mountains, in order that he might not enter the camp before night.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having entered when all was still, they were severally conducted into their tents by the men of their own description, <pb id="p.1154" n="1154"/>where they were hospitably entertained with the utmost joy on the part of all. The next day a council was held, at which Lucius Porcius Licinus, the praetor, was present.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had his camp joined to that of the consuls, and before their arrival, by leading, his army along the heights, sometimes occupying narrow defiles that he might intercept his passage, at other times harassing his troops while marching by attacking their flank or rear, he had baffled the enemy by all the arts of war. This man was, on the present occasion, one of the council.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Many inclined to the opinion that an engagement should be deferred till Nero had recruited his soldiers, who were weary with marching and watching, and had employed a few days in acquiring a knowledge of his enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nero urged, not only by persuasion, but with the most earnest entreaties, <quote>that they would not render rash by delay that measure of his which despatch had made safe.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That Hannibal, who lay in a state of torpid inactivity in consequence of a delusion which would not continue long, had neither attacked his camp, left as it was without a leader, nor had directed his course in pursuit of him. That the army of Hasdrubal might be annihilated, and he might retire into Apulia before he stirred a step.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The man who by delay gave time to the enemy both betrayed that camp to Hannibal, and opened a way to him into Gaul, so that he might effect a junction with Hasdrubal at his leisure, and when he pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That they ought to give the signal for battle instantly, and march out into the field, and take advantage of the delusion of their enemies present and absent, while neither those were aware that they had fewer, nor these that they had more and stronger forces to encounter.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the breaking up of the council the signal for battle was displayed, and the troops immediately led into the field.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Carthaginians were already standing before their camp in battle-array. This circumstance delayed the battle: Hasdrubal, who had advanced before the line with a few horsemen, remarked some old shields among the enemy, which he had not seen before, and some horses leaner than the rest; their numbers also appeared greater than usual.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Suspecting, therefore, what was really the case, he hastily sounded a retreat, and sent a party to the river from which they got their water, where some of them might be intercepted, and notice taken whether there were perchance any there whose com- <pb id="p.1155" n="1155"/>plexions were more than ordinarily sun-burnt, as from a recent march.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the same time he ordered a party to ride round the camp at a distance, and note whether the rampart was extended in any part, and also observe whether the signal sounded once or twice. Having received a report of all these particulars, the fact of the camp's not being enlarged led him into error.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were now two camps, as there were before the other consul arrived, one belonging to Marcus Livius, the other to Lucius Porcius, and to neither of them had any addition been made to give more room for the tents.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the veteran general, who was accustomed to a Roman enemy, was much struck by their reporting that the signal sounded once in the praetor's camp, and twice in the consul's; there must therefore be two consuls, and felt the most painful anxiety as to the manner in which the other had got away from Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Least of all could he suspect, what was really the case, that he had got away from Hannibal by deceiving him to such an extent, as that he knew not where the general was, and where the army whose camp stood opposite to his own.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Surely, he concluded, deterred by a defeat of no ordinary kind, he has not dared to pursue him; and he began to entertain the most serious fears that he had himself come too late with assistance, now that affairs were desperate, and lest the same good fortune attended the Roman arms in Italy which they had experienced in Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sometimes he imagined that his letter could not have reached him, and that, it having been intercepted, the consul had hastened to overpower him. Thus anxious and perplexed, having put out the fires, he issued a signal at the first watch to collect the baggage in silence, and gave orders to march. In the hurry and confusion occasioned by a march by night, their guides were not watched with sufficient care and attention.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> One of them stopped in a lace of concealment which he had beforehand fixed upon in hi mind, the other swam across the river Metaurus, at a ford with which he was acquainted. The troops, thus deserted by their guides, at first wandered up and down through the fields; and some of them, overpowered with sleep, and fatigued with watching, stretched themselves on the ground here and there, leaving their standards thinly attended.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hasdrubal gave orders to march along the bank of the river until the light should discover the road; but, pursuing a circuitous and un- <pb id="p.1156" n="1156"/>certain course along the turnings and windings of that tortuous river, with the intention of crossing it as soon as the first light should discover a place convenient for the purpose, he made but little progress;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but wasting the day in a fruitless attempt to discover a ford, for the further he went from the sea the higher he found the banks which kept the river in its course, he gave the enemy time to overtake him.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>First Nero arrived with the whole body of his cavalry; then Porcius came up with him, with the light infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And while these were harassing his weary troops on every side, and charging them, and the Carthaginian, stopping his march, which resembled a flight, was desirous of encamping on an eminence, on the bank of the river, Livius came up with all his

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> foot forces, not after the manner of troops on march, but armed and marshalled for immediate action.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they had united all their forces, and the line was drawn out, Claudius took the direction of the battle in the right wing, Livius in the left; the management of the centre was given to the praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hasdrubal, when he saw that an engagement was inevitable, giving over the fortification of a camp, placed his elephants in the front line, before the standards; on either side these he placed in the left wing the Gauls to oppose Claudius, not so much from any confidence he reposed in them, as because he believed them to be dreaded by the enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the right wing he took to himself against M. Livius, together with the Spaniards, in whom, as being veteran troops, he placed his greatest hopes.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Behind the elephants, in the centre, the Ligurians were posted; but his line was rather long than deep. The Gauls were covered by a hill, which extended in front.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That part of the line which was occupied by the Spaniards, engaged the left wing of the Romans, the whole of whose right wing, extending beyond the line of battle, was unengaged. The hill before them prevented their making an attack either in front or flank.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Between Livius and Hasdrubal a furious contest arose, and the slaughter on both sides was dreadful.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Here were both the generals, here the major part of the Roman horse and infantry, here the Spaniards, veteran troops, and experienced in the Roman manner of fighting, and the Ligurians, a nation inured to war.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The elephants were also driven to the same part, which, on the first onset, disordered the van, and had now <pb id="p.1157" n="1157"/>even dislodged the standards; but afterwards, the contest growing hotter, and the shout increasing, they became less submissive to their riders, and ranged to and fro between the two lines, as if not knowing to which side they belonged, like ships floating about without rudders.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Claudius, when he had striven in vain to advance up the hill, repeatedly calling out to his soldiers, <quote>To what purpose then have we performed so long a march with such expedition?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> when he found it impossible to make his way to the enemy in that quarter, withdrawing several cohorts from the right wing, where he saw they would occupy an inactive station, rather than join in the fight, led them round the rear of the line, and, to the surprise not only of the enemy but his own party, charged their right flank;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and such was their rapidity, that after showing themselves on their flank, they almost immediately made an attack on their rear. Thus on all sides, in front, flank, and rear, the Spaniards and Ligurians were cut to pieces; and now the carnage had even reached the Gauls.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Here the least opposition was found; for a great number

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> of them had quitted their standards, having slunk off during the night, and laid themselves down to sleep up and down the fields, while even those who were present, being tired with marching and watching, for their bodies are most intolerant of fatigue, could scarcely carry their arms upon their shoulders.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> And now it was midday, and thirst and heat gave them over to the enemy to be killed or captured in multitudes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>More elephants were killed by their guides than by the enemy. They used to have with them a workman's knife, with a mallet. When these beasts began to grow furious, and attack their own party, the rider, placing this knife between the ears, just on the joint by which the neck is connected with the head, used to drive it in, striking it with all the force he could.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was found to be the most expeditious mode of putting these bulky animals to death, when they had destroyed all hope of governing them. This method was first practised by Hasdrubal, a general whose conduct both frequently on other occasions, and especially in this battle, deserved to be recorded.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By encouraging the men when fighting, and sharing equally in every danger, he kept up the battle. Sometimes by entreating, at other times by rebuking, the troops, when tired and indisposed to fight from <pb id="p.1158" n="1158"/>weariness and over-exertion, he rekindled their spirits.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He called back the flying, and restored the battle in many places when it had been given up. At length, when fortune decidedly declared for the Romans, lest he should survive so great an army which had been collected under the influence of his name, he put spurs to his horse and rushed upon a Roman cohort, where he fell fighting, as was worthy of the son of Hamilcar and the brother of Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At no time during that war were so many of the enemy slain in one battle;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> so that a defeat equal to that sustained at Cannae, whether in respect of the loss of the general or the troops, was considered to have been retorted upon him. Fifty-six thousand of the enemy were slain, five thousand four hundred captured.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The other booty was great, both of every other kind, and also of gold and silver. In addition to the rest, there were recovered above four thousand Roman citizens, who had been taken by the enemy, which formed some consolation for the soldiers lost in that battle. For the victory was by no means bloodless.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Much about eight thousand of the Romans and the allies were slain; and so completely were even the victors satiated with blood and slaughter, that the next day, when Livius the consul received intelligence that the Cisalpine Gauls and Ligurians, who had either not been present at the battle or had made their escape from the carnage, were marching off in one body without a certain leader, without standards, without any discipline or subordination;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that if one squadron of horse were sent against them they might be all destroyed, he replied, <quote>Let some survive to bear the news of the enemy's losses and of our valour.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nero set out on the night following the battle, and marching at a more rapid rate than when he came, arrived at his camp before the enemy on the sixth day.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As he was not preceded by a messenger, fewer people attended him on his march; but the joy felt was so great, that they were almost insane with delight.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither state of feeling at Rome can be well described or told, whether that in which the citizens were when in doubtful expectation of the issue, or when they received the intelligence of victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Every day, from the time that news arrived that the consul Claudius had set out, from sunrise to sunset, none of the senators ever quitted the senate-house, or did the people depart from the forum. The <pb id="p.1159" n="1159"/>matrons, as they had themselves no means of affording assistance, had recourse to prayers and entreaties, and going about to all the temples, wearied the gods with vows and supplications.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While the city was in this state of solicitude and suspense, a vague report first arrived that two Narnian horsemen had come from the field of battle into the camp which stood as a defence in the entrance to Umbria, with intelligence that the enemy were cut to pieces.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first they rather heard than credited this news, as being too great and too joyful for the mind to take in, or obtain a firm belief.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even the very rapidity with which it had arrived formed an obstacle to its reception; for it was stated that the battle took place two days before. After this a letter was brought which had been sent by Lucius Manlius Acidinus, from his camp, on the subject of the arrival of the Narnian horsemen.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This letter being conveyed through the forum to the tribunal of the praetor, drew the senators out of the senate-house;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and with such eagerness and hurry did the people crowd to the doors of the senate-house, that the messenger could not approach, but was dragged off by persons who asked him questions, and demanded vociferously that the letter should be read on the rostrum before it was read in the senate. At length they were put back and restrained by the magistrates; and thus the joy was gradually dispensed to their overpowered spirits.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The letter was read first in the senate, and then in the assembly of the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The effect was various, according to the difference in the cast of men's minds, some thinking that there were already sure grounds for rejoicing, while others would place no confidence in the news, till they listened to ambassadors, or a letter from the consuls.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this, news came that the ambassadors themselves were on the point of arriving. Then, indeed, people of all ages ran to meet them, each man being eager to be the first to

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> receive an assurance of such joyful tidings, by the evidence of his eyes and ears.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> One continued train extended as far as the Mulvian bridge. The ambassadors, Lucius Veturius Philo, Publius Licinius Varus, and Quintus Caecilius Metellus, made their way into the forum, surrounded by a crowd of persons of every description; when some asked the ambassadors them-selves, others their attendants, what had been done;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and, as <pb id="p.1160" n="1160"/>soon as each had heard that the army and general of the enemy had been cut off, that the Roman legions were safe, and the consuls unhurt, he immediately imparted the joyful intelligence to others, imparting to them the joy he felt himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having with difficulty made their way into the senate-house, and the crowd with still more difficulty being removed, that they might not mix with the fathers, the letter was read in the senate; after which the ambassadors were brought into the general assembly.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Veturius Philo, after reading the letter himself, gave a more explicit account of all that had occurred, amidst great approbation, and at last of general shouting from the assembly, while their minds could scarcely contain their joy.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They then ran off in various directions, some to the different temples of the gods, to return thanks, others to their homes, to impart the joyful intelligence to their wives and children.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate decreed a supplication for three days, because Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius, the consuls, had cut off the general and legions of the enemy, their own army being safe. This supplication Caius Hostilius, the praetor, proclaimed in the assembly, and was celebrated both by men and women.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> During the whole three days all the temples were uniformly crowded, whilst the matrons, dressed in their richest robes, and accompanied by their children, just as though the war had been brought to a conclusion, and free from every apprehension, offered thanksgivings to the immortal gods.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This victory produced an alteration also in the condition of the state, so that immediately from this event, just as though it had been a time of peace, men were not afraid to do business with each other, buying, selling, lending, and paying borrowed money.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Caius Claudius, the consul, on his return to his camp, ordered the head of Hasdrubal, which he had carefully kept and brought with him, to be thrown before the advanced guards of the enemy, and the African prisoners to be shown to them bound just as they were.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Two of these also he unbound, and bid them go to Hannibal and tell him what had occurred. Hannibal, smitten by such severe distress, at once public and domestic, is said to have declared that he recognised the destiny of Carthage;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and decamping thence with the intention of drawing together into Bruttium, the remotest corner of Italy, all his <pb id="p.1161" n="1161"/>auxiliaries which he could not protect when widely scattered, removed into Bruttium the whole state of the Metapontines, summoned away from their former habitations, and also such of the Lucanians as were under his authority.</p></div1> <div1 type="book" n="28"><head>BOOK XXVIII.</head>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AT the time when Spain appeared to be relieved in proportion to the degree in which the weight of the war was removed into Italy, by the passage of Hasdrubal, another war sprang up there equal in magnitude to the former.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At this juncture, the Romans and Carthaginians thus occupied Spain: Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, had retired quite to the ocean and Gades;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the coast of our sea, and almost the whole of that part of Spain which lies eastward, was subject to Scipio and the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The new general, Hanno, who had passed over from Africa, to supply the place of the Barcine Hasdrubal, with a new army, and formed a junction with Mago, having in a short time armed a large number of men in Celtiberia, which lies in the midway between

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the two seas, Scipio sent Marcus Silanus against him, with no more than ten thousand infantry and five hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Silanus, by marching with all the haste he could, (though the ruggedness of the roads, and narrow defiles obstructed with thick woods, which are <pb id="p.1162" n="1162"/>very frequent in Spain, impeded him,) yet being guided by deserters from Celtiberia, natives of that place, reached the enemy, anticipating not only messengers but even all rumour of his coming.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From the same source he ascertained, when they were about ten thousand paces from the enemy, that they had two camps, one on each side of the road in which they were marching; that the Celtiberians, a newly-raised army, in number above nine thousand, were on the left, and that the Carthaginian camp was stationed on the right.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The latter was secured and protected by outposts, watches, and every kind of regular military guard, while the former was disorderly and neglected, as belonging to barbarians, who were raw soldiers, and were under the less apprehension, because they were in their own country.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Silanus, concluding that this was the camp to be attacked first, ordered the troops to march as much as possible towards the left, lest he should be observed from any point by the Carthaginian outposts, and sending scouts in advance, pushed on towards the enemy at a rapid pace.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He was now about three thousand paces from the enemy, when as yet none of them had perceived him. The ground was covered with craggy places, and hills overgrown with bushes.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Here in a hollow valley, and on that account unexposed to the view, he ordered his men to sit down and take refreshment.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the mean time the scouts returned, confirming the statements of the deserters. Then the Romans, collecting their baggage in the centre, took arms, and marched to battle in regular array. They were a thousand paces off when they were descried by the enemy, when suddenly all began to be in a state of hurry and confusion. At the first shout and tumult, Mago quitted the camp and rode up at full speed.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As there were in the Celtiberian army four thousand targeteers and two hundred horsemen, this regular legion, as it formed the flower of his troops, he stationed in the first line; the rest, composed of light-armed, he posted in reserve.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While he was leading them out of the camp thus marshalled, the Romans discharged their javelins at them before they had scarcely cleared the rampart.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Spaniards stooped down to avoid the javelins thrown at them by the enemy, and then rose up to discharge their own in turn; which the Romans <pb id="p.1163" n="1163"/>having received according to their custom in close array, with their shields firmly united, they then engaged foot to foot, and began to fight with their swords.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the ruggedness of the ground, while it rendered ineffectual the agility of the Celtiberians, who were accustomed to a skirmishing kind of battle, was at the same time not unfavourable to the Romans, who were accustomed to a steady kind of

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> fight, except that the narrow passes and the bushes, which grew here and there, broke their ranks, and they were compelled to engage one against one, and two against two, as if matched together.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The same circumstance which obstructed the enemy's flight, delivered them up, as it were, bound for slaughter.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And now when almost all the targeteers had been slain, the light-armed and the Carthaginians, who had come up to their assistance from the other camp, having been thrown into confusion, were put to the sword.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not more than two thousand of the infantry, and all the cavalry, fled from the field with Mago before the battle was well begun. The other general, Hanno, was taken alive, together with those who came up when the battle was now decided.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Almost the whole of the cavalry and the veteran infantry, following Mago in his flight, came to Hasdrubal on the tenth day in the province of Gades. The newly-raised Celtiberian troops, stealing off to the neighbouring woods, fled thence to their homes.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By this very seasonable victory, a stop was put to a war which was not by any means so considerable as that to which it would have grown, had the enemy been allowed, after having prevailed upon the Celtiberians to join them, to solicit other nations also to take up arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Scipio, therefore, having liberally bestowed the highest commendations on Silanus, and entertaining a hope that he might bring the war to a termination, if he did not impede it by a want of activity on his own part, proceeded into the remotest part of Spain against Hasdrubal.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Carthaginian, who then happened to be encamped in Baetica, in order to prevent his allies from wavering in their allegiance, retired quite to the ocean and Gades, in a manner much more resembling a flight than a march.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He was afraid, however, that while he kept his forces together, he should form the principal object of attack. Before he crossed the strait to Gades he sent them into different cities, that they might both <pb id="p.1164" n="1164"/>provide for their own safety by the help of walls, and for that of the town by their arms.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, seeing the enemy's forces thus distributed, and that to carry about his forces to each of the several cities would be rather tedious than important, marched his army back.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not to leave all that country, however, to the Carthaginians, he sent his brother, Lucius Scipio, at the head of ten thousand foot and one thousand horse, to besiege the most important city of that quarter, called by the barbarians Orinx, and situated on the borders of the Milesians, a nation of Spain so called.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The soil is fertile, and even silver is dug out of it by the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This place served as a fort to Hasdrubal, from which he might make incursions on the inland states. Scipio encamped near the city. Before he formed his lines round it, he sent to the gates to sound the inclinations of the inhabitants, by a direct interview, and persuade them to make trial of the friendship of the Romans rather than of their power.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As they answered nothing of a friendly nature, he threw a double trench and rampart round the place, dividing his army into three parts, in order that one division might assault it while the other two rested.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The first of these beginning the attack, a furious and doubtful contest ensued.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was by no means easy to approach and bring the ladders to the walls, on account of the weapons which fell upon them; and even of those persons who had raised them, some were thrown down with forks made for the purpose, others were in danger of being laid hold of by iron grapples, and dragged up hanging to the wall.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, seeing that the contest was equalized owing to the fewness of his party, and that the enemy, fighting from the wall, were superior to him, called off the first division and attacked them with the two others together.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This so terrified the besieged, who were already fatigued with fighting with the former, that not only the townsmen forsook the walls in sudden flight, but the Carthaginian garrison, fearing that the town had been betrayed, also quitted their posts and collected themselves into a body.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Upon this the inhabitants began to be alarmed, lest if the enemy broke into the town they should kill all they met indiscriminately, Carthaginian or Spaniard.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They therefore suddenly threw open the gates and rushed out of the <pb id="p.1165" n="1165"/>town, holding their shields before them, lest any weapons should be cast at them from a distance, and stretching out to view their bare right hands, that it might be seen they had thrown away their swords.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Whether this was not observed, in consequence of the distance, or whether some deception was suspected, is not known; but an attack was made on the deserters, and they were put to death as a hostile force.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Through this gate the enemy marched into the city in battle-array. The other gates were cut through and broken down with axes and sledges; and as each horseman entered, he galloped off to seize the forum, as had been ordered. A body of veteran troops were also added to the horse to support them.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The legionary troops spread themselves in every part of the city, but neither killed nor plundered any, except such as defended themselves with arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All the Carthaginians were put under guard, with more than three hundred of the inhabitants, who had shut the gates.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The rest had the town put into their hands, and their property restored. About two thousand of the enemy fell in the assault on this city, and not more than ninety of the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the taking of this town was a source of great joy to those who effected it, as well as to the general and the rest of the army, so their approach to their camp also presented a splendid spectacle, on account of the immense crowd of captives they drove before them.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio, having bestowed high commendations upon his brother, representing the capture of Orinx as equal in importance to the capture of Carthage by himself, led his forces back into hither Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He could not make an attempt on Gades, or pursue the army of Hasdrubal, now dispersed through all parts of the province, in consequence of the approach of winter.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore dismissed the legions into winter quarters, and sent his brother Lucius Scipio with Hanno, the enemy's general, and other distinguished prisoners, to Rome, while he retired himself to Tarraco.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the same year, the Roman fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus, the proconsul, sailing over from Sicily into Africa, devastated to a wide extent the fields about Utica and Carthage. They carried off plunder from the remotest borders of the Carthaginian territory around the very walls of Utica.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On their return to Sicily they were met by <pb id="p.1166" n="1166"/>a Carthaginian fleet of seventy ships of war, of which seventeen were taken and four sunk; the rest were dispersed and compelled to fly.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans, victorious both by land and sea, returned to Lilybaeum with immense booty of every kind. The ships of the enemy having thus been driven from the whole sea, large supplies of corn were conveyed to Rome.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>




















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the summer in which these events occurred, Publius Sulpicius, proconsul, and king Attalus, having passed the winter at Aegina, as before observed, united their fleets, consisting of twenty-three Roman quinqueremes and thirty-five belonging to the king, and proceeded to Lemnos.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Philip also, that he might be prepared for every kind of measure, whether it should be necessary to meet the enemy on land or sea, came down to the coast of Demetrias and appointed to his army a day on which to meet him at Larissa.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the news of the king's arrival, ambassadors from his allies came to Demetrias from all sides. For the Aetolians, inspirited both by their

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> alliance with the Romans and the approach of king Attalus, were ravaging the neighbouring states;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> not only the Acarnanians, B&oelig;otians, and Eub&oelig;ans were very much alarmed, but the Achaeans also were kept in a state of terror, both by the hostile proceedings of the Aetolians, and also by Machanidas, tyrant of Lacedaemon, who had encamped at a short distance from the borders of the Argives.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All of these stating the dangers which threatened their possessions, both by land and sea, entreated succour from the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Philip received accounts even from his own kingdom, that things were not in a state of tranquillity; that both Scerdiledus and Pleuratus were in motion, and that some of the Thracians, and particularly the Maedians, would certainly make incursions on the contiguous provinces of Macedonia, should the king be occupied with a distant war.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The B&oelig;otians, indeed, and the people inhabiting the inland parts of Greece, told him that the Aetolians had obstructed by a ditch and rampart the straits of Thermopylae, where the road is very narrow and confined, in order to prevent their passing to the assistance of the allied states.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So many disturbances arising on all hands were sufficient to awaken an inactive general. He dismissed the ambassadors, promising to assist them all according as opportunity and circum- <pb id="p.1167" n="1167"/>stances allowed.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For the present, he sent to Peparethus a body of troops to garrison the city, for this was the most urgent business, as information had been received thence that Attalus, crossing over to Lemnos, was devastating all the neighbouring country.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He sent Polyphantas with a small detachment to B&oelig;otia, and also Menippus, one of his guards, with one thousand targeteers (the target is not unlike the ordinary buckler) to Chalcis.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Five hundred Agrianians were added, that every part of the island might be secured. He went himself to Scotussa, and ordered the Macedonian soldiers to be removed thither from Larissa.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Here he heard that the Aetolians had been summoned to an assembly at Heraclea, and that king

<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> Attalus was to come and advise with them as to the conduct of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Determining to interrupt this meeting by his sudden approach, he led his troops by forced marches to Heraclea, where he arrived just after the assembly had broken up. However, he destroyed the crops, which were nearly ripe, particularly those round the Aenian bay.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He then marched back to Scotussa, and leaving there the main army, retired to Demetrias with the royal guards. In order to be prepared against every attempt of the enemy, he sent persons hence to Phocis, Eub&oelig;a, and Peparethus, to select elevated situations, from which fires lighted upon them might be seen from a distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> He fixed a watchtower on Tisaeum, a mountain whose summit is prodigiously high, in order that when the enemy made any attempt he might instantly receive intimation of it by means of fires lighted up at a distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The Roman general and king Attalus then passed over from Peparethus to Nicaea, and thence sailed to Orcus, the first city of Eub&oelig;a, on the left as you proceed to Chalcis and the Euripus from the bay of Demetrias.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It was agreed upon between Attalus and Sulpicius, that the Romans should attack the town on the side neat the sea, and the king's forces on the land side.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Four days after the fleet arrived, they attacked the city. That time had been employed in private conferences with Plator, whom Philip had put in command of the place.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The city has two citadels, one overhanging the coasts, the other in the middle of the town, from which there is a subterraneous passage to the ocean, whose entrance next the sea is defended <pb id="p.1168" n="1168"/>by a strong fortification, a tower five stories high.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here the affair commenced with a most furious contest, the tower being furnished with all kinds of weapons, and engines and machines of every kind for the purpose of the assault having been landed from the ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While the eyes and attention of all were turned to that quarter, Plator opened one of the gates and received the Romans into the citadel next the sea, which they instantly became masters of.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The inhabitants, driven thence, fled to the other citadel in the middle of the city; but there had been troops posted there to shut the gates against them; so that, being thus excluded, they were surrounded and either slain or made prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Meanwhile the Macedonian garrison stood under the wall of the citadel, formed into a compact body, neither confusedly attempting a retreat, nor obstinately engaging in a contest.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These men Plator, after obtaining permission from Sulpicius, put on board ships and landed them at Demetrias in Phthiotis; he himself withdrew to Attalus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sulpicius, elated with the success at Oreum, gained with so much ease, proceeded to Chalcis with his victorious fleet, where the issue by no means answered his expectations.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The sea, which is wide on both sides, being here contracted into a narrow strait, might perhaps, at first view, exhibit the appearance of two harbours facing the two entrances of the Euripus.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It would be difficult to find a station more dangerous for shipping; for not only do the winds come down with great violence from the high mountains on each side, but the strait itself of the Euripus does not ebb and flow seven times a day at stated times, as is reported, but the current changing irregularly, like the wind, now this way now that, is hurried along like a torrent rolling headlong down a steep mountain, so that no quiet is given to vessels there day or night.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But not only did so perilous a station receive his ships, but the town was strong and impregnable, covered on one side by the sea, and very well fortified on the other towards the land, secured by a strong garrison, and above all, by the fidelity of the prefects and principal men, which was wavering and unsettled at Oreum.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Though the business had been rashly undertaken, the Roman still acted with prudence, in so far as he speedily gave up the attempt, after he had seen all the difficulties which sur- <pb id="p.1169" n="1169"/>rounded him, that he might not waste time, and passed his fleet over from thence to Cynus in Locris, the port of the town of Opus, which is one mile distant from the sea.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip had received notice of this from Oreum, by the signal fires; but through the treachery of Plator they were raised from the watch-tower at a later period.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As he was not a match for the enemy's forces at sea, it was difficult for him to approach the island; and thus, by delay, the opportunity was lost. He moved with promptness to the assistance of Chalcis as soon as he received the signal. For although Chalcis is a city of the same island, yet it is separated from the continent by so narrow a strait, that they communicate by means of a bridge, and the approach to it is easier by land than by water.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philip therefore, going from Demetrias to Scotussa, and setting out thence at the third watch, dislodged the guard, put to flight the Aetolians who kept the pass of Thermopylae, and drove the enemy in confusion to Heraclea, marching in one day to Elatia in Phocis, a distance of above sixty miles.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Almost on the same day the town of Opus was taken and plundered by Attalus. Sulpicius had given it up to the king because Oreum had been plundered a few days before by the Roman soldiers, the royal soldiers not having shared the booty.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman fleet having retired thither, Attalus, who was not aware of Philip's approach, wasted time in levying contributions from the principal inhabitants, and so sudden was

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> his coming, that had he not been descried by some Cretans, who happened to go farther from the town than usual in quest of forage, he might have been surprised.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He fled hastily to the sea and his ships, without arms, and in the greatest disorder. Just as they were putting off from the land Philip arrived, and even from the shore created much alarm among the mariners.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He returned thence to Opus, accusing both gods and men, because he had lost an opportunity of so great importance, almost snatched from his hands.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He also reproached the Opuntians with the like anger, because they had, immediately on sight of the enemy, made almost a voluntary surrender, though they might have prolonged the siege till his arrival. Having settled affairs at Opus, he proceeded thence to Thronium. Attalus, too, at first retired from Oreum; but there receiving intelligence that Prusias, king of Bithynia, had invaded his <pb id="p.1170" n="1170"/>kingdom, he withdrew his attention from the Romans and the Aetolian war, and passed over into Asia.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Sulpicius also withdrew his fleet to Aegina, from whence he had set out in the beginning of spring. Philip took Thronium with as little difficulty as Attalus had at Opus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was inhabited by foreigners, fugitives from Thebes in Phthiotis, who, on the capture of their own town by Philip, had fled to the protection of the Aetolians, and received from them a city as a settlement which had been laid waste and desolated in a former war by the same Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Having recovered Thronium, as has been a little before mentioned, he set out thence; and having taken Tritonos and Drymae, inconsiderable towns of Doris, he came thence to Elatia, where he had ordered the ambassadors of Ptolemy and the Rhodians to wait for him.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> While consulting there as to the best method of bringing the Aetolian war to a conclusion, (for these ambassadors attended the late council of the Romans and Aetolians at Heraclea,) intelligence is brought that Machanidas intended to attack the Elians while busied in preparing for the celebration of the Olympic games.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thinking it his duty to prevent such an attempt, he dismissed the ambassadors with a gracious answer to the effect, that he had neither caused the war, nor would he

<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> be any obstacle to the restoration of peace, if it should be possible on equitable and honourable terms;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> then marching quickly through B&oelig;otia he came down from Megara, and thence to Corinth, where receiving supplies of provisions, he went to Phlius and Pheneus. And now, when he had proceeded as far as Heraea, having received intelligence that Machanidas, terrified at the news of

<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> his approach, had retreated to Lacedaemon, he betook himself to Aegium, where the Achaeans were assembled in council, expecting at the same time to meet there a Carthaginian fleet, which he had sent for, in order that he might accomplish something by sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But the Carthaginians had left a few days before, and were gone to the Oxean islands; and thence, hearing that the Romans and Attalus had left Oreum, to the harbours of the Acarnanians, for they feared that it was intended to attack them, and that they would be overpowered while within the straits of Rhium, which is the name of the entrance of the Corinthian bay.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip was grieved and vexed when he reflected, that <pb id="p.1171" n="1171"/>though he proceeded with the utmost speed on all occasions, yet he had not come up in time to accomplish any one object, and that fortune had frustrated his activity by snatching away every advantage from before his eyes.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the assembly, however, concealing his chagrin, he discoursed with elated spirits, calling gods and men to witness, that <quote>he had never been wanting at any time or place, so as not to repair instantly wherever the enemy's arms resounded, but that it was difficult to calculate whether the war was carried on more boldly by him or more pusillanimously by the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Such was the manner in which Attalus had slipped out of his hands from Opus; Sulpicius from Chalcis; and so, within these few days, Machanidas.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That flight, however, was not always successful; and that that should not be esteemed a difficult war in which victory would be certain if the enemy could be brought to a regular engagement.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had already obtained one very great advantage, which was a confession on the part of the enemy themselves, that they were not a match for him; and in a short time,</quote> he said, <quote>he would be in possession of undoubted victory;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for that he would engage with him with a result no better than their expectations.</quote> The allies listened to the king with great satisfaction.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then gave up to the Achaeans Heraera and Triphylia. Aliphera he restored to the Megalopolitans, they having brought satisfactory proof that it belonged to their territories.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then having received some ships from the Achaeans, three quadriremes and three biremes, he sailed to Anticyra, whence with seven quinqueremes and more than twenty barks, which he had sent to the bay of Corinth

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> to join the Carthaginian fleet, he proceeded to Erythrae, a town of the Aetolians near Eupalium, where he made a descent.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He was not unobserved by the Aetolians; for all who were either in the fields or in the neighbouring forts of Potidania and Apollonia, fled to the woods and mountains. The cattle which they could not drive off in their haste they seized and put on board.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He sent Nicias, praetor of the Achaeans, to Aegium with these and the other boot; and then going to Corinth, ordered his army to march by land through B&oelig;otia, while he himself, sailing from Cenchrea along the coast of Attica, round the promontory of Sunium, reached Chalcis, having passed almost through the midst of the enemy's fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After commending in the highest terms their fidelity <pb id="p.1172" n="1172"/>and bravery, as neither fear nor hope had influenced their minds, and after exhorting them to show the same fidelity in maintaining the alliance, he sailed to Oreum;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and having placed such of the chief inhabitants as chose to fly, rather than surrender to the Romans, in the command of the city and the direction of affairs, he sailed over from Eub&oelig;a to Demetrias, from which place he at first set out to succour his allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> After this, having laid the keels of one hundred ships of war at Cassandria, and collected a large number of ship carpenters for the completion of that business, and as both the departure of Attalus and the seasonable assistance he had brought to his allies had tranquillized affairs in Greece, he retired into his own dominions, in order to make war upon the Dardanians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Just at the close of the summer during which these operations were carried on in Greece, when Quintus Fabius, son of Maximus, ambassador from Marcus Livius the consul, brought a message to Rome to the senate, to the effect, that the consul considered that Lucius Portius with his legions formed a sufficient protection for the province, that he

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> might himself retire thence, and that the consular army might be withdrawn, the fathers directed that not only Livius should return to the city, but also his colleague, Caius Claudius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The only difference made between them in the decree was, that they ordered the army of Marcus Livius to be led back, and the legions of Nero to remain in their province opposed to Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls agreed between themselves by letter, that as they had conducted the affairs of the commonwealth with unanimity, they should arrive at the city at the same time, though they came from different quarters. He who arrived first at Praeneste was enjoined to wait there for his colleague.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It so happened that they both came to Praeneste on the same day, and thence, sending a proclamation before them, directing that there should be a full attendance of the senate at the temple of Bellona, three days after, they came up to the city, when they were met by the whole body of the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only did the whole body pour around them and salute them, but each person individually, desiring to touch the victorious right hands of the consuls, some congratulated them, while others thanked them because by their services the state had been preserved.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the senate, when, <pb id="p.1173" n="1173"/>having made a recital of their services according to the custom observed by all generals, they had requested, that <quote>in consideration of the brave and successful conduct of the affairs of the commonwealth, honours should be paid to the immortal gods, and they themselves enter the city in triumph;</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the fathers replied, that <quote>they most willingly decreed those things which they requested in gratitude to the gods in the first instance, and, next to them, to the consuls.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A supplication in the name of both, and a triumph to both of them, having been decreed, lest after having carried on the war with entire unanimity they should have a separate triumph, they made the following agreement;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that <quote>since both the service had been performed in the province of Marcus Livius, and he was in possession of the command on the day on which the battle was fought, and further, that as the army of Livius had been withdrawn and had come to Rome, while Nero's could not be withdrawn from the province, Marcus Livius should enter the city in a four-horse chariot and followed by the soldiers; Caius Claudius on horseback without soldiers.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This plan of associating the generals in the triumph increased the glory of both, but particularly of him who had yielded to his colleague in the honours he received, as much as he surpassed him in merit.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The people said, that <quote>the general on horseback had traversed the whole length of Italy in the space of six days, and had fought a pitched battle with Hasdrubal in Gaul, on the very day on which Hannibal supposed that he was occupying a camp pitched in Apulia to oppose him.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That thus one consul, acting in defence of either extremity of Italy against two leaders, had opposed against one his skill, against the other his person.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> That the name of Nero had been sufficient to confine Hannibal within his camp, while with regard to Hasdrubal, by what, but his arrival, had he been overwhelmed and annihilated?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The other consul might move along raised aloft in a chariot, drawn if he pleased by a number of horses, but that the real triumph was his who was conveyed by one horse;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> and that Nero, though he should go on foot, would be immortalized, whether on account of the glory he had acquired in the war, or the contempt he had shown for it in the triumph.</quote> Such continual expressions of the spectators attended Nero all the way to the Capitol.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The money they brought into the treasury was three hundred <pb id="p.1174" n="1174"/>thousand sesterces, with eighty thousand asses of brass. Marcus Livius distributed among the soldiers fifty-six asses each.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Caius Claudius promised the same sum to his absent troops when he returned to the army. It was observed that more verses were written by the soldiery upon Caius Claudius in their jocular style, than upon their own consul;

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> that the horsemen highly extolled Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius, lieutenant-generals, and exhorted the commons to create them consuls for the ensuing year;

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> that the consuls added their authority to the recommendation of the knights, relating in the public assembly the following day with what courage and fidelity their two lieutenant-generals in particular had served them.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the time for the elections approached, and it was resolved that it should be held by a dictator, the consul Caius Claudius nominated as dictator his colleague Marcus Livius, who appointed Quintus Caecilius his master of the horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius were created consuls by Marcus Livius the dictator, the latter being then master of the horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After this the election of praetors was held. The persons appointed were, Caius Servilius, Marcus Caecilius Metellus, Titus Claudius Asellus, and Quintus Mamilius Turinus, who was at that time plebeian aedile.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the elections were finished, the dictator, having abdicated his office and dismissed his army, set out for his province of Etruria, according to a

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> decree of the senate, to make inquiry what states of the Tuscans and Umbrians had formed schemes of revolt from the Romans to Hasdrudal at the time of his approach, and what states had assisted him with auxiliaries, provisions, or succours of any kind. Such were the transactions this year at home and abroad.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman games were thrice repeated in full by the curule aediles, Cneius Servilius Caepio and Servius Cornelius Lentulus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the same manner the plebeian games also were once repeated entire by the plebeian aediles, Manius Pomponius Matho and Quintus Mamilius Thurinus.</p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In the thirteenth year of the Punic war, when Lucius Veturius Philo and Quintus Caecilius Metellus were consuls, Bruttium was assigned to both of them, as their province, to carry on the war with Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The praetors then cast lots for their provinces: Marcus Caecilius Metellus had the city <pb id="p.1175" n="1175"/>jurisdiction; Quintus Mamilius, the foreign; Caius Servilius, Sicily; Tiberius Claudius, Sardinia. The armies were distributed thus:

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> to one of the consuls was given the army which Caius Claudius the consul of the former year, to the other that which Quintus Claudius the proprietor, had commanded, consisting of two legions each.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was decreed that Marcus Livius, proconsul, who was continued in command for the year, should take the two legions of volunteer slaves from Caius Terentius

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> the propraetor, and that Quintus Mamilius, transferring his judicial business to his colleague, should occupy Gaul with the army which Lucius Porcius, the praetor, had commanded, with orders to lay waste the lands of those Gauls who had revolted to the Carthaginians on the approach of Hasdrubal.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The protection of Sicily was assigned to Caius Servilius with the two legions which fought at Cannae, in the same manner as Caius Mamilius had held it.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The old army which Aulus Hostilius had commanded was conveyed out of Sardinia, and the consuls enlisted a new legion, which Tiberius Claudius might take over with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Quintus Claudius and Caius Hostilius Tubulus were continued in command for a year, that the former might hold Tarentum as his province, the latter, Capua.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Marcus Valerius, the proconsul, to whom had been committed the protection of the sea-coast round Sicily, was ordered to deliver thirty ships to Caius Servilius, and return to the city with all the rest of the fleet.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In a state where the greatest anxiety prevailed, in consequence of the very critical situation in which the war stood, and where all events, prosperous or adverse, were attributed to the interposition of the gods, accounts of many prodigies were received;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that the temple of Jupiter at Tarracina, and that of Mater Matuta at Satricum, had been struck by lightning. The people of Satricum were no less terrified by two snakes gliding into the temple of Jupiter by the very doors.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A report was brought from Antium, that bloody ears of corn had been seen by the reapers. At Caere a pig with two heads had been littered, and a lamb yeaned which was both male and female.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Intelligence was brought that two suns ha been seen at Alba, and that light had suddenly appeared luring night at Fregellae. An ox was reported to have spoken in the Roman territory.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A copious perspiration was said to <pb id="p.1176" n="1176"/>have exuded from the altar of Neptune, in the Flaminian circus; and the temples of Ceres, Safety, and Quirinus were said to have been struck by lightning.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls were directed to expiate these prodigies with victims of the larger sort, and to make a supplication for one day. These things were executed according to a decree of the senate. The extinction of the fire in the temple of Vesta struck more terror upon the minds of men than all the prodigies which were reported from abroad, or seen at home; and the vestal, who had the guarding of it for that night, was scourged by the command of Publius Licinius the pontiff.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although this event was not appointed by the gods as a portent, but had happened through human neglect, yet it was thought proper that it should be expiated with victims of the larger sort, and that a supplication should be made at the temple of Vesta.</p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Before the consuls set out for the campaign, they were cautioned by the senate to take care that the common people should be brought back into the country; for since, through the goodness of the gods, the war was removed from the city of Rome and Latium, the country might be inhabited without fear. That it was most inconsistent that greater care should be taken in cultivating Sicily than Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But it was a matter by no means easy for the people, the free labourers having been cut off by war, and there being a scarcity of slaves, their cattle having been carried off as booty, and the farmhouses pulled down or burnt.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A large number, however, compelled by the authority of the consuls, returned into the country. The mention of this affair had been occasioned by ambassadors of Placentia and Cremona, who complained that their lands were being invaded and laid waste by the neighbouring Gauls; that a large portion of their settlers had dispersed; that their cities were thinly inhabited, and their lands devastated and deserted.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Mamilius the praetor was charged with the protection of the colonies from the enemy. The consuls, in conformity with a decree of the senate, issued an edict that all who were citizens of Cremona and Placentia should return to those colonies before a certain day; after which, in the beginning of spring, they set out for the campaign.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Quintus Caecilius, the consul, received the army from Caius Nero; Lucius Veturius received his from Quintus Claudius the proprietor, filling it up with new- <pb id="p.1177" n="1177"/>raised soldiers, whom he had himself enlisted.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consuls marched their army into the territory of Consentia, and devastating the country on all hands, when the troops were loaded with plunder, they were thrown into such confusion by some Bruttians and Numidian spearmen, who attacked them in a narrow defile, that not only the booty but the troops were in danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There was more of confusion, however, than fighting; and sending the booty in advance, the legions themselves also escaped into a place free from danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Proceeding thence into Lucania, the whole of that people returned, without a contest, into subjection to the Roman people.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No action with Hannibal took place this year; for neither did he present himself after the public and personal calamity so recently inflicted, and the Romans did not provoke him while he remained quiet, such power did they consider that single general possessed, though every thing else around him was falling into ruin.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Indeed I know not whether he was not more deserving of admiration in adversity than in prosperity;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> inasmuch as though he carried on a war in the territory of enemies through a period of thirteen years, at so great a distance from home, with varying success, and with an army not composed of his own countrymen, but made up of the offscouring of all nations, without communion of laws, customs, or language, different in their appearance, their dress, their arms, their religious ceremonies and observances, and I had almost said, their gods;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> yet he so effectually united them by some one bond, that no disturbance ever arose either among the soldiers themselves, or between them and their general, though he often wanted money to pay them, and provisions, as being in

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> a hostile country, through want of which, in the former Punic war, many dreadful transactions had occurred between the generals and their soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But after the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, in which all hopes of victory had been treasured up; and after retiring from the possession of every other part of Italy by withdrawing into Bruttium, one corner of it; to whom does it not appear wonderful that no disturbance arose in the camp?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For to other circumstances this also was added, that he had no hope of subsisting his army, except from the lands of Bruttium, which, though they were all cultivated, would be very <pb id="p.1178" n="1178"/>insufficient for the maintenance of so large an army.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Besides, many of the youth were drawn off from the cultivation of the fields, and engaged in the war; and a custom also prevailed among the people of that nation, grafted on a naturally depraved inclination, of carrying on a predatory kind of warfare.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nor did he receive any supplies from home, where they were anxious about the retention of Spain, as if every thing was going on prosperously in Italy. In Spain the state of affairs was in one respect similar, but in another widely different;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> similar in that the Carthaginians, having been defeated with the loss of their general, had been driven to the remotest coast of that country, even to the ocean;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but different, because Spain, both from the nature of the country and the genius of its inhabitants, was better adapted not only than Italy, but than any other part of the world, for renewing a war.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And accordingly, therefore, though this was the first of the provinces on the continent which the Romans entered, it was the last which was at length reduced, in the present age, under the conduct and auspices of Augustus Caesar.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Here Hasdrubal, son of Gisco, the greatest and most renowned general concerned in the war, next to the Barcine family, returning from Gades, and encouraged in his hopes of reviving the war by Mago, son of Hamilcar, by means of levies made throughout the Farther Spain, armed as many as fifty thousand foot and four thousand five hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> With regard to his mounted force, authors are pretty much agreed, but some state that seventy thousand infantry were led to the city Silpia.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Here the two Carthaginian generals sat down on open plains, with a determination not to avoid a battle.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Scipio received an account of the collection of so large an army, he felt convinced that he would not be a match for so great a multitude with the Roman legions only, without making a show at least of the auxiliary troops of the barbarians;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> at the same time that he did not think it right that they should form so large a portion of his force as to occasion important consequences if they should change sides, which had brought ruin upon his father and his uncle.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore, sending forward Silanus to Colca, who was sovereign of twenty-eight towns, to receive from him the infantry and cavalry, which he promised to enlist during the <pb id="p.1179" n="1179"/>winter, he himself set out from Tarraco;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and collecting small bodies of auxiliaries from his allies, who lay near his road as he proceeded, he came to Castulo.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To this place Silanus led the auxiliaries, consisting of three thousand infantry and five hundred horse. Thence he advanced to the city of Baecula, with his entire army of countrymen and allies, foot and horse, amounting to forty-five thousand.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Mago and Masinissa attacked them with the whole body of their cavalry while forming their camp, and would have dispersed those engaged in the works, had not a party of horse, concealed by Scipio behind an eminence conveniently situated for the purpose, unexpectedly charged them when rushing on to

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the attack, and, ere the battle was well begun, routed all the most forward, both those who had advanced nearest the rampart, and those who were foremost in charging the very workmen. With the rest of the troops who came up with their standards, and in order of march, the contest lasted longer, and was for a considerable time doubtful.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But when first the light cohorts from the outposts, and then the troops withdrawn from the works and ordered to take arms, came up, being more numerous than those which had been engaged, and fresh while they were fatigued, and now a large body of armed troops rushed from the camp to the battle, the Carthaginians and Numidians at once turned their backs.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At first they moved off in troops without breaking their ranks, through fear or precipitation; but afterwards, when the Romans pressed furiously upon their rear, and they were unable to bear the violence of their attack, then at length, utterly regardless of order, they fled precipitately in every direction, as suited each man's convenience.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And although, in consequence of this battle, the spirits of the Romans were considerably raised, and those of the enemy depressed, yet, for several days following, the horsemen and light-armed troops never ceased from skirmishes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After having made sufficient trial of their strength in these slight engagements, Hasdrubal first led out his forces for battle, and then the Romans also advanced.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But both the armies stood drawn up before their ramparts; and as neither party began the attack, and the sun was now going down, the Carthaginian first, and then the Roman, led back his troops into the camp. The same occurred for several days. The <pb id="p.1180" n="1180"/>Carthaginian was always the first to lead out his troops into the field, and the first to give the signal for retiring, when they were weary with standing.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither party sallied from their posts, nor was a weapon discharged, or a word uttered.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On one side the Romans occupied the centre, on the other, the Carthaginians and Africans together; the allies occupied the wings, which were composed of Spaniards on both sides. The elephants which stood before the Carthaginian line, appeared at a distance like castles.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was now commonly talked of in both camps, that they would fight in the order in which they had stood when drawn up, and that their centres, composed of Romans and Carthaginians, who were the principals in the war, would engage with equal courage and strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Scipio perceived that this was firmly believed, he studiously altered all his arrangements against the day on which he intended to fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He issued orders through the camp at evening, that the men and horses should be refreshed and fed before daylight, and that the horsemen, armed themselves, should keep their horses bridled and saddled. When it was scarcely yet daylight, he sent all his cavalry, with the light troops, against the Carthaginian outposts, and then without delay advanced himself, at

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the head of the heavy body of the legions, having strengthened his wings with Roman

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> soldiers, and placed the allies in the centre, contrary to the full anticipations of his own men and of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hasdrubal, alarmed by the shout of the cavalry, sprang out of his tent, and, perceiving a tumult before the rampart, and his own troops in a state of hurry and confusion, the standards of the legions gleaming at a distance, and the plain filled with the enemy, immediately sent out the whole body of his cavalry against the horsemen of the enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> marching himself out of the camp, at the head of the infantry, without departing at all from the usual arrangement in forming his line.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The battle between the cavalry had continued for a long time doubtful; nor could they decide it themselves, because, when repulsed, which was the case in a manner alternately, they had a safe retreat upon the line of infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But when the armies were not more than five hundred paces distant from each other, Scipio, sounding a retreat and opening his files, received into the midst of them the whole body of his cavalry and light-armed troops;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and dividing them into <pb id="p.1181" n="1181"/>two parts, placed them in reserve behind the wings. After this, when it was now time to commence the battle, he ordered the Spaniards, who formed the centre, to advance at a slow pace;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> he himself sent a messenger from the right wing, for that he commanded, to Silanus and Marcius to extend the wing on the left in the same manner as they should see him extend

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> that on the right, and engage the enemy with the light-armed of the horse and foot, before the two centres could meet.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The wings being thus extended, they advanced against the enemy at a rapid pace, with three cohorts of infantry, and three troops of horse, each with the addition of skirmishers, the rest following them in an oblique line.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> There was a depression in the centre of the line, because the battalions of the Spaniards advanced slower than the rest, and the wings had already encountered the enemy, when the veteran Carthaginians and Africans had not yet come within distance to discharge their darts;

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> nor dared they run in different directions to the wings to assist them when fighting, lest they should expose their centre to the enemy approaching over against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> The wings were hard pressed, by a twofold attack; the cavalry, the light-armed, and the skirmishers, wheeling round, charged their flanks, while the cohorts pressed them hard in front, in order to separate the wings from the rest of the line.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The battle was now extremely unequal in every part, both because an irregular band of Balearians and raw Spaniards were opposed to Roman and Latin soldiers, and further, because, as

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the day was now getting on, Hasdrubal's troops began to grow languid, having been dispirited by the alarm in the morning, and compelled to go out hastily into the field, without refreshing themselves with food.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Scipio had designedly spun out the day, in order that the battle might take place at a late hour; for it was not until the seventh hour that the battalions of infantry charged the wings.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was considerably later before the battle reached the centres, so that the heat from the meridian sun, and the fatigue of standing under arms, together with hunger and thirst, enfeebled their bodies before they engaged the enemy. Thus they stood still, supporting themselves upon their shields.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In addition to their other misfortunes, the elephants too, ter- <pb id="p.1182" n="1182"/>rified at the tumultuous kind of attack of the cavalry, the skirmishers, and the light-armed, had transferred themselves from the wings to the centre.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fatigued therefore in mind and body, they gave ground, preserving their ranks, however, just as though the army were retreating entire at the command of their general. But when the victors, perceiving that the enemy had given way, charged them on all sides

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> with increased vehemence on that very account, so that the shock could hardly be sustained, though Hasdrubal endeavoured to stop them and hinder them from retiring, vociferating, <quote>that there were hills on their rear, and a safe refuge if they would retreat without precipitation;</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> yet, fear getting the better of their sense of shame, and all those who

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> were nearest the enemy giving way, they immediately turned their backs, and all gave themselves up to disorderly flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The first place they halted at was the foot of the hills, where they endeavoured to recall the soldiers to their ranks, the Romans hesitating to advance their line up the opposite steep; but afterwards, when they saw them push on briskly, renewing their flight, they were driven into their camp in extreme alarm.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nor were the Romans far from the rampart; and such was their impetuosity, that they would have taken their camp had not so violent a shower of rain suddenly poured down, while, as is usually the case, the solar rays darted with the greatest intensity between the clouds surcharged with water, that the victors with difficulty returned to their camp. Some were even deterred, by superstition, from making any further attempts that day.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Though night and the rain invited the Carthaginians to take necessary rest, yet, as their fears and the danger would not allow them to

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> delay, as it was expected that the enemy would assault their camp as soon as it was light, they raised their rampart by stones collected from the neighbouring valleys around them on all sides, with the determination to defend themselves by works, since there was but little protection in their arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But the desertion of their allies made it appear safer to fly than stay. Attanes, prince of the Turdetani, began this revolt; he deserted at the head of a numerous band of his countrymen.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then two fortified towns, together with their garrisons, were delivered up by their praefects to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And, lest the evil should <pb id="p.1183" n="1183"/>spread more widely, now that the disposition to revolt from the Carthaginians had evinced itself in one instance, Hasdrubal decamped during the silence of the ensuing night.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The troops in the outposts having brought word, as soon as it was light, that the enemy had departed, Scipio, despatching his cavalry in advance, ordered the army to move forward;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and so rapidly were they led, that had they directly followed the track of the fugitives, they would certainly have overtaken them; but they trusted to the report of their guides, that there was a shorter cut to the river Baetis, where they might attack them while crossing it.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hasdrubal, being precluded from passing the river, turned his course to the ocean; and they now advanced in disorder and in the manner of fugitives, so that the Roman legions were left considerably behind.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The cavalry and light-armed, attacking sometimes their rear, and sometimes their flank, harassed and delayed them;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and as they were obliged to halt, in consequence of these frequent annoyances, and engaged sometimes the cavalry, at other times the skirmishers and the auxiliary infantry, the legions came up.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After this it was no longer a fight, but a butchering as of cattle, till the general himself, who was the first to run away, made his escape to the neighbouring hills with about six thousand men half armed; the rest were slain or made prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Carthaginians hastily fortified an irregular camp on the highest eminence, and from thence they defended themselves without difficulty, the enemy failing in his attempt to get at them, from the difficulty of the ascent. But a siege in a place bare and affording no means of subsistence, was hardly to be supported, even for a few days; the troops therefore deserted to the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At last the general himself, having procured some ships, for the sea was not at a great distance, left his army by night and effected his escape to Gades.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Scipio, having heard of the flight of the general of the enemy, left ten thousand foot and one thousand cavalry for Silanus to carry on the siege of the camp, and returned to Tarraco with the rest of the troops,

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> after a march of seventy days, during which he took cognizance of the causes of the petty princes and states, in order that rewards might be conferred according to a just estimate of their merits.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After his departure, Masinissa, having held a private conference with Silanus, passed over into Africa with a few of his countrymen, in order <pb id="p.1184" n="1184"/>that he might induce his nation also to acquiesce in his new designs.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The cause of this sudden change was not so evident at the time, as the proof was convincing which was afforded by his subsequent fidelity, preserved to extreme old age, that he did not on this occasion act without reasonable grounds. Mago went to Gades in the ships which had been sent back by Hasdrubal.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Of the rest of the troops thus abandoned by their generals, some deserted and others betook themselves to flight, and in this manner were dispersed through the neighbouring states. There was no body of them considerable either for numbers or strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Such were, as near as possible, the circumstances under which the Carthaginians were driven out of Spain, under the conduct and auspices of Publius Scipio, in the thirteenth year from the commencement of the war, and the fifth from the time that Publius Scipio received the province and the army.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Not long after, Silanus returned to Tarraco to Scipio, with information that the war was at an end.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Scipio was sent to Rome to convey the news of the reduction of Spain, and with him a number of distinguished captives.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While everybody else extolled this achievement as an event in the highest degree joyful and glorious, yet the author of it alone, whose valour was such that he never thought he had achieved enough, and whose search for true glory was insatiable, considered the reduction of Spain as affording

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> but a faint idea of the hopes which his aspiring mind had conceived.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He now directed his view to Africa and Great Carthage, and the glorious termination of the war, as redounding to his honour, and giving lustre to his name.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Judging it therefore to be now necessary to pave the way to his object, and to conciliate the friendship of kings and nations, he resolved first to sound the disposition of Syphax, king of the Masaesylians, a nation bordering on the Moors, and lying for the most part over-against that quarter of Spain in which New Carthage is situated.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king was at the present juncture in league with the Carthaginians;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and Scipio, concluding that he would not hold it as more binding and sacred than was customary with barbarians, sent Caius Laelius as envoy to him with presents.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The barbarian, delighted with these, and seeing that the Roman cause was then successful in every quarter, but that the Carthaginians were unfortunate <pb id="p.1185" n="1185"/>in Italy, and no longer existed in Spain, consented to accept the friendship of the Romans, but refused to give or receive a solemn ratification of it except the Roman general himself were present in person.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This being the case, Laelius returned to Scipio, having received from the king merely an assurance of a safe journey.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To one desirous of getting a footing in Africa, Syphax was of great importance, as he was the most powerful king in that country, had already had experience of the Carthaginians themselves in war, and the boundaries of his dominions lay very conveniently with respect to Spain, from which they are separated by a narrow strait.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Scipio, therefore, considering it an object of sufficient importance to warrant his attempting it, notwithstanding the greatness of the danger which attended it, since he could not effect it otherwise, left for the protection of Spain Lucius Marcius at Tarraco, and Marcus Silanus at New Carthage, to which place he had gone on foot by long marches;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and setting out himself in company with Caius Laelius, with two quinqueremes from Carthage, passed over into Africa, working the vessels with oars for the greatest part of the voyage, in consequence of the calmness of the sea, though sometimes they were assisted by a gentle breeze.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It so happened, that just at that time Hasdrubal, having been driven out of Spain, had entered the harbour with seven triremes, and having cast anchor was mooring his ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The sight of two quinqueremes, which it was the firm opinion of everybody belonged to the enemy, and might be overpowered by superior numbers before they entered the harbour, produced no other effect than a tumult and confusion among the soldiers and sailors, who endeavoured to no purpose to get their arms and ships ready;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> for their sails, impelled by a somewhat brisker gale from the sea, brought the quinqueremes into the harbour before the Carthaginians weighed their anchors, and no one dared make any further stir now that they were in the king's harbour.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Thus Hasdrubal, who landed first, and Scipio and Laelius, who landed soon after, proceeded to the king.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Syphax considered it highly honourable to him, as it really was, that generals of the two most powerful people of the age should come to him on the same day to solicit peace and friendship with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He invited them both to become his guests; and, as it was the will of fortune that they should be <pb id="p.1186" n="1186"/>under one roof, and under the protection of the same household gods, he endeavoured to bring them together to a conference, in order to put an end to the difference between them;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> when Scipio declared, that there was no personal enmity between the Carthaginian and himself which he might do away with by a conference, and that he could not transact any business relating to the republic with an enemy without the command of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the king being earnest in his endeavours to persuade him to come to the same entertainment, lest one of his guests should appear to be excluded, he did not withhold his assent.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They supped together at the king's table, and Scipio and Hasdrubal even sat at meat on the same couch, because it was the king's pleasure.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So courteous was the manner of Scipio, so naturally happy and universal was his genius, that by his conversation he gained the esteem not only of Syphax, a barbarian, and unused to Roman manners, but even of a most inveterate enemy, who openly avowed, that <quote>he

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> appeared to him more to be admired for the qualities he displayed on a personal interview with him, than for his exploits in war, and that he had no doubt that Syphax and his kingdom were already at the disposal of the

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Romans, such were the abilities that man possessed for gaining the esteem of others.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That it, therefore, was incumbent upon the Carthaginians not more to inquire by what means they had lost Spain, than to consider how they might retain possession of Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That it was not from a desire to visit foreign countries, or to roam about delightful coasts, that so great a Roman captain, leaving a recently subdued province, and his armies, had crossed over into Africa with only two ships, entering an enemy's territory, and committing himself to the untried honour of the king, but in pursuance of a hope he had conceived of subduing Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That it had been long the object of his anxious solicitude, and had drawn from him open expressions of his indignation, that Scipio was not carrying on war in Africa in the same way as Hannibal was in Italy.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio, having formed a league with Syphax, set out from Africa, and, after having been tossed about during his voyage by variable and generally tempestuous winds, made the port of New Carthage on the fourth day.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As Spain was undisturbed by a Carthaginian war, so it was evident that some of the states remained quiet more <pb id="p.1187" n="1187"/>from fear, arising from a consciousness of demerit, than from sincere attachment. The most remarkable of them, both for their greatness and guilt, were Illiturgi and Castulo.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Castulo had been in alliance with the Romans when in prosperity, but had revolted to the Carthaginians after the destruction of the Scipios and their armies. The Illiturgians, by betraying and putting to death those who fled thither after that calamity, had added villany to revolt.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It would have been more deserved than expedient to have executed severe vengeance upon these people on his first arrival, while the affairs of Spain were in an uncertain state;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but now, when all was tranquil, as the time for visiting them with punishment appeared to have arrived, he summoned Lucius Marcius from Tarraco, and sent him with a third of his forces to attack Castulo, and with the rest of the army he himself reached Illiturgi, after about five days' march.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The gates were closed, and every arrangement and preparation made for repelling an attack; so completely had the consciousness of what they deserved produced the same effect as a declaration of war against them. From this circumstance Scipio commenced his exhortation to his soldiers:

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he said, that <quote>by closing their gates the Spaniards had themselves shown what their deserts were by what they feared, and that therefore they ought to prosecute the war against them with much greater animosity than against the Carthaginians. For with the latter the contest was carried on for empire and glory almost without any exasperated feeling, while they had to punish the former for perfidy, cruelty, and villany.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That the time had now arrived when they should take vengeance for the horrid massacre of their fellow soldiers, and for the treachery which was prepared for themselves, had they been carried in their flight to the same place;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and by the severity of the punishment inflicted in the present instance, establish it as a law for ever, that no one should consider a Roman citizen and soldier, whatever his situation, a fit object for injurious treatment.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Animated by this exhortation of their general, they distributed the scaling-ladders to men selected from each of the companies; and the army being divided into two parts, so that Laelius, as lieutenant-general, might command one, they attacked the city in two places at once; thus creating an alarm in two quarters at the same time.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was not by the <pb id="p.1188" n="1188"/>exhortations of one general, nor of the several nobles who were present, that the townsmen were stimulated to a vigorous defence of the city, but by the fear which they themselves entertained; they bore in mind, and admonished each other, that the object aimed at was punishment, and not victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That the only question for them was, where they should meet death, whether in the battle and in the field, where the indiscriminate chance of war frequently raised up the vanquished and dashed the victor to the ground; or whether, after a short interval, when the city was burnt and plundered, after suffering every horror and indignity, they should expire amid stripes and bonds before the eyes of their captive wives and children.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Therefore, not only those who were of an age to bear arms, or men only, but women and children,

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> beyond the powers of their minds and bodies, were there, supplying with weapons those who were fighting in defence of the place, and carrying stones to the walls for those who were strengthening the works; for not only was their liberty at stake, which excites the energies of the brave only, but they had before their eyes the utmost extremity of punishment, to be inflicted on all indiscriminately, and an ignominious death.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Their minds were worked up to the highest pitch, both by emulation in toil and danger, and also by the mere sight of each other.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Accordingly the contest was entered upon with such ardour, that the army which had subdued the whole of Spain was frequently driven back from the walls of one town, and exhibited such a want of resolution in the contest as was not very honourable to it.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> When Scipio perceived this, he was afraid lest, by the failure of his attempts, the courage of the enemy should be raised and his own troops be dispirited; and thinking it incumbent upon him to exert himself in person and share the danger, reproved his soldiers for their cowardice, and ordered the scaling-ladders to be brought, threatening to mount the wall himself, since the rest hesitated.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> He had now advanced near the walls with no small danger, when a shout was raised from all sides by the soldiers, who were alarmed at the danger their general was exposed to, and the scaling-ladders began to be reared in several places at once. Laelius too, in another quarter, pressed on vigorously.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> It was then that the energy of the townsmen was subdued, and those who defended the <pb id="p.1189" n="1189"/>walls being beaten off, the Romans took possession of them. The citadel also was captured during the confusion on a side where it was thought impregnable.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some African deserters, who were at that time among the Roman auxiliaries, while the townsmen were occupied in defending those quarters whence danger was apprehended, and the Romans were making approaches where they could gain access, observed that the

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> most elevated part of the town, which was protected by a very high rock, was neither fortified by any work nor furnished with defenders.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Being men of light make and nimble from being well exercised, they climbed up wherever they could gain access over the irregular projections of the rock, carrying with them iron spikes.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If in any part they met with a cliff too steep and smooth, they fixed spikes at moderate intervals, and having thus formed a sort of steps, and those who were foremost pulling up those who followed, and those who were behind lifting up those before them, they succeeded in gaining the summit, whence they

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> ran down with a shout into the city, which had already been taken by the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then it became manifest indeed that it was resentment and hatred which prompted the assault upon the city. No one thought of taking any alive, nor of booty, though every thing lay exposed to plunder. They butchered all indiscriminately, armed and unarmed, male and female. Their cruel resentment extended to the slaughter of infants.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They then set fire to the houses, and pulled down those which could not be consumed by fire, so bent were they upon erasing even every vestige of the city, and blotting out the memory of their enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio marched his army thence to Castulo, which was defended, not only by Spaniards who had assembled there, but also by the remains of the Carthaginian army, which had gone there from the various places to which they had been dispersed in their flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the news of the calamity of the Illiturgians had reached them before the arrival of Scipio; and in consequence of this, dismay and desperation had seized them;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and as their cases were differently circumstanced, and each party was desirous of consulting its own safety independent of the other, at first secret jealousy, and then an open rupture, created a separation between the Carthaginians and Spaniards.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Cerdubellus without disguise advised the latter to surrender. Himilco commanded the <pb id="p.1190" n="1190"/>Carthaginian auxiliaries, which, together with the city, Cerdubellus delivered up to the Romans, having secretly obtained terms.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This victory was attended with less cruelty; for not only was the guilt of this people less than the others, but their voluntary surrender had considerably mitigated resentment.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcius was then sent against the barbarians, to reduce under the authority and dominion of the Romans such of them as had not yet been subdued. Scipio returned to Carthage, to pay his vows to the gods, and to exhibit a gladiatorial show, which he had prepared on account of the death of his father and uncle. This exhibition of gladiators was not formed from that description of men which the lanistae are accustomed to procure, such as slaves, or those who sell their blood.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> All the service of the combatants was voluntary and gratuitous; for some were sent by the petty princes,

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to show an example of the natural courage of their people; others came forward to fight, in compliment to their general;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> others were induced to give and accept challenges, by a spirit of emulation and a desire of victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some decided by the sword disputes which they either could not or were unwilling to determine by argument, with an agreement that the matter in question should be given up to the victor.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor was it confined to men of obscure rank, but comprehended persons of distinction and celebrity; such were Corbis and Orsua, cousins-german, who, having a dispute about the sovereignty of a city called Ibis, declared that they would contest it with the sword. Corbis was the elder of the two.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The father of Orsua was the last sovereign, having succeeded to that dignity on the death of his elder brother.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When Scipio was desirous of settling the dispute by argument and allaying their irritation, they both declared that they had refused that to their mutual kinsmen, and that they would appeal to no other judge, whether god or man, than Mars.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The elder presuming upon his strength, the younger on the prime of youth, each wished to die in the combat rather than become the subject of the other; and every effort failing to prevent their prosecuting their mad design, they exhibited to the army a most interesting spectacle, and a proof how great mischief is occasioned among men by a thirst for power.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The elder, in consequence of his experience in arms and his address, easily mastered the unscientific efforts of the younger. To this show <pb id="p.1191" n="1191"/>of gladiators were added funeral games, proportioned to the means possessed, and with such magnificence as the provinces and the camp afforded.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the operations of the war were carried on with unabated activity by the lieutenant-generals. Marcius, crossing the river Baetis, which the natives call Certis, received the submission of two powerful cities without a contest.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was a city called Astapa, which had always sided with the Carthaginians; nor was it that which drew upon it the resentment of the Romans so much as the fact, that its inhabitants harboured an extraordinary animosity against them, which was not called for by the necessities of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their city was not so secured by nature or art as to make their dispositions so fierce, but the natural disposition of the inhabitants, which took delight in plunder, had induced them to make excursions into the neighboring lands belonging to the allies of the Romans, and to intercept such Roman soldiers, suttlers, and merchants as they found ranging about.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They had also surrounded, by means of an ambuscade, and put to the sword on disadvantageous ground, a large company which was crossing their borders, for it had proved hardly safe to go in small parties.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the troops were marched up to assault this city, the inhabitants, conscious of their guilt, and seeing that it would be dangerous to surrender to an enemy so highly incensed, and that they could not hope to keep themselves in safety by means of their walls or their arms, resolved to execute upon themselves and those belonging to them a horrid and inhuman deed.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They fixed upon a place in their forum, in which they collected the most valuable of their property, and having directed their wives and children to seat themselves upon this heap, they raised a pile of wood around it and threw on it bundles of twigs.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They then ordered fifty armed youths to stand there and guard their fortunes, and the persons dearer to them than their fortunes, as long as the issue of the battle continued doubtful.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If they should perceive that the battle went against them, and that it came to the point that the city must be captured, they might be assured that those whom they saw going out to engage the enemy would perish in the battle itself;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but implored them by all the gods, celestial and infernal, that, mindful of their liberty, which must be terminated on that day either by <pb id="p.1192" n="1192"/>an honourable death or ignominious servitude, they would leave nothing on which an exasperated enemy could wreak his fury;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that they had fire and sword at their command, and it was better that friendly and faithful hands should destroy what must necessarily perish, than that enemies should insult it with haughty wantonness.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To these exhortations a dreadful execration was added against any one who should be diverted from this purpose by hope or faintheartedness. Then throwing open the gates, they rushed out at a rapid pace and with the utmost impetuosity.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nor was there any guard sufficiently strong opposed to them; for there could be nothing that was less apprehended than that they would have the courage to sally from their walls. A very few troops of horse, and the light-armed, hastily sent out of the camp for that purpose, opposed them.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The battle was furious and spirited, rather than steady and regular in any degree. The horse, therefore, which had first encountered the enemy, being repulsed, created an alarm among the light-armed; and the battle would have been fought under the very rampart, had not the legions, which were their main strength, drawn out their line, though they had a very short time to form in.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> These too, for a short time, wavered around their standards, when the Astapans, blind with rage, rushed upon wounds and the sword with reckless daring; but afterwards the veteran soldiers, standing firm against their furious assaults, checked the violence of those that followed by the slaughter of the foremost.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Soon after, the veteran troops themselves made an attempt to charge them, but seeing that not a man gave ground, and that they were inflexibly determined on dying each in his place, they extended their line, which the number of their troops enabled them to do with ease, and, surrounding their flanks, slew them all to a man while fighting in a circle.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But these, however, were acts committed by exasperated enemies in the heat of battle, and executed, in conformity with the laws of war, upon men armed and most fiercely resisting;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> there was another more horrible carnage in the city, where a harmless and defenceless crowd of women and children were butchered by their own countrymen, who threw their bodies, most of them still alive, upon the burning pile, while streams of blood damped the rising flame; and lastly, <pb id="p.1193" n="1193"/>wearied with the piteous slaughter of their friends, they threw themselves, arms and all, into the midst of the flames.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the carnage was now completed the victorious Romans came up, and at the first sight of so revolting a transaction they stood for some time wrapt in wonder and amazement;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but afterwards, from a rapacity natural to humanity, wishing to snatch out of the fire the gold and silver which glittered amid the heap of other materials, some were caught by the flames, others scorched by the hot blasts, as the foremost were unable to retreat, in consequence of the immense crowd which pressed upon them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this manner was Astapa destroyed by the sword and fire, without affording any booty to the soldiers. After the rest of the people in that quarter, influenced by fear, had made submission to him, Marcius led his victorious troops to Scipio, at Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Just at this same time deserters arrived from Gades, who promised to betray the town and Carthaginian garrison which occupied it, together with the commander and the fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Mago had halted there after his flight, and having collected some ships on the ocean, had got together a considerable number of auxiliaries from the coast of Africa, on the other side the strait, and also by means of Hanno the praefect from the neighbouring parts of Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After pledges had been exchanged with the deserters, Marcius and Laelius were sent thither, the former with the light cohorts, the latter with seven triremes and one quinquereme, in order that they might act in concert by land and sea.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In consequence of Scipio's being afflicted with a severe fit of illness, which rumour represented as more serious than it really was; for every one made some addition to the account he had received, from a desire inherent in mankind of intentionally exaggerating reports, the whole province, and more especially the distant parts of it, were thrown into a state of ferment;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and it was evident what a serious disturbance would have been excited had he really died, when an unfounded report created such violent commotions.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither the allies kept their allegiance, nor the army their duty. Mandonius and Indibilis, who were not at all satisfied with what had occurred, for they had anticipated with certainty that they would

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> have the dominion of Spain on the expulsion of the Carthaginians, called together their countrymen the Lacetani, <pb id="p.1194" n="1194"/>and summoning the Celtiberian youth to arms, devastated in a hostile manner the territories of the Suessetanians and Sedetanians, allies of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Besides, a mutiny arose in the camp at Sucro. Here were eight thousand men, stationed as a guard over the nations dwelling on this side the Iberus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was not on hearing uncertain rumours respecting the life of the general that their minds were first excited, but previously, owing to the licentiousness which naturally results from long-continued idleness, and in some degree also owing to the restraint felt in time of peace by men who had been accustomed to live freely on what they gained by plunder in an enemy's country.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first they only discoursed in private, asking what they were doing among people who were at peace with them, if there was a war in the province? if the war was terminated and the province completely subdued, why were they not conveyed back into Italy?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The pay also was demanded with more insolence than was customary or consistent with military subordination, and the guards cast reproaches upon the tribunes while going round to the watches. Some too had gone out by night into the neighbouring lands, belonging to persons at peace with the Romans, to plunder; but at last they quitted their standards in the day-time and openly without furloughs.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Every thing was done according to the caprice and unrestrained will of the soldiers, and nothing according to rule and military discipline, or the orders of those who were in command.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The form, however, of a Roman camp was preserved solely in consequence of the hopes they entertained that the tribunes, catching the spirit of insubordination, would not be averse from taking part in the mutiny and defection, on which account they suffered them to dispense justice in their courts, went to them for the watch-word, and served in their turn on the outposts and watches;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and as they had taken away the power of command, so they preserved the appearance of obedience to orders, by spontaneously executing their own.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Afterwards, when they perceived that the tribunes censured and reprobated their proceedings, endeavoured to counteract them, and publicly declared that they would not take any share in their disorderly conduct, the mutiny assumed a decided character;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> when, after driving the tribunes from their courts, and shortly after from the camp, the command was conferred by universal con- <pb id="p.1195" n="1195"/>sent upon Caius Albius of Cales and Caius Atrius of Umbria, common soldiers, who were the prime movers of the sedition.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> These men were so far from being satisfied with the ornaments used by tribunes, that they had the audacity to lay hold even of the insignia of the highest authority, the fasces and axes, without ever reflecting that their own backs and necks were in danger from those very rods and axes which they carried before them to intimidate others.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Their mistaken belief of the death of Scipio had blinded their minds, and they doubted not that, in a short time, when that event should be made generally known, all Spain would blaze with war;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> that during this confusion money might be exacted from the allies and the neighbouring cities plundered; and that in this unsettled state of affairs, when there was nothing which any man would not dare, their own acts would be less conspicuous.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As they expected that other fresh accounts would follow those which they had received, not only of the death, but even of the burial, of Scipio, and yet none arrived;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and as the rumour which had been so idly originated began to die away, the first author of it began to be sought out; and each backing out in order that he might appear rather to have inconsiderately credited than to have fabricated such a report, the leaders were forsaken, and began now to dread their own ensigns of authority, and to apprehend that, instead of that empty show of command which they wore, a legitimate and rightful power would be turned against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The mutiny being thus paralysed, and credible persons bringing in accounts, first, that Scipio was alive, and, soon after, that he was even in good health, seven military tribunes were sent by Scipio himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the first arrival of these their minds were violently excited; but they were soon calmed by the mild and soothing language which they addressed to such of their acquaintance as they met with;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for, going round first of all to the tents, and then entering the principia and the praetorium, wherever they observed circles of men conversing together, they addressed them, inquiring rather what it was that had occasioned their displeasure and sudden consternation, than taxing them with what had occurred.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>That they had not received their pay at the appointed time,</quote> was generally complained; and <quote>that although at the time of the horrid <pb id="p.1196" n="1196"/>transaction of the Illiturgians, and after the destruction of two generals and two armies, the Roman cause had been defended and the province retained by their valour; the Illiturgians had received the punishment due to their offence, but there was no one found to reward them for their meritorious services.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The tribunes replied, <quote>that, considering the nature of their complaints, what they requested was just, and that they would lay it before the general; that they were happy that there was nothing of a more gloomy and irremediable character; that both Publius Scipio, by the favour of the gods, and the commonwealth, were in a situation to requite them.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, who was accustomed to war but inexperienced in the storms of sedition, felt great anxiety on the occasion, lest the army should run into excess in transgressing, or himself in punishing.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For the present he resolved to persist in the lenient line of conduct with which he had begun, and sending collectors round to the tributary states, to give the soldiers hopes of soon receiving their pay.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Immediately after this a proclamation was issued that they should come to Carthage to receive their pay, whether they wished to do so in detached parties or all in a body.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The sudden suppression of the rebellion among the Spaniards had the effect of tranquillizing the mutiny, which was by this time beginning to subside of itself; for Mandonius and Indibilis, relinquishing their attempt, had returned within their borders when intelligence was brought that Scipio was alive; nor did there now remain any person, whether countryman or foreigner, whom they could make their companion in their desperate enterprise.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On examining every method, they had no alternative except that which afforded a retreat from wicked designs, which was not of the safest kind, namely, to commit themselves either to the just anger of the general, or to his clemency, of which they need not despair.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For he had pardoned even enemies whom he had encountered with the sword;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> while they reflected that their sedition had been unaccompanied with wounds or blood, and was neither in itself of an atrocious character nor merited severe punishment. So natural is it for men to be over-eloquent in extenuating their own demerit.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> They felt doubtful whether they should go to demand their pay in single cohorts or in one entire body; but the opinion that they should go in a body, which they regarded as the safer mode, prevailed. <pb id="p.1197" n="1197"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, when they were employed in these deliberations, a council was held on their case at Carthage;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when a warm debate took place as to whether they should visit with punishment the originators only of the mutiny, who were in number not more than thirty-five, or, whether atonement should be made for this defection, (for such it was rather than a mutiny,) of so dreadful a character as a precedent, by the punishment of a greater number.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The opinion recommending the more lenient course, that the punishment should fall where the guilt originated, was adopted. For the multitude a reprimand was considered sufficient.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the breaking up of the council, orders were given to the army, which was in Carthage, to prepare for an expedition against Mandonius and Indibilis, and to get ready provisions for several days, in order that they might appear to have been deliberating about this.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The seven tribunes who had before gone to Sucro to quell the mutiny, having been sent out to meet the army, gave in, each of them, five names of persons principally concerned in the

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> affair, in order that proper persons might be employed to invite them to their homes, with smiles and kind words; and that, when overpowered with wine, they might be thrown into chains.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were not far distant from Carthage when the intelligence, received from persons on the road, that the whole army was going the following day with Marcus Silanus against the Lacetanians, not only freed them from all the apprehensions which, though they did not give utterance to them, sat heavy upon their minds, but occasioned the greatest transport, because they would thus have the general alone, and in their power, instead of being themselves in his.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They entered the city just at sun-set, and saw the other army making every preparation for a march. Immediately on their arrival they were greeted in terms feigned for the

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> purpose, that their arrival was looked upon by the general as a happy and seasonable circumstance, for they had come when the other army was just on the point of setting out. After which they proceeded to refresh themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The authors of the mutiny, having been conveyed to their lodgings by proper persons, were apprehended by the tribunes without any disturbance, and thrown into chains.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At the fourth watch the baggage belonging to the army, which, as it was pretended, was about to march, began to set out. As soon as it was <pb id="p.1198" n="1198"/>light the troops marched, but were stopped at the gate, and guards were sent round to all the gates to prevent any one going out of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then those who had arrived the day before, having been summoned to an assembly, ran in crowds into the forum to the tribunal of the general, with the presumptuous purpose of intimidating him by their shouts.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At the same time that the general mounted the tribunal, the armed troops, which had been brought back from the gates, spread themselves around the rear of the unarmed assembly.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then all their insolence subsided; and, as they afterwards confessed, nothing terrified them so much as the unexpected vigour and hue of the general, whom they had supposed they should see in a sickly state, and his countenance, which was such as they declared that they did not remember to have ever seen it even in battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He sat silent for a short time, till he was informed that the instigators of the mutiny were brought into the forum, and that every thing was now in readiness.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, a herald having obtained silence, he thus began: "I imagined that language would never fail me in which to address my army;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> not that I have ever accustomed myself to speaking rather than action, but because, having been kept in a camp almost from my boyhood, I had become familiar with the dispositions of soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But I am at a loss both for sentiments and expressions with which to address you, whom I know not even by what name I ought to call.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Can I call you countrymen, who have revolted from your country? or soldiers, who have rejected the command and authority of your general, and violated the solemn obligation of your oath? Can I call you enemies?

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I recognise the persons, faces, dress, and mien of fellow countrymen; but I perceive the actions, expressions, intentions, and feelings of enemies. For what have you wished and hoped for, but what the Ilergetians and Lacetanians did. Yet they followed Mandonius and Indibilis, men of royal rank, who were the leaders of their mad project; you conferred the auspices and command upon the Umbrian, Atrius, and the Calenian, Albius.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Deny, soldiers, that you were all concerned in this measure, or that you approved of it when taken. I shall willingly believe, when you disclaim it, that it was the folly and madness of a few. For the acts which have been committed are of such a nature, that, if <pb id="p.1199" n="1199"/>the whole army participated in them, they could not be expiated without atonements of tremendous magnitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Upon these points, like wounds, I touch with reluctance; but unless touched and handled, they cannot be cured.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For my own part, I believed that, after the Carthaginians were expelled from Spain, there was not a place in the whole province where, or any persons to whom, my life was obnoxious; such was the manner in which I had conducted myself, not only towards my allies, but even towards my enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But lo, even in my own camp, so much was I deceived in my opinion, the report of my death was not only readily believed, but anxiously waited for.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Not that I wish to implicate you all in this enormity; for, be assured, if I supposed that the whole of my army desired my death, I would here immediately expire before your eyes; nor could I take any pleasure in a life which was odious to my countrymen and my soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But every multitude is in its nature like the ocean; which, though in itself incapable of motion, is excited by storms and winds. So, also, in yourselves there is calm and there are storms; but the cause and origin of your fury is entirely attributable to those who led you on; you have caught your madness by contagion.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nay, even this day you do not appear to me to be aware to what a pitch of phrensy you have proceeded; what a heinous crime you have dared to commit against myself, your country, your parents, your children; against the gods, the witnesses of your oath; against the auspices under which you serve; against the laws of war, the discipline of your ancestors, and the majesty of the highest authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> With regard to myself, I say nothing. You may have believed the report of my death rather inconsiderately than eagerly. Lastly, suppose me to be such a man that it could not at all be a matter of astonishment that my army should be weary of my command, yet what had your country deserved of you, which you betrayed by making common cause with Mandonius and Indibilis?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What the Roman people, when, taking the command from the tribunes appointed by their suffrages, you conferred it on private men? When, not content even with having them for tribunes, you, a Roman army, conferred the fasces of your general upon men who never had a slave under their command?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Albius and Atrius had their tents in your general's pavilion. With them the trumpet sounded, from <pb id="p.1200" n="1200"/>them the word was taken, they sat upon the tribunal of Scipio, upon whom the lictor attended, for them the crowd was cleared away as they moved along, before them the fasces with the axes were carried.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> When showers of stones descend, lightnings are darted from the heavens, and animals give birth to monsters, you consider these things as prodigies. This is a prodigy which can be expiated by no victims, by no supplications, without the blood of those men who have dared to commit so great a crime.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Now, though villany is never guided by reason, yet so far as it could exist in so nefarious a transaction, I would fain know what was your design.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Formerly, a legion which was sent to garrison Rhegium, wickedly put to the sword the principal inhabitants and kept possession of that opulent city through a space of ten years;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> on account of which enormity the entire legion, consisting of four thousand men, were beheaded in the forum at Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But they, in the first place, did not put themselves under the direction of Atrius the Umbrian, scarcely superior to a scullion, whose name even was ominous, but of Decius Jubellius, a military tribune; nor did they unite themselves with Pyrrhus, or with the Samnites or Lucanians, the enemies of the Roman people. But you made common cause with Mandonius and Indibilis, and intended also to have united your arms with them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They intended to have held Rhegium as a lasting settlement, as the Campanians held Capua, which they took from its ancient Tuscan inhabitants;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and as the Mamertines held Messana in Sicily, without any design of commencing without provocation a war upon the Roman people or their allies. Was it your purpose to hold Sucro as a place of abode?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> where, had I, your general, left you on my departure after the reduction of the province, you would have been justified in imploring the interference of gods and men, because you could not return to your wives and children.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But suppose that you banished from your minds all recollection of these, as you did of your country and myself; I would wish to track the course of a wicked design, but not of one utterly insane.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> While I was alive, and the rest of the army safe, with which in one day I took Carthage, with which I routed, put to flight, and expelled from Spain four generals and four armies of the Carthaginians; did you, I say, who were only eight thousand men, all of course of less <pb id="p.1201" n="1201"/>worth than Albius and Atrius, to whom you subjected yourselves, hope to wrest the province of Spain out of the hands of the Roman people? I lay no stress upon my own name, I put it out of the question.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Let it be supposed that I have not been injured by you in any respect beyond the ready credence of my death.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> What! if I were dead, was the state to expire with me? was the empire of the Roman people to fall with me? Jupiter, most good and great, would not have permitted that the existence of the city, built under the auspices and sanction of the gods to last for ever, should terminate with that of this frail and perishable body.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman people have survived those many and distinguished generals who were all cut off in one war; Flaminius, Paulus, Gracchus, Posthumius Albinus, Marcus Marcellus, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Cneius Fulvius, my kinsmen the Scipios; and will survive a thousand others who may perish, some by the sword, others by disease; and would the Roman state have been buried with my single corpse?

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> You yourselves, here in Spain, when your two generals, my father and my uncle, fell, chose Septimus Marcius as your general to oppose the Carthaginians, exulting on account of their recent victory. And thus I speak, on the supposition that Spain would have been without a leader.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Would Marcus Silanus, who was sent into the province with the same power and the same command as myself, would Lucius Scipio my brother, and Caius Laelius, lieutenant-generals, have been wanting to avenge the majesty of the empire?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Could the armies, the generals themselves, their dignity or their cause, be compared with one another? And even had you got the better of all these, would you bear arms in conjunction with the Carthaginians against your country, against your countrymen? Would you wish that Africa should rule Italy, and Carthage the city of Rome? If so, for what offence on the part of your country?</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>An unjust sentence of condemnation, and a miserable and undeserved banishment, formerly induced Coriolanus to go and fight against his country; he was restrained, however, by private duty from public parricide. What grief, what resentment instigated you?

Without doubt, soldiers, you were mad; nor was the disease which seized my frame more violent than that with which your minds were affected.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He had scarcely finished speaking, when, according to the plan preconcerted, every object of terror was at once presented to their eyes and ears.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The troops, which had formed a circle round the assembly, clashed their swords against their shields; the herald's voice was heard citing by name the persons who had been condemned in the council; the culprits were dragged naked into the midst of the assembly, and at the same time all the apparatus for punishment was brought forth.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They were tied to the stake, scourged with rods, and decapitated; while those who were present were so benumbed with fear, that not only no expression of dissatisfaction at the severity of the punishment, but not even a groan was heard.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They were then all dragged out, the place was cleared, and the men cited by name took the oath of allegiance to Scipio before the military tribunes, each receiving his full demand of pay as he answered to his name. Such was the termination and result which the <pb id="p.1203" n="1203"/>insurrection of the soldiers, which began at Sucro, met with.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the time of these transactions, Hanno, the lieutenant-general of Mago, having been sent from Gades to the river Baetis with a small body of Africans, by tempting the Spaniards with money, armed as many as four thousand men;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but afterwards, being deprived of his camp by Lucius Marcius, and losing the principal part of his troops in the confusion occasioned by its capture, and some also in the flight, for the cavalry pursued them closely while they were dispersed, he made his escape with a few attendants.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> During these transactions on the river Baetis, Laelius in the mean time, sailing out of the straits into the ocean, came with his fleet before Carteia, a city situated on the coast of the ocean, where the sea begins to expand itself, after being confined in a narrow strait.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had entertained hopes of having Gades betrayed to him without a contest, persons having come unsolicited into the Roman camp to make promises to that effect, as has been before mentioned. The plot was discovered before it was ripe, and all having been apprehended, were placed by Mago in the hands of Adherbal the praetor, to be conveyed to Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Adherbal, having put the conspirators on board a quinquereme, sent it in advance, because it sailed slower than a trireme, and followed himself at a moderate distance with eight triremes.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The quinquereme was just entering the strait, when Laelius, who had himself also sailed out of the harbour of Carteia in a quinquereme, followed by seven triremes, bore down upon Adherbal and his triremes, feeling assured that the trireme, when once caught in the rapid strait, would not be able to return against the opposing current. The Carthaginian, alarmed by the suddenness of the affair, hesitated for some little time whether he should follow the trireme, or turn his prows against the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This very delay put it out of his power to decline an action, for they were now within a weapon's cast, and the enemy were bearing down upon him on all sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The current also had rendered it impossible to manage the ships. Nor was the action like a naval engagement, inasmuch as it was in no respect subject to the control of the will, nor afforded any opportunity for the exercise of skill or method.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The nature of the strait and the tide, which solely and en- <pb id="p.1204" n="1204"/>tirely governed the contest, carried the ships against those of their own and the enemy's party indiscriminately, though striving in a contrary direction; so that you might see one ship which was flying whirled back by an eddy and driven against the victors, and another which was engaged in pursuit, if it had fallen into an opposite current, turning itself away as if for flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And when actually engaged, one ship while bearing down upon another with its beak directed against it, assuming an oblique position itself, received a stroke from the beak of the other; while another which lay with its side exposed to the enemy, receiving a sudden impulse, was turned round so as to present its prow.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While the triremes were thus engaged in a doubtful and uncertain contest, in which every thing was governed by chance, the Roman quinquereme, whether being more manageable in consequence of its weight, or by means of more banks of oars making its way through the eddies, sunk two triremes, and swept off the oars from one side of another, while sailing by it with great violence.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The rest too, had they come in its way, it would have disabled; but Adherbal, with his remaining four ships, sailed over into Africa.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Laelius returned victorious into Carteia; and hearing there what had occurred at Gades, that the plot had been discovered, the conspirators sent to Carthage, and

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> that the hopes which had brought them there had been completely frustrated, he sent a message to Lucius Marcius, to the effect that, unless they wished to waste time uselessly in lying before Gades, they should return to the general; and Marcius consenting to the proposal, they both returned to Carthage a few days after.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In consequence of their departure, Mago not only obtained a temporary relief from the dangers which beset him on all sides, both by sea and land, but also on hearing of the rebellion of the Ilergetians, conceived hopes of recovering Spain, and sent messengers to Carthage to

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the senate, who, at the same time that they represented to them in exaggerated terms both the intestine dissension in the Roman camp and the defection of their allies, might exhort them to send succours by which the empire of Spain, which had been handed down to them by their ancestors, might be regained.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Mandonius and Indibilis, retiring within their borders, remained quiet for a little time, not knowing what course to take, till they knew what was determined upon respecting the mutiny; but not <pb id="p.1205" n="1205"/>distrusting that if Scipio pardoned the error of his own countrymen, they also might obtain the same.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But when the severe punishment inflicted came to be generally known, concluding that their offence also would be considered as demanding a similar expiation, they again summoned their countrymen to arms;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and assembling the auxiliaries which had joined them before, they crossed over into the Sedetanian territory, where they had had a fixed camp at the beginning of the revolt, with twenty thousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio having without difficulty regained the affection of his soldiers, both by his punctuality in discharging the arrears of pay to all, as well the guilty as the innocent, and particularly by the looks and language of reconciliation towards all, before he quitted Carthage summoned an assembly;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and after inveighing at large against the perfidy of the petty princes who were

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> in rebellion, declared <quote>that the feelings with which he set out to take revenge for their villany were widely different from those with which he lately corrected the error committed by his countrymen.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That on the latter occasion, he had with groans and tears, as though he were cutting his own vitals, expiated either the imprudence or the guilt of eight thousand men with the heads of thirty; but now he was going to the destruction of the Ilergetians with joyful and animated feelings: for they were neither natives of the same soil, nor united with him by any bond of society.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The only connexion which did subsist between them, that of honour and friendship, they had themselves severed by their wicked conduct.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he looked at the troops which composed his army, besides that he saw that they were all either of his own country, or allies and of the Latin confederacy; he was also strongly affected by the circumstance, that there was scarcely a soldier in it who was not brought out of Italy into that country either by his uncle, Cneius Scipio, who was the first of the Roman name who had come into that province, or by his father when consul, or by himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That they were all accustomed to the name and auspices of the Scipios; that it was his wish to take them home to their country to receive a well-earned triumph; and that he hoped that they would support him when he put up for the consulship, as if the honour sought were to be shared <pb id="p.1206" n="1206"/>in common by them all.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With regard to the expedition which they were just going to undertake, that the man who considered it as a war must be forgetful of his own achievements. That, by Hercules, Mago, who had fled for safety with a few ships beyond the limits of the world into an island surrounded by the ocean, was a source of greater concern to him than the Ilergetians;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for in it there was both a Carthaginian general and a Carthaginian army, whatever might be its numbers; while here were only robbers and leaders of robbers, who, though they possessed sufficient energy for ravaging the lands of their neighbours, burning their houses, and carrying off their cattle, yet would have none at all in a regular and pitched battle; and who would come to the encounter relying more on the swiftness with which they can fly than on their arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly,</quote> he said, <quote>that he had thought it right to quell the Ilergetians before he quitted the province, not because he saw that any danger could arise from them, or that a war of greater importance could grow out of these proceedings;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but in the first place, that a revolt of so heinous a character might not go unpunished, and in the next place, that not a single enemy might be said to be left in a province which had been subdued with such valour and success.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He bid them, therefore, follow him, with the assistance of the gods, not so much to make war upon, for the contest was not with an enemy who was upon an equality with them, but to take vengeance on the basest of men.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this harangue he dismissed them, with orders to get themselves in readiness in every respect for marching the next day; when, setting out, he arrived at the river Iberus in ten days. Then crossing the river, he, on the fourth day, pitched his camp within sight of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before him was a plain enclosed on all sides by mountains. Into the valley thus formed Scipio ordered some cattle, taken chiefly from the lands of the enemy, to be driven, in order to excite the rapacity of the barbarians, and then

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> sent some light-armed troops as a protection for them, directing Laelius to charge the enemy from a place of concealment when they were engaged in skirmishing.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A mountain which projected conveniently concealed the ambuscade of the cavalry, and the battle began without delay. The Spaniards, as soon as they saw the cattle at a distance, rushed upon them, and the light-armed troops <pb id="p.1207" n="1207"/>attacked the Spaniards while occupied with their booty.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first they annoyed each other with missiles; but afterwards, having discharged their light weapons, which were calculated to provoke rather than to decide the contest, they drew their swords, and began to engage foot to foot.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fight between the infantry would have been doubtful, but that the cavalry then came up, and not only, charging them in front, trod down all before them, but some also, riding round by the foot of the hill, presented themselves on their rear, so that they might intercept the greater part of them; and consequently the carnage was greater than usually takes place in light and skirmishing engagements.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The resentment of the barbarians was rather inflamed by this adverse battle, than their spirits depressed. Accordingly, that they might not appear cast down, they marched out into the field the following day as soon as it was light.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The valley, which was confined, as has been before stated, would not contain all their forces. About two-thirds of their foot and all their cavalry came down to the engagement. The remainder of their infantry they stationed on the declivity of the hill.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Scipio, conceiving that the confined nature of the ground would be in his favour, both because the Roman troops were better adapted for fighting in a contracted space than the Spanish, and also because the enemy had come down and formed their line on ground which would not contain all their forces, applied his mind to a new expedient.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For he considered that he could not himself cover his flanks with his cavalry, and that those of the enemy which they had led out, together with their infantry, would be unable to act.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly he ordered Laelius to lead the cavalry round by the hills as secretly as possible, and separate, as far as he could, the fight between the cavalry from that between the infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He himself drew up the whole body of his infantry against the enemy, placing four cohorts in front, because he could not extend his line further. He commenced the battle without delay, in order that the contest itself might divert the attention of the enemy, and prevent their observing the cavalry which were passing along the hills.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Nor were they aware that they had come round before they heard the noise occasioned by the engagement of the cavalry in their rear.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thus there were two battles; two lines of infantry and two bodies of horse being engaged within the space occupied by the plain lengthwise; and that because <pb id="p.1208" n="1208"/>it was too narrow to admit of both descriptions of force being engaged in the same lines.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When the Spanish infantry could not assist their cavalry, nor their cavalry the infantry, and the infantry, which had rashly engaged in the plain, relying on the assistance of the cavalry, were being cut to pieces, the cavalry themselves also, being surrounded and unable to stand the shock of the enemy's infantry in front, (for by this time their own infantry were completely overthrown,) nor of the cavalry in their rear, after having formed themselves into a circle and defended themselves for a long time, their horses standing still, were all slain to a man.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Nor did one person, horse or foot, survive of those who were engaged in the valley. The third part, which stood upon the hill rather to view the contest in security than to take any part of it upon themselves, had both time and space to fly;

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> among whom the princes themselves also fled, having escaped during the confusion, before the army was entirely surrounded.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same day, besides other booty, the camp of the Spaniards was taken, together with about three thousand men.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of the Romans and their allies as many as one thousand two hundred fell in that battle; more than three thousand were wounded. The victory would have been less bloody had the battle taken place in a plain more extended, and affording facilities for flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Indibilis, renouncing his purpose of carrying on war, and considering that his safest reliance in his present distress was on the tried honour and clemency of Scipio, sent his brother Mandonius to him; who, falling prostrate before his knees, ascribed his conduct to the fatal frenzy of those times, when, as it were

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> from the effects of some pestilential contagion, not only the Ilergetians and Lacetanians, but even the Roman camp had been infected with madness.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He said that his own condition, and that of his brother and the rest of his countrymen, was such, that either, if it seemed good, they would give back their lives to him from whom they had received them, or if preserved a second time, they would in return for that favour devote their lives for ever to the service of him to whom alone they were indebted for them.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They before placed their reliance on their cause, when they had not yet had experience of his clemency, but now, on the contrary, placing no reliance on their cause, all their hopes were centred in the mercy of the conqueror.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was a custom with the Romans, observed from ancient times, not to ex- <pb id="p.1209" n="1209"/>ercise any authority over others, as subject to them, in cases where they did not enter into friendship with them by a league and on equal terms, until they had surrendered all they possessed, sacred and profane; until they had received hostages, taken their arms from them, and placed garrisons in their cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the present instance, however, Scipio, after inveighing at great length against Mandonius, who stood before him, and Indibilis, who was absent, said <quote>that they had justly forfeited their lives by their wicked conduct, but that they should be preserved by the kindness of himself and the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Further, that he would neither take their arms from them, (which only served as pledges to those who feared rebellion,) but would leave them the free use of them, and their minds free from fear; nor would he take vengeance on their unoffending hostages, but upon themselves, should they revolt, not inflicting punishment upon a defenceless but an armed enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That he gave them the liberty of choosing whether they would have the Romans favourable to them or incensed against them, for they had experienced them under both circumstances.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thus Mandonius was allowed to depart, having only a pecuniary fine imposed upon him to furnish the means of paying the troops. Scipio himself, having sent Marcius in advance into the Farther Spain, and sent Silanus back to Tarraco, waited a few days until the Ilergetians had paid the fine imposed upon them;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and then, setting out with some troops lightly equipped, overtook Marcius when he was now drawing near to the ocean.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The negotiation which had some time before commenced respecting Masinissa, was delayed from one cause after another; for the Numidian was desirous by all means of conferring with Scipio in person, and of touching his right hand in confirmation of their compact. This was the cause of Scipio's undertaking at this time a journey of such a length, and into so remote a quarter.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Masinissa, when at Gades, received information from Marcius of the approach of Scipio, and by pretending that his horses were injured by being pent up in the island, and that they not only caused a scarcity of every thing to the rest, but also felt it themselves; moreover that his cavalry were beginning to lose their energy for want of employment;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> he prevailed upon Mago to allow him to cross over to the continent, to plunder the adjacent country of <pb id="p.1210" n="1210"/>Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having passed over, he sent forward three chiefs of the Numidians, to fix a time and place for the conference, desiring that two might be detained by Scipio as hostages. The third being sent back to conduct Masinissa to the place to which he was directed to bring him, they came to the conference with a few attendants.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Numidian had long before been possessed with admiration of Scipio from the fame of his exploits; and his imagination had pictured to him the idea of a grand and magnificent person; but his veneration for him was still greater when he appeared before him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For besides that his person, naturally majestic in the highest degree, was rendered still more so by his flowing hair, by his dress, which was not in a precise and ornamental style, but truly masculine and soldier-like, and also by his age, for he was then in full vigour of body, to which the bloom of youth,

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> renewed as it were after his late illness, had given additional fulness and sleekness.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Numidian, who was in a manner thunderstruck by the mere effect of the meeting, thanked him for having sent home his brother's son. He affirmed, that from that time he had sought for this opportunity, which being at length presented to him, by favour of the immortal gods, he had not allowed to pass without seizing it.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That he desired to serve him and the Roman people in such a manner, as that no one foreigner should have aided the Roman interest with greater zeal than himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Although he had long since wished it, he had not been so able to effect it in Spain, a foreign and strange country; but that it would be easy for him to do so in that country in which he had been born and educated, under the hope of succeeding to his father's throne.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If, indeed, the Romans should send the same commander, Scipio, into Africa, he entertained a well-grounded hope that Carthage would continue to exist but a short time.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio saw and heard him with the highest delight, both because he knew that he was the first man in all the cavalry of the enemy, and because the youth himself exhibited in his manner the strongest proof of a noble spirit. After mutual pledges of faith, he set out on his return to Tarraco.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Masinissa, having laid waste the adjacent lands, with the permission of the Romans, that he might not appear to have passed over into the continent to no purpose, returned to Gades.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mago, who despaired of success in Spain, of which he <pb id="p.1211" n="1211"/>had entertained hopes, from the confidence inspired first by the mutiny of the soldiers, and afterwards by the defection of Indibilis, received a message from Carthage, while preparing to cross over into Africa, that the senate ordered him to carry over into Italy the fleet he had at Gades;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and hiring there as many as he could of the Gallic and Ligurian youth, to form a junction with Hannibal, and not to suffer the war to flag which had been begun with so much vigour and still more success.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For this object Mago not only received a supply of money from Carthage, but himself also exacted as much as he could from the inhabitants of Gades, plundering not only their treasury, but their temples, and compelling them individually to bring contributions of gold and silver, for the public service.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As he sailed along the coast of Spain, he landed his troops not far from New Carthage, and after wasting the neighbouring lands, brought his fleet thence to the city. Here, keeping his troops in the ships by day, he landed them by night, and marched them to that part of the wall at which Carthage had been captured by the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for he had supposed both that the garrison by which the city was occupied was not sufficiently strong for its protection, and that some of the townsmen would act on the hope of effecting a change. But messengers who came with the utmost haste and alarm from the country, brought intelligence at once of the devastation of the lands, the flight of the rustics, and the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Besides, the fleet had been observed during the day, and it was evident that there was some object in choosing a station before the city. Accordingly, the troops were kept drawn up and armed within the gate which looks towards the lake and the sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the enemy, rushing forward in a disorderly manner, with a crowd of seamen mingled with soldiers, came up to the walls with more noise than strength;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the gate being suddenly thrown open, the Romans sallied forth with a shout, and pursued the enemy, routed and put to flight at the first onset and

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> discharge of their weapons, all the way to the shore, killing a great number of them;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> nor would one of them have survived the battle and the flight, had not the ships, which had been brought to the shore, afforded them a refuge in their dismay.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Great alarm and confusion also prevailed in the ships, occasioned by their drawing up the ladders, lest the enemy should force their way in together with <pb id="p.1212" n="1212"/>their own men, and by cutting away their halsers and anchors that they might not lose time in weighing them.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Many, too, met with a miserable death while endeavouring to swim to the ships, not knowing, in consequence of the darkness, which way to direct their course, or what to avoid.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On the following day, after the fleet had fled back to the ocean, whence it had come, as many as eight hundred were slain between the wall and the shore, and two thousand stand of arms were found.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mago, on his return to Gades, not being allowed to enter the place, brought his fleet to shore at Cimbis, a place not far distant from Gades; whence he sent ambassadors with complaints of their having closed their gates upon a friend and ally.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While they endeavoured to excuse themselves on the ground that it was done by a disorderly assembly of their people, who were exasperated against them on account of some acts of plunder which had been committed by the soldiers when they were embarking, he enticed their suffetes, which is the name of the chief magistracy among the Carthaginians, together with their quaestor, to come to a conference;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> when he ordered them to be lacerated with stripes and crucified.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then passed over with his fleet to the island Pityusa, distant about a hundred miles from the continent, and inhabited at that time by Carthaginians; on which account the fleet was received in a friendly manner; and not only were provisions liberally furnished, but also young men and arms were given them to reinforce their fleet. Rendered confident by these supplies, the Carthaginians crossed over to the Balearian islands, fifty miles distant.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Balearian islands are two in number; one larger than the other, and more powerful in men and arms; having also a harbour in which, as it was now the latter end of autumn, he believed he might winter conveniently.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But here his fleet was opposed with as much hostility as he would have met with had the Romans inhabited that island. The only weapons they used at that time, and which they now principally employ, were slings; nor is there an individual of any other nation who possesses such a degree of excellence in the skilful use of this weapon, as the Balearians universally possess over the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such a quantity of stones, therefore, was poured like the thickest hail on the fleet, when approaching the shore, that, not daring to enter the harbour, <pb id="p.1213" n="1213"/>they made off for the main.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They then passed over to the lesser Balearian island, which is of a fertile soil, but not equally powerful in men and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Here, therefore, they landed, and pitched a camp in a strong position above the harbour; and having made themselves masters of the city and country without a contest, they enlisted two thousand auxiliaries, which they sent to Carthage, and then hauled their ships on shore for the winter.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After Mago had left the coast of the ocean, the people of Gades surrendered to the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the transactions in Spain under the conduct and auspices of Publius Scipio. Scipio himself, having put Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus in charge of the province, returned to Rome with ten ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having obtained an audience of the senate without the city, in the temple of Bellona, he gave an account of the services he had performed in Spain; how often he had fought pitched battles, how many towns he had taken by force from the enemy, and what nations he had brought under the dominion of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He stated that he had gone into Spain against four generals, and four victorious armies, but that he had not left a Carthaginian in that country.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On account of these services he rather tried his prospect of a triumph, than pressed it pertinaciously; for it was quite clear, that no one had triumphed up to that time for services performed, when not invested with a magistracy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the senate was dismissed he entered the city, and carried before him into the treasury fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-two pounds of silver, and a great quantity of coined silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Veturius Philo then held the assembly for the election of consuls, when all the centuries, with the strongest marks of attachment, named Publius Scipio as consul. Publius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff, was joined with him as his colleague.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is recorded, that this election was attended by a greater number of persons than any other during the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> People had come together from all quarters, not only to give their votes, but also for the purpose of seeing Publius Scipio. They ran in crowds, not only to his house, but also to the Capitol;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> where he was engaged in offering a sacrifice of a hundred oxen to Jupiter, which he had vowed in Spain, impressed with a presentiment, that as Caius Lutatius had terminated the former Punic war, <pb id="p.1214" n="1214"/>so Publius Scipio would terminate the present;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that as he had driven the Carthaginians out of every part of Spain, so he would drive them out of Italy; and dooming Africa to him as his province, as though the war in Italy were at an end.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The assembly was then held for the election of praetors. Two were elected who were then plebeian aediles, namely, Spurius Lucretius and Cneius Octavius; and of private persons, Cneius Servilius Caepio and Lucius Aemilius Papus.</p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>In the fourteenth year of the Punic war, Publius Cornelius Scipio and Publius Licinius Crassus entered on the consulship, when the provinces assigned to the consuls were, to Scipio, Sicily, without drawing lots, his colleague not opposing it, because the care of the sacred affairs required the presence of the chief pontiff in Italy; to Crassus, Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The provinces of the praetors were then put to the determination of lots, when the city jurisdiction fell to Servilius; Ariminum, for so they called Gaul, to Spurius Lucretius; Sicily to Lucius Aemilius; Sardinia to Cneius Octavius.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> A senate was held in the Capitol, when, on the motion of Publius Scipio, a decree was made, that he should exhibit the games which he had vowed in Spain during the mutiny of the soldiers, out of the money which he had himself brought into the treasury.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>























<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He then introduced into the senate the Saguntine ambassadors, the eldest of whom thus spoke: <quote>Although there remains no degree of suffering, conscript fathers, beyond what we have endured, in order that we might keep our faith towards you to the last; yet such are the benefits which we have received both from yourselves and your generals, that we do not repent of the calamities to which we have ourselves been exposed.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On our account you undertook the war, and having undertaken it, you have continued to carry it on for now the fourteenth year with such inflexible perseverance, that frequently you have both yourselves been reduced, and have brought the Carthaginians to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At a time when you had a war of such a desperate character in Italy, and Hannibal as your antagonist, you sent your consul with an army into Spain, to collect, as it were, the remains of our wreck.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Publius and Cneius Cornelius, from the time they entered the province, never ceased from adopting such measures as were favourable to us and detrimental to our enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> First of all, they restored to us our <pb id="p.1215" n="1215"/>town; and, sending persons to collect our countrymen, who were sold and dispersed throughout all Spain, restored them from a state of slavery to freedom.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When our circumstances, from being wretched in the extreme, had nearly assumed a desirable state, your generals Publius and Cneius Cornelius fell, more to be lamented by ourselves even than by you.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then truly we seemed to have been dragged back from distant places to our ancient abode, to perish again, and witness the second destruction of our country. Nor did it appear that there was any need forsooth of a Carthaginian army or general to effect our destruction;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but that we might be annihilated by the Turdulans, our most inveterate enemies, who had also been the cause of our former overthrow. When suddenly, to our great surprise, you sent us this Publius Scipio, in seeing whom declared consul, and in having it in

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> our power to carry word back to our countrymen that we have seen it, for on him our hopes and safety entirely rest, we consider ourselves the most fortunate of all the Saguntines.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He, when he had taken a great number of the cities of your enemies in Spain, on all occasions separated the Saguntines out of the mass of captives, and sent them back to their country; and lastly, by his arms he reduced to so low a state Turdetania, which harboured such animosity against us, that if that

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> nation continued to flourish it was impossible that Saguntum could stand, that it not only was not an object of fear to us, but, and may I say it without incurring odium, not even to our posterity.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> We see the city of those persons demolished, to gratify whom Hannibal destroyed Saguntum. We receive tribute from their lands, which is not more acceptable to us from the advantage we derive from it than from revenge.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In consideration of these benefits, than which we could not hope or wish for greater from the immortal gods, the senate and people of Saguntum have sent us ten ambassadors to you to return their thanks;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and at the same time to offer you their congratulations on your having carried on your operations in Spain and Italy so successfully of late years, that you have subdued by your arms, and have gotten possession of Spain, not only as far as the river Iberus, but also to where the ocean forms the limit of the remotest regions of the world; while in Italy you have left nothing to the Carthaginian except so much space as the rampart of his camp en- <pb id="p.1216" n="1216"/>closes.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> We have been desired, not only to return thanks for these blessings to Jove most good and great, the guardian deity of the capitoline citadel, but also, if you should permit us, to carry into the Capitol this present of a golden crown in token of victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> We request that you would permit us so to do; and, if you think proper, that you would, by your authority, perpetuate and ratify the advantages which your generals have conferred upon us.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The senate replied to the Saguntines, <quote>that the destruction and restoration of Saguntum would form a monument to all the nations of the world of social faith preserved on both sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> That, in restoring Saguntum, and rescuing its citizens from slavery, their generals had acted properly, regularly, and according to the wishes of the senate; and that, whatever other acts of kindness they had done to them, were in conformity with the wishes of the senate. That they gave them permission to deposit their present in the Capitol.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Orders were then given to furnish the ambassadors with apartments and entertainment, and that not less than ten thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> should be given to each as a present. After this, the rest of the embassies were introduced and heard.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> On the request of the Saguntines that they

<milestone unit="section" n="21??"/> might go and take a view of Italy as far as they could with safety, they were furnished with guides, and letters were sent to the several towns, requiring them to entertain the Spaniards kindly.

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> The senate then took into consideration the state of public affairs, the levying troops, and the provinces.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It being generally reported that Africa, as a new province, was destined for Publius Scipio without casting lots; and he himself, not content with any moderate share of glory, asserting that he had been declared consul, not only for prosecuting, but for finishing the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that that object could not be accomplished by any other means than by his transporting an army into Africa; and himself openly declaring that he would do it through the people if the senate opposed him; the design by no means pleased the principal senators; and when the rest, either through fear or a wish to ingratiate themselves with him, only murmured, Quintus Fabius Maximus, being asked his opinion, thus spoke:

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> "I know, conscript fathers, that by many of you the question which is this day agitated is considered as already determined; and that the man who shall deliver his sentiments on the subject of making <pb id="p.1217" n="1217"/>Africa a province, as a new proposal, will speak to little purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, in the first place, I cannot see how it can be considered as determined, that Africa shall be the province of the consul, that brave and active officer, when neither the senate have voted nor the people ordered that it should be constituted a province this year.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the next place, if it is determined, I think the consul is to blame, who, by pretending to consult the senate on a question already decided, insults that body, and not the senator only who delivers his sentiments in his place on the subject of deliberation.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Now I am well aware, that by disapproving of this excessive eagerness to pass over into Africa, I subject myself to two imputations: one grounded on the caution inherent in my disposition, which young men may if they please call cowardice and

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> sloth, so long as we have the consolation to reflect, that though hitherto the measures of others have always appeared on the first view of them the more plausible, mine on experience have proved the sounder.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other imputation is that of jealousy and envy towards the daily increasing glory of this most valiant consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But if neither my past life and character, nor a dictatorship, together with five consulships, and so much glory acquired, both in peace and war, that I am more likely to loathe it than desire more, exempt me from such a suspicion, let my age at least acquit me. For what rivalry can there exist between myself and a man who is not equal in years even to my son?

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When I was dictator, when as yet in the possession of full vigour, and engaged in a series of affairs of the utmost magnitude, no one heard me, either in the senate or in the popular assembly, express any reluctance to have the command equally shared between myself and the master of the horse, at the time when he was maligning me; a proposition which no one ever heard mention of before.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I chose to bring it about by actions rather than by words, that he who was placed on the same footing with me in the judgment of others, should soon by his own confession declare me his superior.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Much less, after having passed through these honours, would I propose to myself to enter the lists of competition and rivalry with a man in the very bloom of youth.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And that, forsooth, in order that Africa, if it shall have been denied to him, may be assigned as a province to me, who am now weary of life, and not merely of active employments. I must live and die with that share <pb id="p.1218" n="1218"/>of glory which I have already acquired.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> I prevented Hannibal from conquering, in order that he might even be conquered by you, whose powers are now in full vigour.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"It is but fair, Publius Cornelius, that you should pardon me, if I, who in my own case never preferred the honour of men to the interest of the state, do not place even your fame before the public good.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although, if there were either no war in Italy, or an enemy of such a description that no glory could be acquired from conquering him, the man who would retain you in Italy, though actuated by a desire to promote the public good, might appear to wish to deprive you of an opportunity of acquiring renown when he objected to your removing the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since Hannibal is our antagonist, who is besieging Italy for now the fourteenth year, with an army unimpaired, will you have reason to be dissatisfied, Publius Cornelius, with the glory you will acquire, if you in your consulate shall drive out of Italy an enemy who has been the cause of so many deaths and so many disasters to us, and if you should enjoy the distinction of having terminated this, as Caius Lutatius did the former Punic war?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Unless either Hamilcar is a general more worthy of consideration than Hannibal, or a war in Africa of more importance, or a victory there greater and more glorious, (should it be our lot to be victorious while you are consul,) than one here. Would you rather have drawn away Hamilcar from Drepanum and Eryx than have expelled the Carthaginians and Hannibal from Italy?

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although you naturally prize more highly the renown which you have acquired than that which

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> you hope for, yet surely you would not boast more of having freed Spain from war than of having freed Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hannibal is not as yet in such a state as that the man who prefers another war would not appear to have feared rather than to have despised him. Why then do you not apply yourself to this, and carry the war in a straightforward manner to the place where Hannibal is, rather than pursue that circuitous course, according to which you expect that when you shall have crossed over into Africa Hannibal will follow you thither? Do you seek to obtain the distinguished honour of having finished the Punic war?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After you have defended your own possessions, for this is naturally the first object, then proceed to attack those of others.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Let there be peace in Italy before war in <pb id="p.1219" n="1219"/>Africa; and let us be free from fear ourselves before we bring it upon others.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If it is possible that both objects may be accomplished under your conduct and auspices, having first conquered Hannibal here, then go and lay siege to Carthage; but if one or other of these conquests must be left for the succeeding consuls, the former is both the greater and more glorious, and also the cause of the second.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For now indeed, besides that the treasury is not able to maintain two different armies, one in Italy and one in Africa; besides that we have nothing left from which we may equip fleets or be able to furnish provisions, who knows not how great danger would be incurred? 'Publius Licinius will wage war in Italy, Publius Scipio in Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> What if, (an omen which may all the gods avert, and which my mind shrinks back with alarm from mentioning, &mdash;but what has happened may happen again, &mdash;) what I say, if Hannibal, having gained a victory, should advance to the city?

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Shall we then at length send for you, our consul, out of Africa, as we formerly sent for Quintus Fulvius from Capua? What shall we say when we consider that in Africa also both parties will be liable to the chances of war?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Let your own house, your father and your uncle, slain together with their armies within the space of thirty days, after that, having spent several years in the performance of the most important services, both by sea and land, they had

<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> inspired foreign nations with the highest reverence for the name of the Roman people and your family, be a warning to you.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The day would fail me were I disposed to enumerate the kings and generals who have brought the most signal calamities upon themselves and their armies by rashly passing into the territories of their enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The Athenians, a state distinguished for prudence, leaving a war at home, sent a great fleet into Sicily at the instance of a youth equally enterprising and illustrious; but by one naval battle they reduced their flourishing republic to a state of humiliation from which she could never recover.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>























<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>But I am adducing foreign and too remote examples. That same Africa, and Marcus Atilius, who was a signal example of both extremes of fortune, may form a warning to us.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Without doubt, Publius Cornelius, when you shall have a view of Africa from the sea, the reduction of your province of Spain will appear to you to have been a mere matter of <pb id="p.1220" n="1220"/>sport and pastime.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For what similarity is there between them? After sailing along the coast of Italy and Gaul to Emporiae without any enemy to oppose you, you brought your fleet to land at a city of our allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There landing your soldiers, you marched them through countries entirely secure from danger to Tarraco, to join the allies and friends of the Roman people. After that, from Tarraco you marched through places garrisoned by Roman troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the banks of the Iberus were the armies of your father and your uncle, rendered. still more furious after the loss of their generals, even by the very calamity they had suffered. The general, indeed, Lucius Marcius, had been irregularly constituted and chosen for the time by the suffrages of the soldiers; but had he been adorned with noble birth and the regular gradations of preferment, he would have been equal to the most distinguished generals, from his skill in every art of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> You then laid siege to Carthage, quite at your leisure, not one of the three Punic armies coming to the defence of their allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The rest of your achievements, nor do I wish to disparage them, are by no means to be compared with what you will have to do in a war in Africa, where there is not a single harbour open to receive our fleet, no part of the country at peace with us, no state in alliance, no king in friendship with us, no room in any part either to take up a position or to advance.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whichever way you turn your eyes, all is hostility and danger. Do you trust in the Numidians and Syphax? Let it suffice to have trusted in them once. Temerity is not always successful, and the fraudulent usually pave the way to confidence in small matters, that when an advantageous opportunity occurs, they may deceive with great gain.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Your father and uncle were not cut off by the arms of their enemies till they were duped by the treachery of their Celtiberian allies; nor were you yourself exposed to so much danger from Mago and Hasdrubal, the generals of your enemies, as from Indibilis and Mandonius, whom you had received into friendship.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Can you place any confidence in Numidians after having experienced a defection in your own soldiers? Syphax and Masinissa would rather that they themselves should have the rule in Africa than the Carthaginians, but that the Carthaginians should rather than any other state.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At present, emulation and the various causes of dispute existing be- <pb id="p.1221" n="1221"/>tween them incite them against each other, because the fear of any foreign enemy is remote. But show them the Roman arms and a body of troops, natives of another country, and they will run together as if to extinguish a common conflagration.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> These same Carthaginians defended Spain in a different manner from that in which they will defend the walls of their capital, the temples of their gods, their altars, and their hearths; when their terrified wives will attend them on the way to the battle, and their little children will run to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> What, moreover, if the Carthaginians, feeling sufficiently secure in the harmony subsisting in Africa, in the attachment of the sovereigns in alliance with them, and their own fortifications, should, when they see Italy

<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> deprived of the support of yourself and your army, themselves assuming an offensive attitude, either send a fresh army out of Africa into Italy, or order Mago, who, it is certain, having passed over from the Baleares, is now sailing along the coast of Liguria and the Alps, to form a junction with Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Without doubt, we should be thrown into the same state of alarm as we were lately, when Hasdrubal passed over into Italy; that Hasdrubal, whom you, who are about to blockade, not Carthage only, but all Africa with your army, allowed to slip out of your hands into Italy. You will say that he was conquered by you. For that very reason I should be less willing, not on account of the commonwealth only, but of yourself, that, after having been defeated, he should be allowed to march into Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Suffer us to ascribe to your prudence all the successful events which have happened to you and the empire of the Roman people, and to impute all those of an adverse nature to the uncertain chances of war and to fortune. The more meritorious and brave you are, so much the more do your country and all Italy desire to retain you as their protector.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> You cannot even yourself pretend to deny, that where Hannibal is, there is the head and principal stress of the war, for you profess, that your motive in crossing over into Africa is to draw Hannibal thither. Whether, therefore, here or there, it is with Hannibal that you will have to contend. Will you then, I pray, have more power in Africa and alone, or here, with your own and your colleague's army united?

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Is not the great difference which this makes proved to you even by the recent precedent of Claudius and Livius, <pb id="p.1222" n="1222"/>the consuls? What! will Hannibal, who has now for a long time been unavailingly soliciting succours from home, be rendered more powerful in men and arms when occupying the remotest corner of the Bruttian territory, or when near to Carthage and supported by all Africa?

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> What sort of policy is that of yours, to prefer fighting where your own forces will be diminished by one half, and the enemy's greatly augmented, to encountering the enemy when you will have two armies against one, and that wearied with so many battles, and so protracted and laborious a service?

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Consider how far this policy of yours corresponds with that of your parent. He, setting out in his consulship for Spain, returned from his province into Italy, that he might meet Hannibal on his descent from the Alps; while you are going to leave Italy when Hannibal is there, not because you consider such a course beneficial to the state, but because you think it will redound to your own honour and glory;

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> acting in the same manner as you did when leaving your province and your army without the sanction of a law, without a decree of the senate, you, a general of the Roman people, intrusted to two ships the fortune of the commonwealth and the majesty of the empire, which were then hazarded in your person.

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> In my estimation, conscript fathers, Publius Cornelius was elected consul for the service of the state and of us, and not to forward his own individual interest; and the armies were enlisted for the protection of the city and of Italy, and not for the consuls, like kings, to carry into whatever part of the world they please from motives of vanity.</quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Fabius having made a strong impression on a large portion of the senate, and especially those advanced in years, by this speech, which was adapted to the occasion, and also by his authority and his long-established reputation for prudence; and those who approved of the counsel of this old man being more numerous than those who commended the hot spirit of the young one;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio is reported thus to have spoken:

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> "Even Quintus Fabius himself has observed, conscript fathers, in the commencement of his speech, that in the opinion he gave a feeling of jealousy might be suspected.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And though I dare not myself charge so great a man with harbouring that feeling, yet, whether it is owing to a defect in his language, or to the fact, that suspicion has certainly not <pb id="p.1223" n="1223"/>been removed. For he has so magnified his own honours and the fame of his exploits, in order to do away with the imputation of envy, that it would appear I am in danger of being rivalled by every obscure person, but not by himself, because, as he enjoys an eminence above every body else, an eminence to which I do not dissemble that I also aspire, he is unwilling that I should be placed upon a level with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He has represented himself as an old man, and as one who has gone through every gradation of honour, and me as below the age even of his son;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> as if he supposed that the desire of glory did not exceed the limits of human life, and as if its chief part had not respect to memory and future ages.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I am confident, that it is usual with all the most exalted minds, to compare themselves, not only with the illustrious men of the present, but of every age.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For my own part, I do not dissemble that I am desirous, not only to attain to the share of glory which you possess, Quintus Fabius, but, (and in saying it I mean no offence,) if I can, even to exceed it. Let not such a feeling exist in your mind towards me, nor in mine towards those who are my juniors, as that we should be unwilling that any of our countrymen should attain to the same celebrity with ourselves;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for that would be a detriment, not to those only who may be the objects of our envy, but to the state, and almost to the whole human race.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He mentioned what a great degree of danger I should incur, should I cross over into Africa, so that he appeared solicitous on my account, and not only for the state and the army. But whence has this concern for me so suddenly sprung?

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When my father and uncle were slain; when their two armies were cut up almost to a man; when Spain was lost; when four armies of the Carthaginians and four generals kept possession of every thing by terror and by arms; when a general was sought for to take the command of that war, and no one came forward besides myself, no one had the courage to declare himself a candidate; when the Roman people had conferred the command upon me, though only twenty-four years of age;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> why was it that no one at that time made any mention of my age, of the strength of the enemy, of the difficulty of the war, and of the recent destruction of my father and uncle?

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Has some greater disaster been suffered in Africa now than had at that time befallen us in Spain? Are there now larger armies in Africa, more and better generals, than were then in Spain?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <pb id="p.1224" n="1224"/>Was my age then more mature for conducting a war than now? Can a war with a Carthaginian enemy be carried on with greater convenience in Spain than in Africa?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After having routed and put to flight four Carthaginian armies; after having captured by force, or reduced to submission by fear, so many cities; after having entirely subdued every thing as far as the ocean, so many petty princes, so many savage nations; after having regained possession of the whole of Spain, so that no trace of war remains, it is an easy matter to make light of my services;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> just as easy as it would be, should I return victorious from Africa, to make light of those very circumstances which are now magnified in order that they may appear formidable, for the purpose of detaining me here. He says that there is no possibility of entering Africa; that there are no ports open.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> He mentions that Marcus Atilius was taken prisoner in Africa, as if Marcus Atilius had miscarried on his first access to Africa. Nor does he recollect that the ports of Africa were open to that very commander, unfortunate as he was; that he performed some brilliant services during the first year, and continued undefeated to the last, so far as related to the Carthaginian generals. You will not, therefore, in the least deter me by that example of yours.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> If that disaster had been sustained in the present, and not in the former war, if lately, and not forty years ago, yet why would it be less advisable for me to cross over into Africa after Regulus had been made prisoner there, than into Spain after the Scipios had been slain there?

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> I should be reluctant to admit that the birth of Xanthippus the Lacedaemonian was more fortunate for Carthage than mine for my country. My confidence would be increased by the very circumstance, that such important consequences depended upon the valour of one man.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> But further, we must take warning by the Athenians, who inconsiderately crossed over into Sicily, leaving a war in their own country.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Why, therefore, since you have leisure to relate Grecian tales, do you not rather set before us the instance of Agathocles, king of Syracuse, who, when Sicily was for a long time wasted by a Punic war, by passing over into this same Africa, removed the war to the country from whence it came.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>But what need is there of ancient and foreign examples to remind us what sort of thing it is boldly to carry terror against an enemy, and, removing the danger from oneself, to <pb id="p.1225" n="1225"/>bring another into peril?

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Can there be a stronger instance than Hannibal himself, or one more to the point? It makes a great difference whether you devastate the territories of another, or see your own destroyed by fire and sword.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He who brings danger upon another has more spirit than he who repels it. Add to this, that the terror excited by unknown circumstances is increased on that account.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When you have entered the territory of an enemy, you may have a near view of his advantages and disadvantages. Hannibal did not expect that it would come to pass that so many of the states in Italy would come over to him as did so after the defeat at Cannae.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> How much less would any firmness or constancy be experienced in Africa by the Carthaginians, who are themselves faithless allies, oppressive and haughty masters! Besides, we, even when deserted by our allies, stood firm in our own strength, the Roman soldiery. The Carthaginians possess no native strength. The soldiers they have are obtained by hire; &mdash;Africans and Numidians &mdash;people remarkable above all others for the inconstancy of their attachments.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Provided no impediment arises here, you will hear at once that I have landed, and that Africa is blazing with war; that Hannibal is preparing for his departure from this country, and that Carthage is besieged.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Expect more frequent and more joyful despatches from Africa than you received from Spain. The considerations on which I ground my anticipations are the good fortune of the Roman people, the gods, the witnesses of the treaty violated by the enemy, the kings Syphax and Masinissa; on whose fidelity I will rely in such a manner as that I may be secure from danger should they prove perfidious.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many things which are not now apparent, at this distance, the war will develope; and it is the part of a man, and a general, not to be wanting when fortune presents itself, and to bend its events to his designs.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I shall, Quintus Fabius, have the opponent you assign me, Hannibal; but I shall rather draw him after me than be kept here by him. I will compel him to fight in his own country, and Carthage shall be the prize of victory rather than the half-ruined forts of the Bruttians.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With regard to providing that the state sustain no injury in the mean time, while I am crossing over, while I am landing my troops in Africa, while I am advancing my camp to the walls of Carthage;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> be not too sure that it is not an insult to <pb id="p.1226" n="1226"/>Publius Licinius, the consul, a man of consummate valour, who did not draw lots for so distant a province merely that, as he was chief pontiff, he might not be absent from religious affairs, to say that he is unable to do that, now that the power of Hannibal is shaken, and in a manner shattered, which you, Quintus Fabius, were able to effect when he was flying victorious throughout all Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> By Hercules, even if the war would not be more speedily terminated by adopting the plan I propose, yet it were consistent with the dignity of the Roman people, and the high character they enjoy with foreign kings and nations, to appear to have had spirit not only to defend Italy, but also to carry hostilities into Africa; and that it should not be supposed and spread abroad that no Roman general dared what Hannibal had dared;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that in the former Punic war, when the contest was about Sicily, Africa should have been so often attacked by our fleets and armies, and that now, when the contest is about Italy, Africa should be left undisturbed.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Let Italy, which has so long been harassed, at length enjoy some repose; let Africa, in her turn, be fired and devastated.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Let the Roman camp overhang the gates of Carthage rather than that we should again behold the rampart of the enemy from our walls. Let Africa be the seat of the remainder of the war. Let terror and flight, the devastation of lands, the defection of allies, and all the other calamities of war which have fallen upon us, through a period of fourteen years, be turned upon her.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It is sufficient for me to have spoken on those matters which relate to the state, the war before us, and the provinces which form the subject of deliberation.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> My discourse would be tedious and uninteresting to you if, as Fabius has depreciated my services in Spain, I should also in like manner endeavour, on the other hand, to turn his glory into ridicule, and make the most of my own.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> I will do neither, conscript fathers; and if in nothing else, though a young man, I shall certainly have shown my superiority over this old man, in modesty and the government of my tongue. Such has been my life, and such the services I have performed, that I can gladly rest contented in silence with that opinion which you have spontaneously conceived of me.</quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio was heard less favourably, because a report had been spread that, if he did not prevail with the senate to have <pb id="p.1227" n="1227"/>Africa decreed to him as his province, he would immediately lay the matter before the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore, Quintus Fulvius, who had been consul four times, and censor, requested of the consul that he would openly declare in the senate whether <quote>he submitted to the fathers to decide respecting the provinces; and whether he intended to abide by their determination, or to put it to the people.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Scipio having replied that he would act as he thought for the interest of the state, Fulvius then rejoined:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>When I asked you the question I was not ignorant of what answer you would give, or how you would act; for you plainly show that you are rather sounding than consulting the senate;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and, unless we immediately decree to you the province you wish, have a bill ready (to lay before the people). Therefore,</quote> said he, <quote>I require of you, tribunes of the people, to support me in refusing to give my opinion, because, though my recommendation should be adopted, the consul is not disposed to abide by it.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> An altercation then arose, the consul asserting that it was unfair for the tribunes to interpose so as to prevent any senator from giving his opinion in his place on being asked it.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The tribunes came to the determination, <quote>that if the consul submit to the senate the question relating to the provinces, whatever the senate decree we shall consider as final, nor will we allow a bill to be proposed to the people on the subject. If he does not submit it to them, we will support any one who shall refuse to deliver his sentiments upon the matter.</quote> The consul requested the delay of a day to confer with his colleague.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The next day the decision was submitted to the senate. The provinces were assigned in this manner: to one of the consuls Sicily and thirty ships of war, which Caius Servilius had commanded the former year; he was also permitted to cross over into Africa if he conceived it to be for the advantage of the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To the other consul Bruttium and the war with Hannibal were assigned; with either that army which Lucius Veturius or that which Quintus Caecilius commanded.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The two latter were to draw lots, and settle between themselves which should act in Bruttium with the two legions which the consul gave up; and he to whose lot that province fell, was to be continued in command for a year. The other persons also, besides the consuls and praetors, who were to take the command of armies and provinces, were continued in command.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <pb id="p.1228" n="1228"/>It fell to the lot of Quintus Caecilius to carry on the war against Hannibal in Bruttium, together with the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The games of Scipio were then celebrated in the presence of a great number of persons, and with the approbation of the spectators. The deputies, Marcus Pomponius Matho and Quintus Catius, sent to Delphi to convey a present out of the spoils taken from Hasdrubal, carried with them a golden crown of two hundred pounds' weight, and representations of the spoils made out of a thousand pounds' weight of silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Scipio, though he could not obtain leave to levy troops, a point which he did not urge with great eagerness, obtained leave to take with him such as volunteered their services;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and also, as he declared that the fleet would not be the occasion of expense to the state, to receive what was furnished by the allies for building fresh ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> First, the states of Etruria engaged to assist the consuls to the utmost of their respective abilities. The people of Caere furnished corn, and provisions of every description, for the crews; the people of Populoni furnished iron; of Tarquinii, cloth for sails;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> those of Volaterrae, planks for ships, and corn; those of Arretium, thirty thousand shields, as many helmets;

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and of javelins, Gallic darts, and long spears, they undertook to make up to the amount of fifty thousand, an equal number of each description, together with as many axes, mattocks, bills, buckets, and mills, as should be sufficient for fifty men of war, with a hundred and twenty thousand pecks of wheat;

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> and to contribute to the support of the decurios and rowers on the voyage. The people of Perusia, Clusium, and Rusella furnished firs for building ships, and a great quantity of corn.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Scipio had firs out of the public woods. The states of Umbria, and, besides them, the people of Nursia, Reate, and Amiternum, and all those of the Sabine territory, promised soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Many of the Marsians, Pelignians, and Marrucinians volunteered to serve in the fleet. The Cameritans, as they were joined with the Romans in a league on equal terms, sent an armed cohort of six hundred men.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Having laid the keels of thirty ships, twenty of which were quinqueremes, and ten quadriremes, he prosecuted the work with such diligence, that, on the forty-fifth day after the materials were taken from the woods, the ships, being fully equipped and armed, were launched.</p>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Licinius came into Bruttium to the two consular armies, of which he selected for himself that which Lucius Veturius, the consul, had commanded.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He allowed Metellus to continue in the command of those legions which were before under him, concluding that he could act more easily with the troops accustomed to his command. The praetors also went to their different provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As there was a scarcity of money to carry on the war, the quaestors were ordered to sell a district of the Campanian territory extending from the Grecian trench to the sea, with permission to receive information as to what land belonged to a native Campanian, in order that it might be put into the possession of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The reward fixed upon for the informer was a tenth part of the value of the lands so discovered.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Cneius Servilius, the city praetor was also charged with seeing that the Campanians dwelt where they were allowed, according to the decree of the senate, and to punish such as dwelt anywhere else.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same summer, Mago, son of Amilcar, setting out from the lesser of the Balearian islands, where he had wintered, having put on board his fleet a chosen body of young men, conveyed over into Italy twelve thousand foot, and about two thousand horse, with about thirty ships of war, and a great number of transports. By the suddenness of his arrival he took Genoa, as there were no troops employed in protecting the sea-coast.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence he brought his fleet to shore, on the coast of the Alpine Ligurians, to see if he could create any commotion there.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Ingaunians, a tribe of the Ligurians, were at that juncture engaged in war with the Epanterians, a people inhabiting the mountains.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Carthaginian, therefore, having deposited his plunder at Savo, an Alpine town, left ten ships of war for its protection. He sent the rest to Carthage to guard the seacoast, as it was reported that Scipio intended to pass over thither; formed an alliance with the Ingaunians, whose friendship he preferred; and commenced an attack upon the mountaineers.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> His army increased daily, the Gauls flocking to his standard from all sides, from the splendour of his fame.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the senate received information of these things, by a letter fron Spurius Lucretius, they were filled with the most intense anxiety, lest the joy they had experienced on the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, two years before, should <pb id="p.1230" n="1230"/>be rendered vain by another war's springing up in the same quarter, equal in magnitude, but under a new leader.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They therefore ordered Marcus Livius, proconsul, to march his army of volunteer slaves out of Etruria to Ariminum, and gave in charge to Cneius Servilius to issue orders, if he thought it necessary for the safety of the state, that the city legions should be marched out under the command of any person he thought proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> About the same time, as many as eighty transports of the Carthaginians were captured, near Sardinia, by Cneius Octavius, who had the government of that province.

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>



























<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SCIPIO, after his arrival in Sicily, formed his volunteers into cohorts and centuries.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of these he kept about his person three hundred young men, in the bloom of their age and the prime of their strength, unarmed, and not knowing for what purpose they were reserved, as they were not included in the centuries, nor furnished with arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then selected out of the number of the youth of all Sicily three hundred horsemen, of the highest birth and fortune, who were to cross over with him into Africa, appointing a day on which they were to present themselves equipped and furnished with horses and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This severe service, far from their native land, appeared to them likely to be attended with many hardships, and great dangers, both by sea and land; nor did that anxiety affect themselves alone, but also their parents and relations.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the appointed day arrived, they exhibited their arms and horses. Then Scipio observed, <quote>that an intimation had been conveyed to him that certain of the Sicilian horsemen felt a strong aversion to that service, as being severe and arduous.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If there were any who entertained such a feeling, that he would rather they should then confess it to him, than, complaining afterwards, prove themselves slothful and <pb id="p.1232" n="1232"/>useless soldiers to the state. He desired that they would openly avow their sentiments, for that he would hear them with kindly feeling.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When one of the number took courage to declare, that if he were allowed the uncontrolled exercise of his will he certainly would not serve, Scipio replied to him thus:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <quote>Since then, young man, you have not dissembled your sentiments, I will furnish a substitute for you, to whom I request that you transfer your arms, your horse, and other appliances of war; and, taking him hence immediately to your house, train him, and take care that he is instructed in the management of his horse and arms.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The youth accepted the terms joyfully, when Scipio delivered to him one of the three hundred whom he kept unarmed. The rest, seeing the horseman thus discharged without giving any offence to the general, began severally to excuse themselves and receive substitutes. Thus Roman horsemen were substituted for the three hundred Sicilian, without any expense to the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Sicilians had the care of instructing and training them, because the general had ordered that the man who should not do so, should serve himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It is said that this turned out to be an admirable body of cavalry, and rendered effectual service to the state in many engagements.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Afterwards, inspecting the legions, he chose out of them such soldiers as had served the greatest number of campaigns, particularly those who had acted under Marcellus; for he considered that they were formed under the best discipline, and also, from the long time in which they were engaged in the siege of Syracuse, were most skilled in the assault of towns: for his thoughts were now occupied with no small object, but the destruction of Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He then distributed his army through the towns; ordered the Sicilian states to furnish corn, sparing that which had been brought from Italy; repaired his old ships, and sent Caius Laelius with them into Africa to plunder.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> His new ships he hauled on shore at Panormus, that they might be kept on land during the winter, as they had been hastily built of unseasoned timber.</p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>When every thing was got in readiness for the war he came to Syracuse, which had hardly yet returned to a state of tranquillity, after the violent commotions of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Greeks, demanding restitution of their property, which had been granted to them by the senate, from certain persons of <pb id="p.1233" n="1233"/>the Italian nation, who retained possession of it in the same forcible manner in which they had seized it in the war, Scipio, who deemed it

<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> of the first importance to preserve the public faith, restored their property to the Syracusans, partly by proclamation, and partly even by judgments pronounced against those who pertinaciously retained their unjust acquisitions.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> This measure was acceptable not only to the persons immediately concerned, but to all the states of Sicily, and so much the more energetically did they give aid in the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> During the same summer a very formidable war sprang up in Spain, at the instance of Indibilis the Ilergetian, from no other cause than the contempt he conceived for the other generals, in consequence of his admiration of Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> He considered <quote>that he was the only commander the Romans had left, the rest having been slain by Hannibal. That they had, therefore, no other general whom they could send into Spain after the Scipios were cut off there, and that afterwards, when the war in Italy pressed upon them with increased severity, he was recalled to oppose Hannibal. That, in addition to the fact that the Romans had the names only of generals in Spain, their old army had also been withdrawn thence.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> That all the troops they had there were irresolute, as consisting of an undisciplined multitude of recruits.

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> That there would never again occur such an opportunity for the liberation of Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> That up to that time they had been the slaves either of Carthaginians or Romans, and that not to one or the other in turns, but sometimes to both together.

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> That the Carthaginians had been driven out by the Romans, and that the Romans might be driven out by the Spaniards, if they would unite: so that Spain, for ever freed from a foreign yoke, might return to her native customs and rites.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> By these and other observations he stirred up not only his countrymen, but the Ausetanians also, a neighbouring nation, as well as other states bordering on his own and their country.

<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Accordingly, within a few days, thirty thousand foot and about four thousand horse assembled in the Sedetanian territory, according to the orders which had been given.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the other side, the Roman generals also, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, lest

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> by neglecting the first beginnings of the war it should increase in violence, having united their armies, and led their troops through the <pb id="p.1234" n="1234"/>Ausetanian territory in a peaceable manner, as though it had been the territory of friends instead of enemies, came to the position of the enemy, and pitched their camp at a distance of three miles from theirs.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first an unsuccessful attempt was made, through ambassadors, to induce them to lay down their arms; then the Spanish cavalry making a sudden attack on the Roman foragers, a body of cavalry was sent to support them from the Roman outposts, when a battle between the cavalry took place with no memorable issue to either side.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The next day, at sun-rise, the whole force displayed their line, armed and drawn out for battle, at the distance of about a mile from the Roman camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Ausetanians were in the centre, the right wing was occupied by the Ilergetians, the left by some inconsiderable states of Spain. Between the wings and the centre they had left intervals of considerable extent, through which they might send out their cavalry when occasion required.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans also, drawing up their army in their usual manner, imitated the enemy in respect only of leaving themselves also intervals between the legions to afford passages for their cavalry.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Lentulus, however, concluding that the cavalry could be employed with advantage by those only who should be the first to send them against the enemy's line, thus broken by intervals, ordered Servius Cornelius, a military tribune, to direct the cavalry to ride at full speed into the spaces left in the enemy's line.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lentulus himself, as the battle between the infantry was somewhat unfavourable in its commencement, waited

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> only until he had brought up from the reserve into the front line the thirteenth legion to support the twelfth legion, which had been posted in the left wing, against the Ilergetians, and which was giving ground.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And when the battle was thus placed on an equal footing in that quarter, he came to Lucius Manlius, who was exhorting the troops in the foremost line, and bringing up the reserves in such places as circumstances required, and told him that all was safe in the left wing, and that Cornelius Servius, who had

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> been sent by him for that purpose, would soon pour round the enemy a storm of cavalry.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had scarcely uttered these words, when the Roman horse, riding into the midst of the enemy, at once threw their line of infantry into disorder, and closed up the passage by which the Spanish cavalry were to advance.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Spaniards, therefore, giving up all thoughts of fighting on <pb id="p.1235" n="1235"/>horseback, dismounted and fought on foot. When the Roman generals saw that the ranks of the enemy were in confusion, that they were in a state of trepidation and dismay, their standards moving to and fro, they exhorted and implored their men to charge them while thus discomfited, and not allow them to form their line again.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> So desperate was their charge that the barbarians could not have withstood the shock, had not the prince Indibilis in person, together with the dismounted cavalry, opposed himself to the enemy before the front rank of the infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There an obstinate contest continued for a considerable time; but those who fought round the king, who continued his resistance though almost expiring, and who was afterwards pinned to the earth by a javelin, having at length fallen, overwhelmed with darts, a general flight took place;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> and the number slain was the greater because the horsemen were prevented from remounting, and because the Romans pressed impetuously upon the discomfited troops; nor did they give over until they had deprived the enemy of their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> On that day thirteen thousand Spaniards were slain, and about eight hundred captured. Of the Romans and allies there fell a little more than two hundred, and those principally in the left wing.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Such of the Spaniards as were beaten out of their camp, or had escaped from the battle, at first dispersed themselves through the country, but afterwards returned each to his own state.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They were then summoned to an assembly by Mandonius, at which, after complaining bitterly of the losses they had sustained, and upbraiding the instigators of the war, they resolved that ambassadors should be sent with proposals to deliver up their arms and make a surrender.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These, laying the blame on Indibilis, the instigator of the war, and the other chiefs, most of whom had fallen in the battle, and offering to deliver up their arms and surrender themselves, received for answer, that their surrender would be accepted on condition that they delivered up alive Mandonius and the rest of the persons who had fomented the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but if they refused to comply, that armies should be marched into the territories of the Ilergetians and Ausetanians, and afterwards into those of the other states in succession.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This answer given to the ambassadors, was reported to the assembly, and Mandonius and the other chiefs were there seized and delivered up for punish- <pb id="p.1236" n="1236"/>ment.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Peace was restored to the states of Spain, which were ordered to pay double taxes that year, and furnish corn for six months, together with cloaks and gowns for the army; and hostages were taken from about thirty of the states.</p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The tumult occasioned by the rebellion in Spain having been thus excited and suppressed within the space of a few days, without any great disturbance, the whole terror of the war was directed against Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Caius Laelius having arrived at Hippo Regius by night, at break of day led his soldiers and mariners in regular array to lay waste the country.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As all the inhabitants were living unguardedly, as in a time of peace, great damage was done; and messengers, flying in terror, filled Carthage with alarm, by reporting that the Roman fleet and the general, Scipio, had arrived; for there was a rumour that Scipio had already crossed over into Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Not knowing accurately how many ships they had seen, or how large a body of troops was devastating the country, they, under the influence of fear, which represented them as greater than they really were, exaggerated every thing.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly, at first, terror and dismay took possession of their minds, but afterwards grief, when they reflected that their circumstances had undergone so great a change; that they, who lately as conquerors had an army before the walls of Rome, and, after having laid prostrate so many armies of the enemy, had received the surrender of all the states of Italy, either by force or choice, now, the war having

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> taken an unfavourable turn, were destined to behold the devastation of Africa and the siege of Carthage, without any thing like the resources to enable them to bear up against those calamities which the Romans possessed.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To the latter the Roman commons and Latium afforded a supply of young men, which continually grew up more vigorous and more numerous, in the room of so many armies destroyed, while their own people, both those in the city and those in the country, were unfit for military service;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> their troops consisted of auxiliaries, procured by hire from the Africans, a faithless nation, and veering about with every gale of fortune.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Now too, with regard to the kings, Syphax was alienated from them since his conference with Scipio, and Masinissa, by an open defection, had become their most determined enemy. Wherever they turned their eyes there was no hope, no aid.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Neither did Mago ex- <pb id="p.1237" n="1237"/>cite any commotion on the side of Gaul, nor join his forces with those of Hannibal; while Hannibal himself was now declining both in reputation and strength.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Their minds, which had fallen into these melancholy reflections in consequence of the intelligence they had just received, were brought back by their immediate fears to deliberate how to oppose the instant danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They resolved, that troops should be hastily levied both in the city and in the country; that persons should be sent to hire auxiliaries from the Africans; that the city should be fortified, corn collected, weapons and arms prepared, and ships equipped and sent to Hippo against the Roman fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But now, while engaged in these matters, news at length arrived that it was Laelius, and not Scipio; that the forces which he had brought over were only what were sufficient for making predatory incursions into the country, and that the principal stress of the war still lay in Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thus they were enabled to take breath, and they began to send embassies to Syphax and the other petty princes, for the purpose of strengthening their alliances. To Philip also ambassadors were sent, to promise him two hundred talents of silver, if he would cross over into Sicily or Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Ambassadors were also sent into Italy to the two generals, to desire them to keep Scipio at home by terrifying the enemy in every way they could.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To Mago, not only ambassadors were sent, but twenty-five men of war, six thousand infantry, eight hundred horse, and seven elephants, besides a large sum of money to be employed in hiring auxiliaries, in order that, encouraged by these aids, he might advance his army nearer to the city of Rome, and form a junction with Hannibal. Such were the preparations and plans at Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While Laelius was employed in carrying off an immense quantity of booty from the country, the inhabitants of which had no arms, and which was destitute of forces, Masinissa, moved by the report of the arrival of the Roman fleet, came to him attended by a small body of horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He complained that <quote>Scipio had not acted with promptness in this business, in that he had not already passed his army over into Africa, while the Carthaginians were in consternation, and while Syphax was entangled in wars with the neighbouring states, and in doubt and uncertainty as to the course he should take; that if time was allowed to Syphax to adjust his own <pb id="p.1238" n="1238"/>affairs according to his mind, he would not in any thing keep his faith with the Romans inviolate.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He requested that he would exhort and stimulate Scipio not to delay. Though driven from his kingdom, he said he would join him with no despicable force of foot and horse. Nor was it right, said he, that Laelius should continue in Africa, for he believed that a fleet had set sail from Carthage, with which, in the absence of Scipio, it would not be altogether safe to engage.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this discourse Masinissa departed. Laelius, the next day, sailed from Hippo with his ships loaded with booty, and returning to Sicily, delivered to Scipio the injunctions of Masinissa.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About the same time the ships which were sent from Carthage to Mago touched at the country between the Albingaunian Ligurians and Genoa. Mago happened to be lying here with his fleet at this time.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After hearing the message of the ambassadors, directing him to collect as great a number of troops as possible, he immediately held a council of the Gauls and Ligurians, for a great number of both those nations were there.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He said that he was sent to restore them to liberty, and, as they themselves might see, succours were sent him from home; but that it depended upon them with how great forces and how large an army the war for that purpose was to be carried on.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That the Romans had two armies in the field, one in Gaul and another in Etruria. That he was well informed that Spurius Lucretius would form a junction with Marcus Livius, and that they on their part must arm many thousands, in order to cope with two Roman generals and two armies.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Gauls replied, that they had the strongest possible inclination to this, but as the Romans had one army within their borders, and another in the neighbouring country of Etruria, almost within sight, if it should be known that they had supported the Carthaginians with auxiliaries, those would immediately invade their territories on both sides with determined hostility. They requested that he would ask of the Gauls such aids as they could afford in a covert manner.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The purposes of the Ligurians, they said, were unrestrained, because the Roman troops were at a distance from their lands and cities; that it was fair that they should arm their youth and take upon themselves a portion of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Ligurians did not dissent; they only requested the space of two months to make their levies. Having <pb id="p.1239" n="1239"/>dismissed the Gauls, Mago in the mean time secretly hired soldiers through their country. Provisions also of every description were sent to him privately by the Gallic states.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Livius led his army of volunteer slaves out of Etruria into Gaul, and having joined Lucretius, prepared to meet Mago in case he should move from Liguria nearer to the city; but intending, if the Carthaginian should keep himself quiet under the angle formed by the Alps, to remain himself also in the same quarter, near Ariminum. for the protection of Italy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the return of Caius Laelius from Africa, though Scipio was goaded on by the exhortations of Masinissa; and the soldiers, on seeing the booty which was taken from the enemy's country landed from the whole fleet, were inflamed with the strongest desire to cross over as soon as possible; this important object was interrupted by one of minor consideration, namely, that of regaining the town of Locri, which at the time of the general defection of Italy had itself also gone over to the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The hope of accomplishing this object beamed forth from a very trifling circumstance. The war was carried on in Bruttium rather in a predatory than a regular manner, the Numidians having set the example, and the Bruttians falling in with that practice, not more in consequence of their connexion with the Carthaginians, than from their natural inclination.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At last the Romans also, who now took delight in plunder by a sort of infection, made excursions into the lands of their enemies so far as their leaders would permit it.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some Locrians who had gone out of the town were surrounded by them and carried off to Rhegium. Among the number of the prisoners were certain artisans, who, as it happened, had been accustomed to work for the Carthaginians in the city of Locri for hire.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were recognised by some of the Locrian nobles, who having been driven out by the opposite faction, which had delivered up Locri to Hannibal, had retired to Rhegium; and having answered their other questions relative to what was going on at home, questions which are usually put by such as have been long absent, they gave them hopes that, if ransomed and sent back, they might be able to deliver up the citadel to them;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for there they resided, and among the Carthaginians they enjoyed unlimited confidence.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly, as these nobles <pb id="p.1240" n="1240"/>were at once tormented with a longing for their country, and inflamed with a desire to be revenged on their enemies, they immediately ransomed the prisoners and sent them back, after having settled the plan of operation, and agreed upon the signals which were to be given at a distance and observed by them.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They then went themselves to Scipio to Syracuse, with whom some of the exiles were;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and having, by relating to him the promises made by the prisoners, inspired the consul with hopes which seemed likely to be realized, Marcus Sergius and Publius Matienus, military tribunes, were sent with them, and ordered to lead three thousand soldiers from Rhegium to Locri. A letter was also written to Quintus Pleminius, the proprietor, with directions that he should assist in the business.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The troops, setting out from Rhegium and carrying with them ladders to suit the alleged height of the citadel, about midnight gave a signal to those who were to betray it from the place agreed upon.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The latter were ready and on the watch, and having themselves also lowered down ladders made for the purpose, and received the Romans as they climbed up in several places at once, an attack was made upon the Carthaginian sentinels, who were fast asleep, as they were not afraid of any thing of the kind before any noise was made.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Their dying groans were the first sound that was heard; then, awaking from their sleep, a sudden consternation and confusion followed, the cause of the alarm being unknown.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At length, one rousing another, the fact became more certain, and now every one shouted <quote>To arms</quote> with all his might; <quote>that the enemy were in the citadel and the sentinels slain;</quote> and the Romans, who were far inferior in numbers, would have been overpowered, had not a shout raised by those who were outside of the citadel rendered it uncertain whence the noise proceeded, while the terror of an alarm by night magnified all fears, however groundless.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Carthaginians, therefore, terrified and supposing that the citadel was already filled with the enemy, gave up all thoughts of opposition and fled to the other citadel; for there were two at no great distance from each other.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The townsmen held the city, which lay between the two fortresses, as the prize of the victors.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Slight engagements took place daily from the two citadels. Quintus Pleminius commanded the Roman, Hamilcar the Carthaginian garrison. They augmented their <pb id="p.1241" n="1241"/>forces by calling in aids from the neighbouring places.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> At last Hannibal himself came; nor would the Romans have held out, had not the general body of the Locrians, exasperated by the pride and rapacity of the Carthaginians, leaned towards the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Scipio received intelligence that the posture of affairs at Locri had become more critical, and that Hannibal himself was approaching, lest even the garrison might be exposed to danger;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for it was not an easy matter for it to retire thence; as soon as the direction of the tide in the strait had changed, he let the ships drive with the tide from Messana, having left his brother, Lucius Scipio, in command there.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hannibal also sent a messenger in advance from the river Butrotus, which is not far from the town of Locri, to desire his party to attack the Romans and Locrians at break of day in the most vigorous manner, while he on the opposite side assaulted the town, which would be unprepared for such a measure, as every one would have his attention occupied with the tumult created in the other quarter.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when, as soon as it was light, he found that the battle had commenced, he was unwilling to shut himself up in the citadel, where, by his numbers, he would crowd that confined place; nor had he brought with him scaling-ladders to enable him to mount the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having, however, had the baggage thrown together in a heap, and displayed his line at a distance from the walls to intimidate the enemy, while the scaling-ladders and other requisites for an assault were preparing, he rode round the city with some Numidian horsemen, in order to observe in what quarter the attack might be best made.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having advanced towards the rampart, the person who happened to stand next him was struck by a weapon from a scorpion; and, terrified at an accident in which he had been exposed to so much danger, he retired, gave directions for sounding a retreat, and fortified a camp out of the reach of weapons.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Roman fleet from Messana came to Locri several hours before night. The troops were all landed and had entered the city before sun-set.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The following day the fight began from the citadel on the part of the Carthaginians, and Hannibal, having now prepared ladders and all the other requisites for an assault, was coming up to the walls; when, throwing open the gate, the Romans suddenly sallied out <pb id="p.1242" n="1242"/>upon him, Hannibal fearing nothing less than such a step.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They slew as many as two hundred in the attack, having taken them by surprise. The rest Hannibal withdrew into the camp when he found the consul was there; and having despatched a messenger to those who were in the citadel, to desire them to take measures for their own safety, he decamped by night.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Those who were in the citadel also, after throwing fire upon the buildings they occupied, in order that the alarm thus occasioned might detain their enemy, went away with a speed which resembled flight, and overtook the body of their army before night.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, seeing that the citadel was abandoned by the enemy, and their camp deserted, called the Locrians to an assembly and rebuked them severely for their defection.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He inflicted punishment on the persons principally concerned, and gave their effects to the leaders of the other party, in consideration of their extraordinary fidelity to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As to the Locrians in general, he said that he would neither grant them any thing, nor take any thing from them. They might send ambassadors to Rome, and they should experience that treatment which the senate thought proper to adopt.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of one thing, however, he said he was confident, which was, that although they had deserved ill at the hands of the Romans, they would be better off when subject to them, though incensed against them, than they had been when in the power of their friends the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Leaving Quintus Pleminius lieutenant-general, and the garrison which had taken the citadel to defend the city, the general himself crossed over to Messana with the forces he had brought with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Locrians had been treated with such insolence and cruelty by the Carthaginians since their revolt from the Romans, that they were able to endure severities of an ordinary kind not only with patience but almost willingness.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But indeed, so greatly did Pleminius surpass Hamilcar, who had commanded the garrison, so greatly did the Roman soldiers in the garrison surpass the Carthaginians in villany and rapacity, that it would appear that they endeavoured to outdo each other, not in arms, but in vices.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> None of all those things which render the power of a superior hateful to the powerless was omitted towards the inhabitants, either by the general or his soldiers. The most shocking insults were committed <pb id="p.1243" n="1243"/>against their own persons, their children, and their wives.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For their rapacity did not abstain from the spoliation even of sacred things; and not only were other temples violated, but even the treasures of Proserpine, which had never been touched through all ages, excepting that they were said to have been carried away by Pyrrhus, who restored the spoils, together with a costly offering in expiation of his sacrilege.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Therefore, as on the former occasion, the royal ships, wrecked and shattered, brought nothing safe to land, except the sacred money of the goddess, which they were carrying away;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> so now also, that same money, by a different kind of calamity, cast a spirit of madness upon all who were contaminated by this violation of the temple, and turned them against each other with the fury of enemies, general against general, and soldier against soldier.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Pleminius had the chief command; that part of the soldiers which he had brought with him from Rhegium were under his own command, the rest were under the command of the tribunes.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One of Pleminius's men, while running away with a silver cup which he had stolen from the house of a townsman, the owners pursuing him, happened to meet Sergius and Matienus, the military tribunes.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The cup having been taken away from him at the order of the tribunes, abuse and clamour ensued, and at last a fight arose between the soldiers of Pleminius and those of the tribunes; the numbers engaged and the tumult increasing at the same time, as either party was joined by their friends who happened to come up at the time.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the soldiers of Pleminius, who had been worsted, had run to him in crowds, not without loud clamouring and indignant feelings, showing their blood and wounds, and repeating the reproaches which had been heaped upon him during the dispute, Pleminius, fired with resentment, flung himself out of his house, ordered the tribunes to be summoned and stripped, and the rods to be brought out.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the time which was consumed in stripping them, for they made resistance, and implored their men to aid them, on a sudden the soldiers, flushed with their recent victory, ran together from every quarter, as if there had been a shout to arms against enemies;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and when they saw the bodies of their tribunes now mangled with rods, then indeed, suddenly inflamed with much more ungovernable rage, without respect, <pb id="p.1244" n="1244"/>not only for the dignity of their commander, but of humanity, they made an attack upon the lieutenant-general, having first mutilated the lictors in a shocking manner;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> they then cruelly lacerated the lieutenant-general himself, having cut him off from his party and hemmed him in, and after mutilating his nose and ears left him almost lifeless.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accounts of these occurrences arriving at Messana, Scipio, a few days after, passing over to Locri in a ship with six banks of oars, took cognizance of the cause of Pleminius and the tribunes. Having acquitted Pleminius and left him in command of the same place, and pronounced the tribunes guilty and thrown them into chains, that they might be sent to Rome to the senate, he returned to Messana, and thence to Syracuse.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pleminius, unable to restrain his resentment, for he thought that the injury he had sustained had been treated negligently and too lightly by Scipio, and that no one could form an estimate of the punishment which ought to be inflicted in such a case, except the man who

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> had in his own person felt its atrocity, ordered the tribunes to be dragged before him, and after lacerating them with every punishment which the human body could endure, put them to death; and not satisfied with the punishment inflicted on them while alive, cast them out unburied.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The like cruelty he exercised towards the Locrian nobles, whom he heard had gone to Scipio to complain of the injuries he had done them.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The horrid acts, prompted by lust and rapacity, which he had before perpetrated upon his allies, he now multiplied from resentment; thus bringing infamy and odium, not only upon himself, but upon the general also.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The time of the elections was now drawing near, when a letter from the consul Publius Licinius arrived at Rome, stating that <quote>he himself and his army were afflicted with a severe sickness, nor could they have stood their ground had not the malady attacked the enemy with the same or even greater violence.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore, as he could not come himself to the election, he would, with the approbation of the senate, nominate Quintus Caecilius Metellus dictator, for the purpose of holding the election.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That it was for the interest of the state that the army of Quintus Caecilius should be disbanded; for that it could not be made any use of under present circumstances, for Hannibal had now withdrawn his troops into <pb id="p.1245" n="1245"/>winter quarters; and so violent was the malady which had infected that camp, that unless it was speedily broken up, there would not survive one man out of the whole army.</quote> The senate left it to the consul to settle these matters, as he should deem consistent with the interest of the state and his own honour.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The state was at this time suddenly occupied with a question of a religious nature, in consequence of the discovery of a prediction in the Sibylline books, which had been inspected on account of there having been so many showers of stones this year.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It ran thus: <quote>Whensoever a foreign enemy should bring war into the land of Italy, he may be driven out of Italy and conquered, if the Idaean Mother should be brought from Pessinus to Rome.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This prophecy, discovered by the decemviri, produced the greater impression upon the senate, because ambassadors also, who had carried a present to Delphi, had brought word back, that they had both obtained a favourable appearance in sacrificing to the Pythian Apollo, and that a response was delivered from the oracle, to the effect, that a much greater victory than that from the spoils of which they now brought presents, awaited the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They considered the presentiment which existed in the mind of Publius Scipio, with regard to the termination of the war, when he claimed Africa as his province, as corroborating the same anticipation.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In order, therefore, that they might the more speedily put themselves in possession of victory, which was portended to them by the fates, omens, and oracles, they began to think what method could be adopted for conveying the goddess to Rome.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As yet the Roman people had none of the states of Asia in alliance with them. Recollecting, however, that formerly Aesculapius, on account of a sickness among the people, was fetched from Greece, which was not then united with them by any treaty;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> recollecting, also, that a friendship had already commenced between them and king Attalus, on

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> account of the war which they waged in common against Philip, and that he would do whatever he could to oblige the Roman people, they resolved to send, as ambassadors to him, Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had been twice consul, and had carried on operations in Greece; Marcus Caecilius Metellus, who had been praetor; Servius Sulpicius Galba, who had been aedile; and two who had been quaestors, Caius Tremellius <pb id="p.1246" n="1246"/>Flaccus and Marcus Valerius Falto.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To these five quinqueremes were assigned, in order that, in a manner suitable to the dignity of the Roman people, they might visit those lands where it was important to gain respect for the Roman name.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The ambassadors, on their way to Asia, having landed at Delphi, immediately approached the oracle, inquiring what hopes the deity held out to themselves and the Roman people, of accomplishing the business for which they had been sent from home.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is said that the answer given was, <quote>that they would obtain what they were seeking by means of king Attalus. When they had conveyed the goddess to Rome, they must take care that the best man at Rome should receive her to his hospitality.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They came to Pergamus to the king, who received the ambassadors graciously, and conducted them to Pessinus in Phrygia, and putting into their hands a sacred

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> stone, which the inhabitants said was the mother of the gods, bid them convey it to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Valerius Falto, who was sent in advance, brought word that the goddess was on her way, and that the most virtuous man in the state must be sought out, who might in due form receive and entertain her. Quintus Caecilius Metellus was nominated dictator for holding the elections, by the consul in Bruttium, and his army was disbanded.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Lucius Veturius Philo was made master of the horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The elections were held by the dictator; the consuls elected were Marcus Cornelius Cethegus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, who was absent, being engaged in his province of Greece. The praetors were then elected: Titus Claudius Nero, Marcus Marcius Ralla, Lucius Scribonius Libo, Marcus Pomponius Matho.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the conclusion of the elections, the dictator abdicated his office. The Roman games were repeated thrice, the plebeian seven times.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The curule aediles were Cneius and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus: Lucius had the province of Spain; he was elected in his absence, and was absent while he filled the office. The plebeian aediles were Titus Claudius Asellus and Marcus Junius Pennus. Marcus Marcellus this year dedicated the temple of Virtue at the Porta Capena, in the seventeenth year after it had been vowed by his father during his first consulate at Clastidium in Gaul:

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> also Marcus Aemilius Regillus, flamen of Mars, died this year.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For the last two years the affairs of Greece had been <pb id="p.1247" n="1247"/>neglected. Accordingly, as the Aetolians were deserted by the Romans, on whom alone they depended for assistance, Philip compelled them to sue for and agree to a peace on whatever conditions he pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Had he not exerted himself to the utmost in expediting this measure, he would have been overpowered, while engaged in war with the Aetolians, by Publius Sempronius, the proconsul, who had been sent to succeed Sulpicius in the command, with ten thousand infantry and a thousand horse, together with thirty-five ships of war, a force of no small importance to bring to the assistance of allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Ere the peace was well concluded, news was brought to the king that the Romans had arrived at Dyrrachium; that the Parthinians, and other bordering nations, were up in arms on seeing hopes of effecting a change; and that Dimallum was besieged.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans had turned their efforts to that quarter instead of assisting the Aetolians, for which purpose they had been sent, from resentment at the conduct of the Aetolians for making peace with the king without their sanction, contrary to the league.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Philip had received intelligence of these events, lest any greater commotion should arise in the neighbouring nations and states, he proceeded by forced marches to Apollonia, to which place Sempronius had retired, having sent Laetorius, his lieutenant-general, with a part of his forces and fifteen ships into Aetolia, to look into the state of affairs, and, if he could, dissolve the peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip laid waste the lands of the Apollonians, and, advancing his troops to the tower, offered the Romans battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But seeing that they remained quiet, only defending the walls, and not having sufficient confidence in his strength to assault the town, being desirous also of making peace with the Romans if possible, as he had with the Aetolians, or at least a truce, he withdrew into his own dominions, without further exciting their animosity by a fresh contest.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> During the same time the Epirots, wearied by the long continuance of the war, having first sounded the disposition of the Romans, sent ambassadors to Philip on the subject of a common peace;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> affirming that they were well satisfied that it might be arranged if he would come to a conference with Publius Sempronius, the Roman general.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They easily prevailed on him to pass into Epirus, for neither were the king's own inclinations averse from this measure.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Ph&oelig;nice is a <pb id="p.1248" n="1248"/>city of Epirus; here Philip first conferred with Aeropus Dardas and Philip, praetors of the Epirots, and afterwards met Publius Sempronius. Amynander, king of the Athamanians, and other magistrates of the Epirots and Acarnanians, were present at the conference.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The praetor Philip spoke first, and requested at once of the king and the Roman general, that they would put an end to the war, and grant this boon to the Epirots.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Publius Sempronius proposed as the conditions of the peace, that the Parthinians, and Dimallum, and Bargulum, and Eugenium, should be under the dominion of the Romans; that Atintania, if on sending ambassadors to Rome they could prevail upon the senate to acquiesce, should be added to the dominions of the Macedonian.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The peace having been agreed upon on these terms, Prusias king of Bithynia, the Achaeans, the B&oelig;otians, the Thessalians, the Acarnanians, and the Epirots, were included in the treaty by the king; by the Romans, the Ilians, king Attalus, Pleuratus, Nabis tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans, the Messenians, and Athenians.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> These conditions were committed to writing and sealed; and a truce was agreed upon for two months, to allow time for ambassadors being sent to Rome, that the people might order the peace upon these terms.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All the tribes agreed in ordering it, because now that the operations of the war were removed into Africa, they were desirous to be relieved for the present from all other wars. The peace being concluded, Publius Sempronius took his departure for Rome, to attend to the duties of his consulship.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To Publius Sempronius and Marcus Cornelius, the consuls in the fifteenth year of the Punic war, the provinces assigned were, to Cornelius, Etruria, with the old army; to Sempronius, Bruttium, with directions to levy fresh legions.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of the praetors, to Marcus Marcius fell the city jurisdiction; to Lucius Scribonius Libo, the foreign, together with Gaul; to Marcus Pomponius Matho, Sicily; to Titus Claudius Nero, Sardinia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Publius Scipio was continued in command with the army and fleet which he had under him, as was also Publius Licinius, with directions to occupy Bruttium with two legions, so long as the consul should deem it for the advantage of the state that he should continue in the province ithw command.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcus Livius and Spurius Lucretius were <pb id="p.1249" n="1249"/>also continued in command, with the two legions with which they had protected Gaul against Mago;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> also Cneius Octavius, with orders that, after he had delivered up Sardinia and the legion to Titus Claudius, he should, with forty ships of war, protect the sea-coast within such limits as the senate should appoint.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To Marcus Pomponius, the praetor in Sicily, the troops which had fought at Cannae, consisting of two legions, were assigned. It was decreed, that Titus Quinctius and Caius Tubulus, proprietors, should occupy, the former Tarentum, the latter Capua, as in the former year, each having his old army.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With respect to the command in Spain, it was submitted to the people to decide on the two proconsuls to be sent into that province. All the tribes agreed in ordering that the same persons, namely, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, should, as proconsuls, hold the command of those provinces as they had the former year.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls set about making the levies, both to raise new legions for Bruttium, and recruit the other armies; for so were they directed by the senate.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although Africa had not as yet been openly declared a province, the senate keeping it a secret, I suppose, lest the Carthaginians should get intelligence of it beforehand, nevertheless, the most sanguine hopes were entertained in the city, that the enemy would be vanquished that year in Africa, and that the termination of the Punic war was at hand.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This circumstance had filled the minds of the people with superstitious notions, and they were strongly disposed to credit and propagate accounts of prodigies, and for that reason more were reported.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was said, <quote>that two suns had been seen; that it had become light for a time during the night; that at Setia a meteor had been seen, extending from the east to the west; that at Tarracina a gate, at Anagnia a gate and the wall in many places, had been struck by lightning; that in the temple of Juno Sospita, at Lanuvium, a noise had been heard, accompanied with a tremendous crash.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was a supplication for one day for the purpose of expiating these, and the nine days' sacred rite was celebrated on account of a shower of stones.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In addition to these cares, they had to deliberate about the reception of the Idaean Mother; for besides that Marcus Valerius, one of the ambassadors who had come before the rest, had brought word that she would be in Italy <pb id="p.1250" n="1250"/>forthwith, a recent account had arrived that she was at Tarracina.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate was occupied with the determination of a matter of no small importance, namely, who was the most virtuous man in the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Every one doubtless would wish for himself the victory in this contest, rather than any office of command, or any honours, which could be conferred by the suffrages either of the senate or the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Publius Scipio, son of Cneius who had fallen in Spain, a youth not yet of the age to be quaestor, they adjudged to be the best of the good men in the whole state.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Though I would willingly record it for the information of posterity, had the writers who lived in the times nearest to those events mentioned by what virtues of his they were induced to come to this determination, yet I will not obtrude my own opinion, formed upon conjecture, relative to a matter buried in the obscurity of antiquity.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Publius Cornelius was ordered to go to Ostia, attended by all the matrons, to meet the goddess; to receive her from the ship himself, and, when landed, place her in the hands of the matrons to convey her away.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After the ship arrived at the mouth of the Tiber, Scipio, according to the directions given him, sailed out into the open sea, and, receiving the goddess from the priests, conveyed her to land.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The chief matrons in the state received her, among whom the name of Claudia Quinta alone is worthy of remark. Her fame, which, as it is recorded, was before that time dubious, became, in consequence of her having assisted in so solemn a business, illustrious for chastity among posterity.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The matrons, passing her from one to another in orderly succession, conveyed the goddess into the temple of Victory, in the Palatium, on the day before the ides of April, which was made a festival, while the whole city poured out to meet her; and, placing censers before their doors, on the way by which she was conveyed in procession, kindled frankincense, and prayed that she would enter the city of Rome willingly and propitiously.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The people in crowds carried presents to the goddess in the Palatium; a lectisternium was celebrated, with games called the Megalesian.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the business of recruiting the legions in the provinces was under consideration, it was suggested by certain senators that now was the time, when, by the favour of the gods, their fears were removed, to put a stop to certain <pb id="p.1251" n="1251"/>things, however they might have been tolerated in perilous circumstances.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senators, being intent in expectation, subjoined, that the twelve Latin colonies which had refused to furnish soldiers to the consuls, Quintus Fabius and Quintus Fulvius, were enjoying, for now the sixth year, exemption from military service, as though it had been granted to them as a mark of honour and favour;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> while in the mean time their good and dutiful allies, in return for their fidelity and obedience to the Roman people, had been exhausted by continual levies every year. By these words the recollection of the senate was renewed touching a matter which was now almost obliterated, and their indignation equally excited.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, without allowing the consuls to lay any other business before the senate in priority, they decreed, <quote>that the consuls should summon to Rome the magistrates, and ten principal inhabitants, from each of the colonies, Nepete, Sutrium, Ardea, Cales, Alba, Carseoli, Sora, Suessa, Setia, Circeii, Narnia, and Interamna;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for these were the colonies implicated in this affair; and command them that each of those colonies should furnish double the greatest number of foot soldiers which they had ever provided for the Roman people since the enemy had been in Italy, and one hundred and twenty horsemen each.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If any of them was unable to make up that number of horsemen, that it should be allowed to furnish three foot soldiers for every horseman deficient.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That both the foot and horse soldiers should be chosen from the wealthiest of the inhabitants, and should be sent out of Italy wheresoever there was want of recruits. If any of them refused to comply, it was their pleasure that the magistrates and ambassadors of such should be detained;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and that, if they requested it, they should not be allowed an audience of the senate till they had obeyed these orders.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Moreover, that an annual tax should be imposed upon them, and collected after the rate of one <hi rend="italics">as</hi> for every thousand; and that a census should be taken in those colonies, according to a formula appointed by the Roman censors, which should be the same which was employed in the case of the Roman people;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that a return should be made at Rome by sworn censors of the colonies, before they retired from their office.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The magistrates and principal men of these colonies having been summoned to Rome, when the consuls imposed upon them the <pb id="p.1252" n="1252"/>contribution of men, and the management of the tax, they vied with each other in making excuses, and remonstrating against it. They said <quote>it was impossible that so large a number of men could be raised.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That they could scarcely accomplish it, if even the simple contribution only, according to the established ratio, were required of them.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They entreated and besought them that they might be allowed to appear before the senate and deprecate their resolution. They had committed no crime for which they deserved to be ruined; but, even if they were to be ruined, neither their own crime nor the resentment of the Roman people could make them furnish a greater number of soldiers than they had got.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consuls, persisting, ordered the ambassadors to remain at Rome, and the magistrates to go home to make the levies; observing, that <quote>unless the amount of soldiers enjoined were brought to Rome, no one would give them an audience of the senate.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All hope of appearing before the senate, and deprecating their decision, being then cut off, the levies were completed in the twelve colonies without difficulty, as the number of their youth had increased during their long exemption from service.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Another affair, likewise, which had been passed over in silence for an almost equally long period, was laid before the senate by Marcus Valerius Laevinus; who said, <quote>that equity required that the monies which had been contributed by private individuals, when he and Marcus Claudius were consuls, should now at length be repaid.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor ought any one to feel surprised that a case, where the public faith was pledged, should have engaged his attention in an especial manner; for, besides that the matter appertained, in some degree, peculiarly to the consul of that year in which the money was contributed, he was himself the author of the measure, as the treasury was drained, and the people unable to pay the taxes.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This suggestion was well received by the senate, and, bidding the consuls to propose the question, they decreed, <quote>that this money should be paid by three instalments; that the present consuls should make the first payment immediately, and the third and fifth consuls, from that time, the two remaining.</quote></p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this, all their other cares gave place to one alone, when the sufferings of the Locrians, of which they had been ignorant up to that day, were made known by the arrival of <pb id="p.1253" n="1253"/>their ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor was it the villany of Pleminius so much as the partiality or negligence of Scipio in that affair, which excited the resentment of the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While the consuls were sitting in the comitium, ten ambassadors of the Locrians, covered with filth, and in mourning, and extending branches of olive, the badges of suppliants, according to the Grecian custom, prostrated themselves on the ground before the tribunal, with loud lamentations.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In answer to the inquiry of the consuls, they said, <quote>that they were Locrians, who had suffered such things at the hands of Pleminius the lieutenant-general, and the Roman soldiers, as the Roman people would not wish even the Carthaginians to experience. They requested that they would allow them to appear before the senate, and complain of their sufferings.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>An audience having been granted, the eldest of them thus spoke: "I know, conscript fathers, that the importance you will attach to the complaints we make before you must depend, in a very great degree, upon your accurately knowing the manner in which Locri was betrayed to Hannibal, and placed again under your dominion after the expulsion of his garrison.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Inasmuch as if the guilt of defection does not rest upon the public, and it is made apparent that our restoration to your dominion was effected, not only in concurrence with our wishes, but by our own co-operation and valour, you will be the more indignant that such atrocious and shameful injuries should have been inflicted upon good and faithful allies by your lieutenant-general and soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But I think it proper that the subject of our changing sides, in both instances, should be deferred to another time, on two accounts:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> first, that it may be discussed in the presence of Publius Scipio, who retook Locri, and who witnessed all our acts, both good and bad; and secondly, because, whatever we are, we ought not to have suffered what we have.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> We cannot conceal, conscript fathers, that when we had a Carthaginian garrison in our citadel we were exposed to many sufferings, of a shocking and shameful kind, from Hamilcar, the captain of the garrison, and the Numidians and Africans. But what are they compared with what we endure this day? I request, conscript fathers, that you will hear without offence what I am reluctant to mention.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All mankind are now in a state of anxious suspense, whether they are to see you or the Carthaginians lords <pb id="p.1254" n="1254"/>of the world. If an estimate is to be formed of the Roman and Carthaginian governments from what we Locrians have suffered from the Carthaginians on the one hand, or on the other, from what we are suffering, at the present time especially, from your garrison;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> there is no one who would not wish the Carthaginians to be his masters rather than the Romans. And yet observe what are the feelings which the Locrians have entertained towards you.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When we were suffering injuries of much less magnitude from the Carthaginians, we fled for protection to your general; now we are suffering more than hostile indignities from your garrison, we have carried our complaints to no others than yourselves. Conscript fathers! either you will consider our forlorn condition, or there is no other resource left us for which we can even pray to the immortal gods.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Quintus Pleminius, the lieutenant-general, was sent with a body of troops to recover Locri from the Carthaginians, and was left there in command of the same as a garrison.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In this your lieutenant-general there is neither any thing of a man, conscript fathers, but the figure and

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> outward appearance, (for the extremity of our misery prompts me to speak freely,) nor of a Roman citizen, but the attire and dress, and the sound of the Latin language. He is a pest and savage monster, such as are fabled to have beset the strait by which we are separated from Sicily, for the destruction of mariners.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And yet if he had been content to be the only person to vent his villany, his

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> lust, and rapacity upon your allies, that one gulf, deep as it was, we would however have filled up by our patience.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But the case is, he has made every one of your centurions and soldiers a Pleminius, so indiscriminately has he willed that licentiousness and wickedness should be practised.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All plunder, spoil, beat, wound, and slay; all defile matrons, virgins, and free-born youths torn from the embraces of their parents. Our city is captured daily, plundered daily.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Day and night, every place indiscriminately rings with the lamentations of women and children, seized and carried away. Any one, acquainted with our sufferings, might be astonished how it is that we are capable of bearing them, or that the authors of them are not yet satiated with inflicting such enormous cruelties.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Neither am I able to go through with them, nor is it worth your while to listen to the particulars of our sufferings. I will embrace <pb id="p.1255" n="1255"/>them all in a general description.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> I declare that there is not a house or a man at Locri exempt from injury. I say that there cannot be found any species of villany, lust, or rapacity which has not been exercised on every one capable of being the object of them.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It would be difficult to determine in which case the city was visited with the more horrible calamity, whether when it was captured by an enemy, or when a sanguinary tyrant crushed it by violence and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Every evil, conscript fathers, which captured cities suffer, we have suffered, and do now as much as ever suffer. All the enormities which the most cruel and savage tyrants are wont to perpetrate upon their oppressed subjects, Pleminius has perpetrated upon ourselves, our children, and our wives.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>There is one circumstance, however, in complaining of which particularly we may be allowed to yield to our deeply-rooted sense of religion, and indulge a hope that you will listen to it; and, if it shall seem good to you, conscript fathers, free your state from the guilt of irreligious conduct.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For we have seen with how great solemnity you not only worship your own deities, but entertain even those of foreign countries.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> We have a fane dedicated to Proserpine, of the sanctity of which temple I imagine some accounts must have reached you, during the war with Pyrrhus;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> who, when sailing by Locri, on his return from Sicily, among other horrid enormities which he committed against our state, on account of our fidelity towards you, plundered also the treasures of Proserpine, which had never been touched up to that day; and then, putting the money on board his ships, proceeded on his journey himself by land.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What, therefore, was the result, conscript fathers? The next day his fleet was shattered by a most hideous tempest, and all the ships which carried the sacred money were thrown on our shores.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That most insolent king, convinced by this so great disaster that there were gods, ordered all the money to be collected and restored to the treasures of the goddess. However, he never met with any success afterwards; but, after being driven out of Italy, he died an ignoble and dishonourable death, having incautiously entered Argos by night.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Though your lieutenant-general and military tribune had heard of these, and a thousand other circumstances, which were related not for the purpose of creating increased reverence, but frequently <pb id="p.1256" n="1256"/>experienced by ourselves and our ancestors, through the special interposition of the goddess, they had, nevertheless, the audacity

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> to apply their sacrilegious hands to those hallowed treasures, and pollute themselves, their own families, and your soldiers, with the impious booty.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Through whom we implore you, conscript fathers, by your honour, not to perform any thing in Italy or in Africa, until you have expiated their guilty deed, lest they should atone for the crime they have committed, not with their own blood only, but by some disaster affecting their country. Although, even now, conscript fathers, the resentment of the goddess does not tarry either towards your generals or your soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Already have they several times engaged each other in pitched battles, one party headed by Pleminius, and the other by the two military tribunes. Never did they employ their weapons with more fury against the Carthaginians than when encountering each other; and they would have afforded Hannibal an opportunity of retaking Locri, had not Scipio, whom we called in, come in time to prevent it.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But, by Hercules, is it that the soldiers are impelled by frenzy, and that the influence of the goddess has not shown itself in punishing the generals themselves?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nay, herein her interposition was manifested in the most conspicuous manner. The tribunes were beaten with rods by the lieutenant-general.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then the lieutenant-general, treacherously seized by the tribunes, besides being mangled in every part of his body, had his nose and ears cut off, and was left for dead.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then, recovering from his wounds, he threw the tribunes into chains; beat them, tortured them with every species of degrading punishment, and put them to death in a cruel manner, forbidding them to be buried.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such atonements has the goddess exacted from the despoilers of her temple; nor will she cease to pursue them, with every species of vengeance, till the sacred money shall have been replaced in the treasury.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Formerly, our ancestors, during a grievous war with the Crotonians, because the temple was without the town, were desirous of removing the money into it; but a voice was heard from the shrine, during the night, commanding them to hold off their hands, for the goddess would defend her own temple. As they were deterred, by religious awe, from removing the treasures thence, they were desirous of surrounding the temple with a wall.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The walls <pb id="p.1257" n="1257"/>were raised to a considerable height, when they suddenly fell down in ruins. But, both now, and frequently on other occasions, the goddess has either defended her own habitation and temple, or has exacted heavy expiations from those who had violated it. Our injuries she cannot avenge, nor can any but yourselves avenge them, conscript fathers.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> To you, and to your honour, we fly, as suppliants.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It makes no difference to us whether you suffer Locri to be subject to that lieutenant-general and that garrison, or whether you deliver us up for punishment to incensed Hannibal and the Carthaginians. We do not request that you should at once believe us respecting one who is absent, and when the cause has not been heard. Let him come; let him hear our charges in person, and refute them himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> If there is any enormity one man can commit against another which he has not committed upon us, we do not refuse to suffer all the same cruelties over again, if it is possible we can endure them, and let him be acquitted of all guilt towards gods and men.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the ambassadors had thus spoken, and Quintus Fabius had asked them whether they had carried those complaints to Publius Scipio, they answered, <quote>that deputies were sent to him, but he was occupied with the preparations for the war, and had either already crossed over into Africa, or was about to do so within a few days.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That they had experienced how highly the lieutenant-general was in favour with the general, when, after hearing the cause between him and the tribunes, he threw the tribunes into chains, while he left the lieutenant-general, who was equally or more guilty, in possession of the same power as before.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The ambassadors, having been directed to withdraw from the senate-house, not only Pleminius, but even Scipio, was severely inveighed against by the principal men; but, above all, by Quintus Fabius, who endeavoured to show, <quote>that he was born for the corruption of military discipline.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was thus,</quote> he said, <quote>that in Spain he almost lost more men in consequence of mutiny than the war. That, after the manner of foreigners and kings, he indulged the licentiousness of the soldiers, and then punished them with cruelty.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then followed up his speech by a resolution equally harsh: that <quote>it was his opinion, that Pleminius should be conveyed to Rome in chains, and in chains plead his cause; and, if the complaints of the Locrians were found- <pb id="p.1258" n="1258"/>ed in truth, that he should be put to death in prison, and his effects confiscated.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That Publius Scipio should be recalled, for having quitted his province without the permission of the senate; and that the plebeian tribunes should be applied to, to propose to the people the abrogation of his command. That the senate should reply to the Locrians, when brought before them, that the injuries which they complained of having received were neither approved of by the senate nor the people of Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That they should be acknowledged as worthy men, allies, and friends; that their children, their wives, and whatsoever else had been taken from them, should be restored; that the sum of money which had been taken from the treasures of Proserpine should be collected, and twice the amount placed in the treasury.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That an expiatory sacred rite should be celebrated, first referring it to the college of pontiffs, to determine what atonements should be made, to what gods, and with what victims, in consequence of the sacred treasures' having been removed and violated.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That the soldiers at Locri should be all transported into Sicily, and four cohorts of the allies of the Latin confederacy taken to Locri for a garrison.</quote> The votes could not be entirely collected that day in consequence of the warm feeling excited for and against Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Besides the atrocious conduct of Pleminius, and the calamities of the Locrians, much was said about the dress of the general himself, as being not only not Roman, but even unsoldierlike.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was said, that <quote>he walked about in the gymnasium in a cloak and slippers, and that he gave his time to light books and the palaestra.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That his whole staff were enjoying the delights which Syracuse afforded, with the same indolence and effeminacy.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That Carthage and Hannibal had dropped out of his memory; that the whole army, corrupted by indulgence, like that at Sucro in Spain, or that now at Locri, was more to be feared by its allies than by its enemies.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though these charges, partly true, and partly containing a mixture of truth and falsehood, and therefore, probably, were urged with vehemence; the opinion, however, of Quintus Metellus prevailed, who, agreeing with Maximus on other points, differed from him in the case of Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>For how inconsistent would it be,</quote> said he, <quote>that the person whom the state a little while ago selected as their general, though a very young man, for the recovery of Spain; whom, after he had <pb id="p.1259" n="1259"/>taken Spain out of the hands of their enemies, they elected their consul, for the purpose of putting an end to the Punic war;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> whom they marked out with the most confident anticipation as the person who would draw Hannibal out of Italy, and subdue Africa; how inconsistent would it be, that this man, like another Pleminius, condemned in a manner without a hearing, should suddenly be recalled from his province! when the Locrians asserted that the wicked acts which had been committed against them were done not even in the presence of Scipio, and no other charge could be brought against him, than that he spared the lieutenant-general, either from good nature or respect.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He thought it advisable, that Marcus Pomponius the praetor, to whose lot the province of Sicily had fallen, should go to his province within the next three days; that the consuls should select out of the senate ten deputies, whomsoever they thought proper, and send them with the praetor, together with two tribunes of the people, and an aedile.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That the praetor, assisted by this council, should take cognizance of the affair.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If those acts of which the Locrians complained were committed at the command or with the concurrence of Scipio, that they should command him to quit the province. If Publius Scipio had already crossed over into Africa, that the tribunes of the people and the aedile, with two of the deputies, whom the praetor should judge most fit for it, should proceed into Africa;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the tribunes and the aedile to bring Scipio back from thence, and the deputies to take the command of the army until a new general had come to it.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But if Marcus Pomponius and the ten deputies should discover that those acts had been committed neither with the orders nor concurrence of Publius Scipio, that Scipio should then remain with the army and carry on the war as he had proposed.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A decree of the senate having passed to this effect, application was made to the tribunes of the people to arrange among themselves, or determine by lot, which two should go with the praetor and the deputies.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The advice of the college of pontiffs was taken on the subject of the expiations to be made, on account of the treasures in the temple of Proserpine, at Locri, having been touched, violated, and carried out of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The tribunes of the people, who went with the praetor and ten deputies, were Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Marcus Cincius Alimentus. To these a plebeian aedile <pb id="p.1260" n="1260"/>was given, whom, if Scipio, whether he was still in Sicily or had now crossed over into Africa, should refuse to obey the orders of the praetor, the tribunes might direct to apprehend him, and bring him home in right of their most sacred authority. The plan was, to go to Locri before they went to Messana.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With regard to Pleminius, there are two different accounts. Some relate that, having heard what measures had been adopted at Rome, as he was going into exile to Naples, he accidentally fell in with Quintus Metellus, one of the deputies, by whom he was forcibly conveyed back to Rhegium.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Others say, that Scipio himself sent a lieutenant-general with thirty of the most distinguished of the cavalry to throw Quintus Pleminius into chains, and with him the principal movers of the mutiny. All these, whether by the orders of Scipio before, or of the praetor now, were delivered over to the Rhegians to be kept in custody.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The praetor and the deputies, going to Locri, gave their attention first to the affair relating to religion, agreeably to their instructions;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for, collecting all the sacred money, whether in the possession of Pleminius or the soldiers, they replaced it in the treasury, together with that which they had brought with them, and performed an expiatory sacred rite.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The praetor then, summoning the soldiers to an assembly, ordered them to march out of the city, and pitched a camp in the plain, issuing an edict which threatened severe punishment to any soldier who either had remained behind in the city, or had carried out with him what did not belong to him. He gave permission to the Locrians to seize whatever each of them identified as his property, and demand restitution to be made of any thing which was concealed. Above all, he was resolved that the free persons should be restored to the Locrians without delay.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That the man who did not restore them should be visited with no light punishment.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then held an assembly of the Locrians, and told them, that <quote>the people and senate of Rome restored to them their liberty and their laws. That if any one was desirous of bringing charges against Pleminius, or any one else, he should follow them to Rhegium.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If they were desirous of complaining, in the name of their state, of Publius Scipio, as having ordered and approved of the nefarious acts which had been committed at Locri against gods and men, that they should send deputies to Messana, where, with the assistance <pb id="p.1261" n="1261"/>of his council, he would hear them.</quote> The Locrians returned thanks to the praetor and deputies, and to the senate and people of Rome, and said that they would go and bring their charge against Pleminius.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That Scipio, though he had evinced too little sympathy in the injuries inflicted on their state, was such a man as they would rather have their friend than their enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that they were convinced that the many and horrid acts which had been committed were done neither by the orders nor with the approval of Publius Scipio; that he had either placed too much confidence in Pleminius, or too little in them;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that the natural disposition of some men was such, that they rather were unwilling that crimes should be committed, than had sufficient resolution to punish them when committed. Both the praetor and his council were relieved from a burden of no ordinary weight in not having to take cognizance of charges against Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Pleminius, and as many as thirty-two persons with him, they condemned and sent in chains to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They then proceeded to Scipio, that they might carry to Rome a statement attested by their own observation relative to the facts which had been so generally talked of, concerning the dress and indolent habits of the general, and the relaxation of military discipline.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they were on their way to Syracuse, Scipio prepared to clear himself, not by words but facts. He ordered all his troops to assemble there, and the fleet to be got in readiness, as though a battle had been to be fought that day with the Carthaginians, by sea and land.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the day of their arrival he entertained them hospitably, and on the next day presented to their view his land and naval forces, not only drawn up in order, but the former performing evolutions, while the fleet in the harbour itself also exhibited a mock naval fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The praetor and the deputies were then conducted round to view the armouries, the granaries, and other preparations for the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so great was the admiration excited in them of each particular, and of the whole together, that they firmly believed, that under the conduct of that general, and with that army, the Carthaginians would be vanquished, or by none other.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They bid him, with the blessing of the gods, cross over, and, as soon as possible, realize to the Roman people the hopes they conceived on that day when all the centuries concurred in naming him first consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thus <pb id="p.1262" n="1262"/>they set out on their return in the highest spirits, as though they were about to carry to Rome tidings of a victory, and not of a grand preparation for war.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Pleminius, and those who were implicated in the same guilt with him, when they arrived at Rome, were thrown immediately into prison. At first, when brought before the people by the tribunes, they found no place in their compassion, as their minds were previously engrossed by the sufferings of the Locrians; but afterwards, being repeatedly brought before them, and the hatred with which they were regarded subsiding, their resentment was softened.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Besides, the mutilated appearance of Pleminius, and their recollections of the absent Scipio, operated in gaining them favour with the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pleminius, however, died in prison, before the people had come to a determination respecting him. Clodius Licinius, in the third book of his Roman history, relates, that this Pleminius, during the celebration of the votive games, which Africanus, in his second consulate, exhibited at Rome, made an attempt, by means of certain persons whom he had corrupted by bribes, to set fire to the city in several places, that he might have an opportunity of breaking out of prison, and making his escape;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that afterwards, the wicked plot having been discovered, he was consigned to the Tullian dungeon, according to a decree of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The case of Scipio was considered no where but in the senate; where all the deputies and tribunes, bestowing the highest commendations on the fleet, the army, and the general, induced the senate to vote that he should cross over into Africa as soon as possible;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and that permission should be given him to select himself, out of those armies which were in Sicily, those forces which he would carry with him into Africa, and those which he would leave for the protection of the province.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Romans were thus employed, the Carthaginians, on their part, though they had passed an anxious winter, earnestly inquiring what was going on, and terrified at the arrival of every messenger, with watch-towers placed on every promontory,

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had gained a point of no small importance for the defence of Africa, in adding to their allies king Syphax, in reliance on whom chiefly they believed the Romans would cross over into Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, not only formed a connexion of hospitality with the before-named <pb id="p.1263" n="1263"/>king, when Scipio and Hasdrubal happened to come to him at the same time out of Spain, but mention had also been slightly made of an affinity to take place between them, by the king's marrying the daughter of Hasdrubal.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hasdrubal, who had gone for the purpose of completing this business, and fixing a time for the nuptials, for the virgin was now marriageable, perceiving that the king was inflamed with desire, for the Numidians are, beyond all the other barbarians, violently addicted to love, sent for the virgin from Carthage, and hastened the nuptials.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Among the other proofs of joy felt upon the occasion, and in order that a public connexion might be added to this private one, an oath was taken in confirmation of an alliance between the Carthaginian people and the king, and faith reciprocally pledged that they would have the same friends and enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But Hasdrubal, recollecting both the alliance which had been entered into by the king and Scipio, and how inconstant and changeable were the minds of the barbarians, was afraid that, if Scipio were to invade Africa, that marriage would prove but a slight bond of union, he therefore took advantage of the Numidian while under the influence of the first transports of love, and calling to his aid the caresses of the bride, prevailed upon him to send ambassadors into Sicily to Scipio, and by them to warn him "not to

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> cross over into Africa in reliance upon his former promises.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That he was united to the Carthaginians both by a marriage with a Carthaginian citizen, the daughter of Hasdrubal, whom he saw entertained at his house, and likewise by a public treaty.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That his first wish was that the Romans would carry on the war with the Carthaginians at a distance from Africa, as they had hitherto done, lest he should be compelled to interfere with their disputes, and join one of the two contending parties, renouncing his alliance with the other.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If Scipio should not keep away from Africa, and should advance his army to Carthage, it would be incumbent upon him to fight for the land of Africa, which gave him birth, and for the country of his spouse, for her parent, and household gods.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The ambassadors, sent to Scipio by the king with these instructions, met him at Syracuse.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio, though disappointed in an affair which was of the greatest importance with regard to his operations in Africa, and in the sanguine expectations he had formed from it, sent the ambassadors back <pb id="p.1264" n="1264"/>into Africa speedily, before their business was made

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> known, giving them letters for the king, in which he warned him over and over again <quote>not to violate the laws of hospitality which bound them together; the obligation of the alliance entered into with the Roman people; nor make light of justice, honour, their right hands pledged, and the gods the witnesses and arbitrators of compacts.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, as the coming of the Numidians could not be concealed, for they lounged about the city, and had frequently appeared at the pavilion; and as, if nothing were said about the object of their visit, there was danger lest the truth, from the very circumstance of its being made a secret, should spontaneously spread the more; and, in consequence, the troops become alarmed lest they should have to wage war at once with the king and the Carthaginians, Scipio endeavoured to divert their attention from the truth by preoccupying their minds with false information; and, summoning his soldiers to an assembly, said, <quote>that it was not expedient to delay any longer.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That the kings, their allies, urged them to cross over into Africa with all speed.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That Masinissa himself had before come to Lalius, complaining that time was consumed in delays, and that now Syphax sent ambassadors, expressing his astonishment on the same account, namely, what could be the cause of such long delay; and requesting either that the army would now at length be transported into Africa, or, if the plan was changed, that he might be informed so that he might himself take measures for the safety of himself and his dominions.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Therefore, as every thing was now ready and prepared, and as the business admitted of no further delay, he was resolved, after having removed the fleet to Lilybaeum, and collected here all his forces of foot and horse, with the blessing of the gods to pass over into Africa the first day the ships could sail.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He sent a letter to Marcus Pomponius, directing him, if he thought proper, to come to Lilybaeum, that they might consult together as to what legions, in preference to any others, and how large a number of soldiers, they should convey into Africa;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> he also sent round to every part of the sea-coast, with directions that all the ships of burthen should be seized and collected at Lilybaeum.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When all the soldiers and ships in Sicily were assembled at Lilybaeum, and neither the city could contain the multitude of men, nor the harbour the ships, so ardent was the desire possessed by all of passing over to Africa, that they <pb id="p.1265" n="1265"/>did not appear as if going to wage war, but to reap the certain rewards of victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Particularly those who remained of the soldiers who had fought at Cannae felt convinced that under Scipio, and no other general, they would be enabled, by exerting themselves in the cause of the state, to put an end to their ignominious service.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio was very far from feeling contempt for that description of soldiers, inasmuch as he knew that the defeat sustained at Cannae was not attributable to their cowardice, and that there were no soldiers in the Roman army who had served so long, or were so experienced not only in the various kinds of battles, but in assaulting towns also.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The legions which had fought at Cannae were the fifth and sixth. After declaring that he would take these with him into Africa, he inspected them man by man; and leaving those whom he considered unfit for service, he substituted for them those whom he had brought from Sicily, filling up those legions so that each might contain six thousand two hundred infantry and three hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The horse and foot of the allies. of the Latin confederacy, he also chose out of the army of Cannae.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There is a wide difference among historians as to the number of men transported into Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In some I find ten thousand infantry and two hundred horse; in others, sixteen thousand infantry and sixteen hundred horse. In others, again, I find it stated that thirty-five thousand infantry and cavalry were put on board the fleet, making the number more than one half greater.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some have not added an account of the number; among whom, as the matter is doubtful, I should rather have myself ranked. Caelius, though he abstains from specifying the number, increases the impression of their multitude indefinitely.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He says, that birds fell to the ground from the shout of the soldiers, and that so great a multitude went on board the fleet, that it seemed as if there was not a man left in Italy or Sicily. Scipio took upon himself the care of seeing that the soldiers embarked orderly and without confusion. The seamen, who were made to embark first, Caius Laelius, the admiral of the fleet, kept in order on board the ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The task of the putting on board the provisions was assigned to Marcus Pomponius, the praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Food for forty-five days, of which enough for fifteen was cooked, was put on board. When they were all embarked, he sent boats round with directions that the pilots <pb id="p.1266" n="1266"/>and masters, with two soldiers from each ship, should assemble in the forum to receive orders.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After they had assembled, he first asked them whether they had put on board water for the men and cattle, sufficient to last as many days as the corn would.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they answered that there was water on board sufficient for five and forty days' consumption, he then charged the soldiers that, conducting

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> themselves submissively, and keeping quiet, they would not make any noise or disturb the mariners in the execution of their duties.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He informed them, that he himself and Lucius Scipio in the right wing, with twenty ships of war, and Caius Laelius, admiral of the fleet, together with Marcus Porcius Cato, who was then quaestor, with the same number of ships of war in the left wing, would protect the transports. That the ships of war should carry each a single light, the transports two each.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That in the ship of the commander-in-chief there would be three lights as a distinction by night. He desired the pilots to make for Emporia, where the land is remarkably fertile;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and on that account the district abounds with plenty of every thing, and the barbarous inhabitants are unwarlike, which is usually the case where the soil is rich. It was supposed that they might, therefore, be overpowered before assistance could be brought them from Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After these commands were delivered, they were ordered to return to their ships, and the next day, with the blessing of the gods, on the signal being given, to set sail.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many Roman fleets had set sail from Sicily, and from that very harbour. But not only during this war, nor is that surprising, (for most of the fleets went out for the purpose of getting plunder,) but even in any former war, never did a fleet on setting out exhibit so grand a spectacle.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And yet, if the estimate is to be formed with reference to the magnitude of the fleet, it must be owned that two consuls with their armies had passed from thence before, and there were almost as many ships of war in those fleets as the transports with which Scipio was crossing.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For, besides fifty men of war, he conveyed his army over in four hundred transports. But what made the Romans consider one war as

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> more formidable than the other, the second than the first, was, that it was carried on in Italy, and that so many armies had been destroyed, and their commanders slain.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The general, Scipio, also, who <pb id="p.1267" n="1267"/>enjoyed the highest degree of renown, partly from his brave achievements, and partly from a peculiar felicity of fortune, which conducted him to the acquisition of boundless glory, attracted extraordinary regard.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the same time, the very project of passing over into the enemy's country, which had not been formed by any general before during that war, had made him an object of admiration; for he had commonly declared, that he passed over with the object of drawing Hannibal out of Italy, of removing the seat of war into Africa, and terminating it there.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A crowd of persons of every description had assembled in the harbour to view the spectacle; not only the inhabitants of Lilybaeum, but all the deputies from Sicily, who had come together out of compliment to witness the departure of Scipio, and had followed Marcus Pomponius, the praetor of the province.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Besides these, the legions which were to be left in Sicily had come forth to do honour to their comrades on the occasion; and not only did the fleet form a grand sight to those who viewed it from the land, but the shore also, crowded as it was all around, afforded the same to those who were sailing away.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as day appeared, silence having been obtained by a herald, Scipio thus spoke from the ship of the commander-in-chief:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Ye gods and goddesses who preside over the seas and lands, I pray and entreat you, that whatever things have been, are now, or shall be performed during my command, may turn out prosperously to myself, the state, and commons of Rome, to the allies and the Latin confederacy, and to all who follow my party and that of the Roman people, my command and auspices, by land, by sea, and on rivers. That you would lend your favourable aid to all those measures, and promote them happily.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That you would bring these and me again to our homes, safe and unhurt; victorious over our vanquished enemies, decorated with spoils, loaded with booty, and triumphant.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That you would grant us the opportunity of taking revenge upon our adversaries and foes, and put it in the power of myself and the Roman people to make the Carthaginian state feel those signal severities which they endeavoured to inflict upon our state.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After these prayers, he threw the raw entrails of a victim into the sea, according to custom, and, with the sound of a trumpet, gave the signal for sailing.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Setting out with a favourable wind, which blew <pb id="p.1268" n="1268"/>pretty strong, they were soon borne away out of sight of the land; and in the afternoon a mist came over them, so that they could with difficulty prevent the ships from running foul of each other. The wind abated when they got into the open sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The following night the same haziness prevailed; but when the sun rose it was dispelled, and the wind blew stronger. They were now within sight of land, and, not long after, the pilot observed to Scipio, that <quote>Africa was not more than five miles off;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that he could discern the promontory of Mercury, and that if he gave orders to direct their course thither, the whole fleet would presently be in harbour.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Scipio, when the land was in sight, after praying that his seeing Africa might be for the good of the state and himself, gave orders to make for another place of landing, lower down.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were borne along by the same wind; but a mist, arising nearly about the same time as on the preceding day, hid the land from them; and the wind fell as the mist grew more dense.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Afterwards, the night coming on increased the confusion in every respect; they therefore cast anchor, lest the ships should either run foul of each other, or be driven on shore. At daybreak the wind, rising in the same quarter, dispelled the mist and discovered the whole coast of Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio asked what was the name of the nearest promontory, and, on being told that it was called the cape of Pulcher, he observed, <quote>the omen pleases me, direct your course to it.</quote> To this place the fleet ran down, and all the troops were landed.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> I have adopted the accounts given by a great many Greek and Latin authors, who state that the voyage was prosperous, and unattended with any cause of alarm or confusion.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Caelius alone, except that he does not state that the ships were sunk in the waves, says that they were exposed to all the terrors of the heavens and the sea, and that at last the fleet was driven by tempest from Africa to the island Aegimurus, from which, with great difficulty, they got into the right course;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and that, the ships almost foundering, the soldiers, without orders from their general, got into boats, just as if they had suffered shipwreck, and escaped to land without arms, and in the utmost disorder.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The troops being landed, the Romans marked out their camp on the nearest rising grounds.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By this time, not only the parts bordering on the sea were filled with consternation and alarm, first in consequence of the fleet being seen, and <pb id="p.1269" n="1269"/>afterwards from the bustle of landing, but they had extended to the cities also.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For not only multitudes of men, mixed with crowds of women and children, had filled up all the roads in every direction, but the rustics also drove away their cattle before them, so that you would say that Africa was being suddenly deserted.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the cities, indeed, they occasioned much greater terror than they felt themselves. At Carthage, particularly, the tumult was almost as great as if it had been captured.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For since the time of Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius, which was almost fifty years ago, the Carthaginians had seen no Roman armament, with the exception of fleets sent for plundering, from which troops had made descents upon the lands bordering on the sea,

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> and after carrying away every thing which chance threw in their way, had always returned to their ships before their noise had collected the peasantry. For this reason the hurry and consternation in the city was, on the present occasion, the greater.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And, by Hercules, they had neither an efficient army at home, nor a general, whom they could oppose to their enemy. Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, was by far the first man in their state in respect of birth, fame, opulence, and, at that time, also by reason of an affinity with the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But they recollected that he had been routed in several battles and driven out of Spain by this very Scipio; and that therefore, as a general, he was no more a match for the general of the enemy than their tumultuary army was for that of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Therefore they shouted to arms, as if Scipio were coming immediately to attack the city; the gates were hastily closed, armed men placed upon the walls, guards and outposts stationed in different places, and the following night was spent in watching.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The next day, five hundred horsemen, sent to the coast to reconnoitre and interrupt the enemy while landing, fell in with the advanced guards of the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> for by this time Scipio, having sent his fleet to Utica, had proceeded a short distance from the sea, and occupied the nearest heights. He had also placed outposts of cavalry in proper situations, and sent troops through the country to plunder.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These, engaging the body of Carthaginian horse, slew a few of them in the fight, and the greater part of them as they pursued them when they were flying; among whom was <pb id="p.1270" n="1270"/>Hanno, their captain, a young man of distinction.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio not only devastated the lands in the country round him, but also took a very wealthy city of the Africans which lay nearest to him;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> where, besides other things which were immediately put on board the transports and sent into Sicily, eight thousand free persons and slaves were captured. But the most gratifying circumstance to the Romans was, the arrival of Masinissa just at the commencement of their operations.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some say that he came with not more than two hundred horse, but most authors say with a body of two thousand cavalry.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But, as this man was by far the greatest king of his age, and rendered most essential service to the Romans, it seems worth while to digress a little, to give a full account of the great vicissitudes of fortune he experienced in the loss and recovery of his father's kingdom. While he was serving in Spain in the cause of the Carthaginians, his father, named Gala, died.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The kingdom, according to the custom of the Numidians, came to &OElig;salces, the brother of the late king, who was very aged.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Not long after, &OElig;salces also dying, the elder of his two sons, named Capusa, the other being quite a boy, succeeded to his father's kingdom. But, as he occupied the throne more by right of descent than from the

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> esteem in which he was held among his countrymen, or the power he possessed, there stood forth a person named Mezetulus, not unrelated by blood to the kings, of a family which had always been hostile to them, and had continually contested the right to the throne with those who then occupied it, with various success.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This man, having roused his countrymen to arms, over whom he possessed a great influence, from the hatred felt towards the kings, openly pitched his camp, and compelled the king to come into the field and fight for the throne.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Capusa, with many of his nobles, falling in the action, the whole nation of the Massylians came under the dominion and rule of Mezetulus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He abstained, however, from assuming the title of king; and, contenting himself with the modest appellation of protector, gave the name of king to the boy Lacumaces, a surviving branch of the royal stock.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In the hope of an alliance with the Carthaginians, he formed a matrimonial connexion with a noble Carthaginian lady, daughter of Hannibal's sister, who had been lately married to the king &OElig;salces;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and, sending ambassadors for that purpose, renewed an old con- <pb id="p.1271" n="1271"/>nexion of hospitality with Syphax, taking all these measures with a view to obtain assistance against Masinissa.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Masinissa, hearing of the death of his uncle, and afterwards that his cousin-german was slain, passed over out of Spain into Mauritania. Bocchar was king of the Moors at that time.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Applying to him as a suppliant, he succeeded, by means of the most humble entreaties, in obtaining from him four thousand Moors to escort him on his march, since he could not procure his co-operation in the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With these, after sending a messenger before him to his own and his father's friends, he arrived on the frontiers of the kingdom, when about five hundred Numidians came to join him.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having, therefore, sent back the Moors to their king, as had been agreed, though the numbers which joined him were much less than he had anticipated, not being such as to inspire him

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> with sufficient confidence for so great an attempt, yet, concluding that by action, and by making some effort, he should collect sufficient strength to enable him to effect something, he threw himself in the way of the young king Lacumaces, at Thapsus, as he was going to Syphax. The troops which attended him having fled back to the town in consternation, Masinissa took it at the first assault.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Of the royal party, some who surrendered themselves he received, others he slew while attempting resistance.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The greater part, with the young king himself, escaped during the confusion and came to Syphax, to whom they intended to go at first. The fame of this success, in the commencement of his operations, though of no great magnitude, brought the Numidians over to the cause of Masinissa; and the veteran soldiers of Gala flocked to his standard from all quarters, from the country and the towns, inviting the youth to come and recover his paternal dominions.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Mezetulus had somewhat the advantage in the number of his soldiers, for he had himself both the army with which he had conquered Capusa, and also some troops who had submitted to him after the king was slain; and the young king Lacumaces had brought him very large succours from Syphax.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Mezetulus had fifteen thousand infantry, and ten thousand cavalry. With these Masinissa engaged in battle, though he had by no means so many horse or foot.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The valour, however, of the veteran troops, and the skill of the general, who had been exercised in the war between the Romans and Carthaginians, <pb id="p.1272" n="1272"/>prevailed. The young king, with the protector and a small body of Massylians, escaped into the territories of the Carthaginians. Masinissa thus recovered his paternal dominions; but, as he saw that there still remained a struggle considerably more arduous with Syphax, he thought it advisable to come to a reconciliation with his cousin-german.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Having, therefore, sent persons to give the young king hopes, that if he put himself under the protection of Masinissa, he would be held in the same honour by him as &OElig;salces had formerly been by Gala;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and to promise Mezetulus, in addition to impunity, a faithful restitution of all his property; as both of them preferred a moderate share of fortune at home to exile, he brought

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> them over to his side, notwithstanding the Carthaginians studiously exerted every means to prevent it.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It happened that Hasdrubal was with Syphax at the time these things were taking place. He told the Numidian, who considered that it could make very little difference to him whether the government of the Massylians was in the hands of Lacumaces or Masinissa, that <quote>he was very much mistaken if he supposed that Masinissa would be content with the same power which his father Gala or his uncle &OElig;salces enjoyed.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That he possessed a much greater degree of spirit, and a more enterprising turn of mind, than had ever existed in any one of that race. That he had frequently, when in Spain, exhibited proofs to his allies, as well as to his enemies, of such valour as was rarely found among men.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That both Syphax and the Carthaginians, unless they smothered that rising flame, would soon find themselves enveloped in a vast conflagration, when they could not help themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That as yet his strength was feeble, and such as might easily be broken, while he was trying to keep together a kingdom, which was not yet firmly cemented.</quote> By continually urging and goading him on, he succeeded in inducing him to lead an army to the frontiers of the Massylians, and to pitch his camp in a country for which he had not only disputed verbally, but had fought battles with Gala, as though it had been his own by uncontested right.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He alleged, that <quote>if any one should attempt to dislodge him, which was what he most wanted, he would have an opportunity of fighting; but, if the ground were given up to him through fear, he must march into the heart of the kingdom.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That the Massylians would either submit to his authority <pb id="p.1273" n="1273"/>without a contest, or would be inferior to him in arms.</quote> Syphax, impelled by these arguments, made war on Masinissa, and, in the first engagement, routed and put him to flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Masinissa, with a few horsemen, effected his escape from the field to a mountain called by the natives Balbus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Several families, with their tents and cattle, which form their wealth, followed the king; the rest of the Massylian people submitted to Syphax.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The mountain, which the exiles had seized, had plenty of grass and water; and, as it was well adapted for feeding cattle, afforded an abundant supply of food for men who live upon flesh and milk. From this place they infested all the surrounding country; at first with nightly and clandestine incursions, but afterwards with open depredations. The lands of the Carthaginians suffered the severest devastation, because there was not only a greater quantity of booty there than among the Numidians, but their plunder would be safer.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And now they did it with so much boldness and defiance, that, carrying their booty down to the sea, they sold it to merchants, who brought their ships to land for that very purpose;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> while a greater number of Carthaginians were slain and made prisoners, than frequently happens in a regular war. The Carthaginians complained bitterly of these occurrences to Syphax, and urged him strongly to follow up this remnant of the war, though he was himself highly incensed at them.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But he considered it hardly suitable to the dignity of a king to pursue a vagabond robber through the mountains.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Bocchar, one of the king's generals, an enterprising and active officer, was chosen for this service. Four thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry were assigned him; and having been loaded with promises of immense rewards if he brought back the head of Masinissa, or if, which would be a source of incalculable joy, he took him alive;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he unexpectedly attacked his party while dispersed and carelessly employed, and after cutting off an immense quantity of cattle and men from the troops which guarded them, drove Masinissa himself with a small body of attendants to the summit of the mountain.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On this, considering the business as in a manner settled, he not only sent the booty of cattle and the prisoners he had made to the king, but also sent back a part of his forces, as being considerably more than were necessary to accomplish what remained of the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and then pursuing Maninissa, <pb id="p.1274" n="1274"/>who had come down from the top of the mountain with not more than five hundred foot and two hundred horse, shut him up in a narrow valley, both the entrances of which he blocked up.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Here great slaughter was made of the Massylians. Masinissa, with not more than fifty horsemen, disengaged himself from the defile by passing through steep descents of the mountains, which were not known to his pursuers.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Bocchar, however, followed close upon him, and overtaking him in the open plains near Clupea, so effectually surrounded him, that he slew every one of his attendants except four horsemen. These, together with Masinissa himself, who was wounded, he let slip, in a manner, out of his hands during the confusion.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fugitives were in sight, and a body of horse, dispersed over the whole plain, pursued the five horsemen of the enemy, some of them pushing off in an oblique direction, in order to meet them.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fugitives met with a very broad river, into which they unhesitatingly plunged their horses, as they were pressed by greater danger from behind, and carried away by the current were borne along obliquely.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Two of them having sunk in the rapid eddy in the sight of the enemy, Masinissa himself was supposed to have perished; but he with the two remaining had emerged among the bushes on the farther bank. Here Bocchar stopped his pursuit, as he neither had courage to enter the river, nor believed that he now had any one to pursue. Upon this he returned to the king, with the false account of the death of Masinissa.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Messengers were despatched to Carthage to convey this most joyful event, and all Africa rang with the news of Masinissa's death; but the minds of men were variously affected by it.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Masinissa, while curing his wound by the application of herbs, was supported for several days in a secret cave by what the two horsemen procured by plunder.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As soon as it was cicatrized, and he thought himself able to bear the motion, with extraordinary resolution he set out to recover his kingdom;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and collecting not more than forty horsemen during his progress, when he arrived among the Massylians, where he now made himself known, he produced such a sensation among them, both by reason of their former regard for him, and also from the unhoped-for joy they experienced at seeing him safe whom they supposed to have perished, that within a few days six thousand armed foot and <pb id="p.1275" n="1275"/>four thousand horse came and joined him;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and now he not only was in possession of his paternal dominions, but was also laying waste the lands of the states in alliance with the Carthaginians, and the frontiers of the Massylians, the dominions of Syphax. Then, having provoked Syphax to war, he took up a position between Cirta and Hippo, on the tops of mountains which were conveniently situated for all his purposes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Syphax, considering this an affair of too great importance to be managed by one of his generals, sent a part of his army with his son Vermina, a youth, with orders to march his troops round and attack the enemy in the rear, while he engaged their attention in front.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Vermina set out by night, as he was to fall upon the enemy unawares; but Syphax decamped in the day-time and marched openly, intending to fight a pitched battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When it was thought that sufficient time had elapsed for those who were sent round to have reached their destination, Syphax himself, relying upon his numbers and on the ambuscade prepared on the enemy's rear, led his troops up the mountain which lay before him, by a gentle acclivity which led towards the enemy. Masinissa, relying chiefly on the great superiority he would have over his opponents in respect of the ground, on his part also formed his troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The battle was furious, and for a long time doubtful; Masinissa having the advantage in point of situation and the courage of his troops, and Syphax in respect of his numbers, which were much the greater of the two.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> His numerous troops, which were divided, some of them pressing upon the enemy in front, while others surrounded them on the rear, gave Syphax a decisive victory; and, enclosed as they were in front and rear, the enemy had not even a way to escape.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly, all their troops, both horse and foot, were slain and made prisoners, except about two hundred horsemen, which Masinissa having collected round him in a compact body, and divided into three squadrons, ordered to force their way through, first naming a place where they were to meet after being separated in their flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Masinissa himself escaped through the midst of the enemy's weapons in the quarter to which he had directed his course; two of the squadrons were unable to extricate themselves; one of them surrendered to the enemy through fear, the other, making a more obstinate resistance, was overwhelmed with weapons and annihilated.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Vermina followed Masinissa, <pb id="p.1276" n="1276"/>treading almost in his steps; but he eluded him by continually turning out of one road into another, till at length he obliged him, wearied with the hopeless task, to desist from the pursuit, and arrived at the Lesser Syrtis with sixty horsemen.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Here, in the country lying between the Carthaginian Emporia and the nation of the Garamantians, he passed all the time till the coming of Caius Laelius and the Roman fleet into Africa, with the proud consciousness of having made every exertion to recover his paternal dominions. These are the circumstances which incline me to the opinion, that afterwards also, when Masinissa came to Scipio, he brought with him a smallish rather than a large body of cavalry to succour him;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for the large number would seem to suit only with the condition of a reigning king, while the small number corresponds with the circumstances of an exile.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Carthaginians having lost a detachment of cavalry, together with the commander, got together another body by means of a new levy, and gave the command of it to Hanno, son of Hamilcar.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They frequently sent for Hasdrubal and Syphax by letters and messengers, and lastly even by ambassadors, ordering Hasdrubal to bring assistance to his almost besieged country, and imploring Syphax to bring relief to Carthage, nay to all Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At that time Scipio had his camp about five miles from the city of Utica, having removed it from the sea, where he had continued encamped for a few days near the fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hanno, having received the body of horse, which was far from being strong enough, not only to attack the enemy, but even to protect the country from devastation, made it his first business to augment the number of his cavalry by pressing;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and though he did not despise the men of other nations, he enlisted principally from the Numidians, who are by far the first horsemen in Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had now as many as four thousand horsemen, when he took possession of a town named Salera, about fifteen miles from the Roman camp. When Scipio was told of this, he said, <quote>What! cavalry lodging in houses during the summer!

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let them be even more in number while they have such a leader.</quote> Concluding that the more dilatory they were in their operations, the more active he ought to be, he sent Masinissa forward with the cavalry, directing him to ride up to the gates of the enemy and draw them out to battle;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and when their whole force had poured out and pressed upon him with such <pb id="p.1277" n="1277"/>impetuosity in the contest that they could not easily be withstood, then to retire by degrees, and he would himself come up and join in the battle in time.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Waiting only till he thought he had allowed sufficient time for the advanced party to draw out the enemy, he followed with the Roman cavalry, proceeding without being seen, as he was covered by some rising grounds, which lay very conveniently between him and the enemy, round the windings of the road.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Masinissa, according to the plan laid down, at one time as if menacing the enemy, at another as if he had been afraid, either rode up to the gates, or else by retiring when his counterfeited fears had inspired them with courage, tempted them to pursue him with inconsiderate ardour.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They had not as yet all gone out, and the general was wearying himself with various occupations, compelling some who were oppressed with sleep and wine to take arms and bridle their horses, and preventing others from running out at all the gates in scattered parties and in disorder, without keeping their ranks or following their standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At first, those who incautiously rushed out were overpowered by Masinissa; but then a greater number pouring out of the gate at once in a dense body, placed the contest on an equal footing;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and at last the whole of their cavalry coming up and joining in the battle, they could now no longer be withstood.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Masinissa, however, did not receive their charge in hasty flight, but retired slowly, until he drew them to the rising grounds which covered the Roman cavalry. The Roman cavalry then rising up, their own strength unimpaired and their horses fresh, spread themselves round Hanno and the Africans, fatigued 'with the fight and the pursuit, and Masinissa, suddenly turning his horses round, came back to the battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> About a thousand who formed the first line and could not easily retreat, together with Hanno their general, were surrounded and slain.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The victors pursuing the rest through a space of three miles, as they fled with the most violent haste, being terrified, principally on account of the death of their leader, either took or slew as many as two thousand horsemen more.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> It appeared that there were not less than two hundred Carthaginian horsemen among them, some of whom were distinguished by birth and fortune.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It happened that the same day on which these events <pb id="p.1278" n="1278"/>occurred, the ships which had carried the plunder to Sicily returned with provisions, as if divining that they came to take another cargo of booty.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> All the writers do not vouch for the fact that two generals of the Carthaginians bearing the same name were slain in the battles of the cavalry; fearing, I believe, lest the same circumstance related twice should lead them into error. Caelius, indeed, and Valerius, make mention of a Hanno also who was made prisoner.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Scipio rewarded his officers and horsemen according to the service they had respectively rendered, but he presented Masinissa above all the rest with distinguished gifts.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Leaving a strong garrison at Saleca, he set out with the rest of his army; and having not only devastated the country wherever he marched, but taken some cities and towns, thus spreading the terrors of war far and wide, he returned to his camp on the seventh day after he set out, bringing with him an immense quantity of men and cattle, and booty of every description, and sent away his ships again loaded with the spoils of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then giving up all expeditions of a minor kind, and predatory excursions, he directed the

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> whole force of the war to the siege of Utica, that he might make it for the time to come, if he took it, a position from which he might set out for the execution of the rest of his designs.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At one and the same time his marines attacked the city from the fleet in that part which is washed by the sea, and the land forces were brought up from a rising ground which almost immediately overhung the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had also brought with him engines and machines which had been conveyed from Sicily with the stores, and fresh ones were made in the armoury, in which he had for that purpose employed a number of artificers skilled in such works. The people of Utica, thus beset on all sides with so formidable a force, placed all their hopes in the Carthaginians, and the Carthaginians in the chance there was that Hasdrubal could induce Syphax to take arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But all their movements were made too slowly for the anxiety felt by those who were in want of assistance.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hasdrubal, though he had by levies, conducted with the utmost diligence, made up as many as thirty thousand infantry and three thousand horse, yet dared not move nearer to the enemy before the arrival of Syphax.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Syphax came with fifty thousand foot and ten thousand horse, and, immediately <pb id="p.1279" n="1279"/>decamping from Carthage, took up a position not far from Utica and the Roman works.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Their arrival produced, however, this effect, that Scipio, who had been besieging Utica for forty days, during which he had tried every expedient without effect, left the place without accomplishing his object;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and as the winter was now fast approaching, fortified a camp for the winter upon a promontory, which being attached to the continent by a narrow isthmus, stretched out a considerable way into the sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He included his naval camp also within one and the same rampart. The camp for the legions being stationed on the middle of the isthmus, the ships, which were drawn on land, and the mariners occupied the northern shore, the cavalry a valley on the south inclining towards the other shore.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such were the transactions in Africa up to the close of autumn.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Besides the corn collected from all parts of the surrounding country by plunder, and the provisions imported from Italy and Sicily, Cneius Octavius, propraetor, brought a vast quantity out of Sardinia from Tiberius Claudius the praetor, whose province Sardinia was; and not only were the granaries already built filled, but new ones were erected.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The army wanted clothing, and Octavius was instructed to consult with the praetor in order to ascertain if any could be procured and sent out of that province. This business was also diligently attended to. One thousand two hundred gowns and twelve thousand tunics were in a short time sent.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> During the summer in which these operations were carried on in Africa, Publius Sempronius, the consul, who had the province of Bruttium, fought an irregular kind of battle with Hannibal in the Crotonian territory while actually on march;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> they fought with their troops drawn more in order of march than of battle. The Romans were driven back, and as many as twelve hundred of the army of the consul were slain in this affair, which was more a tumult than a battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They returned in confusion to their camp. The enemy, however, dared not assault it.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But, during the silence of the following night, the consul marched away, and having sent a messenger before him to Publius Licinius, the proconsul, to bring up his legions, united his forces with his. Thus two generals and two armies returned to Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor did either party delay to fight, as the forces of the consul were <pb id="p.1280" n="1280"/>doubled, and the Carthaginian was inspirited by recent victory. Sempronius led his legions into the front line; those of Licinius were placed in reserve.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul, in the beginning of the battle, vowed a temple to Fortuna Primigenia if he routed the enemy that day, and he obtained the object of that vow. The Carthaginians were routed and put to flight; above four thousand armed men were slain, a little under three hundred taken alive, with forty horses and eleven military standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hannibal, dispirited by this adverse battle, led his troops away to Croton. At the same time, in another part of Italy, Etruria, almost the whole of which had espoused the interest of Mago, and had

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> conceived hopes of effecting a revolution through his means, was kept in subjection by the consul Marcus Cornelius, not so much by the force of his arms as the terror of his judicial proceedings.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In the trials he had instituted there, in conformity with the decree of the senate, he had shown the utmost impartiality; and many of the Tuscan nobles, who had either themselves gone, or had sent others to Mago respecting the revolt of their states, at first standing their trials, were condemned;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> but afterwards others, who, from a consciousness of guilt, had gone into voluntary exile, were condemned in their absence, and by thus withdrawing left their effects only, which were liable to confiscation, as a pledge for their punishment.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consuls were thus engaged in different quarters, in the mean time, at Rome, the censors, Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius, called over the senate roll. Quintus Fabius was again chosen chief of the senate; seven were stigmatized, of whom there was not one who had sat in the curule chair.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They inquired into the business relating to the repair of public edifices with diligence and the most scrupulous exactness. They set by contract the making of a road out of the ox market to the temple of Venus, with public seats on each side of it, and a temple to be built in the palatium for the great mother.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They established also a new tax out of the price of salt. Salt, both at Rome, and throughout all Italy, was sold at the sixth part of an <hi rend="italics">as.</hi> They contracted for the supply of it at Rome at the same price, at a higher price in the country towns and markets, and at different prices in different places.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They felt well convinced that this tax was invented by one of the censors, out of resentment to the people, <pb id="p.1281" n="1281"/>because he had formerly been condemned by an unjust sentence, and that in fixing the price of salt, those tribes had been most burdened by whose means he had been condemned.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hence Livius derived the surname of Salinator. The closing of the lustrum was later than usual, because the censors sent persons through the provinces, that

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> a report might be made of the number of Roman citizens in each of the armies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Including these, the number of persons returned in the census was two hundred and fourteen thousand. Caius Claudius Nero closed the lustrum. They then received a census of the twelve colonies, which had never been done before, the censors of the colonies themselves presenting it, in order that there might appear registers among the public records, stating the extent of their resources, both in respect of furnishing soldiers and money.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The review of the knights then began to be made, and it happened that both the censors had a horse at the public expense.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they came to the Pollian tribe, in which was the name of Marcus Livius, and the herald hesitated to cite the censor himself, Nero said, <quote>Cite Marcus Livius;</quote> and whether it was that he was actuated by the remains of an old enmity, or that he felt a ridiculous pride in this ill-timed display of severity, he ordered Marcus Livius to sell his horse, because he had been condemned by the sentence of the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In like manner, when they came to the Narnian tribe, and the name of his colleague, Marcus Livius ordered Caius Claudius to sell his horse, for two reasons; one, because he had given false evidence against him; the other, because he had not been sincere in his reconciliation with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thus a disgraceful contest arose, in which each endeavoured to asperse the character of the other, though not without detriment to his own.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the expiration of the office, when Caius Claudius had taken the oath respecting the observance of the laws, and had gone up into the treasury, he gave the name of his colleague among the names of those whom he left disfranchised.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Afterwards, Marcus Livius came into the treasury, and excepting only the Maecian tribe, which had neither condemned him nor made him consul or censor when condemned, left all the Roman people, four and thirty tribes, disfranchised, because they had both condemned him when innocent, and when condemned had made him consul and censor;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and therefore could not deny <pb id="p.1282" n="1282"/>that they had been guilty of a crime, either once in his condemnation, or twice at the elections.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He said that the disfranchisement of Caius Claudius would be included in that of the thirty-four tribes, but that if he were in possession of a precedent for leaving the same person disfranchised twice, he would have left his name particularly among the disfranchised.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> This contest between censors, endeavouring to brand each other, was highly improper, while the correction applied to the inconstancy of the people was suitable to the office of a censor, and worthy of the strict discipline of the times.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> As the censors were labouring under odium, Cneius Babius, tribune of the people, thinking this a favourable opportunity of advancing himself at their expense, summoned them both to trial before the people. This proceeding was quashed by the unanimous voice of the senate, lest in future the office of censor should become subject to the caprice of the people.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same summer Clampetia in Bruttium was taken by the consul by storm. Consentia and Pandosia, with some other inconsiderable states, submitted voluntarily.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As the time for the elections was now drawing near, it was thought best that Cornelius should be summoned to Rome from Etruria, as there was no war there.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He elected, as consuls, Cneius Servilius Caepio and Caius Servilius Geminus. The election of praetors was then held.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The persons elected were, Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Publius Quinctilius Varus, Publius Aelius Paetus, and Publius Villius Tappulus. The last two were plebeian aediles when elected praetors.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The elections finished, the consul returned into Etruria to his army. The priests who died this year, and those who were put in their places, were Tiberius Veturius Philo, flamen of Mars, elected and

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> inaugurated in the room of Marcus Aemilius Regillus, who died the year before:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> in the room of Marcus Pomponius Matho, augur and decemvir, were elected Marcus Aurelius Cotta, decemvir, and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, augur, being then a very young man; an instance of very rare occurrence in the disposal of the priests' offices in those times.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Golden four-horsed chariots were placed this year in the Capitol by the curule aediles, Caius Livius and Marcus Servilius Geminus. The Roman games were repeated during two days. During two days also the plebeian games were repeated by the aediles, Publius Aelius and Publius Villius. There was likewise a feast of Jupiter on occasion of the games.</p></div1> <pb id="p.1283" n="1283"/><div1 type="book" n="30"><head>BOOK XXX.</head>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>CNEIUS SERVILIUS and Caius Servilius Geminus, the consuls in the sixteenth year of the Punic war, having consulted the senate respecting the state, the war, and the provinces, they decreed that the consuls should arrange between themselves, or draw

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> lots, which of them should have the province of Bruttium, to act against Hannibal, and which that of Etruria and Liguria; that the consul to whose lot Bruttium fell should receive the army from Publius Sempronius;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that Publius Sempronius, who was continued in command as proconsul for a year, should succeed Publius Licinius, who was to return to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In addition to the other qualifications with which he was adorned in a degree surpassed by no citizen of that time, for in him were accumulated all the perfections of nature and fortune, Licinius was also esteemed eminent in war. He was at once a man of noble family and great wealth; possessing a fine person and great bodily strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was considered an orator of the highest order, both in respect of judicial eloquence, and also when engaged in promoting or opposing any measure in the senate, or before the people. He was also accurately skilled in the pontifical law.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In addition to all these recommendations, the consulship enabled him to acquire military glory. The senate adopted the same course in the decree with respect to the province of Etruria and Li- <pb id="p.1284" n="1284"/>guria as had been observed with regard to Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcus Cornelius was ordered to deliver his army to the new consul, and with continued command to hold himself the province of Gaul, with those legions which the praetor Lucius Scribonius had commanded the former year.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls then cast lots for their provinces: Bruttium fell to the lot of Caepio, Etruria to the lot of Servilius Geminus.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The provinces of the praetors were then put to the lot. Paetus Aelius obtained the city jurisdiction; Publius Lentulus, Sardinia; Publius Villius, Sicily; Quinctilius Varus, Ariminum, with two legions which had served under Lucretius Spurius.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Lucretius also was continued in command that he might complete the building of the town of Genoa, which had been destroyed by Mago the Carthaginian. Publius Scipio was continued in command for a period not limited in point of time, but the object he had to achieve, namely, till the war in Africa had been brought to a termination;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and a decree was passed, ordering a supplication to be made that the circumstance of his crossing over into Africa might be beneficial to the Roman people, the general himself, and his army.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Three thousand men were enlisted for Sicily, and lest any fleet should go thither from Africa, as all the efficient troops that province had possessed had been transported into Africa, it was resolved that the sea-coast of that island should be guarded with forty ships. Villius took with him into Sicily thirteen ships, the rest consisted of the old ones, which were repaired.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcus Pomponius, the praetor of the former year, who was continued in command, having been placed at the head of this fleet, put on board the fresh soldiers brought from Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate assigned by a decree an equal number of ships to Cneius Octavius, who was also a praetor of the former year, with a similar privilege of command, for the protection of the coast of Sardinia.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lentulus the praetor was ordered to furnish two thousand soldiers to put on board it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The protection of the coast of Italy was assigned to Marcus Marcius, a praetor of the former year, with the same number of ships; for it was uncertain to what quarter the Carthaginians would send a fleet, though it was supposed that they would attack any quarter which was destitute of defence.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls, in conformity with a decree of the senate, enlisted three thousand soldiers for this fleet, and two city legions with a view to the <pb id="p.1285" n="1285"/>hazards of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Spains were assigned to the former generals, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, who were continued in command, and retained their former armies. The operations of the war on the part of the Romans this year were carried on with twenty legions in all, and one hundred and sixty ships of war. The praetors were ordered to proceed to their provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Directions were given to the consuls, that before they left the city they should celebrate the great games which Titus Manlius Torquatus, when dictator, had vowed to be exhibited in the fifth year, if the condition of the state remained unaltered.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accounts of prodigies brought from several places excited fresh superstitious fears in the minds of men. It was believed that crows had not only torn with their beaks some gold in the Capitol, but had even eaten it. At Antium mice gnawed a golden crown.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> An immense quantity of locusts filled the whole country around Capua, nor could it be made appear satisfactorily whence they came. At Reate a foal was produced with five feet.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At Anagnia at first scattered fires appeared in the sky, afterwards a vast meteor blazed forth. At Frusino a circle surrounded the sun with a thin line, which was itself afterwards included within the sun's disc which extended beyond it.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At Arpinum the earth sank into an immense gulf, in a place where the ground was level. When one of the consuls was immolating the first victim, the head of the liver was wanting.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These prodigies were expiated with victims of the larger kind. The college of pontiffs gave out to what gods sacrifice was to be made.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After these matters were finished, the consuls and praetors set out for their provinces. All, however, made Africa the great object of their concern, as though it had been allotted to them; whether it was because they saw that the welfare of the state and the issue of the war turned upon the operations there, or that they might oblige Scipio, on whom the whole state was then intent.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, not only from Sardinia, as has been before mentioned, but from Sicily also and Spain, clothing and corn, and from Sicily arms also, together with every kind of stores, were conveyed thither.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor did Scipio at any time during the winter relax in any of the various military operations in which he was engaged on all sides. He continued the siege of Utica. His camp was within sight of Hasdrubal. The Carthaginians had launched <pb id="p.1286" n="1286"/>their ships, and had a fleet prepared and equipped to intercept his supplies.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Amid these occupations he had not even lost sight of his endeavours to regain the friendship of Syphax, whose passion for his bride he thought might now perhaps have become satiated from unlimited enjoyment.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From Syphax he received terms of peace with the Carthaginians, with proposals that the Romans should evacuate Africa, and the Carthaginians Italy, rather than any ground of hope that he would desert their cause if the war proceeded.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For my part I am of opinion, and in this I am countenanced by the majority of writers, that these negotiations were carried on through messengers, rather than that Syphax himself came to the Roman camp to hold a conference, as Antias Valerius relates.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first the Roman general scarcely allowed these terms to be mentioned, but afterwards, in order that there might exist a plausible pretext for his emissaries to go frequently into the camp of the enemy, he rejected these same terms in a more qualified manner, holding out a hope that they might eventually come to an agreement by agitating the question on both sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The winter huts of the Carthaginians, which were constructed from materials hastily collected out of the fields, were almost entirely of wood. The Numidians, particularly, lay for the most part in huts formed of interwoven reeds, and covered with mats, dispersed up and down without any regard to order;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> while some of them, having chosen the situations for their tents without waiting for orders, lay even without the trench and rampart.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> These circumstances having been reported to Scipio, gave him hopes that he might have an opportunity of burning the enemy's camp.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In company with the ambassadors whom he sent to Syphax, he also sent some centurions of the first rank, of tried valour and prudence, dressed as servants, in lieu of soldiers' drudges;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in order that, while the ambassadors were engaged in conference, they might ramble through the camp, one in one direction and another in another, and thus observe all the approaches and outlets, the situation and form both of the camp in general and of its parts; where the Carthaginians lay, where the Numidians, and what was the distance between the camp of Hasdrubal and that of the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that they might at the same time acquaint themselves with their customary mode of stationing outposts and watches, and learn <pb id="p.1287" n="1287"/>whether they were more open to stratagem by night or by day. During the frequent conferences which were held, several different persons were purposely sent, in order that every circumstance might be known to a greater number.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the more frequent agitation of the matter had given to Syphax a daily increasing hope of peace, and to the Carthaginians through him, the Roman ambassadors at length declared that they were forbidden to return to their

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> general unless a decisive answer was given, and that, therefore, if his own determination was now fixed, he should declare it, or if Hasdrubal and the Carthaginians were to be consulted, he should consult them. That it was time either that an accommodation should be settled or the war vigorously prosecuted.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While Hasdrubal was consulted by Syphax, and the Carthaginians by Hasdrubal, the spies had time to inspect every thing, and Scipio to get together what was necessary for the accomplishment of his project.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In consequence of the mention and prospect of a peace, neglect arose among the Carthaginians and Numidians, as is usually the case, to take precautions in the mean time that they might not suffer an attack of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At length an answer was returned; and as the Romans appeared excessively eager for peace, advantage was taken of that circumstance to add certain unreasonable conditions, which afforded Scipio a very seasonable pretext for putting an end to the truce according to his wishes; and telling the king's messenger that he would refer the matter to his council, he answered him the next day.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He said, that while he alone had in vain endeavoured to restore peace, no one else had desired it. That he must, therefore, carry word back that Syphax must hope for peace on no other condition than his abandonment of the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus he put an end to the truce, in order that he might be free to execute his designs without breaking his faith; and, launching his ships, for it was now the beginning of spring, he put on board machines and engines, with the purpose of assaulting Utica from the sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He also sent two thousand men to seize the eminence which commanded that place, and which he had before occupied, at once with the view of turning the attention of the enemy from the design he was endeavouring

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> to effect to another object of concern, <pb id="p.1288" n="1288"/>and to prevent any sally or attack which might be made from the city upon his camp, which would be left with a slight force to protect it, while he himself went against Syphax and Hasdrubal.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having made these preparations, he called a council, and after ordering the spies to give an account of the discoveries they had made, and requesting Masinissa, who was acquainted with every circumstance relating to the enemy, to state what he knew, lastly, he himself laid before the council the plan proposed for the following night.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He gave directions to the tribunes, that when, after the breaking up of the council, the trumpets had sounded, they should immediately march the legions out of the camp. Agreeably to his commands, the standards began to be carried out about sun-set.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the first watch they formed the troops in marching order. At midnight, for it was seven miles' march, they came up at a moderate pace to the camp of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Here Scipio assigned a part of his forces, together with Masinissa and the Numidians, to Laelius, ordering them to fall upon the camp of Syphax, and throw fire upon it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then taking each of the commanders, Masinissa and Laelius, aside, he implored them separately to make up by diligence and care for the absence of that foresight which the night rendered it impossible to exercise.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He said, that he should himself attack Hasdrubal and the Carthaginian camp; but that he should not begin till he saw the fire in that of the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor did this delay him long; for when the fire thrown upon the nearest huts had taken effect, immediately communicating with all those which were within the shortest distance, and those connected with them in regular succession, it spread itself throughout the whole camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The confusion and alarm which took place, in consequence of so widely extended a fire breaking out during the night, were as great as might naturally be expected; but as they concluded that it was the effect of chance, and not produced by the enemy, or connected with the war, they rushed out in a disorderly manner, without their arms, to extinguish the

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> flames, and fell in with armed enemies, particularly the Numidians, who on account of their knowledge of the king's camp were placed by Masinissa in convenient places at the openings of the passes.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Many perished in the <pb id="p.1289" n="1289"/>flames in their beds while half asleep; and many, tumbling over one another in their haste to escape, were trampled to death in the narrow passages of the gates.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When first the Carthaginian sentinels, and afterwards the rest, roused by the terrifying effects of a tumult by night, beheld the light emitted from the flames, they also, labouring under the same delusion, imagined that the fire had originated from accidental causes;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> while the shout raised amidst the slaughter and wounds, being of a confused kind, prevented their distinguishing whether it was occasioned by the trepidation of an alarm by night.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, rushing out one and all at every gate, each man taking the nearest road, without their arms, as not suspecting any hostile attack, and carrying with them only such things as might be useful in extinguishing the flames, they fell upon the Roman troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After all these had been slain, not only with the animosity of enemies, but also that no one might escape as a messenger, Scipio immediately attacked the gates, which were unguarded in consequence of the confusion;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and, having thrown fire upon the nearest huts, at first the flames blazed forth with great fury, in several places at once, in consequence of the fire having been applied to different parts, but afterwards extending themselves along the contiguous huts, they suddenly enveloped the whole camp in one general conflagration.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Men and cattle scorched with the flames blocked up the passages of the gates, first in a terrible rush to escape, and afterwards with their prostrate bodies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those who got out of the way of the fire were cut off by the sword, and the two camps were involved in one common destruction. The two generals, however, and out of so many thousand troops only two thousand foot and five hundred horsemen, escaped, half armed, a great many of them being wounded and scorched.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Forty thousand men were either slain or destroyed by the flames, and above five thousand captured.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Among the captured were many Carthaginian nobles, eleven senators, with a hundred and seventy-four military standards, above two thousand seven hundred Numidian horses, and six elephants. Eight elephants were destroyed either by fire or sword, and a great quantity of arms taken. All the latter the general dedicated to Vulcan and burnt.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal, in his flight, had made for the nearest city <pb id="p.1290" n="1290"/>of the Africans, accompanied by a few attendants; and hither all those who survived, following the footsteps of their general, had betaken themselves. But afterwards, fearing lest he should be given up to Scipio, he quitted that city.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Soon after, the Romans were received there with open gates; nor was any act of hostility committed, because the inhabitants had surrendered voluntarily. Shortly after, two other cities were captured and plundered. The booty found there, together with what had been rescued from the camps when burning, and from the flames, was given up to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Syphax took up a position in a fortified place about eight miles off. Hasdrubal hastened to Carthage, lest the apprehensions occasioned by the recent disaster should lead to any timorous measures.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So great was the consternation created there on the first receipt of the news, that it was fully anticipated that Scipio, suspending his operations against Utica, would immediately lay siege to Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The suffetes, therefore, who form with them an authority similar to the consular, summoned the senate, when the three following opinions were given.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The first proposed, that a decree should be passed to the effect, that ambassadors should be sent to Scipio to treat of peace; the second, that Hannibal should be recalled to defend his country from a war which threatened its annihilation; the third breathed the spirit of Roman constancy under adversity; it recommended that the losses of the army should be repaired, and that Syphax should be exhorted not to abandon the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The latter opinion prevailed, because it was that which Hasdrubal, who was present, and all the members of the Barcine faction, preferred.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After this, the levy commenced in the city and country, and ambassadors were despatched to Syphax, who was himself employing every effort to restore the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for his wife had prevailed upon him, not, as heretofore, by caresses, powerful as they are in influencing the mind of a lover, but by prayers and appeals to his compassion, imploring him, with streaming eyes, not to betray her father and her country, nor suffer Carthage to be consumed by the same flames which had reduced the camps to ashes.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In addition to this, the ambassadors informed him of a circumstance which had occurred very seasonably to raise their hopes; that they had met with four thousand Celtiberians in the neighbourhood of a city named Abba, a fine body of young <pb id="p.1291" n="1291"/>men who had been enlisted by their recruiting officers in Spain; and that Hasdrubal would very soon arrive with a body of troops by no means contemptible.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly, he not only returned a kind answer to the ambassadors, but also showed them a multitude of Numidian rustics, whom he had lately furnished with arms and horses; and at the same time assured them that he would call out all the youth in his kingdom.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He said, he well knew that the loss sustained had been occasioned by fire, and not by battle, and that he was inferior to his adversary in war who was overcome by force of arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Such was the answer given to the ambassadors; and, after a few days, Hasdrubal and Syphax again united their forces. This army consisted of about thirty-five thousand fighting men.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, considering that Syphax and the Carthaginians could make no further efforts, gave his whole attention to the siege of Utica, and was now bringing up his engines to the walls, when he was diverted from his purpose by a report of the renewal of the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and, leaving small forces merely to keep up the appearence of a siege by sea and land, he set out himself with the main strength of his army to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first he took up his position on an eminence about five miles distant from the king's camp. The next day, coming down with his cavalry into a place called the great plains, which lay at the foot of that eminence, he spent the day in advancing up to the outposts of the enemy, and provoking them by skirmishing attacks.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> During the ensuing two days, irregular excursions were made by both sides alternately, but nothing worthy of notice was achieved. On the fourth day, both sides came down in battle-array.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans placed their principes behind the spearmen, which latter formed the front line, and the triarii they stationed in reserve; the Italian cavalry they opposed to the enemy in the right wing, the Numidians and Masinissa on the left.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Syphax and Hasdrubal, placing the Numidians against the Italian cavalry, and the Carthaginians opposite to Masinissa, received the Celtiberians into the centre of their line, to face the Roman legions. Thus arranged, they then commenced the encounter.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the first charge, both the wings, the Numidians and Carthaginians, were together driven from their ground; for neither could the Numidians, who consisted principally of rustics, sustain <pb id="p.1292" n="1292"/>the shock of the Roman cavalry, nor the Carthaginians, who were also raw soldiers, withstand Masinissa, who, in addition to other circumstances, was rendered formidable by his recent victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Celtiberian line, though stript of the support of both the wings, stood their ground; for neither did any hope of safety by flight present itself, as they were ignorant of the country, nor could they expect pardon from Scipio, against whom, though he had deserved well both of them and their nation, they had come into Africa to fight for hire.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Surrounded, therefore, on all sides by the enemy, they died with obstinate resolution, falling one upon another; and, while the attention of all was turned upon them, Syphax and Hasdrubal gained a considerable space of time to effect their escape. The victors, fatigued with the slaughter, which had continued for a greater length of time than the battle, were interrupted by the night.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day Scipio sent Laelius and Masinissa, with all the Roman and Numidian cavalry, and the light infantry, to pursue Syphax and Hasdrubal.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He himself, with the main strength of the army, reduced the neighbouring towns, which were all subject to the Carthaginians, some by holding out hopes to them, some by threats, and others by force.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Carthage, indeed, the consternation was extreme; and it was fully anticipated there, that Scipio, who was carrying his arms to the different places around, would, after having rapidly subdued all the neighbouring parts, suddenly attack Carthage itself.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their walls were repaired and protected with outworks; and every man individually exerted himself to the utmost in collecting from the country the requisites for holding out against a protracted siege.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Mention was seldom made of peace, but not so seldom of sending deputies to recall Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The majority of them urged that the fleet, which had been equipped to intercept the convoys of the enemy, should be sent to surprise the ships stationed near Utica, which were lying in an unguarded state. It was also urged that they might perhaps overpower the naval camp, which was left under the protection of a trifling force.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They chiefly inclined to the latter plan, though they thought, nevertheless, that deputies should be sent to Hannibal;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for should the operations of the fleet succeed in the highest degree, the siege of Utica would be partially raised, but they had no general <pb id="p.1293" n="1293"/>remaining but Hannibal, and no army but his which could defend Carthage itself.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The ships were therefore launched the following day, and, at the same time, the deputies set out for Italy; and, their position stimulating them, every thing was done with the greatest expedition; each man considering, that the safety of all was betrayed in whatever degree he remitted his own individual exertions.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Scipio, who drew after him an army now encumbered with the spoils of many cities, sent his prisoners, and other booty, to his old camp at Utica, and, as his views were now fixed on Carthage, he seized on Tunes, which was abandoned in consequence of the flight of the garrison.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This city is about fifteen miles distant from Carthage, being a place secured both by works, and also by its own natural position;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> it may be seen from Carthage, and itself affords a prospect both of that city and of the sea which washes it.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>






















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From this place the Romans, while diligently employed in raising a rampart, descried the fleet of the enemy, on its way to Utica from Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Desisting from their work, therefore, orders for marching were given, and the troops began to move with the utmost haste, lest the ships which were turned towards the land, and occupied with the siege, and which were far from being in a condition for a naval battle, should be surprised and overpowered.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For how could ships, carrying engines and machines, and either converted to the purposes of transports, or brought up to the walls so as to afford the means of mounting up, in lieu of a mound and bridges, resist a fleet, with nothing to impede its movements, furnished with every kind of naval implement, and prepared for action.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Scipio, therefore, contrary to his usual practice in naval engagements, drew the ships of war, which might have been employed in defending the rest, into the rear, and formed them into a line near the land; opposing to the enemy a row of transports, four deep, to serve as a wall;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and, lest these same transports should be thrown into disorder during the confusion of the battle, he bound them together by placing masts and yard-arms across them, from one vessel to the other; and, by means of strong ropes, fastened them together, as it were, by one uninterrupted bond.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He also laid planks upon them, so as to form a free passage along the line, leaving spaces under these bridges of communication by which the <pb id="p.1294" n="1294"/>vessels of observation might run out towards the enemy, and retreat with safety. Having hastily made these arrangements, as well as the time would permit, he put on board the transports about a thousand picked men, to keep off

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the enemy, with a very large store of weapons, particularly missiles, that they might hold out, however long the contest lasted. Thus prepared, and on the watch, they waited the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Carthaginians, who, if they had made haste, would, on the first assault, have surprised their adversaries while every thing was in a state of confusion, from the hurry and bustle attending the preparations, were so dismayed at their losses by land, and thereby

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> had lost so much confidence even in their strength by sea, in which they had the advantage, that, after consuming the day, in consequence of the slow rate at which they sailed, about sun-set they put in to a harbour which the Africans call Ruscino.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The following day, at sun-rise, they drew up their ships towards the open sea, as for a regular naval battle, and with the expectation that the Romans would come out to engage them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After they had continued stationary for some time, and saw that no movement was made on the part of the enemy, then, at length, they attacked the transports.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The affair bore no resemblance to a naval fight, but rather had the appearance of ships attacking walls. The transports had considerably the advantage in respect of height;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and as the Carthaginians had to throw their weapons upward, against a mark which was above them, most of them failed of taking effect; while the weapons thrown from the transports from above fell with increased force, and derived additional impetus from their very weight.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The vessels of observation, and even the lighter kind of barks, which went out through the spaces left under the flooring, which formed a communication between the ships, were at first run down by the mere momentum and bulk of the ships of war;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and afterwards they proved a hinderance to the troops appointed to keep the enemy off; for as they mixed with the ships of the enemy, they were frequently under the necessity of withholding their weapons for fear, by a misdirected effort, they

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> should fall on their friends.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> At length, beams with iron hooks at their ends, called harpoons, began to be thrown from the Carthaginian upon the Roman ships; and, as they could not cut the harpoons themselves, <pb id="p.1295" n="1295"/>nor the chains suspended by which they were thrown upon their ships, as each of the ships of war of the enemy, being pulled

<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> back, drew with it a transport, connected with it by a harpoon, you might see the fastenings by which the transports were joined together rent asunder, and in another part a series of many vessels dragged away together.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> In this manner chiefly were all the bridges of communication torn to pieces, and scarcely had the troops who fought in front time to leap to the second line of ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> About six transports were towed away to Carthage, where the joy felt was greater than the occasion warranted; but their delight was increased from the reflection, that, in the midst of so many successive disasters and woes, one event, however trifling, which afforded matter of joy, had unexpectedly occurred;

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> besides which, it was manifest that the Roman fleet would have been well nigh annihilated, had not their own commanders been wanting in diligence, and had not Scipio come up to its assistance in time.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It happened about the same time, that Laelius and Masinissa having arrived in Numidia after a march of about fifteen days, the Massylians, Masinissa's hereditary kingdom, placed themselves under the protection of their king with the greatest joy, as they had long wished him among them.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the commanders and garrisons of Syphax had been expelled from thence, that prince kept himself within the limits of his original dominions, but without any intention of remaining quiet.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Subdued by the power of love, he was spurred on by his wife and father-in-law; and he possessed such an abundance of men and horses, that a review of the resources of his kingdom, which had flourished for so many years, was calculated to infuse spirit into a mind even less barbarous and impetuous than his.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherefore, collecting together all who were fit for service, he distributed among them horses, armour, and weapons. He divided his horsemen into troops, and his infantry into cohorts, as he had formerly learnt from the Roman centurions.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> With an army not less than that which he had before, but almost entirely raw and undisciplined, he set out to meet the enemy, and pitched his camp at a short distance from them.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first a few horsemen advanced cautiously from the outposts to reconnoitre, and being compelled to retire, from a discharge of javelins, they ran <pb id="p.1296" n="1296"/>back to their friends. Then skirmishing parties were sent out from both sides, and the vanquished, fired with indignation, returned to the encounter with increased numbers.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This is the usual incitement of battles between cavalry, when the victors are joined by more of their party from hope, and the vanquished from resentment.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus, on the present occasion, the action commencing with a few, at last the whole body of the cavalry on both sides poured out to join in it, from the zeal excited by the contest. While the cavalry only were engaged, it was scarcely possible to withstand the numbers of the Masaesylians, which Syphax sent out in immense bodies.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But afterwards, when the Roman infantry, suddenly coming up between the troops of horse which made way for them, gave stability to their line, and checked the enemy, who were charging furiously, at first the barbarians slackened their speed, then halted, and were in a manner confounded at this novel kind of battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At length, they not only retired before the infantry, but were unable to sustain the shock even of the cavalry, who had assumed courage from the support of the infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> By this time the legions also were approaching; when, indeed, the Masaesylians not only dared not await their first charge, but could not bear even the sight of the standards and arms; so powerful was either the recollection of their former defeats, or their present fears.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>























<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was then that Syphax, while riding up to the troops of the enemy to try if, either by shame or by exposing his own person to danger, he could stop their flight, being thrown from his horse, which was severely wounded, was overpowered, and being made prisoner, was dragged alive into the presence of Laelius;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> a spectacle calculated to afford peculiar satisfaction to Masinissa.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Cirta was the capital of the dominions of Syphax; to which a great number of men fled.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The number of the slain in this battle was not so great as the victory was important, because the cavalry only had been engaged.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Not more than five thousand were slain, and less than half that number were made prisoners in an attack upon the camp, to which the multitude, dismayed at the loss of their king, had fled.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Masinissa declared that nothing could be more highly gratifying to him than, having gained this victory, to go now and visit his hereditary dominions, <pb id="p.1297" n="1297"/>which he had regained after having been kept out of them so long a time; but it was not proper in prosperity any more than in adversity to lose any time.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That if Laelius would allow him to go before him to Cirta with the cavalry and the captive Syphax, he should overpower the enemy while all was in a state of consternation and dismay; and that Laelius might follow with the infantry at a moderate rate.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Laelius assenting, he advanced to Cirta, and ordered the principal inhabitants to be called out to a conference. But as they were not aware of what had befallen their king, he was unable to prevail upon them, either by laying before them what had passed, by threats, or by persuasion, until the king was presented to their view in chains.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A general lamentation arose at this shocking exhibition, and while some deserted the walls in a panic, others, who sought to ingratiate themselves with the victor, suddenly came to an agreement to throw open the gates.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Masinissa, having sent troops to keep guard near the gates, and at such parts of the wall as required it, that no one might have a passage out to escape by, galloped off to seize the palace.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While entering the porch, Sophonisba, the wife of Syphax and daughter of Hasdrubal the Carthaginian, met him in the very threshold, and seeing Masinissa in the midst of the armed band, for he was distinguished both by his arms and also by his habiliments, she concluded, as was really the case, that he was the king; and, falling down at his knees, thus addressed him:

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>The gods, together with your own valour and good fortune, have given you the power of disposing of us as you please.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But if a captive may be allowed to give utterance to the voice of supplication before him who is the sovereign arbiter of her life or death; if she may be permitted to touch his knees and his victorious right hand, I entreat and beseech you by the majesty of royalty, which we also a short time ago possessed; by the name of the Numidian race, which was common to Syphax and yourself; by the guardian deities of this palace, (and O! may they receive you more auspiciously than they sent Syphax from it!)

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> that you would indulge a suppliant by determining yourself whatever your inclination may suggest respecting your captive, and not suffer me to be placed at the haughty and merciless disposal of any Roman.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Were I nothing more than the wife of Syphax, yet would I rather make trial of the honour of a Numidian, <pb id="p.1298" n="1298"/>one born in Africa, the same country which gave me birth, than of a foreigner and an alien.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> You know what a Carthaginian, what the daughter of Hasdrubal, has to fear from a Roman. If you cannot effect it by any other means, I beg and beseech you that you will by my death rescue me from the power of the Romans.</quote> She was remarkably beautiful, and in the full bloom of youth.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Accordingly, while she pressed his right hand, and only implored him to pledge himself that she should not be delivered up to any Roman, her language assuming the character of amorous blandishment rather than

<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> entreaty, the heart of the conqueror not only melted with compassion, but, as the Numidians are an excessively amorous race, he became the slave of his captive; and giving his right hand as a pledge for the performance of her request, withdrew into the palace.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> He then set upon reflecting in what manner he could make good his promise; and not being able to hit upon any expedient, his passion suggested to him an inconsiderate and barefaced alternative.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> He ordered that preparations should be instantly made for celebrating the nuptials that very day; in order that he might not leave it at all open to Laelius, or Scipio himself, to adopt any measure respecting her as a captive who had become the wife of Masinissa.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> After the nuptials were concluded, Laelius came up; and so far was he from dissembling his disapprobation of the proceeding, that at first he would even have had her dragged from the marriage bed and sent with Syphax and the rest of the captives to Scipio:

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> but afterwards, having been prevailed upon by the entreaties of Masinissa, who begged of him to leave it to Scipio to decide which of the two kings should have his fortunes graced by the accession of Sophonisba, he sent away Syphax and the prisoners; and, aided by Masinissa, employed himself in reducing the rest of the cities of Numidia, which were occupied by the king's garrisons.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When it was announced that Syphax was being brought into the camp, the whole multitude poured out, as if to behold a triumphal pageant.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king himself walked first in chains, and a number of Numidian nobles followed. On this occasion every one strove to the utmost to increase the splendour of their victory, by magnifying the greatness of Syphax and the renown of his nation.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>That was the king,</quote> they said, <quote>to whose dignity the two most powerful nations in the <pb id="p.1299" n="1299"/>world, the Roman and the Carthaginian, had paid so much deference, that their own general, Scipio, leaving his province of Spain and his army, sailed into Africa with only two quinqueremes

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> to solicit his friendship; while Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian general, not only visited him in his dominions, but gave him his daughter in marriage.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That he had in his power two commanders, one a Roman and the other a Carthaginian, at the same time.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That as both the contending parties sought the favour of the immortal gods by the immolation of victims, so had they both equally solicited his friendship.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That he had lately possessed such great power, that after expelling Masinissa from his kingdom, he reduced him to such a state, that his life was protected by a report of his death, and by concealment, while he supported himself in the woods on prey, after the manner of wild beasts.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus signalized by the observations of the surrounding multitude, the king was brought into the pavilion before Scipio, who was moved by the former condition of the man compared with his present, and particularly by the recollection of their relation of hospitality, his right hand pledged, and the public and private connexion which had been formed between them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These same considerations inspired Syphax also with confidence in addressing the conqueror; for when Scipio asked what had been his object in not only renouncing his alliance with the Romans, but in making war against them without provocation, he fully admitted <quote>that he had indeed done wrong, and acted like a madman; but not at that time only when he took up arms against the Roman people; that was the consummation of his frenzy, not its commencement.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then it was that he was mad;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> then it was that he banished from his mind all regard for private friendship and public treaties, when he received a Carthaginian wife into his house.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was by the flames kindled by those nuptial torches that his palace had been consumed. That fury and pest had by every kind of fascination engrossed his affections and obscured his reason; nor had she rested till she had with her own hands clad him with impious arms against his guest and friend.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Yet ruined and fallen as he was, he derived some consolation in his misfortunes when he saw that that same pest and fury had been transferred to the dwelling and household gods of the man who was of all others his greatest enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> That Masinissa <pb id="p.1300" n="1300"/>was neither more prudent nor more firm than Syphax; but even more incautious by reason of his youth. Doubtless he had shown greater folly and want of self-control in marrying her than he himself had.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These words, dictated not merely by the hatred naturally felt towards an enemy, but also by the anguish of jealousy, on seeing the object of his affections in the possession of his rival, affected the mind of Scipio with no ordinary degree of anxiety.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His accusations against Masinissa derived credibility from the fact of the nuptials having been celebrated in the most violent hurry, almost amid the clash of arms, without consulting or waiting for Laelius, and with such precipitate haste, that on the very day on which he saw the captive enemy he united himself with her in matrimony, and performed the nuptial rite in the presence of the household gods of his enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This conduct appeared the more heinous to Scipio, because when a very young man in Spain he had not allowed himself to be influenced by the beauty of any captive. While ruminating on these circumstances, Laelius and Masinissa came up.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Without making any distinction between them he received them both with a cheerful countenance, and having bestowed upon them the highest commendations before a full assembly of his officers, he took Masinissa aside and thus addressed him: <quote>I suppose, Masinissa, that it was because you saw in me some good qualities that you at first came to me when in Spain, for the purpose of forming a friendship with me, and that afterwards in Africa you committed yourself and all your hopes to my protection.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But of all those virtues, on account of which I seemed to you worthy of your regard, there is not one in which I gloried so much as temperance and the control of my passions. I could wish that you also, Masinissa, had added this to your other distinguished qualities.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There is not, believe me, there is not so much danger to be apprehended by persons at our time of life from armed foes, as from the pleasures which surround us on all sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The man who by temperance has curbed and subdued his appetite for them, has acquired for himself much greater honour and a much more important victory than we now enjoy in the conquest of Syphax.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I have mentioned with delight, and I remember with pleasure, the instances of fortitude and courage which you displayed in my absence. As to <pb id="p.1301" n="1301"/>other matters, I would rather that you should reflect upon them in private, than that you should be put to the blush by my reciting them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Syphax was subdued and captured under the auspices of the Roman people; therefore he himself, his wife, his kingdom, his territories, his towns and their inhabitants, in short, every thing which belonged to him, is the booty of the Roman people, and it

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> was proper that the king himself and his consort, even though she had not been a citizen of Carthage, even though we did not see her father commanding the armies of our enemies, should be sent to Rome, and that the senate and people of Rome should judge and determine respecting her who is said to have alienated from us a king in alliance with us, and to have precipitated him into war with us.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Subdue your passions. Beware how you deform many good qualities by one vice, and mar the credit of so many meritorious deeds by a degree of guilt more than proportioned to the value of its object.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Masinissa heard these observations, he not only became suffused with blushes, but burst into tears; and after declaring that he would submit to the discretion of the general, and imploring him that, as far as circumstances would permit, he would consider the obligation

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> he had rashly imposed upon himself, for he had promised that he would not deliver her into the power of any one, he retired in confusion from the pavilion into his own tent.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, dismissing his attendants, he spent a considerable time amid frequent sighs and groans, which could be distinctly heard by those who stood around the tent.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At last, heaving a deep groan, he called one of his servants in whom he confided, in whose custody poison was kept, according to the custom of kings, as a remedy against the unforeseen events of fortune, and ordered him to mix some in a cup and carry it to Sophonisba; at the same time informing her that Masinissa would gladly have fulfilled the first obligation which as a husband he owed to her his wife;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but since those who had the power of doing so had deprived him of the exercise of that right, he now performed his second promise, that she should not come alive into the power of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That, mindful of her father the general, of her country, and of the two kings to whom she had been married, she would take such measures as she herself thought proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the servant came to Sophonisba <pb id="p.1302" n="1302"/>bearing this message and the poison, she said, <quote>I accept this nuptial present; nor is it an unwelcome one, if my husband can render me no better service. Tell him, however, that I should have died with greater satisfaction had I not married so near upon my death.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The spirit with which she spoke was equalled by the firmness with which she took and drained the chalice, without exhibiting any symptom of perturbation.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Scipio was informed of this event, fearful lest the high-spirited young man should in the distempered state of his mind adopt some desperate resolution,

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> he immediately sent for him, and at one time endeavoured to solace him, at another gently rebuked him for expiating one act of temerity with another, and rendering the affair more tragical than was necessary.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day, in order to divert his mind from his present affliction, he ascended his tribunal and ordered an assembly to be summoned, in which having first saluted Masinissa with the title of king, and distinguished him with the highest encomiums, he presented him with a golden goblet, a curule chair, an ivory sceptre, an embroidered gown, and a triumphal vest.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He increased the honour by observing, that among the Romans there was nothing more magnificent than a triumph; and that those who triumphed were not arrayed with more splendid ornaments than those with which the Roman people considered Masinissa alone, of all foreigners, worthy.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He then bestowed the highest commendations upon Laelius also, and presented him with a golden crown, and gave presents to the other military characters proportioned to their respective merits.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> By these honours the king's mind was soothed, and encouraged to hope that he would speedily become master of all Numidia, now that Syphax was removed.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, having sent Caius Laelius with Syphax and the rest of the prisoners to Rome, with whom went also ambassadors from Masinissa, led his troops back again to Tunes, and completed the fortifications which he had before begun.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Carthaginians, who had experienced not only a short-lived but almost groundless joy, from their attack upon the fleet, which, under existing circumstances, was tolerably successful, were so dismayed at the account of the capture of Syphax, in whom they reposed almost greater confidence than in Hasdrubal and his army, that now listening no longer to any who advocated war, they sent thirty of their principal elders as <pb id="p.1303" n="1303"/>deputies to solicit peace. With them the council of elders is held in the highest reverence, and has supreme power even to control the senate itself.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they came into the Roman camp and entered the pavilion, they prostrated themselves after the manner

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> of those who pay profound adoration to kings, adopting the custom, I suppose, from the country from which they derived their origin.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their language corresponded with such abject humiliation, for they did not endeavour to deny their guilt, but charged Hannibal and the favourers of his violent measures with being the originators of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They implored pardon for their state, which had been now twice brought to the brink of ruin by the temerity of its citizens, and would again owe its safety to the indulgence of its enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They said, the object the Roman people aimed at in the subjugation of their enemies was dominion, and not their destruction; that he might enjoin what he pleased upon them, as being prepared submissively to obey.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio replied, <quote>that he had come into Africa with the hope, and that hope had been increased by the success he had experienced in his operations, that he should carry home victory and not terms of peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Still, though he had victory in a manner within his grasp, he would not refuse all accommodation, that all the nations of the world may know that the Roman people both undertake and conclude wars with justice.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The terms of peace which he prescribed were these: <quote>That they should restore the prisoners, deserters, and fugitives; withdraw their armies from Italy and Gaul; give up all claim to Spain; retire from all the islands between Italy and Africa;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> deliver up all their ships of war except twenty, and furnish five hundred thousand pecks of wheat, and three hundred thousand of barley.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Authors are not agreed as to the sum of money he demanded. In some I find five thousand talents; in others five thousand pounds' weight of silver; in others, that double pay for the troops was required.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <quote>Three days,</quote> he said, <quote>shall be allowed to deliberate whether you accept of peace on these terms.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> If you do accept it, make a truce with me, and send deputies to Rome to the senate.</quote> The Carthaginians being thus dismissed, as they thought it proper to accept of any conditions of peace, for their only object was to gain

<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> time for Hannibal to cross over into Africa, sent some ambassadors to Scipio to conclude a truce, and others to Rome <pb id="p.1304" n="1304"/>to solicit peace; the latter taking with them a few prisoners, deserters, and fugitives, in order to facilitate the attainment of peace.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Laelius with Syphax and the principal Numidian prisoners arrived at Rome several days before, and laying before the senate all the transactions which had occurred in Africa in order, the greatest joy was felt for the present, and the most sanguine anticipations formed of the future.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The sense of the senate being then taken upon the subject, they resolved that the king should be sent to Alba to be kept in custody, and that Laelius should be detained until the arrival of the Carthaginian ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A supplication for four days was decreed. The senate breaking up and an assembly of the people being then called, Publius Aelius the praetor, accompanied by Caius Laelius, mounted the rostrum.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There, on hearing that the armies of the Carthaginians had been routed, that a king of the greatest renown had been vanquished and made prisoner, that all

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Numidia had been overrun with brilliant success, the people were unable to refrain from expressing their delight, but manifested their transports by shouts and all the other means usually resorted to by the multitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The praetor, therefore, immediately issued orders that the keepers should open all the temples throughout the city, and that the people should be allowed during the whole day to go round and make their adoration to the gods, and return their thanks.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The next day he brought the ambassadors of Masinissa before the senate. They in the first place congratulated the senate on the successes of Scipio

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> in Africa, and then thanked them, not only for having saluted him with the title of king, but for having made him one, by reinstating him in his paternal dominions, where, now that Syphax was removed, he would reign, if it was the pleasure of the senate, without fear or opposition.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Next, for having bestowed upon him the highest commendations in the assembly, and decorated him with the most magnificent presents, of which Masinissa had endeavoured, and would in future endeavour, to render himself worthy.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They requested that the senate would by a decree confirm the title of king with the other favours and benefits conferred by Scipio, and, if it were not troublesome, they said, that Masinissa further requested that they would send home the Numidian captives who were de- <pb id="p.1305" n="1305"/>tained at Rome;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> for that this boon would procure him the esteem and honour of his countrymen.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On these points the senate replied to the ambassadors, <quote>that they reciprocated the congratulations of the king on the successes in Africa. That Scipio was considered to have acted properly and regularly in saluting him with the title of king, and that the senate applauded and approved of every thing else he had done which was gratifying to Masinissa.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They appointed by a decree what presents the ambassadors should carry to the king; they were, two purple cloaks, each having a golden clasp, and each accompanied with vests and broad purple borders, two horses arrayed with trappings, two suits of equestrian armour with coats of mail, together with tents and other military apparatus such as those usually provided for a consul. These the praetor was directed to send for the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The ambassadors were severally presented with not less than five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi> their attendants with one thousand. Two suits of apparel were presented to each of the ambassadors, and one to each of their attendants and to the Numidians, who were discharged from custody and given back to the king. In addition to these, dwellings, reserved by the state for such purposes, grounds, and entertainment, were assigned to the ambassadors.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same summer during which these decrees were passed at Rome, and these transactions took place in Africa, Publius Quinctilius Varus, the praetor, and Marcus Cornelius, the proconsul, fought a pitched battle with Mago the Carthaginian in the territories of the Insubrian Gauls.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The legions of the praetor were in the first line; Cornelius kept his in reserve, riding forward into the front himself, and the praetor and proconsul, leading on the two wings, exhorted the soldiers to attack the enemy with the utmost vigour.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Finding they produced no impression upon the enemy, Quinctilius said to Cornelius: <quote>The battle, as you perceive, does not proceed with spirit, the enemy, having succeeded in their resistance beyond expectation, have become callous to fear, and there is danger lest it should be converted into boldness.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> We must stir up a tempest of cavalry if we wish to disorder and drive them from their ground; therefore, either do you sustain the fight in front, and I will lead the cavalry into the action; or else, I will act in the front line and you send out <pb id="p.1306" n="1306"/>the cavalry of the four legions against the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The proconsul offering to take whichever part of the service the praetor pleased, Quinctilius the praetor, with his son, surnamed Marcus, a spirited youth, went off to the cavalry, and desiring them to mount, instantly led them to the charge. The confusion occasioned by these was increased by a shout raised by the legions;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> nor would the line of the enemy have stood unbroken, had not Mago, as soon as he saw the cavalry in motion, immediately brought into the action his elephants, which he kept in readiness. The horses were so terrified at the snorting, the smell, and appearance of these animals, that the aid of the cavalry was rendered ineffectual.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As the Roman horseman had the advantage in point of efficiency in a close fight, when he could use his javelin and sword hand to hand, so the Numidians had the advantage when throwing their darts from a distance upon enemies borne away from them by their terrified horses.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the same time the twelfth legion, though a great number of them were slain, maintained their ground through shame rather than a reliance on their strength;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but they would not have continued to do so longer, had not the thirteenth legion, brought up into the front line from the reserve, taken up the doubtful conflict. Mago, also, bringing up the Gauls from his reserve, opposed them to the fresh legion.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Gauls being routed without any great effort, the spearmen of the eleventh legion formed themselves into a circular body and charged the elephants, which were now disordering the line of infantry;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and as scarcely one of the javelins which they threw upon them failed of taking effect, as they were close together, they turned them all upon the line of their own party.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Four of them fell overpowered with wounds. It was then that the front line of the enemy gave ground, the whole body of the Roman infantry at the same time rushing forward to increase the panic and confusion, on seeing the elephants turn their backs.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As long as Mago stood in front, the troops stepped back slowly, preserving their ranks and not relaxing their ardour in fighting; but when they saw him falling, from a wound in his thigh, which was transfixed, and carried off the field almost lifeless, in an instant they all betook themselves to flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As many as five thousand of the enemy were slain, and twenty-two military standards captured on that day. Nor did the Romans obtain <pb id="p.1307" n="1307"/>a bloodless victory. Two thousand three hundred of the army of the praetor, by far the greater part of whom belonged to the twelfth legion, were lost.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Two military tribunes, Marcus Cosconius and Marcus Maenius, of the same legion; and of the thirteenth legion also, which joined in the action at its close, Cneius Helvius, a military tribune, fell in restoring the fight; and about twenty-two distinguished horsemen, together with several centurions, were trampled upon and killed by the elephants. The contest would have continued longer, had not the enemy conceded the victory, in consequence of the wound of their general.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mago, setting out during the silence of the succeeding night, and marching as far at a time as his wounds would allow him, reached the sea-coast in the territory of the Ingaunian Ligurians.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Here ambassadors from Carthage, who had put into the Gallic bay a few days before, came to him with directions to cross over into Africa with all speed;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> informing him that his brother Hannibal, for to him also they said ambassadors had gone with similar directions, would do the same, for the affairs of the Carthaginians were not in a condition to admit of their occupying Gaul and Italy with armies.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mago, not only influenced by the command of the senate and the danger which threatened his country, but fearful also lest the victorious enemy should be upon him if he delayed, and lest the Ligurians themselves, seeing that the Carthaginians were leaving Italy, should pass over to those under whose power they were likely soon to be placed;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> at the same time hoping that his wound would be less irritated by the motion of sailing than marching, and that he would have greater facilities for the cure of it, put his troops on board and set sail. But he had scarcely cleared Sardinia when he died of his wound.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Several also of his ships, which had been dispersed in the main sea, were captured by the Roman fleet which lay near Sardinia. Such were the transactions by sea and land in that part of Italy which is adjacent to the Alps.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul, Caius Servilius, without having performed any memorable achievement in Etruria, his province, and in Gaul, for he had advanced thither also, but having rescued from slavery, which they had endured for now the sixteenth year, his father, Caius Servilius, and his uncle,

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Caius Lutatius, who had been taken by the Boians at the village of Tanetum, returned to Rome with <pb id="p.1308" n="1308"/>his father on one side of him and his uncle on the other, distinguished by family, rather than by public, honours.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was proposed to the people, that Caius Servilius should be indemnified for having filled the offices of plebeian tribune and plebeian aedile contrary to what was established by the laws, while his father, who had sat in the curule chair, was still alive, he being ignorant of that circumstance.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This proposition having been carried, he returned to his province. The towns Consentia, Uffugum, Vergae, Besidiae, Hetriculum, Sypheum, Argentanum, Clampetia, and many other inconsiderable states, perceiving that the Carthaginian cause was declining, went over to Cneius Servilius the consul in Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The same consul fought a battle with Hannibal, in the territory of Croto. The accounts of this battle are not clear. Valerius Antias states that five thousand men were slain. But this is an event of such magnitude, that either it must be an impudent fiction, or negligently omitted.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is certain that nothing further was done by Hannibal in Italy; for ambassadors from Carthage, recalling him into Africa, came to him, as it happened, at the same time that they came to Mago.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It is said that when Hannibal heard the message of the ambassadors he gnashed with his teeth, groaned, and scarcely refrained from shedding tears.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After they had delivered the commands with which they were charged, he said: <quote>Those who have for a long time been endeavouring to drag me home, by forbidding the sending of

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> supplies and money to me, now recall me, not indirectly, but openly. Hannibal, therefore, hath been conquered, not by the Roman people, who have been so often slain and routed, but by the Carthaginian senate, through envy and detraction;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> nor will Publius Scipio exult and glory in this unseemly return so much as Hanno, who has crushed our family, since he could not effect it by any other means, by the ruins of Carthage.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Already had his mind entertained a presentiment of this event, and he had accordingly prepared ships beforehand. Having, therefore, sent a crowd of useless soldiers under pretence of garrisons into the towns in the Bruttian territory, a few of which continued their adherence to him, more through fear than attachment, he transported the strength of his army into Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Many natives of Italy who, refusing to follow him into Africa, had retired to the shrine of Juno Lacinia, which had never been <pb id="p.1309" n="1309"/>violated up to that day, were barbarously massacred in the very temple.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is related, that rarely any person leaving his country to go into exile exhibited deeper sorrow than Hannibal did on departing from the land of his enemies; that he frequently looked back upon the shores of Italy, and, arraigning both gods and men, cursed himself and his own head that that he did not lead his troops, while reeking with blood from the victory at Cannae, to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, who since his appointment to the office of consul had not looked at the Carthaginian enemy in Italy, had dared, he said, to go and

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> attack Carthage, while he, after slaying a hundred thousand fighting men at Trasimenus and Cannae, had suffered his strength to wear away around Casilinum, Cumae, and Nola, Amid these reproaches and complaints he was borne away from his long occupation of Italy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time intelligence was brought to Rome that both Mago and Hannibal had taken their departure. But the delight occasioned by this twofold source of joy was diminished by the reflection that their commanders had wanted either spirit or strength sufficient to detain them, for they had been charged by the senate to do so;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and also in consequence of the anxiety they felt for the issue of a contest, in which the whole weight of the war rested on the efforts of one general and his army.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the same time ambassadors from Saguntum arrived, bringing with them some Carthaginians who had crossed over into Spain for the purpose of hiring auxiliaries, having seized them and the money they had with them.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They laid down in the vestibule of the senate-house two hundred and fifty pounds' weight of gold, and eight hundred of silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After the men had been received and thrown into prison, and the gold and silver returned, the ambassadors were thanked, and received, besides, presents and ships to convey them back into Spain. Some of the older senators then observed, that men were less powerfully affected by prosperity than adversity. That they themselves remembered what terror and consternation had been occasioned by the passage of Hannibal into Italy; what disasters and what lamentations had followed that event.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the camp of the enemy was seen from their walls, what vows were poured forth by each and all!

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> How often, extending their hands to heaven, exclamations were heard in their assemblies, Oh! will that <pb id="p.1310" n="1310"/>day ever arrive when we shall behold Italy cleared of her enemies and enjoying the blessings of peace!

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The gods, they said, had at length, in the sixteenth year, granted that favour, and yet there was no one who proposed that thanks should be returned to them for it.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That if men received a present blessing so ungratefully, they would not be very mindful of it when it was past. In consequence of this a general shout was raised from every part of the senate-house, that Publius Aelius, the praetor, should lay the matter before the senate, and a decree was

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> passed, that a supplication should be performed at all the shrines for the space of five days, and that a hundred and twenty victims of the larger sort should be immolated.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Laelius and the ambassadors of Masinissa having been by this time dismissed, and intelligence having arrived that ambassadors of the Carthaginians, who were coming to the senate to treat about peace, had been seen at Puteoli, and would proceed thence by land, it was resolved, that Caius Laelius should be recalled, that the negotiations respecting the peace might take place in his presence.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Quintus Fulvius Gillo, a lieutenant-general of Scipio, conducted the Carthaginians to Rome; and as they were forbidden to enter the city, they were lodged in a country-house belonging to the state, and admitted to an audience of the senate at the temple of Bellona.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They addressed the senate in nearly the same terms as they had employed before Scipio; laying the whole blame of the war upon Hannibal, and exculpating their state.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They declared, that he had not only crossed the Alps, but the Iberus also, without the sanction of the senate; and that he had made war not only on the Romans, but previously on the Saguntines also, on his own individual responsibility.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That, if the question were viewed in its proper light, it would be found that the league between the senate and people of Carthage and the Romans remained unbroken up to that day.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, all they had in charge to solicit was, that they might be allowed to continue in the enjoyment of that peace which was last entered into with the consul Caius Lutatius.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the praetor, according to the custom handed down from their ancestors, had given the fathers permission to ask the ambassadors any questions they might be pleased to put, and the older members who had been present at the making of the treaties had put some one question and others another, the ambassadors <pb id="p.1311" n="1311"/>declared that they were not old enough to recollect, for they were nearly all of them young men.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Upon this every part of the senate-house resounded with exclamations, that with Carthaginian knavery men had been chosen to solicit a renewal of the old peace who did not recollect its terms.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this, the ambassadors having been removed out of the senate-house, the senators began to be asked their opinions. Marcus Livius recommended, that Caius Servilius, the consul nearest home, should be sent for, that he might be present at the proceedings relative to the peace;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for as it was impossible that any subject of deliberation could occur of greater importance than the present, he did not see how it could be discussed, consistently with the dignity of the Roman people, in the absence of one or both of the consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quintus Metellus, who three years before had been consul, and had filled the office of dictator, said that, since Publius Scipio, by destroying the armies and by devastating the lands of the enemy, had reduced them to such a state that they were compelled as supplicants to sue for peace;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and as no one could estimate with more truth the intentions with which it was solicited, than he who was prosecuting the war before the gates of Carthage; the peace should be rejected or adopted on the advice of none other than Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had been twice consul, endeavoured to show that those who had come were spies, and not ambassadors; that they ought to be ordered to depart from Italy; that guards should be sent with them to their very ships, and that Scipio should be written to not to relax in prosecuting the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Laelius and Fulvius added, that Scipio had grounded his hopes of effecting a peace on Hannibal and Mago not being recalled from Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He considered that the Carthaginians would practise every species of dissimulation, in expectation of the arrival of those generals and their armies, and then, forgetful of all treaties, however recent, and all gods, would proceed with the war. For these reasons they were the more disposed to adopt the opinion of Levinus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The ambassadors were dismissed without having accomplished the peace, and almost without an answer.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Cneius Servilius, the consul, not doubting but that he should enjoy the glory of having restored Italy to a state of peace, pursued Hannibal, whom he consi- <pb id="p.1312" n="1312"/>dered had fled before him, and crossed over into Sicily, with the intention of proceeding thence into Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As soon as this became known at Rome, at first the fathers gave it as their opinion, that the praetor should inform the consul by letter that the senate thought it proper that he should return into Italy;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but afterwards, the praetor declaring that he would not heed his letter, Publius Sulpicius, who was created dictator for this very purpose, recalled the consul to Italy, in virtue of his superior authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The remainder of the year he employed in conjunction with Marcus Servilius, his master of the horse, in going round to the cities of Italy, which had been alienated from the Romans during the war, and in taking cognizance of the cases of each.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the time of the truce, Lentulus the praetor sent over into Africa, from Sardinia, a hundred transports with stores, under a convoy of twenty ships of war, without meeting with any injury either from the enemy or storms.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The same good fortune did not attend Cneius Octavius, while crossing over from Sicily with two hundred transports and thirty men of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having experienced a prosperous voyage until he arrived almost within sight of Africa, at first the wind dropped, but afterwards changing to the south-west, it dispersed his ships in every direction. He himself with the ships of war, having struggled through the opposing billows by the extraordinary exertions of his rowers, made the promontory of Apollo.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The greater part of the transports were driven to Aegimurus, an island filling the mouth of the bay on which Carthage stands, and about thirty miles from the city;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the rest were driven on shore directly opposite the city, near the warm baths. The whole occurrence was within sight of Carthage, and, accordingly, the people ran in crowds to the forum, from every part of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The magistrates summoned the senate, and the people were yelling in the vestibule of the senate-house, lest so great a booty should escape from their hands and their sight.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Though some urged as an objection the obligation imposed upon them by having solicited peace, and others the restraint occasioned by the existence of a truce, the period of which had not yet expired, it was agreed in an assembly, made up almost of a mixture of the senate and people, that Hasdrubal should cross over to Aegimurus with fifty ships, and, proceeding thence, pick up the Roman ships scattered <pb id="p.1313" n="1313"/>along the coasts and in the different ports.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> First the transports from Aegimurus, and then those from the baths, abandoned by the crews, were towed to Carthage.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The ambassadors had not as yet returned from Rome, nor was it known whether the Roman senate had pronounced in favour of peace or war; nor as yet had the period of the truce expired.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio, therefore, considering that the malignity of their offence was heightened by the fact, that, though they had solicited peace and a truce, they had cut off all hopes of the former and violated the latter, immediately despatched Lucius Baebius, Lucius Sergius, and Lucius Fabius, as ambassadors to Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These, having narrowly escaped violence from the assembled multitude, and perceiving that they would be exposed to similar danger on their return, requested of the magistrates, by whose aid they had been protected from violence, to send ships to escort them.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Two triremes were assigned them, which, when they had come to the river Bagradas, whence the Roman camp could be seen, returned to Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Carthaginian fleet was stationed at Utica, and from this three quadriremes were despatched, which suddenly attacked the Roman quinquereme from the main sea, while doubling the promontory, either owing to a message sent from Carthage that this should be done, or that Hasdrubal, who commanded the fleet, perpetrated the atrocity without public connivance.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But neither could they strike it with their beaks from the rapidity with which it evaded them, nor could the fighting men board the higher from lower vessels.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The quinquereme was gallantly defended as long as their weapons lasted; but these failing, and there being now nothing which could save them but the nearness of the land, and the multitude which had poured out from the camp upon the shore, they communicated

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> a rapid motion to the vessel by means of their oars, and running her against the shore with all the force they could, they escaped themselves without injury, and only lost the vessel.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thus when the truce had been unequivocally violated by repeated acts of villany, Laelius and Fulvius arrived from Rome with the Carthaginian ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Scipio told them, that although the Carthaginians had not only broken their faith pledged in the truce, but had also violated the laws of nations in the persons of his ambassadors, yet he would not in their case do any thing unworthy of <pb id="p.1314" n="1314"/>the maxims of the Roman people or his own principles; after saying which, he dismissed the ambassadors and prepared for war.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When Hannibal was now drawing near land, one of the sailors, who was ordered to climb the mast to see what part of the country they were making, said the prow pointed towards a demolished

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> sepulchre, when Hannibal, recognising the inauspicious omen, ordered the pilot to steer by that place, and putting in his fleet at Leptis, landed his forces there.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the transactions in Africa this year. Those which followed extended themselves into that year in which Marcus Servilius Geminus, who was then master of the horse, and Tiberius Claudius Nero were consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> However, at the close of the former year, deputies from the allied states in Greece having arrived with complaints that their lands had been devastated by the king's garrisons, and that their ambassadors, who had gone into Macedonia to demand restitution, had not been admitted into the presence of Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and having also brought information that four thousand men were said to have been conveyed over into Africa, under the conduct of Sopater, to assist the Carthaginians, and that a considerable quantity of money had been sent with them;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the senate resolved that ambassadors should be sent to the king to inform him that the fathers considered that these acts were contrary to the treaty. The persons sent were Caius Terentius Varro, Caius Mamilius, and Marcus Aurelius. Three quinqueremes were assigned to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This year was rendered remarkable by a most extensive fire, by which the buildings on the Publician hill were burned to the ground, and by the greatness of the floods.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But still provisions were cheap, not only because, as it was a time of peace, supplies could be obtained from every part of Italy, but also because Marcus Valerius Falto and Marcus Fabius Buteo, the curule aediles, distributed to the people, so much for each street, at the rate of four <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> a bushel, a great quantity of corn which had been sent out of Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same year died Quintus Fabius Maximus at an advanced age, if, indeed, it be true that he was augur sixty-two years, which some historians relate.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was a man unquestionably worthy of the high surname which he bore, even had it begun with him. He surpassed the honours of his father, and equalled those of his grandfather. His grandfather, Rullus, was distinguished by a greater number of victories and more <pb id="p.1315" n="1315"/>important battles; but one antagonist like Hannibal is sufficient to counterbalance them all.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He was esteemed rather cautious than spirited; and though it may be questioned whether he was naturally dilatory, or whether he adopted that kind of conduct because it was peculiarly suited to the war which he was carrying on, yet nothing can be more clear that he was that one man who by his delay retrieved our affairs, as Ennius says.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Quintus Fabius Maximus, his son, was consecrated augur in his room.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In the room of the same, for he held two priesthoods, Servius Sulpicius Galba was consecrated pontiff. The Roman games were repeated for one day, the plebeian were thrice repeated entire by the aediles, Marcus Sextius Sabinus and Cneius Tremellius Flaccus. Both these were elected praetors, and with them Caius Livius Salinator and Caius Aurelius Cotta.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The difference in the accounts of historians renders it uncertain whether Caius Servilius the consul presided in the elections this year, or Publius Sulpicius, nominated dictator by him, because business detained him in Etruria; being engaged, according to a decree of the senate, in making inquisitions respecting the conspiracies of the principal inhabitants.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the following year, Marcus Servilius and Tiberius Claudius, having assembled the senate, consulted them respecting the provinces. As both were desirous of having Africa, they wished Italy and Africa to be disposed of by lots;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but, principally in consequence of the exertions of Quintus Metellus, Africa was neither assigned to any one nor withheld.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls were ordered to make application to the tribunes of the people, to the effect, that, if they thought proper, they should put it to the people to decide whom they wished to conduct the war in Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All the tribes nominated Publius Scipio. Nevertheless, the consuls put the province of Africa to the lot, for so the senate had decreed.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Africa fell to the lot of Tiberius Claudius, who was to cross over into Africa with a fleet of fifty ships, all quinqueremes, and have an equal command with Scipio. Marcus Servilius obtained Etruria.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Caius Servilius was continued in command in the same province, in case the senate resolved that the consul should remain at the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of the praetors, Marcus Sextus obtained Gaul; which province, together with two legions, Publius Quinctilius Varus was to deliver to him; <pb id="p.1316" n="1316"/>Caius Livius obtained Bruttium, with the two legions which Publius Sempronius, the proconsul, had commanded the former year;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Cneius Tremellius had Sicily, and was to receive the province and two legions from Publius Villius Tappulus, a praetor of the former year; Villius, as propraetor, was to protect the coast of Sicily with twenty men of war, and a thousand soldiers; and Marcus Pomponius was to convey thence to Rome one thousand five hundred soldiers, with the remaining twenty ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The city jurisdiction fell to Caius Aurelius Cotta; and the rest of the praetors were continued in command of the respective provinces and armies which they then had. Not more than sixteen legions were employed this year in the defence of the empire.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And, that they might have the gods favourably disposed towards

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> them in all their undertakings and proceedings, it was ordered that the consuls, before they set out to the war, should celebrate those games, and sacrifice those victims of the larger sort, which, in the consulate of Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Titus Quinctius, Titus Manlius, the dictator, had vowed, provided the commonwealth should continue in the same state for the next five years.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The games were exhibited in the circus during four days, and the victims sacrificed to those deities to whom they had been vowed.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile, hope and anxiety daily and simultaneously increased; nor could the minds of men be brought to any fixed conclusion, whether it was a fit subject for rejoicing, that Hannibal had now at length, after the sixteenth year, departed from Italy, and left the Romans in the unmolested possession of it, or whether they had not greater cause to fear, from his having transported his army in safety into Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They said that the scene of action certainly was changed, but not the danger. That Quintus Fabius, lately deceased, who had foretold how arduous the contest would be, was used to predict, not without good reason, that Hannibal would prove a more formidable enemy in his own country than he had been in a foreign one;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that Scipio would have to encounter not Syphax, a king of undisciplined barbarians, whose armies Statorius, a man little better than a soldier's drudge, was used to lead; nor his father-in-law, Hasdrubal, that most fugacious general;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> nor tumultuary armies hastily collected out of a crowd of half-armed rustics, but Hannibal, born in a manner <pb id="p.1317" n="1317"/>in the pavilion of his father, that bravest of generals, nurtured and educated in the midst of arms, who served as a soldier formerly, when a boy, and became a general when he had scarcely attained the age of manhood;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> who, having grown old in victory, had filled Spain, Gaul, and Italy, from the Alps to the strait, with monuments of his vast achievements; who commanded troops who had served as long as he had himself; troops hardened by the endurance of every species of suffering, such as it is scarcely credible that men could have supported; stained a thousand times with Roman blood, and bearing with them the spoils not only of soldiers but of generals.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That many would meet the eyes of Scipio in battle who had with their own hands slain Roman praetors, generals, and consuls; many decorated with crowns, in reward for having scaled walls and crossed ramparts; many who had traversed the captured camps and cities of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That the magistrates of the Roman people had not then so many fasces as Hannibal could have carried before him, having taken them from generals whom he had slain.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While their minds were harassed by these apprehensions, their anxiety and fears were further increased from the circumstance, that, whereas they had been accustomed to carry on war for several years, in different parts of Italy, and within their view, with languid hopes, and without the prospect of bringing it to a speedy termination, Scipio and Hannibal had stimulated the minds of all, as generals prepared for a final contest.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Even those persons whose confidence in Scipio and hopes of victory were great, were affected with anxiety, increasing in proportion as they saw their completion approaching.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The state of feeling among the Carthaginians was much the same; for, when they turned their eyes on Hannibal, and the greatness of his achievements, they repented having solicited peace;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but when again they reflected that they had been twice defeated in a pitched battle, that Syphax had been made prisoner, that they had been driven out of Spain and Italy, and that all this had been effected by the valour and conduct of Scipio alone, they regarded him with horror, as a general marked out by destiny, and born, for their destruction.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal had by this time arrived at Adrumetum; <pb id="p.1318" n="1318"/>from which place, after employing a few days there in refreshing his soldiers, who had suffered from the motion by sea, he proceeded by forced marches to Zama, roused by the alarming statements of messengers, who brought word, that all the country around Carthage was filled with armed troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Zama is distant from Carthage a five days' journey. Some spies, whom he sent out from this place, being intercepted by the Roman guard, and brought before Scipio, he directed that they should be handed over to the military tribunes, and, after having been desired fearlessly to survey every thing, to be conducted through the camp wherever they chose;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> then, asking them whether they had examined every thing to their satisfaction, he assigned them an escort, and sent them back to Hannibal.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal received none of the circumstances which were reported to him with feelings of joy; for they brought word that, as it happened, Masinissa had joined the enemy that very day, with six thousand infantry and four thousand horse; but he was principally dispirited by the confidence of his enemy, which, doubtless, was not conceived without some ground.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, though he himself was the originator of the war, and by his coming had upset the truce which had been entered into, and cut off all hopes of a treaty, yet concluding that more favourable terms might be obtained if he solicited peace while his strength was unimpaired, than when vanquished, he sent a message to Scipio, requesting permission to confer with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I have no means of affirming whether he did this on his own spontaneous suggestion, or by the advice of his state.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Valerius Antias says, that after having been beaten by Scipio in a battle, in which twelve thousand armed men were slain, and one thousand seven hundred made prisoners, he came himself with ten other deputies into the camp to Scipio.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> However, as Scipio did not decline the proposal for a conference, both the generals, by concert, brought their camps forward in order to facilitate their meeting by shortening the distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Scipio took up his position not far from the city Naragara, in a situation convenient not only for other purposes, but also because there was a watering place within a dart's throw.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hannibal took possession of an eminence four miles thence, safe and convenient in every respect, except that he had a <pb id="p.1319" n="1319"/>long way to go for water. Here, in the intermediate space, a place was chosen, open to view from all sides, that there might be no opportunity for treachery.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>































<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Their armed attendants having retired to an equal distance, they met, each attended by one interpreter, being the greatest generals not only of their own times, but of any to be found in the records of the times preceding them, and equal to

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> any of the kings or generals of any nation whatever.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they came within sight of each other they remained silent for a short time, thunderstruck, as it were, with mutual admiration. At length Hannibal thus began.: <quote>Since fate hath so ordained it, that I, who was the first to wage war upon the Romans, and who have so often had victory almost within my reach, should voluntarily come to sue for peace, I rejoice that it is you, above all others, from whom it is my lot to solicit it.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To you, also, amid the many distinguished events of your life, it will not be esteemed one of the least glorious, that Hannibal, to whom the gods had so often granted victory over the Roman generals, should have yielded to you; and that you should have put an end to this war, which has been rendered remarkable by your calamities before it was by ours.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this also fortune would seem to have exhibited a disposition to sport with events, for it was when your father was consul that I first took up arms;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he was the first Roman general with whom I engaged in a pitched battle; and it is to his son that I now come unarmed to solicit peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It were indeed most to have been desired, that the gods should have put such dispositions into the minds of our fathers, that you should have been content with the empire of Italy, and we with that of Africa: nor, indeed, even to you, are Sicily and Sardinia of sufficient value to compensate you for the loss of so many fleets, so many armies. so many and such distinguished generals.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But what is past may be more easily censured than retrieved. In our attempts to acquire the possessions of others we have been compelled to fight for our own; and not only have you had a war in Italy, and we also in Africa, but you have beheld the standards and arms of your enemies almost in your gates and on your walls, and we now, from the walls of Carthage, distinctly hear the din of a Roman camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What, therefore, we should most earnestly deprecate, and you should most de- <pb id="p.1320" n="1320"/>voutly wish for, is now the case: peace is proposed at a time when you have the advantage. We who negotiate it are the persons whom it most concerns to obtain it, and we are persons whose arrangements, be they what they will, our states will ratify. All we want is a disposition not averse from peaceful counsels.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As far as relates to myself, time, (for I am returning to that country an old man which I left a boy,) and prosperity, and adversity, have so schooled me, that I am more inclined to follow reason than fortune.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But I fear your youth and uninterrupted good fortune, both of which are apt to inspire a degree of confidence ill comporting with pacific counsels. Rarely does that man consider the uncertainty of events whom fortune hath never deceived. What I was at Trasimenus, and at Cannae, that you are this day.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Invested with command when you had scarcely yet attained the military age, though all your enterprises were of the boldest description, in no instance has fortune deserted you.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Avenging the death of your father and uncle, you have derived from the calamity of your house the high honour of distinguished valour and filial duty. You have recovered Spain, which had been lost, after driving thence four Carthaginian armies.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When elected consul, though all others wanted courage to defend Italy, you crossed over into Africa; where having cut to pieces two armies, having at once captured and burnt two camps in the same hour; having made prisoner Syphax, a most powerful king, and seized so many towns of his dominions and so many of ours, you have dragged me from Italy, the possession of which I had firmly held for now sixteen years.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Your mind, I say, may possibly be more disposed to conquest than peace. I know the spirits of your country aim rather at great than useful objects.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> On me, too, a similar fortune once shone. But if with prosperity the gods would also bestow upon us sound judgment, we should not only consider those things which have happened, but those also which may occur. Even if you should forget all others, I am myself a sufficient instance of every vicissitude of fortune.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For me, whom a little while ago you saw advancing my standards to the walls of Rome, after pitching my camp between the Anio and your city, you now behold here, bereft of my two brothers, men of consummate bravery, and most renowned generals, standing before the walls of my native <pb id="p.1321" n="1321"/>city, which is all but besieged, and deprecating, in behalf of my own city, those severities with which I terrified yours. In all cases, the most prosperous fortune is least to be depended upon.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> While your affairs are in a favourable and ours in a dubious state, you would derive honour and splendour from granting peace; while to us who solicit it, it would be considered as necessary rather than honourable. A certain peace is better and safer than a victory in prospect; the former is at your own disposal, the latter depends upon the gods.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Do not place at the hazard of a single hour the successes of so many years.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> When you consider your own strength, then also place before your view the power of fortune, and the fluctuating nature of war. On both sides there will be arms, on both sides human bodies.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> In nothing less than in war do events correspond (with men's calculations). Should you be victorious in a battle, you will not add so much to that renown which you now have it in your power to acquire by granting peace, as you will detract from it should any adverse event befall you. The chance of a single hour may at once overturn the honours you have acquired and those you anticipate.

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Every thing is at your own disposal in adjusting a peace; but, in the other case, you must be content with that fortune which the gods shall impose upon you.

<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Formerly, in this same country, Marcus Atilius would have formed one among the few instances of good fortune and valour, if, when victorious, he had granted a peace to our fathers when they requested it; but by not setting any bounds to his success, and not checking good fortune, which was elating him, he fell with a degree of ignominy proportioned to his elevation.

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> It is indeed the right of him who grants, and not of him who solicits it, to dictate the terms of peace; but perhaps we may not be unworthy to impose upon ourselves the fine.

<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> We do not refuse that all those possessions on account of which the war was begun should be yours; Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, with all the islands lying in any part of the sea, between Africa and Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Let us Carthaginians, confined within the shores of Africa, behold you, since such is the pleasure of the gods, extending your empire over foreign nations, both by sea and land.

<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> I cannot deny that you have reason to suspect the Carthaginian faith, in consequence of their insincerity lately in soliciting a peace and while awaiting the decision. <pb id="p.1322" n="1322"/>The sincerity with which a peace will be observed, depends much, Scipio, on the person by whom it is sought.

<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> Your senate, as I hear, refused to grant a peace in some measure because the deputies were deficient in respectability.

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> It is I, Hannibal, who now solicit peace; who would neither ask for it unless I believed it expedient, nor will I fail to observe it for the same reason of expedience on account of which I have solicited it.

<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> And in the same manner as I, because the war was commenced by me, brought it to pass that no one regretted it till the gods began to regard me with displeasure; so will I also exert myself that no one may regret the peace procured by my means.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In answer to these things the Roman general spoke nearly to the following effect: <quote>I was aware that it was in consequence of the expectation of your arrival, that the Carthaginians violated the existing faith of the truce and broke off all hope of a peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor, indeed, do you conceal the fact; inasmuch as you artfully withdraw from the former conditions of peace every concession except what relates to those things which have for a long time been in our own power.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But as it is your object, that your countrymen should be sensible how great a burden they are relieved from by your means, so it is incumbent upon me to endeavour that they may not receive, as the reward of their perfidy, the concessions which they formerly stipulated, by expunging them now from the conditions of the peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Though you do not deserve to be allowed the same conditions as before, you now request even to be benefited by your treachery. Neither did our fathers first make war respecting Sicily, nor did we respecting Spain. In the former case the danger which threatened our allies the Mamertines, and in the present the destruction of Saguntum, girded us with just and pious arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That you were the aggressors, both you yourselves confess, and the gods are witnesses, who determined the issue of the former war, and who are now determining and will determine the issue of the present according to right and justice.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As to myself, I am not forgetful of the instability of human affairs, but consider the influence of fortune, and am well aware that all our measures are liable to a thousand casualties.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But as I should acknowledge that my conduct would savour of insolence and oppression, if I rejected you on your coming in person to solicit peace, be- <pb id="p.1323" n="1323"/>fore I crossed over into Africa, you voluntarily retiring from Italy, and after you had embarked your troops; so now, when I have dragged you into Africa almost by manual force, notwithstanding your resistance and evasions, I am not bound to treat you with any respect.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Wherefore, if in addition to those stipulations on which it was considered that a peace would at that time have been agreed upon, and what they are you are informed, a compensation is proposed for having seized our ships, together with their stores, during a truce, and for the violence offered to our ambassadors, I shall then have matter to lay before my council.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But if these things also appear oppressive, prepare for war, since you could not brook the conditions of peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus, without effecting an accommodation, when they had returned from the conference to their armies, they informed them that words had been bandied to no purpose, that the question must be decided by arms, and that they must accept that fortune which the gods assigned them.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they had arrived at their camps, they both issued orders that their soldiers should get their arms in readiness, and prepare their minds for the final contest; in which, if fortune should favour them, they would continue victorious, not for a single day, but for ever.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Before to-morrow night,</quote> they said, <quote>they would know whether Rome or Carthage should give laws to the world; and that neither Africa nor Italy, but the whole world, would be the prize of victory. That the dangers which threatened those who had the misfortune to be defeated, were proportioned to the rewards of the victors.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the Romans had not any place of refuge in an unknown and foreign land, and immediate destruction seemed to await Carthage, if the troops which formed her last reliance were defeated.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To this important contest, the day following, two generals, by far the most renowned of any, and belonging to two of the most powerful nations in the world, advanced, either to crown or overthrow, on that day, the many honours they had previously acquired.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their minds, therefore, were agitated with the opposite feelings of hope and fear; and while they contemplated at one time their own troops, at another those of their enemy, estimating their powers more by sight than by reason, they saw in them at once the grounds for joy and grief. <pb id="p.1324" n="1324"/>Those circumstances which did not occur to the troops themselves spontaneously, their generals suggested by their admonitions and exhortations.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Carthaginian recounted his achievements in the land of Italy during sixteen years, the many Roman generals and armies annihilated, reminding each individually of the honours he had acquired as he came to any soldier who had obtained distinction in any of his battles.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Scipio referred to Spain, the recent battles in Africa, and the enemy's own confession, that they could not through fear but solicit peace, nor could they, through their inveterate perfidy, abide by it. In addition to this he gave what turn he pleased to his conference with Hannibal, which was held in private, and was therefore open to misrepresentation.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He augured success that the gods had exhibited the same omens to them on going out to battle on the present occasion, as they had to their fathers when they fought at the islands Aegates.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He told them that the termination of the war, and their hardships, had arrived;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that they had within their grasp the spoils of Carthage, and the power of returning home to their country, their parents, their children, their wives, and their household gods.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He delivered these observations with a body so erect, and with a countenance so full of exultation, that one would have supposed that he had already conquered. He then drew up his troops, posting the hastati in front, the principes behind them, and closing his rear line with the triarii.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He did not draw up his cohorts in close order, but each before their respective standards; placing the companies at some distance from each other, so as to leave a space through which the elephants of the enemy passing might not at all break their ranks.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Laelius, whom he had employed before as lieutenant-general, but this year as quaestor, by special appointment, according to a decree of the senate, he posted with the Italian cavalry in the left wing, Masinissa and the Numidians in the right.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The open spaces between the companies of those in the van he filled with velites, which then formed the Roman light-armed troops, with an injunction, that on the charge of the elephants they should either retire behind the files, which extended in a right line, or, running to the right and left and placing themselves by the side of those in the van, afford a psssage by which the elephants <pb id="p.1325" n="1325"/>might rush in between weapons on both sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal, in order to terrify the enemy, drew up his elephants in front, and he had eighty of them, being more than he had ever had in any battle; behind these his Ligurian and Gallic auxiliaries, with Balearians and Moors intermixed.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the second line he placed the Carthaginians, Africans, and a legion of Macedonians;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> then, leaving a moderate interval, he formed a reserve of Italian troops, consisting principally of Bruttians, more of whom had followed him on his departure from Italy by compulsion and necessity than by choice.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His cavalry also he placed in the wings, the Carthaginian occupying the right, the Numidian the left.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Various were the means of exhortation employed in an army consisting of a mixture of so many different kinds of men; men differing in language, customs, laws, arms, dress, and appearance, and in the motives for serving. To the auxiliaries, the prospect both of their present pay, and many times more from the spoils, was held out.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Gauls were stimulated by their peculiar and inherent animosity against the Romans. To the Ligurians the hope was held out of enjoying the fertile plains of Italy, and quitting their rugged mountains, if victorious. The Moors and Numidians were terrified with subjection to the government of Masinissa, which he would exercise with despotic severity.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Different grounds of hope and fear were represented to different persons.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The view of the Carthaginians was directed to the walls of their city, their household gods, the sepulchres of their ancestors, their children and parents, and their trembling wives; they were told, that either the destruction of their city and slavery or the empire of the world awaited them; that there was nothing intermediate which they could hope for or fear.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> While the general was thus busily employed among the Carthaginians, and the captains of the respective nations among their countrymen, most of them employing interpreters among troops intermixed with those of different nations, the trumpets and cornets of the Romans sounded; and such a clamour arose, that the elephants, especially those in the left wing, turned round upon their own party, the Moors and Numidians.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Masinissa had no difficulty in increasing the alarm of the terrified enemy, and deprived them of the aid of their cavalry in that wing.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> A few, however, of the beasts which were driven against the <pb id="p.1326" n="1326"/>enemy, and were not turned back through fear, made great havoc among the ranks of the velites, though not without receiving many wounds themselves;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> for when the velites, retiring to the companies, had made way for the elephants, that they might not be trampled down, they discharged their darts at them, exposed as they were to wounds on both sides, those in the van also keeping up a continual discharge of javelins; until, driven out of the Roman line by the weapons which fell upon them from all quarters, these elephants also put to flight even the cavalry of the Carthaginians posted in their right wing.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Laelius, when he saw the enemy in disorder, struck additional terror into them in their confusion.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Carthaginian line was deprived of the cavalry on both sides, when the infantry, who were now not a match for the Romans in confidence or strength, engaged. In addition to this there was one circumstance, trifling in itself, but at the same time producing important consequences in the action. On the part of the Romans the shout was uniform, and on that account louder and more terrific; while the voices of the enemy, consisting as they did of many nations of different languages, were dissonant.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans used the stationary kind of fight, pressing upon the enemy with their own weight and that of their arms; but on the other side there was more of skirmishing and rapid movement than force.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, on the first charge, the Romans immediately drove back the line of their opponents;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> then pushing them with their elbows and the bosses of their shields, and pressing forward into the places from which they had pushed them, they advanced a considerable space, as though there had been no one to resist them, those who formed the rear urging forward those in front when they perceived the line of the enemy giving way; which circumstance itself gave great additional force in repelling them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the side of the enemy, the second line, consisting of the Africans and Carthaginians, were so far from supporting the first line when giving ground, that, on the contrary, they even retired, lest their enemy, by slaying those who made a firm resistance, should penetrate to themselves also.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly, the auxiliaries suddenly turned their backs, and facing about upon their own party, fled, some of them into the second line, while others slew

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> those who did not receive them into their ranks, since before they did not <pb id="p.1327" n="1327"/>support them, and now refused to receive them.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And now there were, in a manner, two contests going on together, the Carthaginians being compelled to fight at once with the enemy and with their own party. Not even then, however, did they receive into their line the terrified and exasperated troops;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but, closing their ranks, drove them out of the scene of action to the wings and the surrounding plain, lest they should mingle these soldiers, terrified with defeat and wounds, with that part of their line which was firm and fresh. But such a heap of men and arms had filled the space in which the auxiliaries a little while ago had stood, that it was almost more difficult to pass through it than through a close line of troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The spearmen, therefore, who formed the front line, pursuing the enemy as each could find a way through the heap of arms and men, and streams of blood, threw into complete disorder the battalions and companies.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The standards also of the principes had begun to waver when they saw the line before them driven from their ground. Scipio, perceiving this, promptly ordered the signal to be given for the spearmen to retreat, and, having taken his wounded into the rear, brought the principes and triarii to the wings, in order that the line of spearmen in the centre might be more strong and secure.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus a fresh and renewed battle commenced, inasmuch as they had penetrated to their real antagonists, men equal to them in the nature of their arms, in their experience in war, in the fame of their achievements, and the greatness of their hopes and fears.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But the Romans were superior both in numbers and courage, for they had now routed both the cavalry and the elephants, and having already defeated the front line, were fighting against the second.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Laelius and Masinissa, who had pursued the routed cavalry through a considerable space, returning very opportunely, charged the rear of the enemy's line. This attack of the cavalry at length routed them.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Many of them, being surrounded, were slain in the field; and many, dispersed in flight through the open plain around, were slain on all hands, as the cavalry were in possession of every part. Of the Carthaginians and their allies, above twenty thousand were slain on that day; about an equal number were captured, with a hundred and thirty-three military standards, and eleven elephants.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of the victors as many as two thousand fell.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Han- <pb id="p.1328" n="1328"/>nibal, slipping off during the confusion, with a few horsemen, came to Adrumetum, not quitting the field till he had tried every expedient both in the battle and before the engagement; having, according to the admission of Scipio, and every one skilled in military science, acquired the fame of having marshalled his troops on that day with singular judgment.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He placed his elephants in the front, in order that their desultory attack, and insupportable violence, might prevent the Romans from following their standards, and preserving their ranks, on which they placed their principal dependence.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then he posted his auxiliaries before the line of Carthaginians, in order that men who were made up of the refuse

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> of all nations, and who were not bound by honour but by gain, might not have any retreat open to them in case they fled;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> at the same time that the first ardour and impetuosity might be exhausted upon them, and, if they could render no other service, that the weapons of the enemy might be blunted in wounding them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Next he placed the Carthaginian and African soldiers, on whom he placed all his hopes, in order that, being equal to the enemy in every other respect, they might have the advantage of them, inasmuch as, being fresh and unimpaired in strength themselves, they would fight with those who were fatigued and wounded. The Italians he removed into the rear, separating them also by an intervening space, as he knew not, with certainty, whether they were friends or enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hannibal, after performing this as it were his last work of valour, fled to Adrumetum, whence, having been summoned to Carthage, he returned thither in the six and thirtieth year after he had left it when a boy;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and confessed in the senate-house that he was defeated, not only in the battle, but in the war, and that there was no hope of safety in any thing but in obtaining peace.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately after the battle, Scipio, having taken and plundered the enemy's camp, returned to the sea and his ships, with an immense booty, news having reached

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> him that Publius Lentulus had arrived at Utica with fifty men of war, and a hundred transports laden with every kind of stores.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Concluding that he ought to bring before Carthage every thing which could increase the consternation already existing there, after sending Laelius to Rome to report his victory, he ordered Cneius Octavius to conduct the legions thither by land; and, setting out himself from Utica with the fresh fleet of Lentulus, <pb id="p.1329" n="1329"/>added to his former one, made for the harbour of Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had arrived within a short distance, he was met by a Carthaginian ship decked with fillets and branches of olive. There were ten deputies, the leading men in the state, sent at the instance of Hannibal to solicit peace;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> to whom, when they had come up to the stern of the general's ship, holding out the badges of suppliants, entreating and imploring the protection and compassion of Scipio, the only answer given was, that they must come to Tunes, to which place he would move his camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After taking a view of the site of Carthage, not so much for the sake of acquainting himself with it for any present object, as to dispirit the enemy, he returned to Utica, having recalled Octavius to the same place.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they were proceeding thence to Tunes, they received intelligence that Vermina, the son of Syphax, with a greater number of horse than foot, was coming to the assistance of the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A part of his infantry, with all the cavalry, having attacked them on their march on the first day of the Saturnalia, routed the Numidians with little opposition; and as every way by which they could escape in flight was blocked up, for the cavalry surrounded them on all sides, fifteen thousand men were slain, twelve hundred were taken alive, with fifteen hundred Numidian horses, and seventy-two military standards. The prince himself fled from the field with a few attendants during the confusion.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The camp was then pitched near Tunes in the same place as before, and thirty ambassadors came to Scipio from Carthage. These behaved in a manner even more calculated to excite compassion than the former, in proportion as their situation was more pressing; but from the recollection of their recent perfidy, they were heard with considerably less pity.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the council, though all were impelled by just resentment to demolish Carthage, yet, when they reflected upon the magnitude of the undertaking, and the length of time which would be consumed in the siege of so well fortified and strong a city, while Scipio himself was uneasy in

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> consequence of the expectation of a successor, who would come in for the glory of having terminated the war, though it was accomplished already by the exertions and danger of another, the minds of all were inclined to peace.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day the ambassadors being called in again, and, with many rebukes for their perfidy, warned that, in- <pb id="p.1330" n="1330"/>structed by so many disasters, they would at length believe in the existence of the gods, and the obligation of an oath, these conditions of the peace were stated to them:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>That they should enjoy their liberty and live under their own laws; that they should possess such cities and territories as they had enjoyed before the war, and with the same boundaries, and that the Romans should on that day desist from devastation.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That they should restore to the Romans all deserters and fugitives, giving up all their ships of war except ten triremes, with such tamed elephants as they had, and that they should not tame any more.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That they should not carry on war in or out of Africa without the permission of the Roman people. That they should make restitution to Masinissa, and form a league with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That they should furnish corn, and pay for the auxiliaries until the ambassadors had returned from Rome. That they should pay ten thousand talents of silver, in equal annual instalments distributed over fifty years.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That they should give a hundred hostages, according to the pleasure of Scipio, not younger than fourteen nor older than thirty. That he would grant them a truce on condition that the transports, together with their cargoes, which had been seized during the former truce, were restored. Otherwise they would have no truce, nor any hope of a peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the ambassadors who were ordered to bear these conditions home reported them in an assembly, and Gisgo had stood forth to dissuade them from the terms, and was being listened to by the multitude, who were at once indisposed for peace and unfit for war, Hannibal, indignant that such language should

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> be held and listened to at such a juncture, laid hold of Gisgo with his own hand, and dragged him from his elevated position. This unusual sight in a free state having raised a murmur among the people, the soldier, disconcerted at the liberties which the citizens took, thus addressed them: <quote>Having left you when nine years old, I have returned after a lapse of thirty-six years.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I flatter myself I am well acquainted with the qualifications of a soldier, having been instructed in them from my childhood, sometimes by my own situation, and sometimes by that of my country. The privileges, the laws, and customs of the city and the forum you ought to teach me.</quote> Having thus apologized for his indiscretion, he discoursed largely concerning the peace, showing how inoppressive the <pb id="p.1331" n="1331"/>terms were, and how necessary it was.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The greatest difficulty was, that of the ships which had been seized during the truce nothing was to be found except the ships themselves:

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> nor was it easy to collect the property, because those who were charged with having it were opposed to the peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was resolved that the ships should be restored, and that the men at least should be looked up; and as to whatever else was missing, that it should be left to Scipio to put a value upon it, and that the Carthaginians should make compensation accordingly in money.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There are those who say that Hannibal went from the field of battle to the sea-coast; whence he immediately sailed in a ship, which he had ready for the purpose, to king Antiochus; and that when Scipio demanded above every thing that Hannibal should be given up to him, answer was made that Hannibal was not in Africa.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the ambassadors returned to Scipio, the quaestors were ordered to give in an account, made out from the public registers, of the public property which had been in the ships; and the owners to make a return of the private property.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the amount of the value twenty-five thousand pounds of silver were required to be paid down; and a truce for three months was granted to the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was added, that during the time of the truce they should not send ambassadors any where else than to Rome; and that, whatever ambassadors came to Carthage, they should not dismiss them before informing the Roman general who they were, and what they sought.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With the Carthaginian ambassadors, Lucius Veturius Philo, Marcus Marcius Ralla, and Lucius Scipio, brother of the general, were sent to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the time in which these events took place, the supplies sent from Sicily and Sardinia produced such cheapness of provisions, that the merchant gave up the corn to the mariners for their freight.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At Rome alarm was excited at the first intelligence of the renewal of hostilities by the Carthaginians; and Tiberius Claudius was directed to conduct the fleet with speed into Sicily, and cross over from that place into Africa. The other consul, Marcus Servilius, was directed to stay at the city until the state of affairs in Africa was ascertained.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Tiberius Claudius, the consul, proceeded slowly with every thing connected with the equipment and sailing of the fleet, because the senate had decided that it should be left to Scipio, rather than to the consul, to determine <pb id="p.1332" n="1332"/>the conditions on which the peace should be granted. The accounts also of prodigies which arrived just at the time of the news of the revival of the war, had occasioned great alarm.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At Cumae the orb of the sun seemed diminished, and a shower of stones fell; and in the territory of Veliternum the earth sank in great chasms, and trees were swallowed up in the cavities.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At Aricia the forum and the shops around it, at Frusino a wall in several places, and a gate, were struck by lightning; and in the Palatium a shower of stones fell. The latter prodigy, according to the custom handed down by tradition, was expiated by a nine days' sacred rite; the rest with victims of the larger sort.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Amid these events an unusually great rising of the waters was converted into a prodigy; for the Tiber overflowed its banks to such a degree, that as the circus was under water, the Apollinarian games were got up near the temple of Venus Erycina, without the Colline gate.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> However, the weather suddenly clearing up on the very day of the celebration, the procession, which had begun to move at the Colline gate, was recalled and transferred to the circus, on its being known that the water had retired thence.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The joy of the people and the attraction of the games were increased by the restoration of this solemn spectacle to its proper scene.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul Claudius, having set out at length from the city, was placed in the most imminent danger by a violent tempest, which overtook him between the ports of Cosa and Laurentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having reached Populonii, where he waited till the remainder of the tempest had spent itself, he crossed over to the island Ilva. From Ilva he went to Corsica, and from Corsica to Sardinia. Here, while sailing round the Montes Insani, a tempest much more violent in itself, and in a more dangerous situation, dispersed his fleet. Many of his ships were shattered and stripped of their rigging, and some were wrecked.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His fleet thus weather beaten and shattered arrived at Carales, where the winter came on while the ships were drawn on shore and refitted. The year having elapsed, and no one proposing to continue him in command, Tiberius Claudius brought back his fleet to Rome in a private capacity.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcus Servilius set out for his province, having nominated Caius Servilius Geminus as dictator, that he might not be recalled to the city to hold the elections. The dictator ap- <pb id="p.1333" n="1333"/>pointed Publius Aelius Paetus master of the horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It frequently happened, that the elections could not be held on account of bad weather, though the days were fixed for them; and, therefore, as the magistrates of the former year retired from their offices on the day before the ides of March, and fresh ones were not appointed to succeed them, the state was without curule magistrates.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Manlius Torquatus, a pontiff, died this year. Caius Sulpicius Galba was elected in his room. The Roman games were thrice repeated by the curule aediles, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Quintus Fulvius.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some scribes and runners belonging to the aediles were found, on the testimony of an informer, to have privately conveyed money out of the treasury, and were condemned, not without disgrace to the aedile Lucullus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Publius Aelius Tubero and Lucius Laetorius, plebeian aediles, on account of some informality in their creation, abdicated their office, after having celebrated the games, and the banquet on occasion of the games, in honour of Jupiter, and after having placed in the Capitol three statues made out of silver paid as fines. The dictator and master of the horse celebrated the games in honour of Ceres, in conformity with a decree of the senate.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman, together with the Carthaginian ambassadors, having arrived at Rome from Africa, the senate was assembled at the temple of Bellona;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when Lucius Veturius Philo stated, to the great joy of the senate, that a battle had been fought with Hannibal, which was decisive of the fate of the Carthaginians, and that a period was at length put to that calamitous war.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He added what formed a small accession to their successes, that Vermina, the son of Syphax, had been vanquished. He was then ordered to go forth to the public assembly, and impart the joyful tidings to the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, a thanksgiving having been appointed, all the temples in the city were thrown open, and supplications for three days were decreed. The ambassadors of the Carthaginians, and those of king Philip, for they also had arrived, requesting an audience of the senate, answer was made by the dictator, by order of the fathers, that the new consuls would give them an audience. The elections were then held.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls elected were Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Aelius Paetus. The praetors elected were Marcus Junius Pennus, to whose lot the city jurisdiction fell, Marcus Valerius Falto, who re- <pb id="p.1334" n="1334"/>ceived Bruttium, Marcus Fabius Buteo, who received Sardinia, and Publius Aelius Tubero, who received Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was the pleasure of the senate that nothing should be done respecting the provinces of the consuls, till the ambassadors of king Philip and the Carthaginians had been heard; for they foresaw the termination of one war and the commencement of another.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Cneius Lentulus, the consul, was inflamed with a strong desire to have the province of Africa, looking forward to an easy victory if there was still war, or, if it was on the point of being concluded, to the glory of having it terminated in his consulate.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He therefore refused to allow any business to be transacted before the province of Africa was assigned him; his colleague, who was a moderate and prudent man, giving up his claim to it, for he clearly saw that a contest with Scipio for that honour would be not only unjust but unequal.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Quintus Minucius Thermus, and Manius Acilius Glabrio, tribunes of the people, said that Cneius Cornelius was endeavouring to effect the same object which had been attempted in vain by the consul Tiberius Claudius the former year.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That, by the direction of the senate, it had been proposed to the people to decide whom they wished to have the command in Africa, and all the thirty-five tribes had concurred in assigning that command to Publius Scipio. After many discussions, both in the senate and popular assembly, it was at length determined to leave it to the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The fathers, therefore, on oath, for so it had been agreed, voted, that as to the provinces,

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> the consuls should settle between them- selves, or determine by lots, which of them should have Italy, and which a fleet of fifty ships. That he to whose lot the fleet fell should sail to Sicily, and if peace could not be concluded with the Carthaginians, that he should cross over into Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That the consul should act by sea, and Scipio by land, with the same right of command as heretofore.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> If an agreement should be come to, as to the terms of the peace, that then the plebeian tribunes should consult the commons as to whether they ordered the consul or Publius Scipio to grant the peace; and if the victorious army was to be brought home out of Africa, whom they ordered to bring it.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> That if they ordered that the peace should be granted by Publius Scipio, and that the army should be brought home likewise by him, then the consul should not pass out of Sicily into <pb id="p.1335" n="1335"/>Africa.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> That the other consul, to whose lot Italy fell, should receive two legions from Marcus Sextius the praetor.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Scipio was continued in command in the province of Africa, with the armies which he then had. To the praetor Marcus Valerius Falto the two legions in Bruttium, which Caius Livius had commanded the preceding year, were assigned.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Aelius, the praetor, was to receive two legions in Sicily from Cneius Tremellius. To Marcus Fabius was assigned one legion, which Publius Lentulus, propraetor, had commanded, to be employed in Sardinia; Marcus Servilius, the consul of the former year, was continued in command in Etruria, with his own two legions likewise.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As to Spain, it appeared that Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus had been there for now several years.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was resolved, therefore, that the consuls should make application to the plebeian tribunes to take the opinion of the people, if they thought proper, as to whom they ordered to have command in Spain; that the person so ordered should form one legion of Roman soldiers out of the two armies, and also fifteen cohorts of the allies of the Latin confederacy, with which he should occupy the province.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus should convey the old soldiers into Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To Cornelius, the consul, was assigned a fleet of fifty ships formed out of the two fleets, one of which was under Cneius Octavius in Africa, the other employed in protecting the coast of Sicily, under Publius Villius. He was to select such ships as he pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That Publius Scipio should still have the forty ships of war which he before had, or if he wished that Cneius Octavius should command it, as he had commanded a fleet there before, that Octavius should be continued in command for a year as propraetor;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but if he appointed Laelius to the command of it, Octavius should retire to Rome, and bring with him the ships which the consul did not want. To Marcus Fabius also ten men of war were assigned for Sardinia.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consuls were directed to enlist two city legions, so that the operations of the state might be carried on this year with fourteen legions, and one hundred men of war.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>






















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the business relating to the ambassadors of Philip and the Carthaginians was considered.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was resolved that the Macedonians should be brought before the senate first. <pb id="p.1336" n="1336"/>Their address comprehended a variety of subjects, being employed partly in clearing themselves from the charges relative to the depredations committed against the allies, which the deputies sent to the king from Rome had brought against them;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and partly in preferring accusations themselves against the allies of the Roman people, but particularly against Marcus Aurelius, whom they inveighed against with much greater acrimony; for they said that, being one of the three ambassadors sent to them, he had staid behind, and levying soldiers, had assailed them with hostilities contrary to the league, and frequently fought pitched battles with their prefects;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and partly in preferring a request that the Macedonians and their general, Sopater, who had served in the army of Hannibal for hire, and having been made prisoners were kept in bondage, should be restored to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In opposition to these things, Marcus Furius, who had been sent from Macedonia for the express purpose by Aurelius, thus argued: he said, <quote>that Aurelius, having been left behind, lest the allies of the Roman people, wearied by devastations and injuries, should revolt to the king, had not gone beyond the boundaries of the allies; but had taken measures to prevent plundering parties from crossing over into their lands with impunity.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That Sopater was one of those who wore purple, and was related to the king; that he had been lately sent into Africa with four thousand Macedonians and a sum of money to assist Hannibal and the Carthaginians.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Macedonians, on being interrogated on these points, proceeded to answer in a subtle and evasive manner; but without waiting for the conclusion of their reply they were told, <quote>that the king was seeking occasion for war, and that if he persisted he would soon obtain his object.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That the treaty had been doubly violated by him, both by offering insults to the allies of the Roman people, by assaulting them with hostilities and arms, and also by aiding their enemies with auxiliaries and money.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That Publius Scipio was deemed to have acted properly and regularly in keeping in chains, as enemies, those who had been made prisoners while bearing arms against the Romans; and that Marcus Aurelius had consulted the interest of the state, and the senate were thankful to him for it, in protecting the allies

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> of the Roman people by arms, since he could not do it by the obligation of the treaty.</quote> The Macedonian ambassadors having been dismissed with this <pb id="p.1337" n="1337"/>unpleasant answer, the Carthaginian ambassadors were called.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On observing their ages and dignified appearance, for they were by far the first men of the state, all promptly declared their conviction, that now they were sincere in their desire to effect a peace. Hasdrubal, however, surnamed by his countrymen Haedus, who had invariably recommended peace, and was opposed to the Barcine faction, was regarded with greater interest than the rest.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On these accounts the greater weight was attached to him when transferring the blame of the war from the state at large to the cupidity of a few.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After a speech of varied character, in which he sometimes refuted the charges which had been brought, at other times admitted some, lest by impudently denying what was manifestly true their forgiveness might be the more difficult;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and then, even admonishing the conscript fathers to be guided by the rules of decorum and moderation in their prosperity, he said, that if the Carthaginians had listened to himself and Hanno, and had been disposed to make a proper use of circumstances, they would themselves have dictated terms of peace, instead of begging it as they now did.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> That it rarely happened that good fortune and a sound judgment were bestowed upon men at the same time.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> That the Roman people were therefore invincible, because when successful they forgot not the maxims of wisdom and prudence; and indeed it would have been matter of astonishment did they act otherwise. That those persons to whom success was a new and uncommon thing, proceeded to a pitch of madness in their ungoverned transports in consequence of their not being accustomed to it.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> That to the Roman people the joy arising from victory was a matter of common occurrence, and was now almost become old-fashioned. That they had extended their empire more by sparing the vanquished than by conquering. The language employed by the others was of a nature more calculated to excite compassion; they represented from what a height of power the Carthaginian affairs had fallen.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> That nothing, besides the walls of Carthage, remained to those who a little time ago held almost the whole world in subjection by their arms; that, shut up within these, they could see nothing any where on sea or land which owned their authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> That they would retain possession of their city itself and their household gods only, in case the Roman people should refrain <pb id="p.1338" n="1338"/>from venting their indignation upon these, which is all that remains for them to do.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> When it was manifest that the fathers were moved by compassion, it is said that one of the senators, violently incensed at the perfidy of the Carthaginians, immediately asked with a loud voice, by what gods they would swear in striking the league, since they had broken their faith with those by whom they swore in striking the former one?

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> By those same, replied Hasdrubal, who have shown such determined hostility to the violators of treaties.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The minds of all being disposed to peace, Cneius Lentulus, whose province the fleet was, protested against the decree of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Upon this, Manius Acilius and Quintus Minucius, tribunes of the people, put the question to the people, whether they willed and ordered that the senate should decree that peace should be made with the Carthaginians? whom they ordered to grant that peace, and whom to conduct the army out of Africa?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All the tribes ordered respecting the peace according as the question had been put. That Publius Scipio should grant the peace, and that he also should conduct the army home.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Agreeably to this order, the senate decreed that Publius Scipio, acting according to the opinion of the ten deputies, should make peace with the Carthaginian people on what terms he pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Carthaginians then returned thanks to the senate, and requested that they might be allowed to enter the city and converse with their countrymen who had been made prisoners and were in custody of the state;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> observing, that some of them were their relations and friends, and men of rank, and some, persons to whom they were charged with messages from their relations.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having obtained these requests, they again asked permission to ransom such of them as they pleased; when they were desired to give in their names.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Having given in a list of about two hundred, a decree of the senate was passed to the effect, that the Carthaginian ambassadors should be allowed to take away into Africa to Publius Cornelius Scipio two hundred of the Carthaginian prisoners, selecting whom they pleased; and that they should convey to him a message, that if the peace were concluded, he should restore them to the Carthaginians without ransom.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The heralds being ordered to go into Africa to strike the league, at their own desire the senate passed a decree that they should take with them flint stones of their <pb id="p.1339" n="1339"/>own, and vervain of their own; that the Roman praetor should command them to strike the league, and that they should demand of him herbs. The description of herb usually given to the heralds is taken from the Capitol.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus the Carthaginians, being allowed to depart from Rome, when they had gone into Africa to Scipio concluded the peace on the terms before mentioned.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They delivered up their men-of-war, their elephants, deserters, fugitives, and four thousand prisoners, among whom was Quintus Terentius Culleo, a senator. The ships he ordered to be taken out into the main and burnt.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some say there were five hundred of every description of those which are worked with oars, and that the sudden sight of these, when burning, occasioned as deep a sensation of grief to the Carthaginians as if Carthage had been in flames.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The measures adopted respecting the deserters were more severe than those respecting the fugitives. Those who were of the Latin confederacy were decapitated; the Romans were crucified.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The last peace with the Carthaginians was made forty years before this, in the consulate of Quintus Lutatius and Aulus Manlius.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war commenced twenty-three years afterwards, in the consulate of Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius. It was concluded in the seventeenth year, in the consulate of Cneius Cornelius and Publius Aelius Paetus.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is related that Scipio frequently said afterwards, that first the ambition of Tiberius Claudius, and afterwards of Cneius Cornelius, were the causes which prevented his terminating the war by the destruction of Carthage.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Carthaginians, finding difficulty in raising the first sum of money to be paid, as their finances were exhausted by a protracted war, and in consequence great lamentation and grief arising in the senate-house, it is said that Hannibal was observed laughing;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and when Hasdrubal Haedus rebuked him for laughing amid the public grief, when he himself was the occasion of the tears which were shed, he said: <quote>If, as the expression of the countenance is discerned by the sight, so the inward feelings of the mind could be distinguished, it would clearly appear to you that that laughter which you censure came from a heart not elated with joy, but frantic with misfortunes.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And yet it is not so ill-timed as those absurd and inconsistent tears of yours. Then you ought to have wept, when our arms were taken <pb id="p.1340" n="1340"/>from us, our ships burnt, and we were forbidden to engage in foreign wars, for that was the wound by which we fell.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor is it just that you should suppose that the measures which the Romans have adopted towards you have been dictated by animosity.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No great state can remain at rest long together. If it has no enemy abroad it finds one at home, in the same manner as over-robust bodies seem secure from external causes, but are encumbered with their own strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So far, forsooth, we are affected with the public calamities as they reach our private affairs; nor is there any circumstance attending them which is felt more acutely than the loss of money.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly, when the spoils were torn down from vanquished Carthage, when you beheld her left unarmed and defenseless amid so many armed nations of Africa, none heaved a sigh.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Now, because a tribute is to be levied from private property, you lament with one accord, as though at the funeral of the state. How much do I dread lest you should soon be made sensible that you have shed tears this day for the lightest of your misfortunes!</quote> Such were the sentiments which Hannibal delivered to the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio, having summoned an assembly, presented Masinissa, in addition to his paternal dominions, with the town of Cirta, and the other cities and territories which had passed from the kingdom of Syphax into the possession of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He ordered Cneius Octavius to conduct the fleet to Sicily and deliver it to Cneius Cornelius the consul, and directed the Carthaginian ambassadors to go to Rome, that the arrangements he had made, with the advice of the ten deputies, might be ratified by the sanction of the fathers and the order of the people.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Peace having been established by sea and land, he embarked his troops and crossed over to Lilybaeum in Sicily;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> whence, having sent a great part of his soldiers by ships, he himself proceeded through Italy, which was rejoicing, not less on account of the peace than the victory; while not only the inhabitants of the cities poured out to show him honour, but crowds of rustics thronged the roads. He arrived at Rome and entered the city in a triumph of unparalleled splendour. He brought into the treasury one hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds of silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He distributed to each of his soldiers four hundred <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> out of the spoils. By the death of <pb id="p.1341" n="1341"/>Syphax, which took place but a short time before at Tibur, whither he had been removed from Alba, a diminution was occasioned in the interest of the pageant rather than in the glory of him who triumphed.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His death, however, was attended with circumstances which produced a strong sensation, for he was buried at the public expense.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Polybius, an author by no means to be despised, asserts that this king was led in the triumph. Quintus Terentius Culleo followed Scipio in his triumph with a cap of liberty on his head, and during the remainder of his life treated him with the respect due to him as the author of his freedom.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I have not been able to ascertain whether the partiality of the soldiers or the favour of the people fixed upon him the surname of Africanus, or whether in the same manner as Felix was applied to Sulla, and Magnus to Pompey, in the memory of our fathers, it originated in the flattery of his friends.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was, doubtless, the first general who was distinguished by a name derived from the nation which he had conquered. Afterwards, in imitation of his example, some, by no means his equals in his victories, affixed splendid inscriptions on their statues and gave honourable surnames to their families.</p></div1> <div1 type="book" n="31"><head>BOOK XXXI.</head>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is delightful even to me to have come to the end of the Punic war, as if I myself had borne a share of the toil and danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For though it by no means becomes a person, who has ventured to promise an entire history of all the Roman affairs, to be fatigued by any particular parts of so extensive a <pb id="p.1342" n="1342"/>work;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> yet when I reflect that sixty-three years (for so many there are from the first Punic war to the end of the second) have occupied as many of my

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> volumes, as the four hundred and eighty-seven years, from the building of the city to the consulate of Appius Claudius, who first made war on the Carthaginians, I plainly perceive that, like those who, tempted by the shallows near the shore, walk into the sea, the farther I advance, I am carried, as it were, into a greater depth and abyss;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and that my work almost increases on my hands, which seemed to be diminished by the completion of each of its earlier portions.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The peace with Carthage was quickly followed by a war with Macedonia: a war, not to be compared to the former, indeed, either in danger, or in the abilities of the commander, or the valour of the soldiers;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but almost more remarkable with regard to the renown of their former kings, the ancient fame of that nation, and the vast extent of their empire, in which they had formerly comprehended a large part of Europe, and the greater part of Asia.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The contest with Philip, which had begun about ten years before, had been intermitted for the three last years; the Aetolians having been the occasion both of the war and the peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The entreaties of the Athenians whom, having ravaged their lands, Philip had driven into their city, excited the Romans to a renewal of the war, left, as they were, disengaged by the Carthaginian peace, and incensed against him as well for his treacherous negotiation of peace

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> with the Aetolians and the other allies in that region, as on account of the auxiliaries sent by him with money into Africa to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time, ambassadors arrived both from king Attalus, and from the Rhodians, with information that the Macedonian was tampering with the states of Asia.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To these embassies an answer was given, that the senate would give attention to the affairs of Asia. The determination with regard to the making war on him, was left open to the consuls, who were then in their provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the mean time, three ambassadors were sent to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, namely, Caius Claudius Nero, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, to announce their conquest of Hannibal and the Carthaginians;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> to give thanks to the king for his faithful adherence to his engagements in the time of <pb id="p.1343" n="1343"/>their distress, when even the nearest allies of the Romans abandoned them; and to request that if, compelled by ill treatment, they should undertake a war with Philip, he would preserve his former disposition towards the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In Gaul, about this time, the consul, Publius Aelius, having heard that, before his arrival, the Boians had made inroads on the territories of the allies, levied two occasional legions on account of this disturbance;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and adding to them four cohorts from his own army, ordered Caius Oppius, the prefect, to march with this tumultuary band through Umbria, (which is called the Sappinian district,) and to invade the territories of the Boians. He himself led his own troops thither openly, over the intervening mountains. Oppius, on entering the same, for some time committed depredations with tolerable success and safety.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But afterwards, having pitched on a place near a fort called Mutilum, convenient enough for cutting down the corn, (for the crops were now ripe,) and setting out without having reconnoitred around, and without establishing armed posts of sufficient strength to protect those who were unarmed and intent on their work, he was suddenly surrounded, together with his foragers, by an unexpected invasion of the Gauls.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On this, panic and flight seized even on those who were furnished with weapons.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Seven thousand men, dispersed through the corn fields, were put to the sword, among whom was the commander himself, Caius Oppius.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The rest were driven by terror into the camp; from whence, in consequence of a resolution of the soldiers, they set out on the following night, without any particular commander; and, leaving behind a great part of their baggage, made their way, through woods almost impassable, to the consul, who returned

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> to Rome without having performed any thing in his province worth notice, except that he ravaged the lands of the Boians, and made a treaty with the Ingaunian Ligurians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first time he assembled the senate, it was unanimously ordered that he should propose no other business before that which related to Philip and the complaints of the allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was immediately taken into consideration, and a numerous senate decreed, that Publius Aelius, consul, should send such person as he might think proper, vested with command, to <pb id="p.1344" n="1344"/>receive the fleet which Cneius Octavius was bringing home from Sicily, and pass over to Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, Marcus Valerius Laevinus, propraetor, was sent; and, receiving thirty-eight ships from Cneius Octavius, near Vibo, he sailed to Macedonia, where, when Marcus Aurelius, the ambassador, had

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> come to him and informed him what numerous forces and what large fleets the king had prepared, and how

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> he was arousing the inhabitants to arms, partly by visiting them himself and partly by ambassadors, not only through all the cities of the continent, but even in the islands, (Laevinus was convinced) that the war ought to be undertaken by the Romans with greater vigour;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> lest, if they were dilatory, Philip might attempt that which had been formerly undertaken by Pyrrhus, who possessed not such large dominions. He therefore desired Aurelius to convey this intelligence by letter to the consuls and to the senate.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Towards the end of this year the senate, taking into consideration the lands to be given to the veteran soldiers, who, under the conduct and auspices of Publius Scipio, had finished the war in Africa, decreed that

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Marcus Tunius, praetor of the city, should, if he thought proper, appoint ten commissioners to survey, and distribute among them, that part of the Samnite and Apulian lands which was the property of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For this purpose were appointed, Publius Servilius, Quintus Caecilius Metellus, Caius and Marcus Servilius, both surnamed Geminus, Lucius and Aulus Hostilius Cato, Publius Villius Tappulus, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, Publius Aelius Paetus, and Quintus Flaminius.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the same time, Publius Aelius presiding at the election of consuls, Publius Sulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius Cotta were elected. Then were chosen praetors, Quintus Minucius Rufus, Lucius Furius Purpureo, Quintus Fulvius Gillo, Cneius Sergius Plancus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman stage-games were exhibited, in a sumptuous and elegant manner, by the curule aediles, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, and Lucius Quintius Flaminius, and repeated for two days;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and a vast quantity of corn, which Scipio had sent from Africa, was distributed by them to the people, with strict impartiality and general satisfaction, at the rate of four <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> a peck.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The plebeian games were thrice repeated entire by the plebeian aediles, Lucius Apustius <pb id="p.1345" n="1345"/>Fullo, and Quintus Minucius Rufus; the latter of whom was, from the aedileship, elected praetor. There was also a feast of Jove on occasion of the games.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the year five hundred and fifty-two from the building of the city, Publius Sulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius being consuls, within a few months after the conclusion of the peace with the Carthaginians, the war was entered upon against king Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was the first business introduced by the consul, Publius Sulpicius, on the ides of March, the day on which, in those times, the consulship commenced;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and the senate decreed, that the consul should perform sacrifices with the greater victims, to such gods as they should judge proper, with prayers to this purpose, &mdash;that

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>the business which the senate and people of Rome had then under deliberation, concerning the state, and the entering on a new war, might issue prosperously and happily to the Roman people, the allies, and the Latin confederacy;</quote> and that, after the sacrifices and prayers, they should consult the senate on the state of public affairs, and the provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At this time, very opportunely for exciting their minds to war, the letters were brought from Marcus Aurelius, the ambassador, and Marcus Valerius Laevinus, proprietor. A fresh embassy, likewise, arrived from the Athenians, to acquaint them that the king was approaching their frontiers, and that in a short time, not only their lands, but their city also, must fall into his hands, unless they received aid from the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the consuls had made their report, that the sacrifices had been duly performed, and that the gods had accepted their prayers;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that the aruspices had declared that the entrails showed good omens, and that enlargement of territory, victory, and triumph were portended; the letters of Valerius and Aurelius were read, and audience given to the ambassadors of the Athenians. After which, a decree of the senate was passed, that thanks should be given to their allies, because, though long solicited, they had not, even when in fear of a siege, renounced their fidelity.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With regard to sending assistance to them, they resolved, that an answer should be given as soon as the consuls should have cast lots for the provinces;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and when the consul to whose lot Macedonia fell should have proposed to the people, that war should be declared against Philip, king of the Macedonians <pb id="p.1346" n="1346"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The province of Macedonia fell by lot to Publius Sulpicius; and he proposed to the people to declare, <quote>that they chose and ordered, that on account of the injuries and hostilities committed against the allies of the Roman people, war should be proclaimed against king Philip, and the Macedonians under his government.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The province of Italy fell to the lot of the other consul, Aurelius. The praetors then cast lots: to Cneius Sergius Plancus fell the city jurisdiction; to Quintus Fulvius Gillo, Sicily; to Quintus Minucius Rufus, Bruttium; and to Lucius Furius Purpureo, Gaul.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the first meeting of the people, the proposal concerning the Macedonian war was rejected by almost all the tribes.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was done partly spontaneously, as the people were wearied by the length and severity of the late war, and disgusted with toils and dangers; and partly by Quintus Baebius, tribune of the people, who, pursuing the old practice of criminating the patricians, charged them with multiplying wars one after another, so that the people could never enjoy peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This proceeding the patricians with difficulty brooked, and the tribune was severely reprehended in the senate; where each severally urged the consul to call a new assembly, for passing the proposal; to rebuke the backwardness of the people;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and to prove to them how much loss and disgrace the delay of this war would occasion.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, having assembled the people in the field of Mars, before he dismissed the centuries to the vote, required their attention, and addressed them thus:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Citizens, you seem to me not to understand that the question before you is not whether you choose to have peace or war: for Philip, having already commenced hostilities with a formidable force, both on land and sea, allows you not that option. The question is, Whether you must transport your legions to Macedonia, or admit the enemy into Italy?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> How important the difference is, if you never experienced it before, you certainly did in the late Punic war. For who entertains a doubt, but if, when the Saguntines were besieged, and implored our protection, we had assisted them with vigour, as our fathers did the Mamertines, we should have averted the whole weight of the war upon Spain; which, by our dilatory proceedings, we suffered to our extreme loss to fall upon Italy?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor does it admit a doubt, that we confined this same Philip in Mace- <pb id="p.1347" n="1347"/>donia, (after he had entered into an engagement with Hannibal, by ambassadors and letters, to cross over into Italy,) by sending Laevinus with a fleet to make war aggressively upon him.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And what we did at that time, when we had Hannibal to contend with in Italy, do we hesitate to do now, after Hannibal has been expelled Italy, and the Carthaginians subdued?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Suppose that we allow the king to experience the same inactivity on our part, while he is taking Athens, as we suffered Hannibal to experience while he was taking Saguntum:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> it will not be in the fifth month, as Hannibal came from Saguntum, but on the fifth day after he sets sail from Corinth, that he will arrive in Italy. Perhaps you may not consider Philip as equal to Hannibal; or the Macedonians to the Carthaginians: certainly, however, you will allow him equal to Pyrrhus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Equal, do I say? what a vast superiority has the one man over the other, the one nation over the other!

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Epirus ever was, and is at this day, deemed but an inconsiderable accession to the kingdom of Macedonia. Philip has the entire Peloponnesus under his dominion; even Argos itself, not more celebrated for its ancient glory than for the death of Pyrrhus.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now compare our situation. How much more flourishing was Italy, how much greater its strength, with so many commanders, so many armies unimpaired, which the Punic war afterwards consumed, when Pyrrhus attacked and shook it, and advanced victorious almost to the Roman capital!

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and not the Tarentines only, and the inhabitants of that tract of Italy which they call the greater Greece, whom you may suppose to have been led by the similarity of language and name, but the Lucanian, the Bruttian, and the Samnite revolted from us. Do you believe that these would continue quiet and faithful, if Philip should come over to Italy?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They subsequently continued faithful, forsooth, during the Punic war! Be assured those states will never fail to revolt from us, except when there is no one to whom they can go over.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If you had been annoyed at passing into Africa, you would this day have had Hannibal and the Carthaginians to contend with in Italy. Let Macedonia, rather than Italy, be the seat of war. Let the cities and lands of the enemy be wasted with fire and sword. We have already found by experience, that our arms are more powerful and more successful abroad than at home.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Go to the vote with the blessing <pb id="p.1348" n="1348"/>of the gods; and what the senate have voted, do you ratify by your order.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> This resolution is recommended to you, not only by your consul, but even by the immortal gods themselves; who, when I offered sacrifice, and prayed that the issue of this war might be happy and prosperous to me and to the senate, to you and the allies and Latin confederates, to our fleets and armies, portended all joyful and prosperous results.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech of Sulpicius, being sent to give their votes, they declared for the war as he had proposed.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On which, in pursuance of a decree of the senate, a supplication for three days was proclaimed by the consuls; and prayers were offered to the gods at all the shrines, that the war which the people had ordered against Philip might turn out well and happily.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul Sulpicius inquiring of the heralds, whether they would direct the declaration of the war against king Philip to be made to himself in person, or whether it would be sufficient to publish it in the nearest garrison, within the frontiers of his kingdom, they answered, that they would do rightly whichever course they should adopt.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul received authority from the senate to send any person whom he thought proper, not being a senator, as ambassador, to denounce war against the king. They then arranged for the armies of the consuls and praetors.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls were ordered to levy two legions, and to disband the veteran troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sulpicius, to whom the management of this new and highly important war had been decreed, was allowed permission to carry with him as many volunteers as he could procure out of the army which Publius Scipio had brought home from Africa; but he was not empowered to take with him any veteran soldier against his will.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They ordered that the consul should give to the praetors, Lucius Furius Purpureo and Quintus Minucius Rufus, five thousand of the allies of the Latin confederacy; with which forces they should hold, one, the province of Gaul, the other, Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Quintus Fulvius Gillo was ordered, in like manner, to select out of the army which Publius Aelius, late consul, had commanded, such as had been the shortest time in the service, until he also made up five thousand of the allies and Latin confederates; that this was to be the protection of the province of Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To Marcus Valerius Falto, who, during the former year, had held the province of Campania, as praetor, the command was continued <pb id="p.1349" n="1349"/>for a year;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> in order that he might go over, as propraetor, to Sardinia, and choose out of the army there five thousand of the allies of the Latin confederacy, who had served the fewest campaigns.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consuls were at the same time ordered to levy two legions for the city, which might be sent wherever occasions should require; as there were many states in Italy infected with an attachment to the Carthaginians, which they had formed during the war, and, in consequence, swelling with resentment. The state was to employ during that year six Roman legions.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the midst of the preparations for war, ambassadors came from king Ptolemy, who delivered a message; that <quote>the Athenians had petitioned the king for aid against Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but that although they were their common allies, yet the king would not, except with the sanction of the Roman people, send either fleet or army into Greece, for the purpose of defending or attacking any person.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That he would either remain quiet in his kingdom, if the Romans were at leisure to protect their allies; or, if more agreeable to them to be at rest, would himself send such aid as might easily secure Athens against Philip.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thanks were returned to the king by the senate, and this answer: that <quote>it was the intention of the Roman people to protect their allies; that if they should have occasion for any assistance towards carrying on the war, they would acquaint the king; and that they were fully sensible, that the resources of his kingdom were the sure and faithful support of their own state.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Presents were then, by order of the senate, sent to the ambassadors, of five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>16<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 1<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> to each. While the consuls were engaged in the levy, and preparing what was necessary for the war, the people, prone to religious observances, especially

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> at the beginning of new wars, after supplications had been already performed, and prayers offered up at all the shrines, lest any thing should be omitted that had ever been practised, ordered, that the consul who was to have the province of Macedonia should vow games and a present to Jove. Licinius, the chief pontiff, occasioned some delay to this public vow, alleging, that <quote>it ought not to be fulfilled from promiscuous funds.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For as the sum to be named could not be applied to the uses of the war, it should be immediately set apart, and not to be intermixed with other money; <pb id="p.1350" n="1350"/>and that, unless this were done, the vow could not be properly performed.</quote> Although the objection and the author of it were influential, yet the consul was ordered to consult the college of pontiffs, whether a vow could be undertaken at an indeterminate expense?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The pontiffs determined, that it could; and that it would be even more in order to do it in that way.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul, therefore, repeating after the chief pontiff, made the vow in the same words in which those made for five years of safety used to be expressed; only that he engaged to perform the games, and make the offerings, at such expense as the senate should direct by their vote, at the time when the vow was performed.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Before this, the great games, so often vowed, were constantly rated at a certain expense: these first at an unspecified amount.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While every one's attention was turned to the Macedonian war, and at a time when people apprehended nothing less, a sudden account was brought of an inroad of the Gauls.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Insubrians, Canomanians, and Boians, having been joined by the Salyans, Ilvatians, and other Ligurian states, and putting themselves under the command of Hamilcar, a Carthaginian, who, having been in the army of Hasdrubal, had remained in those parts, had fallen upon Placentia;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and, after plundering the city, and, in their rage, burning a great part of it, leaving scarcely two thousand men among the flames and ruins, passed the Po, and advanced to plunder Cremona.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The news of the calamity which had fallen on a city in their neighbourhood, having reached thither, the inhabitants had time to shut their gates, and place guards on the walls, that they might, at least, be besieged before they were taken, and send messengers to the Roman praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius Furius Purpureo, who had then the command of the province, had, in pursuance of the decree of the senate, disbanded the army, excepting five thousand of the allies and Latin confederacy; and had remained, with these troops, in the nearest district of the province about Ariminum. He immediately informed the senate, by letter, in what confusion the province was.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That, <quote>of the two colonies which had escaped in the dreadful storm of the Punic war, one was taken and sacked by the present enemy, and the other besieged.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor was his army capable of affording sufficient protection to the distressed colonists, unless he chose to expose five thousand allies to be slaughtered by forty thousand <pb id="p.1351" n="1351"/>invaders (for so many there were in arms); and by such a loss, on his side, to augment the courage of the enemy, already elated on having destroyed one Roman colony.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This letter having been read they decreed, that the consul Aurelius should order the army which he had appointed to assemble on a certain day in Etruria, to attend him on the same day at Ariminum;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and should either go in person, if the public business would permit, to suppress the tumult of the Gauls, or write to the praetor Lucius Furius, that, as soon as

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the legions from Etruria came to him, he should send five thousand of the allies to guard that place in the mean time, and should himself proceed to relieve the colony from the siege.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They also determined, that ambassadors should be sent to Carthage, and also into Numidia, to Masinissa: to Carthage, to announce that <quote>their countryman, Hamilcar, having been left in Gaul, (either with a part of the army formerly commanded by Hasdrubal, or with that of Mago &mdash;they

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> did not with certainty know which,) was waging war, contrary to the treaty. That he had excited the armies of the Gauls and Ligurians to arms against the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That, if they wished for peace, they must recall him, and give him up to the Roman people.</quote> They were ordered at the same time to tell them, that <quote>all the deserters had not been sent back; that a great part of them were said to appear openly in Carthage, who ought to be sought after, and surrendered according to the treaty.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such was the message to the Carthaginians. To Masinissa they were charged with congratulations, on his <quote>having not only recovered the kingdom of his father, but enlarged it by the acquisition of the most flourishing parts of Syphax's territories.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were ordered also to acquaint him, that <quote>a war had been undertaken against Philip, because he had given aid to

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the Carthaginians, while, by the injuries which he offered to the allies of the Roman people, he had obliged them to send fleets and armies into Greece, while Italy was blazing with war;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that by thus making them separate their forces, had been the principal cause of their being so late passing over into Africa; and to request him to send to that war supplies of Numidian horsemen.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Ample presents were given them to be carried to the king; vases of gold and silver, a purple robe, and a tunic adorned with palms of purple, an ivory sceptre, and a robe of state, with a curule <pb id="p.1352" n="1352"/>chair.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They were also directed to assure him, that if he deemed any thing further requisite to confirm and enlarge his kingdom, the Roman people, in return for his good services, would exert their utmost zeal to effect it.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At this time, too, ambassadors from Vermina, son of Syphax, came to the senate apologizing for his mistaken conduct, on account of his youth and want of judgment, and throwing all the blame on the deceitful policy of the Carthaginians:

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> adding, that as Masinissa had from an enemy become a friend to the Romans, so Vermina would also use his best endeavours that he should not be outdone in offices of friendship to the Roman people, either by Masinissa, or by any other; and requesting that he might receive from the senate the title of king, friend, and ally."

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The answer given to these ambassadors was, that <quote>not only his father Syphax, from a friend and ally, had on a sudden, without any reason, become an enemy to the Roman people, but that he himself had made his first essay of manhood in bearing arms against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He must, therefore, sue to the Roman people for peace, before he could expect to be acknowledged king, ally, and friend; that it was the practice of that people to bestow the honour of such title, in return for great services performed by kings towards them;

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> that the Roman ambassadors would soon be in Africa, to whom the senate would give instructions to regulate conditions of peace with Vermina, if he would leave the terms of it entirely to the will of the Roman people; and that, if he wished that any thing should be added, left out, or altered, he must make a second application to the senate.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The ambassadors sent to Africa on those affairs, were Caius Terentius Varro, Publius Lucretius, and Cneius Octavius, each of whom had a quinquereme assigned him.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A letter was then read in the senate, from Quintus Minucius, the praetor, who held the province of Bruttium, that <quote>the money had been privately carried off by night out of the treasury of Proserpine at Locri; and that there were no traces to those to whom the charge applied.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate was highly incensed at finding that the practice of sacrilege continued, and that even the fate of Pleminius, an example so recent and so conspicuous both of the guilt and of the punishment, did not deter men from it.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They ordered the consul, Cneius Aurelius, to signify to the praetor in Bruttium, <pb id="p.1353" n="1353"/>that <quote>it was the pleasure of the senate, that an inquiry be made concerning the robbery of the treasury, according to the method used by Marcus Pomponius, praetor, three years before;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that the money which could be discovered should be restored, that what was not found should be made up, and that, if he thought proper, atonements should be made for the purpose of expiating the violation of the temple, in the manner formerly prescribed by the pontiffs.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time, also, prodigies were announced as having happened in many places. It was said, that in Lucania the sky had been seen in a blaze; that at Privernum, in clear weather, the sun had been of a red colour during a whole day; that at Lanuvium, in the temple of Juno Sospita, a very loud noise had been heard in the night.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Besides, monstrous births of animals were related to have occurred in many places: in the country of the Sabines, an infant was born whose sex was doubtful; and another was found, sixteen years old, of doubtful sex.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At Frusino a lamb was born with a swine's head; at Sinuessa, a pig with a human head; and in Lucania, in the land belonging to the state, a foal with five feet.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> All these were considered as horrid and abominable, and as if nature were straying to strange productions. Above all, the people were particularly shocked at the hermaphrodites, which were ordered to be immediately thrown into the sea, as had been lately done with a production of the same monstrous kind, in the consulate of Caius Claudius and Marcus Livius.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Notwithstanding they ordered the decemvirs to inspect the books in regard of that prodigy; and the decemvirs, from the books, directed the same religious ceremonies which had been performed on an occasion of the same kind. They ordered, besides, a hymn to be sung through the city by thrice nine virgins, and an offering to be made to imperial Juno.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul, Caius Aurelius, took care that all these matters were performed according to the direction of the decemvirs. The hymn was composed by Publius Licinius Tegula, as a similar one had been, in the memory of their fathers, by Livius.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All religious scruples were fully removed by expiations; at Locri, too, the affair of the sacrilege had been thoroughly investigated by Quintus Minucius, and the money replaced in the treasury out of the effects of the guilty.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consuls wished to set out to their provinces, a <pb id="p.1354" n="1354"/>number of private persons, to whom the third payment became due that year, of the money which they had lent to the public in the consulate of Marcus Valerius and Marcus Claudius, applied to the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls, however, declared that the treasury being scarcely sufficient for the exigencies of a new war, in which a great fleet and great armies must be employed, there were no means of paying them at present.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate could not stand against them when they complained, that <quote>if the state intended to use, for the purpose of the Macedonian war, the money which had been lent for the Punic war, as one war constantly arose after another, what would be the issue, but that, in return for their generosity, their property would be confiscated as for some crime?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The demands of the private creditors being equitable, and the state being in no capacity of discharging the debt, they decreed a middle course between equity and convenience;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> resolving that <quote>whereas many of them mentioned that lands were frequently exposed to sale, and that they themselves wished to become purchasers, they should, therefore, have liberty to purchase any belonging to the public, and which lay within fifty miles of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That the consuls should make a valuation of these, and impose on each acre one <hi rend="italics">as,</hi> as an acknowledgment that the land was the property of the public, in order that, when the people should become able to

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> pay, if any one chose rather to have the money than the land, he might restore it.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The private creditors accepted the terms with joy; and that land was called Trientius and Tabulius, because it was given in lieu of the third part of their money.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Sulpicius, after making his vows in the Capitol, set out robed from the city with his lictors, and arrived at Brundusium;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> where, having formed into legions the veteran soldiers of the African army who were willing to follow him, and chosen his ships out of the fleet of the late consul, Cornelius, he crossed and arrived in Macedonia the day after he had set sail from Brundusium.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There he was met by ambassadors from the Athenians, entreating him to relieve them from the siege. Immediately, Caius Claudius Centho was despatched to Athens, with twenty ships of war, and a thousand of land forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For it was not the king himself who carried on the siege of Athens; he was at that time besieging <pb id="p.1355" n="1355"/>Abydus, after having tried his strength in naval contests against Attalus, and against the Rhodians, without success in either engagement.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But, besides the natural presumptuousness of his temper, he acquired confidence from a treaty which he had formed with Antiochus, king of Syria, in which they had divided the wealth of Egypt between them; on which, on hearing of the death of Ptolemy, they were both intent.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Athenians now had entangled themselves in a war with Philip on too trifling an occasion, and at a time when they retained nothing of their former condition but their pride.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During the celebration of the mysteries, two young men of Acarnania, who were not initiated, unapprized of its being an offence against religion, entered the temple of Ceres along with the rest of the crowd:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> their discourse readily betrayed them, by their asking some absurd questions; whereupon, being carried before the presidents of the temple, although it was evident that they went in through mistake, yet they were put to death, as if for a heinous crime.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Acarnanian nation made complaint to Philip of this barbarous and hostile act. and prevailed on him to grant them some aid of Macedonian soldiers, and to allow them to make war on the Athenians.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At first this army, after ravaging the lands of Attica with fire and sword, retired to Acarnania with booty of all kinds. This was the first provocation to hostilities. The Athenians afterwards, on their side, entered into a regular war, and proclaimed it by order of the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For king Attalus and the Rhodians, having come to Aegina in pursuit of Philip, who was retiring to Macedonia, the king crossed over to Piraeus, for the purpose of renewing and confirming his alliance with the Athenians.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On entering the city, the whole inhabitants received him, pouring forth with their wives and children to meet him; the priests, with their emblems of religion; and in a manner the gods themselves, called forth from their abodes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately the people were summoned to an assembly, that the king might treat with them in person on such subjects as he chose;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but afterwards it was judged more suitable to his dignity to explain his sentiments in writing, than, being present, to be forced to blush, either at the recital of his favours to the state, or at the immoderate applause of the multitude, which would overwhelm his modesty with acclam- <pb id="p.1356" n="1356"/>ations, and other signs of approbation.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the letter which he sent, and which was read to the assembly, was contained, first, a recapitulation of his acts of kindness to the state, as his ally;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> then, of the actions which he had performed against Philip; and lastly, an exhortation to <quote>enter immediately on the war; while they had himself, the Rhodians, and the Romans also to assist them;</quote> not omitting to warn them, that <quote>if they were backward now, they would hereafter wish in vain for the opportunity which they neglected.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They then gave audience to the ambassadors of the Rhodians, to whom they were under a recent obligation for having retaken, and sent home, four of their ships of war, which had been lately seized by the Macedonians.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> War was determined upon against Philip with universal consent. Unbounded honours were conferred on king Attalus, and then on the Rhodians. At that time, mention was made of adding a tribe, which they were to call Attalus, to the ten ancient tribes;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the Rhodian state was presented with a golden crown, as an acknowledgment of its bravery, and the freedom of the city was given to the inhabitants, in like manner as the Rhodians had formerly given it to the Athenians.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After this, king Attalus returned to his fleet at Aegina. From Aegina, the Rhodians sailed to Cia, and thence to Rhodes, through the islands, all of which they brought to join in the alliance, except Andros, Paros, and Cythnus, which were held by Macedonian garrisons.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Attalus, having sent messengers to Aetolia, and expecting ambassadors from thence, was detained at Aegina for some time in a state of inaction; failing also in his endeavours to excite the Aetolians to arms, for they were rejoiced at having made peace with Philip on any terms.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Had Attalus and the Rhodians pressed Philip vigorously, they might have acquired the illustrious title of the deliverers of Greece, but by suffering him to pass over again into Hellespontus, and to strengthen himself by seizing the

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> advantageous posts in Greece, they increased the difficulties of the war, and yielded up to the Romans the glory of having conducted and finished it.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip acted with a spirit more becoming a king; for, though he had found himself unequal to the forces of Attalus and the Rhodians, yet he was not dismayed, even by the Roman war with which he was threatened.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sending Philocles, one of his generals, with two thousand foot and two <pb id="p.1357" n="1357"/>hundred horse, to ravage the lands of the

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> Athenians, he gave the command of his fleet to Heraclides, to make for Maronea, and marched thither himself by land, with two thousand foot lightly equipped, and two hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Maronea he took at the first assault; and afterwards, with a good deal of trouble, got possession of Aenus, which was at last betrayed to him by Ganymede, the lieutenant of Ptolemy. He then seized on other forts, Cypselus, Doriscos, and Serrheus; and, advancing from thence to the Chersonesus, received Elaeus and Alopeconnesus, which were surrendered by the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Callipolis also, and Madytos, were given up to him, with several forts of but little consequence.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The people of Abydus shut their gates against him, not admitting the ambassadors. This siege detained Philip a long time; and it might have been relieved, had not Attalus and the Rhodians been dilatory.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king sent only three hundred men for a garrison, and the Rhodians one quadrireme from their fleet, although it was lying idle at Tenedos:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and afterwards, when the besieged could with difficulty hold out any longer, Attalus, going over in person, did nothing more than show them some hope of relief being near, giving no assistance to these his allies either by land or sea.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At first the people of Abydus, by means of engines placed along the walls, not only prevented the approaches by land, but annoyed the enemy's ships in their station.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Afterwards a part of the wall being thrown down, and the assailants having penetrated by mines to an inner wall, which had been hastily raised to oppose their entrance, they sent ambassadors to the king about the conditions of the surrender of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They demanded permission to send away the Rhodian quadrireme, with the crew, and the troops of Attalus in the garrison; and that they themselves might depart from the city, each with one suit of apparel.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When Philip's answer afforded no hopes of accommodation, unless they surrendered at discretion, this repudiation of their embassy so exasperated them, at once through indignation and despair, that, seized with the same kind of fury which had possessed the Saguntines, they ordered all the matrons to

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> be shut up in the temple of Diana, and the free-born youths and virgins, and even the infants with their nurses, in the place of exercise; the gold and silver to be carried into the forum;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> their valu- <pb id="p.1358" n="1358"/>able garments to be put on board the Rhodian ship, and another from Cyzicum, which lay in the harbour; the priests and victims to be brought, and altars to be erected in the midst.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There they appointed a select number, who, as soon as they should see the army of their friends cut off in defending the breach, were instantly to slay their wives and children; to throw into the sea the gold, silver, and apparel that was on board the ships, and to set fire to the buildings, public and private:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and to the performance of this deed they were bound by an oath, the priests repeating before them the verses of execration.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Those who were of an age capable of fighting, then swore that they would not leave their ranks alive unless victorious.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> These, regardful of the gods, (by whom they had sworn,) maintained their ground with such obstinacy, that although the night would soon have put a stop to the fight, yet the king, terrified by their fury, first desisted from the fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The chief inhabitants, to whom the more shocking part of the plan had been given in charge, seeing that few survived the battle, and that these were exhausted by fatigue and wounds, sent the priests (having their heads bound with the fillets of suppliants) at the dawn of the next day to surrender the city to Philip.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the surrender, one of the Roman ambassadors, who had been sent to Alexandria, Marcus Aemilius, being the youngest of them, on the joint resolution of the three, on hearing of the present siege, came to Philip, and complained of his having made war on Attalus and the Rhodians;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and particularly that he was then besieging Abydus; and on Philip's saying that he had been forced into the war by Attalus and the Rhodians commencing hostilities against him, &mdash; <quote>Did the people of Abydus, too,</quote> said he, <quote>commence hostilities against you?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To him, who was unaccustomed to hear truth, this language seemed too arrogant to be used to a king, and he answered, &mdash;<quote>Your youth, the beauty of your form, and, above all, the name of Roman, render you too presumptuous.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> However, my first desire is, that you would observe the treaties, and continue in peace with me; but if you begin an attack, I am, on my part, determined to prove that the kingdom and name of the Macedonians is not less formidable in war than that of the Romans.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having dismissed the ambassador in this manner, Philip got possession of <pb id="p.1359" n="1359"/>the gold and silver which had been thrown together in a heap, but lost his booty with respect to prisoners:

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for such violent frenzy had seized the multitude, that, on a sudden, taking up a persuasion that those who had fallen in the battle had been treacherously sacrificed, and upbraiding one another with perjury, especially the priests, who would surrender alive to the enemy those persons whom they themselves had devoted, they all at once ran different ways to put their wives and children to death; and then they put an end to their own lives by every possible method.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king, astonished at their madness, restrained the violence of his soldiers, and said, <quote>that he would allow the people of Abydus three days to die in;</quote> and, during this space, the vanquished perpetrated more deeds of cruelty on themselves than the enraged conquerors would have committed;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> nor did any one of them come into his hands alive, except such as chains, or some other insuperable restraint, forbade to die.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Philip, leaving a garrison in Abydus, returned to his kingdom; and, just when he had been encouraged by the destruction of the people of Abydus to proceed in the war against Rome, as Hannibal had been by the destruction of Saguntum, he was met by couriers, with intelligence that the consul was already in Epirus, and had drawn his land forces to Apollonia, and his fleet to Corcyra, into winter quarters.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the mean time, the ambassadors who had been sent into Africa, on the affair of Hamilcar, the leader of the Gallic army, received from the Carthaginians this answer: that <quote>it was not in their power to do more than to inflict on him the punishment of exile, and to confiscate his effects;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that they had delivered up all the deserters and fugitives, whom, on a diligent inquiry, they had been able to discover, and would send ambassadors to Rome, to satisfy the senate on that head.</quote> They sent two hundred thousand measures of wheat to Rome, and the same quantity to the army in Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From thence the ambassadors proceeded into Numidia, to the king; delivered to Masinissa the presents and the message according to their instructions, and out of two thousand Numidian horsemen, which he offered, accepted one thousand.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Masinissa superintended in person the embarkation of these, and sent them, with two hundred thousand measures of wheat, and the same quantity of barley, into Macedonia. Their third <pb id="p.1360" n="1360"/>commission was with Vermina.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He advanced to meet them as far as the utmost limits of his kingdom, and left it to themselves to prescribe such conditions of peace as they thought proper, declaring, that <quote>he should consider any peace with the Roman people as just and advantageous.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The terms were then settled, and he was ordered to send ambassadors to Rome to procure a ratification of the treaty.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, proconsul, came home from Spain;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and having laid before the senate an account of his brave and successful conduct, during the course of many years, demanded that he might be allowed to enter the city in triumph.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate gave their opinion, that <quote>his services were, indeed, deserving of a triumph; but that they had no precedent left them by their ancestors of any person enjoying a triumph, who had not performed the service either of dictator, consul, or praetor;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that he had held the province of Spain in quality of proconsul, and not of consul, or praetor</quote> They determined, however, that he might enter the city in ovation.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Against this, Tiberius Sempronius Longus, tribune of the people, protested, alleging, that such proceedings would be no more in accordance with the custom of their ancestors, or with any precedent, than the other;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but, overcome at length by the unanimous desire of the senate, the tribune withdrew his opposition, and Lucius Lentulus entered the city in ovation.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He carried to the treasury forty-four thousand pounds weight of silver, and two thousand four hundred pounds weight of gold. To each of the soldiers he distributed, of the spoil, one hundred and twenty <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi>7<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 9<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consular army had, by this time, been conducted from Arretium to Ariminum, and the five thousand Latin confederates had crossed from Gaul into Etruria.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Furius, therefore, advanced from Ariminum, by forced marches, against the Gauls, who were then besieging Cremona, and pitched his camp at the distance of one mile and a half from the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Furius had an opportunity of performing a splendid exploit, had he, without halting, led his troops directly to attack their camp; scattered hither and thither, they were wandering through the country;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and the guard, which they had left, was not sufficiently strong; but he was apprehensive that his men were too much fatigued by <pb id="p.1361" n="1361"/>their hasty march.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Gauls, recalled from the fields by the shouts of their party, returned to the camp without seizing the booty within their reach, and, next day, marched out to offer battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman did not decline the combat, but had scarcely time to draw up his forces, so rapidly did the enemy advance to the fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The right brigade (for he had the troops of the allies divided into brigades) was placed in the first line, the two Roman legions in reserve. Marcus Furius was at the head of the right brigade, Marcus Caecilius of the legions, and Lucius Valerius Flaccus of the cavalry: these were all lieutenant-generals.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Two other lieutenant-generals, Cneius Laetorius and Publius Titinnius, the praetor kept near himself, that, with their assistance, he might observe and take proper measures against all sudden attempts of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At first, the Gauls, bending their whole force to one point, were in hopes of being able to overwhelm, and trample under foot, the right brigade, which was in the van;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but not succeeding, they endeavoured to turn round the flanks, and to surround their enemy's line, which, considering the multitude of their forces, and the small number of the others, seemed easy to be done.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On observing this, the praetor, in order to extend his own line, brought up the two legions from the reserve, and placed them on the right and left of the brigade which was engaged in the van;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> vowing a temple to Jupiter, if he should rout the enemy on that day.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> To Lucius Valerius he gave orders, to make the horsemen of the two legions on one flank, and the cavalry of the allies on the other, charge the wings of the enemy, and not suffer them to come round to his rear.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At the same time, observing that the centre of the line of the Gauls was weakened, from having extended the wings, he directed his men to make an attack there in close order, and to break through their ranks.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The wings were routed by the cavalry, and, at the same time, the centre by the foot; and suddenly, being worsted in all parts with great slaughter, the Gauls turned their backs, and fled to their camp in hurry and confusion.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The cavalry pursued them as they fled; and the legions, coming up in a short time after, assaulted the camp, from whence there did not escape so many as six thousand men.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> There were slain and taken above thirty-five thousand, with seventy standards, and above two hundred Gallic waggons laden with much booty. Hamilcar, <pb id="p.1362" n="1362"/>the Carthaginian general, fell in that battle, and three distinguished generals of the Gauls.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The prisoners taken at Placentia, to the number of two thousand free-men, were restored to the colony.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This was an important victory, and caused great joy at Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On receipt of the praetor's letter, a supplication for three days was decreed. In that battle, there fell of the Romans and allies two thousand, most of them in the right brigade, against which, in the first onset, the most violent efforts of the enemy had been directed.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Although the praetor had brought the war almost to a conclusion, yet the consul, Cneius Aurelius, having finished the business which was necessary to be done at Rome, set out for Gaul, and received the victorious army from the praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul, arriving in his province towards the end of autumn, passed the winter in the neighbourhood of Apollonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Caius Claudius, and the Roman triremes which had been sent to Athens from the fleet that was laid up at Corcyra, as was mentioned above, arriving at Piraeeus, greatly revived the hopes of their allies, who were beginning to give way to despair.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For not only did those inroads by land cease, which used to be made from Corinth through Megara, but the ships of the pirates from Chalcis, who

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> had been accustomed to infest both the Athenian sea and coast, were afraid not only to venture round the promontory of Sunium, but even to trust themselves out of the straits of the Euripus. In addition to these came three quadriremes from Rhodes, the Athenians having three open ships, which they had equipped for the protection of their lands on the coast.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While Claudius thought, that if he were able with his fleet to give security to the Athenians it was as much as could be expected at present, a fortunate opportunity was thrown in his way of accomplishing a much more important enterprise.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some exiles driven from Chalcis, by ill treatment received from the king's party, brought intelligence, that the place might be taken without even a contest;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for that both the Macedonians, being under no immediate apprehension from an enemy, were straying idly about the country; and that the townsmen, depending on the Macedonian garrison, neglected the guard of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Claudius, on this authority, set out, and though he arrived at Sunium early enough to have <pb id="p.1363" n="1363"/>sailed forward to the entrance of the strait of Eub&oelig;a, yet fearing that, on doubling the promontory, he might be descried by the enemy, he lay by with the fleet until night.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As soon as it grew dark he began to move, and, favoured by a calm, arrived at Chalcis a little before day; and then, approaching the city, on a side where it was thinly inhabited, with a small party of soldiers, and by means of scaling ladders, he got possession of the nearest tower, and the wall on each side; the guards being asleep in some places, and in others no one being on the watch.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thence they advanced to the more populous parts of the town, and having slain the sentinels, and broke open a gate, they gave an entrance to the main body of the troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These immediately spread themselves throughout the whole city, and increased the tumult by setting fire to the buildings round the forum, by

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> which means both the granaries belonging to the king, and his armoury, with a vast store of machines and engines, were reduced to ashes.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then commenced a general slaughter of those who fled, as well as of those who made resistance; and after having either put to the sword or driven out every one who was of an age fit to bear arms, (Sopater also, the Acarnanian, who commanded the garrison, being slain,) they first collected all the spoils in the forum, and then carried it on board the ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The prison, too, was forced open by the Rhodians, and those prisoners whom Philip had shut up there, as in the safest custody, were set at liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They next pulled down and mutilated the statues of the king; and then, on a signal being given for a retreat, re-embarked and returned to Piraeus, from whence they had set out.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If there had been so large a force of Roman soldiers that Chalcis might have been retained and the protection of Athens not neglected, Chalcis and Euripus might have been taken from the king; &mdash;a most important advantage at the commencement of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For as the pass of Thermopylae is the principal barrier of Greece by land, so is the strait of the Euripus by sea.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip was then at Demetrias, and as soon as the news arrived there of the calamity which had befallen the city of his allies, although it was too late to carry assistance to those who were already ruined, yet

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> anxious to accomplish what was next to assistance, revenge, he set out instantly with five thousand foot lightly equipped, and three hundred horse. <pb id="p.1364" n="1364"/>With a speed almost equal to that of racing, he hastened to Chalcis, not doubting but that he should be able to surprise the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Being disappointed in this expectation, and having arrived, with no other result than a melancholy view of the smoking ruins of that friendly city, (so few being left, that they were scarcely sufficient to bury those who had fallen in the conflict,) with the same rapid haste which he had used in coming, he crossed the Euripus by the bridge, and led his troops through B&oelig;otia to Athens, in hopes that a similar issue would correspond to a similar attempt.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And it would have corresponded, had not a scout, (one of those whom the Greeks call day-runners,<note>Hemerodromoi.</note> because they run through a journey of great length in one day,) descrying from his post of

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> observation the king's army in its march, set out at midnight, and arrived before them at Athens.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The same sleep, and the same negligence, prevailed there which had proved the ruin of Chalcis a few days before. Roused, however, by the alarming intelligence, the praetor of the Athenians, and Dioxippus, commander of a cohort of mercenary auxiliaries, called the soldiers together in the forum, and ordered the trumpets to sound an alarm from the citadel, that all might be informed of the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On which the people ran from all quarters to the gates, and afterwards to the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In a few hours after, and still some time before day, Philip approached the city, and observing a great number of lights, and hearing the noise of the men hurrying to and fro, as usual on such an alarm, he halted his troops, and ordered them to sit down and take some rest; resolving to use open force, since his stratagem had not succeeded.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly he advanced on the side of Dipylos. This gate, being situated in the principal approach of the city, is somewhat larger and wider than the rest. Both within and without the streets are wide, so that the townsmen could form their troops from the forum to the gate, while on the outside a road of about a mile in length, leading to the school of the academy, afforded open room to the foot and horse of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Athenians, who had formed their troops within the gate, marched out with Attalus's garrison, and the cohort of Dioxippus, along that road.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Which, when Philip observed, thinking that he had the enemy in his power, and was now about to sate him- <pb id="p.1365" n="1365"/>self with their long wished for destruction, (being more incensed against them than any of the Grecian states,) he exhorted his men to keep their eyes on him during the fight, and to take notice, that wherever the king was, there the standards and the army ought to be.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then spurred on his horse against the enemy, animated not only with resentment, but with a desire of gaining honour, for he reckoned it a glorious thing to be beheld fighting from the

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> walls, which were filled with an immense multitude, for the purpose of witnessing the engagement.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Advancing far before the line, and, with a small body of horse, rushing into the midst of the enemy, he inspired his men with great ardour, and the Athenians equally with terror.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Having wounded many with his own hand, both in close fight and with missive weapons, and driven them back within the gate, he still pursued them closely; and having made greater slaughter among them while embarrassed in the narrow pass, rash as the attempt was, he yet had an unmolested retreat, because those who were in the towers withheld their weapons

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> lest they should hit their friends, who were mingled in confusion among their enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The Athenians, after this, confining their troops within the walls, Philip sounded a retreat, and pitched his camp at Cynosarges, a temple of Hercules, and a school surrounded by a grove.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But Cynosarges, and Lycaum, and whatever was sacred or pleasant in the neighbourhood of the city, he burned to the ground, and levelled not only the houses, but sepulchres, nor was any thing either in divine or human possession preserved amidst the violence of his rage.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day, the gates having at first been shut, and afterwards suddenly thrown open, in consequence of a body of Attalus's troops from Aegina, and the Romans from Piraeeus, having entered the city, the king removed his camp to the distance of about three miles.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From thence he proceeded to Eleusis, in hopes of surprising the temple, and a fort which overlooks and surrounds it; but, finding that the watches had not been neglected, and that the fleet was coming from Piraeeus to support them, he laid aside the design, and led his troops, first to Megara, and then to Corinth; where, on hearing that the council of the Achaeans was then sitting at Argos, he went and joined the assembly, unexpected by the Achaeans.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were at the time consulting about a war against <pb id="p.1366" n="1366"/>Nabis, tyrant of the Lacedaemonians; who, on the command being transferred from Philop&oelig;men to Cycliades, a general by no means his equal, perceiving that the confederates of the Achaeans were falling off, had renewed the war, was ravaging the territories of his neighbours, and had become formidable even to the cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While they were deliberating what number of men should be raised out of each of the states to oppose this enemy, Philip promised that he would relieve them of that care, as far as concerned Nabis and the Lacedaemonians;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and that he would not only secure the lands of their allies from devastation, but transfer the whole terror of the war on Laconia itself, by leading his army thither instantly.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This discourse being received with general approbation, he added, &mdash;"It is but reasonable, however, that while I am employed in protecting your property by my arms, my own should not be deprived of protection;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> therefore, if you think proper, provide such a number of troops as will be sufficient to secure Orcus, Chalcis, and Corinth; that my affairs being in a state of safety behind me, I may without anxiety make war on Nabis and the Lacedaemonians.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Achaeans were not ignorant of the tendency of this so kind promise, and of his proffered assistance against the Lacedaemonians; that his purpose was to draw the Achaean youth out of Peloponnesus as hostages, in order to implicate the nation in a war with the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Cycliades, the Achaean praetor, thinking that it was irrelevant to develope the matter by argument, said nothing more than that it was not allowable, according to the laws of the Achaeans, to take any matters into consideration except those on which they had been called together:

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and the decree for levying an army against Nabis being passed, he dismissed the assembly, after having presided in it with much resolution and public spirit, and until that day having been reckoned among the partisans of the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philip, disappointed in a high expectation, after having collected a few voluntary soldiers, returned to Corinth, and from thence into the territories of Athens.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In those days in which Philip was in Achaia, Philocles, one of the king's generals, marching from Eub&oelig;a with two thousand Thracians and Macedonians, in order to lay waste the territories of the Athenians, crossed the forest of Cithaeron opposite to Eleusis.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Despatching half of his troops, <pb id="p.1367" n="1367"/>to make depredations in all parts of the country, he himself lay concealed with the remainder in a place convenient for an ambush;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> in order that, if any attack should be made from the fort at Eleusis on his men employed in plundering, he might suddenly fall upon the enemy unawares, and while they were in disorder.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His stratagem did not escape discovery: wherefore, calling back the soldiers, who had gone different ways in pursuit of booty, and drawing them up in order, he advanced to assault the fort at Eleusis; but being repulsed from thence with many wounds, he formed a junction with Philip on his return from Achaia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The storming of this fort was also attempted by the king in person: but the Roman ships coming from Piraeeus, and a body of forces thrown into the fort, compelled him to relinquish the design.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On this the king, dividing his army, sent Philocles with one part to Athens, and went himself with the other to Piraeeus; that, while his general, by advancing to the walls and threatening an assault, might keep the Athenians within the city, he might be able to make himself master of the harbour, when left with only a slight garrison.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But he found the attack of Piraeeus no less difficult than that of Eleusis, the same persons for the most part acting in its defence. He therefore hastily led his troops to Athens, and being repulsed by a sudden sally of both foot

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and horse, who engaged him in the narrow ground, enclosed by the half-ruined wall, which, with two arms, joins Piraeeus to Athens, he desisted from the assault of the city, and, dividing his forces again with Philocles, set out to complete the devastation of the country.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As, in his former ravages, he had employed himself in levelling the sepulchres round the city, so now, not to leave any thing

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> unviolated, he ordered the temples of the gods, of which they had one consecrated in every village, to be demolished and burned.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The country of Attica afforded ample matter for the exercise of this barbarous rage: being highly embellished with works of that kind, having plenty of indigenous marble, and abounding with artists of exquisite ingenuity.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nor was he satisfied with merely destroying the temples themselves, and overthrowing the images, but he ordered even the stones to be broken, lest, remaining whole, they should give stateliness to the ruins;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and then, his rage not being satiated, but no object remaining on which it could be exercised, he retired <pb id="p.1368" n="1368"/>from the country of the enemy into B&oelig;otia, without having performed in Greece any thing else worth mention.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, Sulpicius, who was at that time encamped on the river Apsus, between Apollonia and Dyrrachium, having ordered Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, thither, sent him with part of the forces to lay waste the enemy's territory.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Apustius, after ravaging the frontiers of Macedonia, and having, at the first assault, taken the forts of Corragos, Gerrunios, and Orgessos, came to Antipatria, a city situated in a narrow gorge;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> where, at first inviting the leading men to a conference, he endeavoured to entice them to commit themselves to the good faith of the Romans; but finding that from confidence in the size, fortifications, and situation of their city, they paid no regard to his discourse, he attacked the place by force of arms, and took it by assault:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> then, putting all the young men to death, and giving up the entire spoil to his soldiers, he razed the walls and burned the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This proceeding spread such terror, that Codrion, a strong and well-fortified town, surrendered to the Romans without a struggle.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Leaving a garrison there, he took Ilion by force, a name better known than the town, on account of that of the same name in Asia. As the lieutenant-general was returning to the consul with a great quantity of spoil, Athenagoras, one of the king's generals, falling on his extreme rear, in its passage over a river, threw the hindmost into disorder.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On hearing the shouting and tumult, Apustius rode back in full speed, ordered the troops to face about, and drew them up in order, arranging the baggage in the centre. The king's troops could not support the onset of the Roman soldiers, many of them were slain, and more made prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The lieutenant-general, having brought back the army without loss to the consul, was despatched immediately to the fleet.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The war commencing thus brilliantly with this successful expedition, several petty kings and princes, neighbours of the Macedonians, came to the Roman camp: Pleuratus, son of Scerdilaedus, and Amynander, king of the Athamanians; and from the Dardanians, Bato, son of Longarus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This Longarus had, in his own quarrel, supported a war against Demetrius, father of Philip. To their offers of aid, the consul answered, that he would make use of the assistance of the Dardanians, and of Pleuratus, when he should <pb id="p.1369" n="1369"/>lead his troops into Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To Amynander he allotted the part of exciting the Aetolians to war. To the ambassadors of Attalus, (for they also had come at the same time,) he gave directions that the king should wait at Aegina, where he wintered, for the arrival of the Roman fleet; and when joined by that, he should, as before, harass Philip with attacks by sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To the Rhodians, also, an embassy was sent, to engage them to contribute their share towards carrying on the war. Nor was Philip, who had by this time arrived in Macedonia, remiss in his preparations for the campaign.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He sent his son Perseus, then very young, with part of his forces to block up the pass near Pelagonia, appointing persons out of the number of his friends to direct his inexperienced age.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sciathus and Peparethus, no inconsiderable cities, he demolished, lest they should become a prey and prize to the enemy's fleet; despatching at the same time ambassadors to the Aetolians, lest that restless nation might change sides on the arrival of the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The assembly of the Aetolians, which they call Panetolium, was to meet on a certain day. In order to be present at this, the king's ambassadors hastened their journey, and Lucius Furius Purpureo also arrived, deputed by the consul. Ambassadors from the Athenians, likewise, came to this assembly.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Macedonians were first heard, as with them the latest treaty had been made;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and they declared, that <quote>as no change of circumstances had occurred, they had nothing new to introduce: for the same reasons which had induced them to make peace with Philip, after experiencing the unprofitableness of an alliance with the Romans, should engage them to preserve it, now that it was established.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Do you rather choose,</quote> said one of the ambassadors, <quote>to imitate the inconsistency, or levity, shall I call it, of the Romans, who ordered this answer to be given to your ambassadors at Rome: 'Why, Aetolians, do you apply to us, when, without our approbation, you have made peace with Philip?' Yet these same people now require that you should, in conjunction with them, wage war against Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Formerly, too, they pretended that they took arms on your account, and in your defence against Philip: now they do not allow you to continue at peace with him. To assist Messana, they first embarked for Sicily; and a second time, that they might redeem Syracuse to freedom <pb id="p.1370" n="1370"/>when oppressed by the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both Messana and Syracuse, and all Sicily, they hold in their own possession, and have reduced it into a tributary province under their axes and rods.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> You imagine, perhaps, that in the same manner as you hold an assembly at Naupactus, according to your own laws, under

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> magistrates created by yourselves, at liberty to choose allies and enemies, and to have peace or war at your own option, so the assembly of the states of Sicily is summoned to Syracuse, or Messana, or Lilybaeum. No, a Roman praetor presides at the meeting; summoned by his command they assemble; they behold him, attended by his lictors, seated on a lofty throne, issuing his haughty edicts.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His rods are ready for their backs, his axes for their necks, and every year they are allotted a different master. Neither ought they, nor can they, wonder at this, when they see all the cities of Italy bending under the same yoke, &mdash;Rhegium,

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Tarentum, Capua, not to mention those in their own neighbourhood, out of the ruins of which their city of Rome grew into power.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Capua indeed subsists, the grave and monument of the Campanian people, that entire people having been either cut off or driven into banishment; the mutilated carcass of a city, without senate, without commons, without magistrates; a sort of prodigy, the leaving which to be inhabited, showed more cruelty than if it had been utterly destroyed.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If foreigners who are separated from us to a greater distance by their language, manners, and laws, than by the distance by sea and land, are allowed to get footing here, it is madness to hope that any thing will continue in its present state.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Does the sovereignty of Philip seem in any degree incompatible with your freedom, who, at a time when he was justly incensed against you, demanded nothing more of you than peace; and at present requires no more than the observance of the peace which he agreed to?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Accustom foreign legions to these countries, and receive the yoke; too late, and in vain, will you look for Philip as an ally, when you shall have the Roman as a master.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Trifling causes occasionally unite and disunite the Aetolians, Acarnanians, and Macedonians, men speaking the same language. With foreigners, with barbarians, all Greeks have, and ever will have, eternal war: because they are enemies by nature, which is always the same, and not from causes which change with the times. My discourse shall <pb id="p.1371" n="1371"/>conclude with the same argument with which it began.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Three years since, the same persons, assembled in this same place, determined on peace with the same Philip, contrary to the inclinations of the same Romans, who now wish that the peace should be broken, after it has been adjusted and ratified. In the subject of your deliberation, fortune has made no change; why you should make any, I do not see.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next, after the Macedonians, with the consent and at the desire of the Romans, the Athenians were introduced; who, having suffered grievously, could, with the greater justice, inveigh against the cruelty and inhumanity of the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They represented, in a deplorable light, the miserable devastation and spoliation of their fields; adding, that <quote>they did not complain on account of having, from an enemy, suffered hostile treatment; for there were certain rights of war, according to which, as it was just to act, so it was just to endure.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their crops being burned, their houses demolished, their men and cattle carried off as spoil, were to be considered rather as misfortunes to the sufferer than as ill-treatment.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But of this they had good reason to complain, that he who called the Romans foreigners and barbarians, had himself so atrociously violated all rights, both divine and human, as, in his former inroad, to have waged an impious war against the infernal gods, in the latter, against those above.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That the sepulchres and monuments of all within their country had been demolished, the graves laid open, and the bones left unprotected by the soil. There had been several temples, which, in former times, when their ancestors dwelt

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> in the country in their separate districts, had been consecrated in each of their little forts and villages, and which, even after they were incorporated into one city, they did not neglect or forsake.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That around all these temples Philip had scattered his destructive flames, and left the images of the gods lying scorched and mutilated among the prostrated pillars of their fanes. Such as he had rendered the country of Attica, formerly opulent and adorned, such, if he were suffered, would he render Aetolia and the whole of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That the mutilation of their own city, also, would have been similar, if the Romans had not come to its relief:

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for he had shown the same wicked rage against the gods who are the guardians of the city, and Minerva who presides over the citadel; the same against the temple of <pb id="p.1372" n="1372"/>Ceres at Eleusis; the same against Jupiter and Minerva at Piraeeus.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In a word, having been repelled by force of arms, not only from their temples, but even from their walls, he had vented his fury on those sacred edifices which were protected by religion alone.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They therefore entreated and besought the Aetolians, that, compassionating the Athenians, and with the immortal gods for their leaders, and, under them, the Romans, who, next to the gods, possessed the greatest power, they would take part in the war.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman ambassador then replied: <quote>The Macedonians first, and afterwards the Athenians, have obliged me to change entirely the method of my discourse.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For, on the one hand, the Macedonians, by aggressively introducing charges against the Romans, when I had come prepared to make complaint of the injuries committed by Philip against so many cities in alliance with us, have obliged me to think of defence rather than accusation;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and, on the other hand, what have the Athenians, after relating his inhuman and impious crimes against the gods both celestial and infernal, left for me, or any one else, which I can further urge against him.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> You are to suppose, that the same complaints are made by the Cianians, Abydenians, Aeneans, Maronites, Thasians, Parians, Samians, Larissenians, Messenians, on the side of Achaia; and complaints, still heavier and more grievous, by those whom he had it more in his power to injure.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For as to those proceedings which he censures in us, if they are not deserving of honour, I will admit that they cannot be defended at all. He has objected to us, Rhegium, and Capua, and Syracuse.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As to Rhegium, during the war with Pyrrhus, a legion which, at the earnest request of the Rhegians themselves, we had sent thither as a garrison, wickedly possessed themselves of the city which they had been sent to defend.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Did we then approve of that deed? or did we exert the force of our arms against that guilty legion, until we reduced them under our power; and then, after making them give satisfaction to the allies, by their stripes and the loss of their heads, restore to the Rhegians their city, their lands, and all their effects, together with their liberty and laws?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To the Syracusans, when oppressed, and that by foreign tyrants, which was a still greater indignity, we lent assistance; and after enduring great fatigues in carrying on the siege of so strong a city, both by land and sea, <pb id="p.1373" n="1373"/>for almost three years, (although the Syracusans themselves chose to continue in slavery to the tyrants rather than be taken to us,) yet, becoming masters of the place, and by exertion of the same force setting it at liberty, we restored it to the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At the same time, we do not deny that Sicily is our province, and that the states which sided with the Carthaginians, and, in conjunction with them, waged war against us, pay us tribute and taxes;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> on the contrary, we wish that you and all nations should know, that the condition of each is such as it has deserved at our hands: and ought we to repent of the punishment inflicted on the Campanians, of which even they themselves cannot complain?

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These men, after we had on their account carried on war against the Samnites for near seventy years, with great loss on our side; had united them to ourselves, first by treaty, and then by intermarriages, and the relationships arising thence;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and lastly, by the right of citizenship; yet, in the time of our adversity, were the first of all the states of Italy which revolted to Hannibal, after basely putting our garrison to death, and afterwards, through resentment at being besieged by us, sent Hannibal to attack Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If neither their city nor one man of them had been left remaining, who could take offence, or consider them as treated with more severity than they had deserved?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From consciousness of guilt, greater numbers of them perished by their own hands, than by the punishments inflicted by us.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And while from the rest we took away the town and the lands, still we left them a place to dwell in, we suffered the city which partook not of the guilt to stand uninjured; so that he who should see it this day would find no trace of its having been besieged or taken. But why do I speak of Capua, when even to vanquished Carthage we granted peace and liberty?

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The greatest danger is, that, by our too great readiness to pardon the conquered, we may encourage others to try the fortune of war against us.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Let so much suffice in our defence, and against Philip, whose domestic crimes, whose parricides and murders of his relations and friends, and whose lust, more disgraceful to human nature, if possible, than his cruelty, you, as being nearer to Macedonia, are better acquainted with.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> As to what concerns yourselves, Aetolians, we entered into a war with Philip on your account: you made peace with him without consulting us. <pb id="p.1374" n="1374"/>Perhaps you will say, that while we were occupied in the Punic war, you were constrained by fear to accept terms of pacification, from him who at that time possessed superior power;

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> and that on our side, pressed by more urgent affairs, we suspended our operations in a war which you had laid aside.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> At present, as we, having, by the favour of the gods, brought the Punic war to a conclusion, have fallen on Macedonia with the whole weight of our power, so you have an opportunity offered you of regaining a place in our friendship and alliance, unless you choose to perish with Philip, rather than to conquer with the Romans.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>






<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these things had been said by the ambassador, the minds of all leaning towards the Romans, Damocritus, praetor of the Aetolians, (who, it was reported, had received money from the king,) assenting in no degree to one party or the other, said, &mdash;that <quote>in consultations of great and critical importance, nothing was so injurious as haste.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That repentance, indeed, generally followed, and that quickly, but yet too late and unavailing; because designs carried on with precipitation could not be recalled, nor matters brought back to their original state. The time, however, for determining the point under consideration, which, for his part, he thought should not be too early, might yet immediately be fixed in this manner.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As it had been provided by the laws, that no determination should be made concerning peace or war, except in the Panaetolic or Pylaic councils; let them immediately pass a decree, that the praetor, when he chooses to treat respecting war and peace, may have full authority to summon a council;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and that whatever shall be then debated and decreed, shall be, to all intents and purposes, legal and valid, as if it had been transacted in the Panaetolic or Pylaic assembly.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And thus dismissing the ambassadors, with the matter undetermined, he said, that therein he had acted most prudently for the interest of the state; for the Aetolians would have it in their power to join in alliance with whichever of the parties should be more successful in the war. Such were the proceedings in the council of the Aetolians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Philip was making vigorous preparations for carrying on the war both by sea and land.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His naval forces he drew together at Demetrias in Thessaly; supposing that Attalus, and the Roman fleet, would move from Aegina <pb id="p.1375" n="1375"/>in the beginning of the spring.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He gave the command of the fleet and of the sea-coast to Heraclides, to whom he had formerly intrusted it. The equipment of the land forces he took care of in person; considering that he had deprived the Romans of two powerful auxiliaries, the Aetolians on the one side, and the Dardanians on the other, by making his son Perseus block up the pass at Pelagonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul was employed, not in preparations, but in the operations of war. He led his army through the country of the Dassaretians, conveying the corn untouched which he had brought from his winter quarters, for the fields afforded supplies sufficient for the consumption of the troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The towns and villages surrendered to him, some through inclination, others through fear; some were taken by assault, others were found deserted, the barbarians flying to the neighbouring mountains.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He fixed a standing camp at Lycus near the river Bevus, and from thence sent to bring in corn from the magazines of the Dassaretians. Philip saw the whole country filled with consternation, and not knowing the designs of the consul, he sent a party of horse to discover whither he was directing his course.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same state of uncertainty possessed the consul; he knew that the king had moved from his winter quarters, but in what direction he had proceeded he knew not: he also had sent horsemen to gain intelligence.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These two parties, having set out from opposite quarters, after wandering a long time among the Dassaretians, through unknown roads, fell at length into the same track. Neither doubted, as soon as the noise of men and horses was heard at a distance, that the enemy was approaching, therefore, before they came within sight of each other, they got their arms in readiness, nor, when they saw their foe, was there any delay in engaging.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As they happened to be nearly equal in number and valour, being picked men on both sides, they fought during several hours with vigour, until fatigue, both of men and horses, put an end to the fight, without deciding the victory. Of the Macedonians there fell forty horsemen; of the Romans thirty-five.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Still, however, neither did the one party carry back to the king, nor the other to the consul, any certain information in what quarter the camp of his enemy lay.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But this was soon made known to them by deserters, whom their <pb id="p.1376" n="1376"/>recklessness of disposition supplies in all wars in sufficient number to discover the affairs of the contending parties.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, judging that he should make some progress towards conciliating the affections of his men, and induce them to face danger more readily on his account, if he

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> bestowed some pains on the burial of the horsemen who fell in that expedition, ordered them to be conveyed into the camp, in order that all might be spectators of the honours paid them at their funeral.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nothing is so uncertain, or so difficult to form a judgment of, as the minds of the multitude. That which seems calculated to increase their alacrity, in exertions of every sort, often creates in them fear and inactivity.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, those who, being always accustomed to fight with Greeks and Illyrians, had only seen wounds made with javelins and arrows, seldom even by lances, came to behold bodies dismembered by the Spanish sword, some with their arms lopped off, with the shoulder or the neck entirely cut through, heads severed from the trunk, and the bowels laid open, with other frightful exhibitions of wounds: they therefore perceived, with horror, against what weapons and what men they were to fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even the king himself was seized with apprehensions, having never yet engaged the Romans in a regular battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Wherefore, recalling his son, and the guard posted at the pass of Pelagonia, in order to strengthen his army by the addition of those troops, he thereby opened a passage into Macedonia for Pleuratus and the Dardanians.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, taking deserters for guides, he marched towards the enemy with twenty thousand foot and four thousand horse, and at the distance of somewhat more than a thousand paces from the Roman camp, and near Ithacus, he fortified a hill with a trench and rampart.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From this place, taking a view of the Roman station in the valley beneath, he is said to have been struck with admiration, both at the general appearance of the camp, and the regular disposition of each particular part; then with the disposition of the tents, and the intervals of the passages; and to have declared, that, certainly, that could not be regarded by any as the camp of barbarians.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For two days, the consul and the king, each waiting for the other's making some attempt, kept their troops within the ramparts. On the third day, the Roman led out all his forces, and offered battle. <pb id="p.1377" n="1377"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the king, not daring to risk so hastily a general engagement, sent four hundred Trallians, who are a tribe of the Illyrians, as we have said in another place, and three hundred Cretans; adding to this body of infantry an equal number of horse, under the command of Athenagoras, one of his nobles honoured with the purple, to make an attack on the enemy's cavalry.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When these troops arrived within a little more than five hundred paces, the Romans sent out the light infantry, and two cohorts of horse, that both cavalry and infantry might be equal in number to the Macedonians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king's troops expected that the method of fighting would be such as they had been accustomed to; that the horsemen, pursuing and retreating alternately, would at one time use their weapons, at another time turn their backs; that the agility of the Illyrians would be serviceable for excursions and sudden attacks, and that the Cretans might discharge their arrows against the enemy, as they advanced eagerly to the charge.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the onset of the Romans, which was not more vigorous than persevering, entirely disconcerted this method of fighting:

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for the light infantry, as if they were fighting with their whole line of battle, after discharging their javelins, carried on a close fight with their swords; and the horsemen, when they had once made a charge, stopping their horses, fought, some on horseback, while others dismounted and intermixed themselves with the foot.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By this means neither were the king's cavalry, who were unaccustomed to a steady fight, a match for the others; nor were the infantry, who were only skirmishing and irregular troops, and were besides but half covered with the kind of harness which they used, at all equal to the Roman infantry, who carried a sword and buckler, and were furnished with proper armour, both to defend themselves and to annoy the

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> enemy': nor did they sustain the combat, but fled to their camp, trusting entirely to their speed for safety.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After an interval of one day, the king, resolving to make an attack with all his forces of cavalry and light-armed infantry, had, during the night, placed in ambush, in a

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> convenient place between the two camps, a body of targeteers, whom they call Peltastae, and given orders to Athenagoras and the cavalry, if they found they had the advantage in the open fight, to pursue their success; if otherwise, that they should <pb id="p.1378" n="1378"/>retreat leisurely, and by that means draw on the enemy to the place where the ambush lay.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The cavalry accordingly did retreat; but the officers of the body of targeteers, by bringing forward their men before the time, and not waiting for the signal, as they ought, lost an opportunity of performing considerable service. The Romans, having gained the victory in open fight, and also escaped the danger of the ambuscade, retired to their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Next day the consul marched out with all his forces, and offered battle, placing his elephants in the front of the foremost battalions. Of this resource the Romans then for the first time availed themselves; having a number of them which had been taken in the Punic war.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Finding that the enemy kept himself quiet behind his intrenchments, he advanced close up to them, upbraiding him with cowardice; and as, notwithstanding, no opportunity of an engagement was afforded, the consul, considering how dangerous foraging must be while the camps lay so near each other, where the cavalry were ready at any moment to attack the soldiers, when dispersed through the country, removed his camp to a place called Ortholophus, distant about eight miles,

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> where by reason of the intervening distance he could forage with more safety.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While the Romans were collecting corn in the adjacent fields, the king kept his men within the trenches, in order to increase both the negligence and confidence of the enemy. But, when he saw them scattered, he set out with all his cavalry, and the auxiliary Cretans, and marching with such speed that

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the swiftest footmen could, by running, but just keep up with the horse, he planted his standards between the camp of the Romans and their foragers. Then, dividing the forces, he sent one part of them in quest of the marauders, with orders to leave not one alive; with the other, he himself halted, and placed guards on the roads through which the enemy seemed likely to fly back to their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And now carnage and flight prevailed in all directions, and no intelligence of the misfortune had yet reached the Roman camp, because those who fled towards the camp fell in

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> with the guards, which the king had stationed to intercept them, and greater numbers were slain by those who were placed in the roads, than by those who had been sent out to attack them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At length, a few effected their escape, through the midst of the enemy's posts, but were so filled with terror, that they ex- <pb id="p.1379" n="1379"/>cited a general consternation in the camp, rather than brought intelligible information.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, ordering the cavalry to carry aid to those who were in danger, in the best manner they could, drew out the legions from the camp, and led them drawn up in a square towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The cavalry, taking different ways through the fields, missed the road, being deceived by the various shouts raised in several quarters.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some of them met with the enemy, and battles began in many places at once. The hottest part of the action was at the station where the king commanded; for the guard there was, in numbers both of horse and foot, almost a complete army; and, as they were posted on the middle road, the greatest number of the Romans fell in with them.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Macedonians had also the advantage in this, that the king himself was present to encourage them; and the Cretan auxiliaries, fighting in good order, and in a state of preparation, against troops disordered and irregular, wounded many at a distance, where no such danger was apprehended.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If they had acted with prudence in the pursuit, they would have secured an advantage of great importance, not only in regard to the glory of the present contest, but to the general interest of the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but, greedy of slaughter, and following with too much eagerness, they fell in with the advanced cohorts of the Romans under the military tribunes.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The horsemen who were flying, as soon as they saw the ensigns of their friends, faced about against the enemy, now in disorder; so that in a moment's time the fortune of the battle was changed, those now turning their backs who had lately been the pursuers.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many were slain in close fight, many in the pursuit; nor was it by the sword alone that they perished; several, being driven into morasses, were, together with their horses, swallowed up in the deep mud.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king himself was in danger; for his horse falling, in consequence of a wound, threw him headlong to the ground, and he very narrowly escaped being overpowered while prostrate.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He owed his safety to a trooper, who instantly leaped down and mounted the affrighted king on his horse; himself, as he could not on foot keep up with the flying horsemen, was slain by the enemy, who had collected about the place where Philip fell.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The king, in his desperate flight, rode about among the morasses, some of which were easily passed, and others not; <pb id="p.1380" n="1380"/>at length, when most men despaired of his ever escaping in safety, he arrived in safety at his camp. Two hundred Macedonian horsemen perished in that action; about one hundred were taken:

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> eighty horses, richly caparisoned, were led off the field; at the same time the spoils of arms were also carried off.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There were some who found fault with the king, as guilty of rashness on that day; and with the consul, for want of energy. For Philip, they say, on his part, ought to have avoided coming to action, knowing that in a few days the enemy, having exhausted all the adjacent country, must be reduced to the extremity of want;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that the consul, after having routed the Macedonian cavalry and light infantry, and nearly taken the king himself, ought to have led on his troops directly to the

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> enemy's camp, where, dismayed as they were, they would have made no stand, and that he might have finished the war in a moment's time. This, like most other matters, was easier to be talked about than to be done.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For, if the king had brought the whole of his infantry into the engagement, then, indeed, during the tumult, and while, vanquished and struck with dismay, they fled from the field into their intrenchments, (and even continued their flight from thence on seeing the victorious enemy mounting the ramparts,) the king might have been deprived of his camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But as some forces of infantry had remained in the camp, fresh and free from fatigue, with outposts before the gates, and guard properly disposed, what would he have done but imitated the rashness of which the king had just now been guilty, by pursuing the routed horse?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the other side, the king's first plan of an attack on the foragers, while dispersed through the fields, would not have been a subject of censure, could he have satisfied himself with a moderate degree of success:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and it is the less surprising that he should have made a trial of fortune, as there was a report, that Pleuratus and the Dardanians had set out from home with very numerous forces, and had already passed into Macedonia;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> so that if he should be surrounded on all sides by these forces, there was reason to think that the Roman might put an end to the war without stirring from his seat.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Philip, however, considered, that after his cavalry had been defeated in two engagements, he could with much less safety continue in the same post; accordingly, wish- <pb id="p.1381" n="1381"/>ing to remove from thence, and, at the same time, to keep the enemy in ignorance of his design, he sent a herald to the consul a little before sun-set, to demand a truce for the purpose of burying the horsemen;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and thus imposing on him, he began his march in silence, about the second watch, leaving a number of fires in all parts of his camp.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul was now taking refreshment, when he was told that the herald had arrived, and on what business;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he gave him no other answer, than that he should be admitted to an audience early the next morning: by which means Philip gained what he wanted &mdash;the length of that night, and part of the following day, during which he might get the start on his march.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He directed his route towards the mountains, a road which he knew the Romans with their heavy baggage would not attempt. The consul, having, at the first light, dismissed the herald with a grant of a truce, in a short time after discovered that the enemy had gone off; but not knowing what course to take in pursuit of them, he remained in the same camp for several days, which he employed in collecting forage.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then marched to Stubera, and brought thither, from Pelagonia, the corn that was in the fields. From thence he advanced to Pluvina, not having yet discovered to what quarter the Macedonian had bent his course.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Philip, having at first fixed his camp at Bryanium, marched thence through cross-roads, and gave a sudden alarm to the enemy. The Romans, on this, removed from Pluvina, and pitched their camp near the river Osphagus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king also sat down at a small distance, forming his intrenchment on the bank of a river which the inhabitants call Erigonus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having there received certain information that the Romans intended to proceed to Eordaea, he marched away before them, in order to take possession of the defiles, and prevent the enemy from making their way, where the roads are confined in narrow straits.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There, with great haste, he fortified some places with a rampart, others with a trench, others with stones heaped up instead of walls, others with trees laid across, according as the situation required, or as materials lay convenient;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and thus a road, in its own nature difficult, he rendered, as he imagined, impregnable by the works which he drew across every pass.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The adjoining ground, being mostly covered with woods, was exceedingly incommodious to the phalanx of <pb id="p.1382" n="1382"/>the Macedonians, which is of no manner of use, except when they extend their very long spears before their shields, forming as it were a palisade; to perform which, they require an open plain.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Thracians, too, were embarrassed by their lances, which also are of a great length, and were entangled among the branches that stood in their way on every side.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The body of Cretans alone was not unserviceable; and yet even these, though, in case of an attack made on them, they could to good purpose discharge their arrows against the horses or riders, where they were open to a wound, yet against the Roman shields they could do nothing, because they had neither strength sufficient to pierce through them, nor was there any part exposed at which they could aim.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Perceiving, therefore, that kind of weapon to be useless, they annoyed the enemy with stones, which lay in plenty in all parts of the valley: the strokes made by these on their shields, with greater noise than injury, for a short time retarded the advance of the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> but quickly disregarding these missiles also, some, closing their shields in form of a tortoise, forced their way through the enemy in front;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> others having, by a short circuit, gained the summit of the hill, dislodged the dismayed Macedonians from their guards and posts, and even slew the greater part of them, their retreat being embarrassed by the difficulties of the ground.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus, with less opposition than they had expected to meet, the defiles were passed, and they came to Eordaea; then, having laid waste the whole country, the consul withdrew into Elimea. From thence he made an irruption into Orestis, and attacked the city Celetrum, situated in a peninsula: a lake surrounds the walls; and there is but one entrance from the main land along a narrow isthmus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Relying on their situation, the townsmen at first shut the gates, and refused to submit;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but afterwards, when they saw the troops in motion, and advancing in the tortoise method, and the isthmus covered by the enemy marching in, they surrendered in terror rather than hazard a struggle.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From Celetrum he advanced into the country of the Dassaretians, took the city Pelium by storm, carried off the slaves with the rest of the spoil, and discharging the freemen without ransom, restored the city to them, after placing a strong garrison in it, for it was very conveniently situated for making inroads into Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.1383" n="1383"/>Having thus traversed the enemy's country, the consul led back his forces into those parts which were already reduced to obedience near Apollonia, from whence the campaign had commenced.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip's attention had been drawn to other quarters by the Aetolians, Athamanians, and Dardanians: so many were the wars that started up on different sides of him.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Against the Dardanians, who were now retiring out of Macedonia, he sent Athenagoras with the light infantry and the greater part of the cavalry, and ordered him to hang on their rear as they retreated;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and, by cutting off their hindmost troops, make them more cautious for the future of leading out their armies from home.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As to the Aetolians, Damocritus, their praetor, the same who at Naupactum had persuaded them to defer passing a decree concerning the war, had in the next meeting roused them to arms, after the report of the battle between the cavalry at Ortholophus; the irruption of the Dardanians and of Pleuratus, with the Illyrians, into Macedonia; of the arrival of the Roman fleet, too, at Oreus;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that Macedonia, besides being beset on all sides by so many nations, was in danger of being invested by sea also.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These reasons had brought back Damocritus and the Aetolians to the interest of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marching out, therefore, in conjunction with Amynander, king of the Athamanians, they laid siege to Cercinium.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The inhabitants here had shut their gates, whether of their own choice or by compulsion is unknown, as they had a garrison of the king's troops. However, in a few days Cercinium was taken and burned; and after great slaughter had been made, those who survived, both freemen and slaves, were carried off amongst other spoil.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This caused such terror, as made all those who dwelt round the lake Baebius abandon their cities and fly to the mountains:

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and the Aetolians, in the absence of booty, turned away from thence, and proceeded into Perrhaebia. There they took Cyretiae by storm and sacked it unmercifully. The inhabitants of Mall&oelig;a, making a voluntary submission, were received into alliance.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From Perrhaebia, Amynander advised to march to Gomphi, because that city lies close to Athamania, and there was reason to think that it might be reduced without any great difficulty.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the Aetolians, for the sake of plunder, directed their march to the rich plains of Thessaly. Amynander following, though he <pb id="p.1384" n="1384"/>did not approve either of their careless method of carrying on their depredations, or of their pitching their camp in any place which chance presented, without choice, and without taking any care to fortify it.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Therefore, lest their rashness and negligence might be the cause of some misfortune to himself and his troops, when he saw them forming their camp in low grounds, under the city Phecadus, he took possession,

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> with his own troops, of an eminence about five hundred paces distant, which could be rendered secure by a slight fortification.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Aetolians seemed to have forgotten that they were in an enemy's country, excepting that they continued to plunder, some straggling about half-armed, others spending whole days and nights alike in drinking and sleeping in the camp, neglecting even to fix guards, when Philip unexpectedly came upon them. His approach being announced by those who had fled out of the fields in a fright, Damocritus and the rest of the officers were thrown into great confusion.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It happened to be mid-day, and when most of the men after a hearty meal lay fast asleep.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Their officers roused them, however, as fast as possible; ordered them to take arms; despatched some to recall those who were straggling through the fields in search of plunder; and so violent was their hurry, that many of the horsemen went out without their swords, and but few of them put on their corslets.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After marching out in this precipitate manner, (the whole horse and foot scarcely making up six hundred,) they met the king's cavalry, superior in number, in spirit, and in arms. They were, therefore, routed at the first charge; and having scarcely attempted resistance, returned to the camp in shameful flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Several were slain; and some taken, having been cut off from the main body of the fugitives.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, when his troops had advanced almost to the rampart, ordered a retreat to be sounded, because both men and horses were fatigued, not so much by the action, as at once by the length of their march, and the extraordinary celerity with which they had made it.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He therefore despatched the horsemen by troops, and the companies of light infantry in turn, to procure water and take refreshment.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The rest he kept on guard, under arms, waiting for the main body of the infantry, which had marched with less expedition, on account of the weight of their armour.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As soon as these <pb id="p.1385" n="1385"/>arrived, they also were ordered to fix their standards, and, laying down their arms before them, to take food in haste; sending two, or at most three, out of each company, to provide water. In the mean time the cavalry and light infantry stood in order, and ready, in case the enemy should make any movement.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Aetolians, as if resolved to defend their fortifications, (the multitude which had been scattered about the fields having, by this time, returned to the camp,) posted bodies of armed men at the gates, and on the rampart, and from this safe situation looked with a degree of confidence on the enemy, as long as they continued quiet.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But, as soon as the troops of the Macedonians began to move, and to advance to the rampart, in order of battle, and ready for an assault, they all quickly abandoned their posts, and fled through the opposite part of the camp, to the eminence where the Athamanians were stationed. During their flight in this confusion, many of the Aetolians were slain, and many made prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Philip doubted not that, had there been day-light enough remaining, he should have been able to make himself master of the camp of the Athamanians also; but the day having been spent in the fight, and in plundering the camp afterwards, he sat down under the eminence, in the adjacent plain, determined to attack the enemy at the first dawn of the following day.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the Aetolians, under the same apprehensions which had made them desert their camp, dispersed, and fled during the following night. Amynander was of the greatest service; for, by his directions, the Athamanians, who were acquainted with the roads, conducted them into Aetolia, whilst the Macedonians pursued them over the highest mountains, through unknown paths.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In this disorderly flight, a few, missing their way, fell into the hands of the Macedonian horsemen, whom Philip, at the earliest dawn, on seeing the eminence abandoned, had sent to harass the marching body of the enemy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time also Athenagoras, one of the king's generals, overtaking the Dardanians in their retreat homeward, at first threw their rear into disorder; but these unexpectedly facing about, and forming their line, the fight became like a regular engagement.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the Dardanians began again to advance, the Macedonian cavalry and light infantry harassed those who had no troops of that kind to aid <pb id="p.1386" n="1386"/>them, and were, besides, burdened with unwieldy arms. The ground, too, favoured the assailants: very few were slain, but many wounded; none were taken, because they rarely quit their ranks, but both fight and retreat in a close body.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thus Philip, having checked the proceedings of those two nations by these well-timed expeditions, gained reparation for the damages sustained from the operations of the Romans; the enterprise being as spirited as the issue was successful.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> An occurrence which accidentally happened to him lessened the number of his enemies on the side of AEtolia. Scopas, a man of considerable influence in his own country, having been sent from Alexandria by king Ptolemy, with a great sum of gold, hired and carried away to Egypt six thousand foot and four hundred horse;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> nor would he have suffered one of the young Aetolians to remain at home, had not Damocritus, (it is not easy to say, whether out of zeal for the good of the nation, or out of opposition to

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> Scopas, for not having secured his interest by presents,) by sometimes reminding them of the war which threatened them, at other times, of

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the solitary condition in which they would be, detained some of them at home by severe reproaches. Such were the actions of the Romans, and of Philip, during that summer.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the same summer, the fleet under Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, setting sail from Corcyra, and passing by Malea, formed a junction with king Attalus, off Scyllaeum, which lies in the district of Hermione.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Athenian state, which had for a long time, through fear, restrained their animosity against Philip within some bounds, in the expectation of approaching aid afforded them, gave full scope to it all.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There are never wanting in that city orators, who are ready on every occasion to inflame the people; a kind of men, who, in all free states, and more particularly in that of Athens, where eloquence flourishes in the highest degree, are maintained by the favour of the multitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These immediately proposed a decree, and the commons passed it, that <quote>all the statues and images of Philip, with their inscriptions, and likewise those of all his ancestors, male and female, should be taken down and destroyed; that the festal days, solemnities, and priests, which had been instituted in honour of him or of his predecessors, should all be abolished; and that even the ground where any such statue <pb id="p.1387" n="1387"/>had been set up, and inscribed to his honour, should be held abominable.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And it was resolved, that, <quote>for the future, nothing which ought to be erected or dedicated in a place of purity should be there erected;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and that the public priests, as often as they should pray for the people of Athens, for their allies, armies, and fleets, so often should they utter curses and execrations against Philip, his offspring, his kingdom, his forces by sea and land, and the whole race and name of the Macedonians.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was added to the decree, that, <quote>if any person in future should make any proposal tending to throw disgrace and ignominy on Philip, the people of Athens would ratify it in its fullest extent:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> if, on the contrary, any one should, by word or deed, endeavour to lessen his ignominy, or to do him honour, that whoever slew him who should have so said or done, should be justified in so doing.</quote> Lastly, a clause was annexed, that <quote>all the decrees, formerly passed against the Pisistratidae, should be in full force against Philip.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thus the Athenians waged war against Philip with writings and with words, in which alone their power consisted.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Attalus and the Romans, having, from Hermione, proceeded first to Piraeus, and staid there a

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> few days, after being loaded with decrees of the Athenians, (in which the honours paid to their allies were as extravagant as the expressions of their resentment against

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> their enemy had been,) sailed from Piraeeus to Andros, and, coming to an anchor in the harbour called Gaureleos, sent persons to sound the inclinations of the townsmen, whether they chose voluntarily to surrender their city, rather than run the hazard of an assault.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On their answering, that they were not at their own disposal, but that the citadel was occupied by the king's troops, Attalus and the Roman lieutenant-general, landing their forces, with every thing requisite for attacking towns, made their approaches to the city on different sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman standards and arms, which they had never seen before, together with the spirit of the soldiers, so briskly approaching the walls, were particularly terrifying to the Greeks. A retreat was immediately made into the citadel, and the enemy took possession of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After holding out for two days in the citadel, relying more on the strength of the place than on their arms, on the third both they and the garrison surrendered the city and citadel, on condition of their being transported to Delium in B&oelig;otia, and <pb id="p.1388" n="1388"/>being each of them allowed a single suit of apparel.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The island was yielded up by the Romans to king Attalus; the spoil, and the ornaments of the city, they themselves carried off. Attalus, desirous that the island, of which he had got possession, might not be quite deserted, persuaded almost all the Macedonians, and several of the Andrians, to remain there:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and, in some time after, those who, according to the capitulation, had been transported to Delium, were induced to return from thence by the promises made them by the king, in which they were disposed the more readily to confide, by the ardent affection which they felt for their native country.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From Andros they passed over to Cythnus; there they spent several days, to no purpose, in assaulting the city; when, at length, finding it scarcely worth the trouble, they departed.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At Prasiae, a place on the main land of Attica, twenty barks of the Issaeans joined the Roman fleet. These were sent to ravage the lands of the Carystians, the rest of the fleet lying at Geraestus, a noted harbour in Eub&oelig;a, until the Issaeans returned from Carystus: on which, setting sail all together, and steering their course through the open sea, until they passed by Scyrus, they arrived at the island of Icus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Being detained there for a few days by a violent northerly wind, as soon as the weather was fair, they passed over to

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> Sciathus, a city which had been lately plundered and desolated by Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The soldiers, spreading themselves over the country, brought back to the ships corn and what other kinds of provisions could be of use to them. Plunder there was none, nor had the Greeks deserved to be plundered.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Directing their course thence to Cassandrea, they first came to Mendis, a village on the coast of that state; and, intending from thence to double the promontory, and bring round the fleet to the very walls of the city, a violent tempest arising, they were near being buried in the waves. However, after being dispersed, and a great part of the ships having lost their rigging, they escaped on shore.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> This storm at sea was an omen of the kind of success which they were to meet on land; for, after collecting their vessels together, and landing their forces, having made an assault on the city, they were repulsed with many wounds, there being a strong garrison of the king's troops in the place. Being thus obliged to retreat without accom- plishing their design, they passed over to Canastrum in <pb id="p.1389" n="1389"/>Pallene, and from thence, doubling the promontory of Torona, conducted the fleet to Acanthus. There they first laid waste the country, then stormed the city itself, and plundered it.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They proceeded no farther, for their ships were now heavily laden with booty, but went back to Sciathus, and from Sciathus to Eub&oelig;a, whence they had first set out.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Leaving the fleet there, they entered the Malian bay with ten light ships, in order to confer with the Aetolians on the method of conducting the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sipyrrhicas, the Aetolian, was at the head of the embassy that came to Heraclea, to hold a consultation with the king and the Roman lieutenant-general.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They demanded of Attalus, that, in pursuance of the treaty, he should supply them with one thousand soldiers, which number he had engaged for on condition of their taking part in the war against Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was refused to the Aetolians, because on their part they had formerly showed themselves unwilling to march out to ravage Macedonia, at a time when Philip, being employed near Pergamus in destroying by fire every thing sacred and profane, they might have compelled him to retire from thence, in order to preserve his own territories.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus, instead of aid, the Aetolians were dismissed with hopes, the Romans making them large promises. Apustius with Attalus returned to the ships, where they began to concert measures for the siege of Oreus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This city was well secured by fortifications; and also, as an attempt had formerly been made on it, by a strong garrison. After the taking of Andros, twenty Rhodian ships, all decked vessels, had formed a junction with them, under the command of Agesimbrotus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This squadron they sent to the station off Zelasium, a promontory of Isthmia, very conveniently situate beyond Demetrias, in order that, if the ships of the Macedonians should attempt any movement, they might act as a defensive force.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Heraclides, the king's admiral, kept his fleet there, rather with a view of laying hold of any advantage which the negligence of the enemy might afford him, than with a design of attempting any thing by open force.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Romans and king Attalus carried on their attacks against Oreus on different sides; the Romans against the citadel next to the sea, the king's troops against the lower part of the town, lying between the two citadels, where the city is also divided by a wall.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As their posts were different, so were their methods of <pb id="p.1390" n="1390"/>attack: the Romans made their approaches by means of covered galleries, applying also the ram to the walls; the king's troops, by throwing in weapons with the balista, catapulta, and every other kind of engine, and stones also of immense weight. They formed mines, too, and made use of every expedient, which, on trial, had been found useful in the former siege.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the other side, not only did more Macedonians protect the town and the citadels, than on the former occasion, but they exerted themselves with greater spirit, in consequence of the reprimands which they had received from the king for the misconduct they had committed, and also from remembrance both of his threats and promises with regard to the future.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus, when time was being consumed there, contrary to their expectation, and there was more hope from a siege and works than from a sudden assault, the lieutenant-general thought that in the mean time some other business. might be accomplished; wherefore, leaving such a number of men as seemed sufficient to finish the works, he passed over to the nearest part of the continent, and, arriving unexpectedly, made himself master of Larissa, except the citadel, &mdash;not that celebrated city in Thessaly, but another, which they call Cremaste.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Attalus also surprised Aegeleos, where nothing was less apprehended than such an enterprise during the siege of another city.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The works at Oreus had now begun to take effect, while the garrison within were almost spent with unremitted toil, (keeping watch both by day and night,) and also with wounds.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Part of the wall, being loosened by the strokes of the ram, had fallen down in many places; and the Romans, during the night, broke into the citadel through the breach which lay over the harbour.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Attalus, likewise, at the first light, on a signal given from the citadel by the Romans, himself also assaulted the city, where great part of the walls had been levelled; on which the garrison and townsmen fled into the other citadel, and a surrender was made two days after. The city fell to the king, the prisoners to the Romans.</p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The autumnal equinox now approached, and the Eub&oelig;an gulf, called C&oelig;la, is reckoned dangerous by mariners. Choosing, therefore, to remove thence before the winter storms came on, they returned to Piraeus, from whence they had set out for the campaign.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Apustius, leaving there thirty <pb id="p.1391" n="1391"/>ships, sailed by Malea to Corcyra. The king was delayed during the celebration of the mysteries of Ceres, that he might assist at the solemnities, immediately after which he also retired into Asia, sending home Agesimbrotus and the Rhodians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Such, during that summer, were the proceedings, by sea and land, of the Roman consul and lieutenant-general, aided by Attalus and the Rhodians, against Philip and his allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul, Caius Aurelius, on coming into his province, and finding the war there already brought to a conclusion, did not dissemble his resentment against the praetor, for having proceeded to action in his absence; wherefore, sending him away to Etruria, he led on the legions into the enemy's country, and, by laying it waste, carried on the war with more spoil than glory.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius Furius, finding nothing in Etruria that could give him employment, and at the same time intent

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> on obtaining a triumph for his success against the Gauls, which he considered would be more easily accomplished in the absence of the consul, who envied and was enraged against him, came to Rome unexpectedly, and called a meeting of the senate in the temple of Bellona;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> where, after making a recital of the services which he had performed, he demanded to be allowed to enter the city in triumph.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With a great part of the senate he prevailed, owing to private interest and the importance of his services.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The elder part refused him a triumph, both <quote>because the army, with which he had acted, belonged to another; and because he had left his province through an ambitious desire of snatching that opportunity of procuring a triumph, &mdash;but

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that he had taken this course without any precedent.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senators of consular rank particularly insisted, that <quote>he ought to have waited for the consul; for that he might, by pitching his camp near the city, and thereby securing the colony without coming to an engagement, have protracted the affair until his arrival; and that, what the praetor had not done, the senate ought to do; they should wait for the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After hearing the business discussed by the consul and praetor in their presence, they would be able, more correctly, to form a judgment on the case.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Great part were of opinion, that the senate ought to consider nothing but the service performed, and whether he had performed it while in office, and under his own auspices.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For, <quote>when of two colonies, which had been <pb id="p.1392" n="1392"/>opposed, as barriers, to restrain the tumultuous inroads of the Gauls, one had been already sacked and burned, the flames being ready to spread (as if from an adjoining house) to the other colony, which lay so near, what ought the praetor to have done?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For if it was improper to enter on any action without the consul, then the senate had acted wrong in giving the army to the praetor; because, if they chose that the business should be performed, not under the praetor's auspices, but the consul's, they might have limited the decree in such a manner, that not the praetor, but the consul, should manage it;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> or else the consul had acted wrong, who, after ordering the army to remove from Etruria into Gaul, did not meet it at Ariminum, in order to be present at operations, which were not allowed to be performed without him.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But the exigencies of war do not wait for the delays and procrastinations of commanders; and battles must be sometimes fought, not because commanders choose it, but because the enemy compels it. The fight itself, and the issue of the fight, is what ought to be regarded now.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The enemy were routed and slain, their camp taken and plundered, the colony relieved from a siege, the prisoners taken from the other colony recovered and restored to their friends, and an end put to the war in one battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And not only men rejoiced at this victory, but the immortal gods also had supplications paid to them, for the space of three days, on account of the business of the state having been wisely and successfully, not rashly and unfortunately, conducted by Lucius Furius, praetor. Besides, the Gallic wars were, by some fatality, destined to the Furian family.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By means of discourses of this kind, made by him and his friends, the interest of the praetor, who was present, prevailed over the dignity of the absent consul, and the majority decreed a triumph to Lucius Furius.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Furius, praetor, during his office, triumphed over the Gauls. He carried into the treasury three hundred and twenty thousand <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi><note>1033<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 8<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> and one hundred and seventy thousand pounds' weight of silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were neither any prisoners led before his chariot, nor spoils carried before him, nor did any soldiers follow him. It appeared that every thing, except the victory, belonged to the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The games which Publius Scipio had vowed when consul in Africa, were then celebrated, in a magnificent <pb id="p.1393" n="1393"/>manner, and with

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> respect to the lands for his soldiers, it was decreed, that whatever number of years each of them had served in Spain or in Africa, he should, for every year, receive two acres; and that ten commissioners should distribute that land.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Three commissioners were then appointed to fill up the number of colonists at Venusia, because the strength of that colony had been reduced in the war with Hannibal: Caius Terentius Varro, Titus Quintius Flamininus, Publius Cornelius, son of Cneius Scipio, enrolled the colonists for Venusia.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During the same year, Caius Cornelius Cethegus, who in the capacity of proconsul commanded in Spain, routed a numerous army of the enemy in the territory of Sedeta; in which battle, it is said, that fifteen thousand Spaniards were slain, and seventy-eight military standards taken.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul Caius Aurelius, on returning from his province to Rome to hold the elections, made heavy complaints, not on the subject on which they had supposed he would, that the senate had not waited for his coming, nor allowed him an opportunity of arguing the matter with the praetor;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but, that "the senate had decreed a triumph in such a manner, without hearing the report of any one of those who had taken part in the war, except the person who was to enjoy the triumph:

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that their ancestors had made it a rule that the lieutenant-generals, the military tribunes, the centurions, and even the soldiers, should be present at the triumph, in order that the Roman people might ascertain the reality of his exploits, to whom so high an honour was paid.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Now, of that army which fought with the Gauls, had any one soldier, or even a soldier's servant, been present, of whom the senate could inquire how much of truth or falsehood was in the praetor's narrative?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then appointed a day for the elections, at which were chosen consuls, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Villius Tappulus. The praetors were then appointed, Lucius Quintius Flamininus, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, Lucius Villius Tappulus, and Cneius Baebius Tamphilus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During that year provisions were remarkably cheap. The curule aediles, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Sextus Aelius Paetus, distributed among the people a vast quantity of corn, brought from Africa, at the rate of two <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> a peck.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They also celebrated the Roman games in a magnificent manner, repeating them a second day;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and erected in the treasury five brazen statues out of the money paid as fines.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.1394" n="1394"/>The plebeian games were thrice repeated entire, by the aediles, Lucius Terentius Massa, and Cneius Baebius Tamphilus, who was elected praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were also funeral games exhibited that year in the forum, for the space of four days, on occasion of the death of Marcus Valerius Laevinus, by

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> his sons Publius and Marcus, who gave also a show of gladiators, in which twenty-five pairs fought.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcus Aurelius Cotta, one of the decemviri of the sacred books, died, and Manius Acilius Glabrio was substituted in his room. It happened that both the curule aediles, who had been created at the elections, were persons who could not immediately undertake the office:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for Caius Cornelius Cethegus was elected in his absence, when he was occupying Spain as his province;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and Caius Valerius Flaccus, who was present, being flamen Dialis, could not take the oath of observing the laws; and no person was allowed to hold any office longer than five days without taking the oath.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Flaccus petitioned to be excused from complying with the law, on which the senate decreed, that if the aedile produced a person approved of by the consuls, who would take the oath for him, the consuls, if they thought proper, should make application to the tribunes, that it might be proposed to the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lucius Valerius Flaccus, praetor elect, was produced to swear for his brother. The tribunes proposed to the commons, and the commons ordered that this should be as if the aedile himself had sworn. With regard to the other aedile, likewise, an order of the commons was made. On the tribunes putting the question, what two persons they chose should go and take the command of the armies in Spain, in order that Caius Cornelius, curule aedile, might come home to execute his office, and that Lucius Manlius Acidinus might, after many years, retire from the province; the commons ordered Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Stertinius, proconsuls, to command in Spain.</p></div1> <pb id="p.1395" n="1395"/><div1 type="book" n="32"><head>BOOK XXXII.</head>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE consuls and praetors, having entered upon office on the ides of March, cast lots for the provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Italy fell to Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, Macedonia to Publius Villius. Of the praetors, the city jurisdiction fell to Lucius Quinctius, Ariminum to Cneius Baebius, Sicily to Lucius Valerius, Sardinia to Lucius Villius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul Lentulus was ordered to levy new legions; Villius, to receive the army from Publius Sulpicius; and, to complete its number, power was given him to raise as many men as he thought proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To the praetor Baebius were decreed the legions which Caius Aurelius, late consul, had commanded, with directions that he should keep them in their present situation, until the consul should come with the new army to supply their place;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and that, on his arriving in Gaul, all the soldiers who had served out their time should be sent home, except five thousand of the allies, which would be sufficient to protect the province round Ariminum.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The command was continued to the praetors of the former year; to Cneius Sergius, that he might superintend the distribution of land to the soldiers who had served for many years in Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia; to Quintus Minucius, that he might finish the inquiries concerning the conspiracies in Bruttium, which, while praetor, he had managed with care and fidelity.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That he should also send to Locri, to suffer punishment, those who had been convicted of sacrilege, and who were then in chains at Rome;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and that he should take care, that whatever had been carried away from the temple of Proserpine should be replaced with expiations.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Latin festival was repeated in pursuance of a decree of the <pb id="p.1396" n="1396"/>pontiffs, because ambassadors from Ardea had complained to the senate, that during the said solemnity they had not been supplied with meat as usual on the Alban mount. From Suessa an account was brought, that two of the gates, and the wall between them, had been struck with lightning.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Messengers from Formiae related, that the temple of Jupiter had also been struck by lightning; from Ostia, likewise, news came of the like accident having happened to the temple of Jupiter there; it was said, too, that the temples of Apollo and Sancus, at Veliternum, were struck in like manner;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and that in the temple of Hercules, hair had grown (on the statue). A letter was received from Quintus Minucius, proprietor, from Bruttium, that a foal had been born with five feet, and three chickens with three feet each.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Afterwards a letter was brought from Macedonia, from Publius Sulpicius, proconsul, in which, among other matters, it was mentioned, that a laurel tree had sprung up on the poop of a ship of war. On occasion of the former prodigies, the senate had voted, that the consuls should offer sacrifices with the greater victims to such gods as they thought proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On account of the last prodigy, alone, the aruspices were called

<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> before the senate, and, in pursuance of their answer, the people were ordered by proclamation to perform a supplication for one day, and worship was solemnized at all the shrines.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year, the Carthaginians brought to Rome the first payment of the silver imposed on them as a tribute;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and the quaestors having reported, that it was not of the proper standard, and that, on the assay, it wanted a fourth part, they made up the deficiency with money borrowed at Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On their requesting that the senate would be pleased to order their hostages to be restored to them, a hundred were given up, and hopes were held out with relation to the rest,

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> if they remained in fidelity (to the treaty).

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> They then further requested, that the remaining hostages might be removed from Norba, where they were ill accommodated, to some other place, and they were permitted to remove to Signia and Ferentinum.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The request of the people of Gades was likewise complied with: that a governor should not be sent to their city; being contrary to what had been agreed with them by Lucius Marcius Septimus, when they came under the protection of the Roman people. Deputies from Narnia, com- <pb id="p.1397" n="1397"/>plaining that they had not their due number of settlers, and that several who were not of their community, had crept in among them, and were conducting themselves as colonists, Lucius Cornelius, the consul, was ordered to appoint three commissioners to adjust those matters.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The three appointed were, Publius and Sextus Aelius, both surnamed Paetus, and Caius Cornelius Lentulus. The favour granted to the Narnians, of filling up their number of colonists, was refused to the people of Cossa, who applied for it.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls, having finished the business that was to be done at Rome, set out for their provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Villius, on coming into Macedonia, found the soldiers in a violent mutiny, which had been previously excited, and not sufficiently repressed at the commencement.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were the two thousand who, after Hannibal had been vanquished, had been transported from Africa to Sicily, and then, in about a year after, into Macedonia, as volunteers; they denied, however, that this was done with their consent, affirming, that <quote>they had been put on board the ships, by the tribunes, contrary to their remonstrances;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but, in what manner soever they had become engaged in that service, whether it had been voluntarily undertaken or imposed on them, the time of it was now expired, and it was reasonable that some end should be put to their warfare.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For many years they had not seen Italy, but had grown old under arms in Sicily, Africa, and Macedonia; they were now, in short, worn out with labour and fatigue, and were exhausted of their blood by the many wounds they had received.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul told them, that <quote>the grounds on which they demanded their discharge, appeared to him to be reasonable, if the demand had been made in a moderate manner; but that neither that, nor any other ground, was a justifying cause of mutiny.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Wherefore, if they were contented to adhere to their standards, and obey orders, he would write to the senate concerning their release; and that what they desired would more easily be obtained by moderation than by turbulence.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time, Philip was pushing on the siege of Thaumaci, with the utmost vigour, by means of mounds and engines, and was ready

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> to bring up the ram to the walls, when he was obliged to relinquish the undertaking by the sudden arrival of the Aetolians, who, under the command of Archi- <pb id="p.1398" n="1398"/>damus, having made their way into the town between the posts of the Macedonians, never ceased, day or night, making continual sallies, sometimes against the guards, sometimes against the works of the besiegers.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were at the same time favoured by the very nature of the place: for Thaumaci stands near the road from Thermopylae, and the Malian bay, as you go through Lamia, on a lofty eminence, hanging immediately over the narrow pass which the Thessalians call Caela.<note>Hollows.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After passing through the craggy grounds of Thessaly, the roads are rendered intricate by the windings of the valleys, and on the near approach to the city, such an immense plain opens at once to view, like a vast sea, that the eye can scarcely reach the bounds of the expanse beneath.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From this surprising prospect it was called Thaumaci.<note>From <hi rend="italics">thumazein,</hi> to wonder.</note> The city itself is secured, not only by the height of its situation, but by its standing on a rock, the stone of which had been cut away on all sides.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These difficulties, and the prize not appearing sufficient to recompense so much toil and danger, caused Philip to desist from the attempt.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The winter also was approaching; he therefore retired from thence, and led back his troops into winter quarters, in Macedonia.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There, whilst others, glad of any interval of rest, consigned both body and mind to repose,

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Philip, in proportion as the season of the year had relieved him from the incessant fatigues of marching and fighting, found his care and anxiety increase the more, when he turned his thoughts towards the general issue of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He dreaded, not only his enemies, who pressed him hard by land and sea, but also the dispositions, sometimes of his allies, at others of his own subjects, lest the former might be induced, by hopes of friendship with the Romans, to revolt, and the Macedonians themselves be seized with a desire of innovation.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherefore, he despatched ambassadors to the Achaeans, both to require their oath, (for it had been made an article of their agreement that they should take an oath prescribed by Philip every year,) and at the same time to restore to them Orchomenes, Heraea, and Triphylia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To the Eleans he delivered up Aliphera; which city, they insisted, had never belonged to Triphylia, but ought to be restored to them, having been one of those that were incorporated by the council of the Arcadians for the <pb id="p.1399" n="1399"/>funding of Megalopolis.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These measures had the effect of strengthening his connexion with the Achaeans.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The affections of the Macedonians he conciliated by his treatment of Heraclides: for, finding that his having countenanced this man had been the cause to him of the utmost unpopularity, he charged him with a number of crimes, and threw him into

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> chains, to the great joy of the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was now, if at any time, that he made preparations for the war with especial energy. He exercised both the Macedonian and mercenary troops in arms, and in the beginning of spring sent Athenagoras, with all the foreign auxiliaries and what light-armed troops there were, through Epirus into Chaonia, to seize the pass at Antigonia, which the Greeks called Stena.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He followed, in a few days, with the heavy troops: and having viewed every situation in the country, he judged that the most advantageous post for fortifying himself was on the river Aous.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This river runs in a narrow vale, between two mountains, one of which the natives call Aeropus, and the other Asnaus, affording a passage of very little breadth along the bank. He ordered Athenagoras, with the light infantry, to take possession of Asnaus, and to fortify it. His own camp he pitched on Aeropus. Those places where the rocks were steep, were defended by guards of a few soldiers only; the less secure he strengthened, some with trenches, some with ramparts, and others with towers.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A great number of engines, also, were disposed in proper places, that, by means of weapons thrown from these, they might keep the enemy at a distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The royal pavilion was pitched on the outside of the rampart, on the most conspicuous eminence, in order, by this show of confidence, to dishearten the foe, and raise the hopes of his own men.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul having received intelligence from Charopus of Epirus, on what pass the king had taken his position with his army, as soon as the spring began to open, left Corcyra, where he had passed the winter, and, sailing over to the continent, led on his army against the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he came within about five miles of the king's camp, leaving the legions in a strong post, he went forward in person with some light troops, to view the nature of the country;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and, on the day following, held a council, in order to determine whether he should attempt a passage through the defiles occupied by the enemy, <pb id="p.1400" n="1400"/>notwithstanding the great labour and danger which the proposal involved, or lead round his forces by the same road through which Sulpicius had penetrated into Macedonia the year before.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The deliberations on this question had lasted several days, when news arrived, that Titus Quinctius had been elected consul; that he had obtained, by lot, Macedonia as his province; and that, hastening his journey, he had already come over to Corcyra.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Valerius Antias says, that Villius marched into the defile, and that, as he could not proceed straight forward, because every pass was occupied by the king, he followed the course of a valley, through the middle of which

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the river Aous flows, and having hastily constructed a bridge, passed over to the bank where the king's camp was, and fought a battle with him; that the king was routed, and driven out of his camp;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that twelve thousand of the enemy were killed, and two thousand two hundred taken, together with a hundred and thirty-two military standards, and two hundred and thirty horses. He adds, that, during the battle, a temple was vowed to Jupiter in case of success.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other historians, both Greek and Latin, (all those at least whose accounts I have read,) affirm that nothing memorable was done by Villius, and that Titus Quinctius, the consul who succeeded him, received from him a war which had yet to be commenced.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the time of these transactions in Macedonia, the other consul, Lucius Lentulus, who had stayed at Rome, held an assembly for the election of censors.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Out of many illustrious men who stood candidates, were chosen Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Publius Aelius Paetus.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These, acting together in perfect harmony, read the list of the senate, without passing a censure on any one member; they also let to farm the port-duties at Capua, and at Puteoli, and of the fort situate were the city now stands; enrolling for this latter place three hundred colonists, that being the number fixed by the senate; they also sold the lands of Capua, which lie at the foot of Mount Tifata.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> About the same time, Lucius Manlius Acidinus, on his return from Spain, was hindered from entering the city in ovation by Marcus Portius Laeca, plebeian tribune, notwithstanding he had obtained permission of the senate: coming, then, into the city in a private character, he conveyed to the treasury one thousand two hundred pounds' <pb id="p.1401" n="1401"/>weight of silver, and about thirty pounds' weight of gold.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During this year, Cneius Baebius Tamphilus, who had succeeded to the government of the province of Gaul, in the room of Caius Aurelius, consul of the year preceding, having, without proper caution, entered the territories of the Insubrian Gauls, was surprised with almost the whole of his army.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He lost above six thousand six hundred men, &mdash;so great a loss was received from a war which had now ceased to be an object of apprehension.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This event called away the consul, Lucius Lentulus, from the city; who, arriving in the province, which was filled with confusion, and taking the command of the army, which he found dispirited by its defeat, severely reprimanded the praetor, and ordered him to quit the province and return to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Neither did the consul himself perform any considerable service, being called home to preside at the elections, which were obstructed by Marcus Fulvius and Manius Curius, plebeian tribunes, who

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> wished to hinder Titus Quinctius Flamininus from standing candidate for the consulship, after passing through the office of quaestor.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They alleged, that <quote>the aedileship and praetorship were now held in contempt, and that the nobility did not make their way to the consulship through the regular gradations of offices, thus affording a trial of themselves; but, passing over the intermediate steps, pushed at once from the lowest to the highest.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> From a dispute in the Field of Mars, the affair was brought before the senate, where it was voted, <quote>that when a person sued for any post, which by the laws he

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> was permitted to hold, the people had the right of choosing whoever they thought proper.</quote> To this decision of the senate the tribunes submitted, and thereupon Sextus Aelius Paetus and Titus Quinctius Flamininus were elected consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then was held the election of praetors. The persons chosen were, Lucius Cornelius Merula, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Marcus Porcius Cato, and Caius Helvius, who had been plebeian aediles. By these the plebeian games were repeated, and, on occasion of the games, a feast of Jupiter was celebrated.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The curule aediles, also, Caius Valerius Flaccus, who was flamen of Jupiter, and Caius Cornelius Cethegus, celebrated the Roman games with great magnificence.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Servius and Caius Sulpicius Galba, pontiffs, died this year; in their room were <pb id="p.1402" n="1402"/>substituted Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Cneius Cornelius Scipio, as pontiffs.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls, Sextus Aelius Paetus and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, on assuming the administration, convened the senate in the Capitol, and the fathers decreed, that <quote>the consuls should settle between themselves or cast lots for the provinces, Macedonia and Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That he to whom Macedonia fell should enlist, as a supplement to the legions, three thousand Roman footmen and three hundred horse, and also five thousand footmen and five hundred horsemen belonging to the Latin confederacy.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The army assigned to the other consul was to consist entirely of newly-raised men. Lucius Lentulus, consul of the preceding year, was continued in command, and was ordered not to depart from the province, nor to remove the old army, until the consul should arrive with the new legions.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls cast lots for the provinces, and Italy fell to Aelius, Macedonia to Quintius.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Of the praetors, the lots gave to Lucius Cornelius Merula the city jurisdiction; to Marcus Claudius, Sicily; to Marcus Porcius, Sardinia; and to Caius Helvius, Gaul.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The levying of troops was then begun, for besides the consular armies, the praetors had been ordered also to enlist men: for Marcellus, in Sicily, four thousand foot and three hundred horse of the Latin confederates;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for Cato, in Sardinia, three thousand foot and two hundred horse of the same class of soldiers; with directions, that both these praetors, on their arrival in their provinces, should disband the veterans, both foot and horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls then introduced to the senate ambassadors from king Attalus. These, after representing that their king gave every assistance to the Roman arms on land and

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> sea, with his fleet and all his forces, and had up to that day executed with zeal and obedience every order of the consuls, added, that <quote>they feared it would not be in his power to continue so to do by reason of king Antiochus, for that Antiochus had invaded the kingdom of Attalus, when destitute of protective forces by sea and land.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That Attalus, therefore, entreated the conscript fathers, if they chose to employ his army and navy in the Macedonian war, then to send a body of forces to protect his territories; or if that were not agreeable, to allow him to go home to defend his own possessions, with his fleet and troops.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The <pb id="p.1403" n="1403"/>following answer was ordered to be given to the ambassadors: that <quote>it was a cause of gratitude to the senate that Attalus had assisted the Roman commanders with his fleet and other forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That they would neither send succours to Attalus, against Antiochus, the ally and friend of the Roman people; nor would they detain the auxiliary troops longer than would be convenient to the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That it was ever a constant rule with the Roman people, to use the aid of others so far only as was agreeable to the will of those who gave it; and even to leave the commencement and the termination of that aid at the discretion of those who desired that the Romans should be benefited by their help.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> That they would send ambassadors to Antiochus, to represent to him, that Attalus, with his fleet and army, were, at the present, employed by the Roman people against Philip, their common enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and that Antiochus would do that which was gratifying to the senate if he abstained from the kingdom of Attalus and desisted from the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> for that it was much to be wished, that kings who were allies and friends to the Roman people should maintain friendship between themselves also.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul Titus Quinctius had finished the levies, in making which he chose principally such as had served in Spain or Africa, that is, soldiers of approved courage, and when hastening to set forward to his province, he was delayed by reports of prodigies, and the expiations of them.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There had been struck by lightning the public road at Veii, a temple of Jupiter at Lanuvium, a temple of Hercules at Ardea, with a wall and towers at Capua, also the edifice which is called Alba.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Arretium, the sky appeared as on fire; at Velitrae, the earth, to the extent of three acres, sunk down so as to form a vast chasm. From Suessa Aurunca, an account was brought of a lamb born with two heads; from Sinuessa, of a swine with a human head.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On occasion of these ill omens, a supplication of one day's continuance was performed; the consuls gave their attention to divine services, and, as soon as the gods were appeased, set out for their provinces. Aelius, accompanied by Caius Helvius.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> praetor, went into Gaul, where he put under the command of the praetor the army which he received from Lucius Lentulus, and which he ought to have disbanded, intending to carry on his own operations with the new troops, which he had brought with him; but he effected <pb id="p.1404" n="1404"/>nothing worth recording.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The other consul, Titus Quinctius, setting sail from Brundusium earlier than had been usual with former consuls, reached Corcyra, with eight thousand foot and eight hundred horse. From this place, he passed over, in a quinquereme, to the nearest part of Epirus, and proceeded, by long journeys, to the Roman camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Here, having dismissed Villius, and waiting a few days, until the forces from Corcyra should come up and join him, he held a council, to determine whether he should endeavour to force his way straight forward through the camp of the enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> or whether, without attempting an enterprise of so great difficulty and danger, he should not rather take a circuitous and safe road, so as to penetrate into Macedonia by the country of the Dassaretians and Lycus.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The latter plan would have been adopted, had he not feared that, in removing to a greater distance from the sea, the enemy might slip out of his hands;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that if the king should resolve to secure himself in the woods and wilds, as he had done before, the summer might be spun out without any thing being effected. It was therefore determined, be the event what it might, to attack the enemy in their present post, disadvantageous as it was.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But they more easily resolved on this measure, than devised any safe or certain method of accomplishing it.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Forty days were passed in view of the enemy, without making any kind of effort. Hence Philip conceived hopes of bringing about a treaty of peace, through the mediation of the people of Epirus;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and a council, which was held for the purpose, having appointed Pausanias, the praetor, and Alexander, the master of the horse, as negotiators, they brought the consul and the king to a conference, on the banks of the river Aous, where the channel was narrowest.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The sum of the consul's demands was, that the king should withdraw his troops from the territories of the several states; that, to those whose lands and cities he had plundered, he should restore such of their effects as could be found;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and that the value of the rest should be estimated by a fair arbitration. Philip answered, that <quote>the cases of the several states differed widely from each other.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That such as he himself had seized on, he would set at liberty; but he would not divest himself of the hereditary and just possessions which had been conveyed down to him from his ancestors.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If those states, with whom <pb id="p.1405" n="1405"/>hostilities had been carried on, complained of any losses in the war, he was ready to submit the matter to the arbitration of any state with whom both parties were at peace.</quote> To this the consul replied, that <quote>the business required neither judge nor arbitrator: for to whom was it not evident that every injurious consequence of the war was to be imputed to him who first took up arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And in this case Philip, unprovoked by any, had first commenced hostilities against all.</quote> When they next began to treat of those nations which were to be set at liberty, the consul named, first, the Thessalians:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> on which the king, fired with indignation, exclaimed, <quote>What harsher terms, Titus Quinctius, could you impose on me if I were vanquished?</quote> With these words he retired hastily from the conference, and they were with difficulty restrained by the river which separated them from assaulting each other with missile weapons.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the following day many skirmishes took place between parties sallying from the outposts, in a plain sufficiently wide for the purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Afterwards the king's troops drew back into narrow and rocky places, whither the Romans, keenly eager for fighting, penetrated also.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These had in their favour order and military discipline, while their arms were of a kind well calculated for protecting their persons. In favour of the enemy were the advantage of ground, and their balistas and catapultas disposed on almost every rock as on walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After many wounds given and received on both sides, and numbers being slain, as in a regular engagement, darkness put an end to the fight.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While matters were in this state, a herdsman, sent by Charopus, prince of the Epirots, was brought to the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He said, that <quote>being accustomed to feed his herd in the forest, then occupied by the king's camp, he knew every winding and path in the neighbouring mountains; and that if the consul thought proper to send some troops with him, he would lead them by a road, neither dangerous nor difficult, to a spot over the enemy's head.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the consul heard these things, he sent to Charopus to inquire if he considered that confidence might be placed in the rustic in so important a matter.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Charopus ordered an answer to be returned, that he should give just so much credit to this man's account, as should still leave every thing rather in his own power than in that of the other.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Though the consul rather wished than <pb id="p.1406" n="1406"/>dared to give the intelligence full belief, and though his mind was possessed by mingled emotions of joy and fear, yet being moved by the confidence due to Charopus, he resolved to put to trial the prospect that was held out to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In order to prevent all suspicion of the matter, during the two following days he carried on attacks against the enemy without intermission, drawing out troops against them in every quarter, and sending up fresh men to relieve the wearied.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, selecting four thousand foot and three hundred horse, he put them under the command of a military tribune, with directions to advance the horse as far as the nature of the ground allowed; and when they came to places impassable to cavalry, then to post them in some plain;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that the infantry should proceed by the road which the guide would show, and that when, according to his promise, they arrived on the height over the enemy's head, then they should give a signal by smoke, but raise no shout, until the tribune should have reason to think that, in consequence of the signal received from him, the battle was begun. He ordered that the march should take place by night, (the moon shining through the whole of it,) and employ the day in taking food and rest.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The most liberal promises were made to the guide, provided he fulfilled his engagement; he bound him, nevertheless, and delivered him to the tribune.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having thus sent off this detachment, the Roman general exerted himself only the more vigorously in every part to make himself master of the posts of the enemy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the third day, the Roman party made the signal by smoke, to notify that they had gained possession of the eminence to which they had been directed; and then the consul, dividing his forces into three parts, marched up with the main strength of his army, through a valley in the middle, and made the wings on right and left advance to the camp of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor did these advance to meet him with less alacrity. The Roman soldiers, in the ardour of their courage, long maintained the fight on the outside of their works, for they had no small superiority in bravery, in skill, and in the nature of their arms;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but when the king's troops, after many of them were wounded and slain, retreated into places secured either by intrenchments or situation, the danger reverted on the Romans, who pushed forward, inconsiderately, into disadvan- <pb id="p.1407" n="1407"/>tageous grounds and defiles, out of which a retreat was difficult.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor would they have extricated themselves without suffering for their rashness, had not the Macedonians, first, by a shout heard in their rear, and then by an attack begun on that quarter, been utterly dismayed and confounded at the unforeseen danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some betook themselves to a hasty flight: some, keeping their stand, rather because they could find no way for flight than that they possessed spirit to support the engagement, were cut off by the Romans, who pressed them hard both on front and rear.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their whole army might have been destroyed, had the victors continued their pursuit of the fugitives; but the cavalry were obstructed by the narrowness of the passes and the ruggedness of the ground;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and the infantry, by the weight of their armour.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The king at first fled with precipitation, and without looking behind him; but afterwards, when he had proceeded as far as five miles, he began, from recollecting the unevenness of the road, to suspect, (what was really the case,) that the enemy could not follow him; and halting, he despatched his attendants through all the hills and valleys to collect the stragglers together. His loss was not more than two thousand men.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The rest of his army, coming to one spot, as if they had followed some signal, marched off, in a compact body, towards Thessaly. The Romans, after having pursued the enemy as far as they could with safety, killing such as they overtook, and despoiling the slain, seized and plundered the king's camp;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> which, even when it had no defenders, was difficult of access. The following night they were lodged within their own trenches.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day, the consul pursued the enemy through the same defiles through which the river winds its way among the valleys.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king came on the first day to the camp of Pyrrhus, a place so called in Triphylia, a district of Melotis; and on the following day he reached Mount Lingos, an immense march for his army, but his fear impelled him.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This ridge of mountains belongs to Epirus, and stretches along between Macedonia and Thessaly; the side next to Thessaly faces the east, that next to Macedonia the north. These hills are thickly clad with woods, and on their summits have open plains and perennial streams.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Here Philip remained encamped for several days, being unable to determine whether <pb id="p.1408" n="1408"/>he should continue his retreat until he arrived in his own dominions, or whether he might venture back into Thessaly. At length, his decision leaned to leading down his army into Thessaly;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and, going by the shortest roads to Tricca, he made hasty excursions from thence to all the cities within his reach.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The inhabitants who were able to accompany him, he summoned from their habitations, and burned the towns, allowing the owners to take with them such of their effects as they were able to carry; the rest became the prey of the soldiers; nor was there any kind of cruelty which they could have suffered from an enemy, that they did not suffer from these their confederates.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These acts were painful to Philip even while he executed them;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but as the country was soon to become the property of the foe, he wished to rescue out of it at least the persons of his allies. In this manner were ravaged the towns of Phacium, Iresiae, Euhydrium, Eretria, and Palaepharsalus.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On his coming to Pherae, the gates were shut against him, and as it would necessarily occasion a considerable delay if he attempted to take it by force, and as he could not spare time, he dropped the design, and crossed over the mountains into Macedonia; for he had received intelligence, that the Aetolians too were marching towards him.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> These, on hearing of the battle fought on the banks of the river of Aous, first laid waste the nearest tracts round Sperchia, and Long Come, as they call it, and then, passing over into Thessaly, got possession of Cymine and Angeae at the first assault.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> From Metropolis they were repulsed by the inhabitants, who, while a part of their army was plundering the country, assembled in a body to defend the city. Afterwards, making an attempt on Callithera, they were attacked by the townsmen in a like manner;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> but withstood their onset with more steadiness, drove back into the town the party which had sallied, and content with that success, as they had no prospect whatever of taking the place by storm, retired.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They then took by assault and sacked the towns of Theuma and Calathas. Acharrae they gained by surrender.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Xyniae, through similar apprehensions, was abandoned by the inhabitants. These having forsaken their homes, and going together in a body, fell in with a party which was being marched to Thaumacus for the purpose of protecting their foragers; all of whom, an irregular and unarmed multitude, <pb id="p.1409" n="1409"/>incapable of any resistance, were put to the sword by the troops. The deserted town of Xyniae was plundered. The Aetolians then took Cyphara, a fort conveniently situated on the confines of Dolopia.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All this the Aetolians performed within the space of a few days.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nor did Amynander and the Athamanians, when they heard of the victory obtained by the Romans, continue inactive. Amynander, having little confidence in his own troops, requested a slight auxiliary force from the consul; and then advancing towards Gomphi, he stormed on his march a place called Pheca, situate between that town and the narrow pass which separates Thessaly from Athamania.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then attacked Gomphi, and though the inhabitants defended it for several days with the utmost vigour, yet, as soon as he had raised the scaling ladders to the walls, the same apprehension (which had operated on others) at length compelled them to surrender.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This capture of Gomphi spread the greatest consternation among the Thessalians: their fortresses of Argenta, Pherinus, Thimarus, Lisinae, Stimon, and Lampsus surrendered, one after another, with several other garrisons equally inconsiderable.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While the Athamanians and Aetolians, delivered from fear of the Macedonians, converted to their own profit the fruits of another's victory; and Thessaly, ravaged by three armies at once, knew not which to believe its foe or its friend; the consul marched on, through the pass which the enemy's flight had left open, into the country of Epirus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Though he well knew which party the Epirots, excepting their prince Charopus, were disposed to favour, yet as he saw that, even from

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the motive of atoning for past behaviour, they obeyed his orders with diligence, he regulated his treatment of them by the standard of their present rather than of their former temper, and by this readiness to pardon conciliated their affection for the future.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, sending orders to Corcyra for the transport ships to come into the Ambrician bay, he advanced by moderate marches, and on the fourth day pitched his camp on Mount Cercetius. Hither lie ordered Amynander to come with his auxiliary troops; not so much as being in want of his forces, as that he might avail himself of them as his guides into Thessaly.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With the same purpose, many volunteers of the Epirots also were admitted into the corps of auxiliaries. <pb id="p.1410" n="1410"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Of the cities of Thessaly, the first which he attacked was Phaloria. The garrison here consisted of two thousand Macedonians, who at first resisted with the utmost vigour so far as their arms and fortifications could protect them.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The assault was carried on without intermission or relaxation, either by day or by night, because the consul thought that it would have a powerful effect on the spirits of the rest of the Thessalians, if the first who made trial of the Roman strength were unable to withstand it;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and this at the same time subdued the obstinacy of the Macedonians. On the reduction of Phaloria, deputies came from Metropolis and Piera, surrendering those cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To them, on their petition, pardon was granted: Phaloria was sacked, and burned. He then proceeded to Aeginium; but finding this place so circumstanced, that, even with a moderate garrison, it was safe, after discharging a few weapons against the nearest advanced guard, he directed his march towards the territory of Gomphi; and thence descended into the plains of Thessaly.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> His army was now in want of every thing, because he had spared the lands of the Epirots; he therefore despatched messengers to learn whether the transports had reached Leucas and the Ambracian bay;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> sending the cohorts, in turn, to Ambracia for corn.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Now, the road from Gomphi to Ambracia, although difficult and embarrassed, is very short; so that in a few days, provisions having been conveyed from the sea, his camp was filled with an abundant supply of all necessaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then marched to Atrax, which is about ten miles from Larissa, on the river Peneus. The inhabitants came originally from Perrhaebia.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Thessalians, here, were not in the least alarmed at the first coming of the Romans; and Philip, although he durst not himself advance into Thessaly, yet, keeping his stationary camp in the vale of Tempe, whenever any place was attempted by the enemy, he sent up reinforcements as occasion required.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the time that Quinctius first pitched his camp opposite to Philip's, at the entrance of Epirus, Lucius, the consul's brother, whom the senate

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had commissioned both to the naval command and to the government of the coast, sailed over with two quinqueremes to Corcyra;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and when he learned that the fleet had departed thence, thinking that no delay ought to be incurred, he followed, and overtook it at <pb id="p.1411" n="1411"/>the island of Zama.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Here he dismissed Lucius Apustius, in whose room he had been appointed, and then proceeded to Malea, but at a slow rate, being obliged, for the most part, to tow the vessels which accompanied him with provisions.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From Malea, after ordering the rest to follow with all possible expedition, himself, with three light quinqueremes, hastened forward to the Piraeus, and took under his command the ships left there by Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, for the protection of Athens.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the same time, two fleets set sail from Asia; one of twenty-four quinqueremes, under king Attalus; the other belonging to the Rhodians, consisting of twenty decked ships, and commanded by Agesimbrotus. These fleets, joining near the island of Andros, sailed for Eub&oelig;a, which was separated from them only by a narrow strait.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They first ravaged the lands belonging to Carystus;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but, judging that city too strong, in consequence of a reinforcement hastily sent from Chalcis, they bent their course to Eretria. Lucius Quinctius also, on hearing of the arrival of king Attalus, came thither with the ships which had lain at the Piraeus; having left orders, that his own ships should, as they arrived, follow him to Eub&oelig;a.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The siege of Eretria was now pushed forward with the utmost vigour; for the three combined fleets carried machines and engines, of all sorts, for the demolition of towns, and the adjacent country offered abundance of timber for the construction of new works.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At the beginning the townsmen defended their walls with a good degree of spirit;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> afterwards, when they felt the effects of fatigue, a great many being likewise wounded, and a part of the wall demolished by the enemy's works, they became disposed to capitulate.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But they had a garrison of Macedonians, of whom they stood in no less dread than of the Romans; and Philocles, the king's general, sent frequent messages from Chalcis, that he would bring them succour in due time, if they could hold out the siege. The hope of this, in conjunction with their fears, obliged them to protract the time longer than was consistent either with their wishes or their strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> However, having learned soon after that Philocles had been repulsed in the attempt, and forced to fly back, in disorder, to Chalcis, they instantly sent deputies to Attalus, to beg pardon and protection.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> While intent on the prospect of peace, they executed with less energy the duties of war, <pb id="p.1412" n="1412"/>and kept armed guards in that quarter only where the breach had been made in the wall, neglecting all the rest;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Quinctius made an assault by night on the side where it was least apprehended, and carried the town by scalade. The whole multitude of the townsmen, with their wives and children, fled into the citadel, but soon after surrendered themselves prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The quantity of money, of gold and silver, taken, was not great. Of statues and pictures, the works of ancient artists, and other ornaments of that kind, a greater number was found than was proportionate either to the

<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> size of the city, or its opulence in other particulars.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>


















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The design on Carystus was then resumed, and the fleets sailed thither; on which the whole body of the inhabitants, before the troops were disembarked, deserted the city and fled into the citadel, whence they sent deputies to beg protection from the Roman general.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the townspeople life and liberty were immediately granted; and it was ordered, that the Macedonians should pay a ransom of three hundred drachmas<note>9<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 13<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 9<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> a head, deliver up their arms, and quit the country.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After being ransomed for the said amount, they were transported, unarmed, to B&oelig;otia. The combined fleets having, in the space of a few days, taken these two important cities of Eub&oelig;a, sailed round Sunium, a promontory of Attica, and steered their course to Cenchreae, the grand mart of the Corinthians.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the mean time, the consul found the siege of Atrax more tedious and severe than had been universally expected, and the enemy resisted in the way which they had least anticipated.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had supposed that the whole of the trouble would be in demolishing the wall, and that if he could once open a passage for his soldiers into the city, the consequence would then be, the flight and slaughter of the enemy, as usually happens on the capture of towns.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But when, on a breach being made in the wall by the rams, and when the soldiers, by mounting over the ruins, had entered the place, this proved only the beginning, as it were, of an unusual and fresh labour.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the Macedonians in garrison, who were both chosen men and many in number, supposing that they would be entitled to extraordinary honour if they should

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> maintain the defence of the city by means of arms and courage, rather than by the help of walls, formed them- <pb id="p.1413" n="1413"/>selves in a compact body, strengthening their line by an uncommon number of files in depth. These, when they saw the Romans entering by the breaches, drove them back, so that they were entangled among the rubbish, and with difficulty could effect a retreat.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This gave the consul great uneasiness; for he considered such a disgrace, not merely as it retarded the reduction of a single city, but as likely to affect materially the whole process of the war, which in general depends much on the influence of events in themselves unimportant.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having therefore cleared the ground, which was heaped up with the rubbish of the half-ruined wall, he brought up a tower of extraordinary height, consisting of many stories, and which carried a great number of soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He likewise sent up the cohorts in strong bodies one after another, to force their way, if possible, through the wedge of the Macedonians, which is called a phalanx.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But in such a confined space, (for the wall was thrown down to no great extent,) the enemy had the advantage, both in the kind of weapons which they used, and in the manner of fighting.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When the Macedonians, in close array, stretched out before them their long spears against the target fence which was formed by the close position of their antagonists' shields, and when the Romans, after discharging their javelins without effect, drew their swords, these could neither press on to a closer combat, nor cut off the heads of the spears;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and if they did cut or break off any, the shaft, being sharp at the part where it was broken, filled up its place among the points of those which were unbroken, in a kind of palisade.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Besides this, the parts of the wall still standing rendered both the flanks of the Macedonians secure, who were not obliged, either in retreating or in advancing to an attack, to pass through a long space, which generally occasions disorder in the ranks.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> An accidental circumstance also helped to confirm their courage: for as the tower was moved along a bank of not sufficiently solid soil, one of the wheels sinking into a rut, made the tower lean in such a manner that it appeared to the enemy as if

<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> falling, and threw the soldiers posted on it into consternation and affright.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As none of his attempts met any success, the consul was very unwilling to allow such a comparison to be exhibited between the two classes of soldiery and their respective weapons;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> at the same time, he could neither see any prospect <pb id="p.1414" n="1414"/>of reducing the place speedily, nor any means of subsisting in winter, at such a distance from the sea, and in regions desolated by the calamities of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He therefore raised the siege; and as, along the whole coast of Acarnania and Aetolia, there was no port capable of containing all the transports that brought supplies to the army, nor any place which afforded lodgings to the

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> legions, he pitched on Anticyra, in Phocis, on the Corinthian gulf, as most commodiously situated for his purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There the legions would be at no great distance from Thessaly, and the places belonging to the enemy; while they would have in front Peloponnesus, separated from them by a narrow sea; on their rear, Aetolia and Acarnania; and on their sides, Locris and B&oelig;otia.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Phanotea in Phocis he took without resistance at the first assault. The siege of Anticyra gave him not much delay. Then Ambrysus and Hyampolis were taken.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Daulis, being situated on a lofty eminence, could not be reduced either by scalade or works: he therefore provoked the garrison, by missile weapons, to make sallies from out the town.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then by flying at one time, pursuing at another, and engaging in slight skirmishes, he led them into such a degree of carelessness, and such a contempt of him, that at length the Romans, mixing with them as they ran back, entered by the gates, and stormed the town.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Six other fortresses in Phocis, of little consequence, came into his hands, through fear rather than by force of arms. Elatia shut its gates, and the inhabitants seemed determined not to admit within their walls either the army or the general of the Romans, unless compelled by force.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consul was employed in the siege of Elatia, a prospect opened to him of effecting a business of much more importance; namely, of drawing away the Achaeans from their alliance with Philip to that of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Cycliades, the head of the faction that favoured the interest of Philip, they had now banished; and Aristaenus, who wished for a union between his countrymen and the Romans, was praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman fleet, with Attalus and the Rhodians, lay at Cenchreae, and were preparing to lay siege to Corinth with their whole combined force.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul therefore judged it prudent, that, before they entered on that affair, ambassadors should be sent to the Achaean state, with assurances, that if they came over from the king to the side of the Romans, the latter <pb id="p.1415" n="1415"/>would consign Corinth to them, and annex it to the old confederacy of their nation.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, by the consul's direction, ambassadors were sent to the Achaeans, by his brother Lucius Quinctius, by Attalus, and by the Rhodians and Athenians &mdash;a general assembly being summoned to meet at Sicyon to give them audience.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Now, the state of feeling of the Achaeans was by no means uniform.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nabis the Lacedaemonian, their constant and inveterate enemy, was the object of their dread; they dreaded the arms of the Romans; they were under obligations to the Macedonians, for services both of ancient and recent date;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but the king himself, on account of his perfidy and cruelty, they looked upon with jealous fear, and, not judging from the behaviour which he then assumed for the time, they knew that, on the conclusion of the war, they should find him a more tyrannical master.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So that every one of them was not only at a loss what opinion he should support in the senate of his own particular state, or in the general diets of the nation;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but, even when they deliberated within themselves, they could not, with any certainty, determine what they ought to wish, or what to prefer. Such was the unsettled state of mind of the members of the assembly, when the ambassadors were introduced and liberty of speaking afforded them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Roman ambassador, Lucius Calpurnius, spoke first; next the ambassadors of king Attalus; after them those of the Rhodians; and then Philip's. The Athenians were heard the last, that they might refute the discourses of the Macedonians.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> These inveighed against the king with the greatest acrimony of any, for no others had suffered from him so many and so severe hardships.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> So great a number of speeches of the ambassadors succeeding each other took up the whole of the day; and about sun-set the council was adjourned.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day the council was convened again; and when the magistrates, according to the custom of the Greeks, gave leave, by their herald, to any person who chose to offer advice, not one stood forth; but they sat a long time, looking on each other in silence.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was no wonder that men, revolving in their minds matters of such contradictory natures, and who found themselves puzzled and confounded, should be involved in additional perplexity by the speeches continued through the whole preceding day; in which the difficulties, on all <pb id="p.1416" n="1416"/>sides, were brought into view, and stated in their full force.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At length Aristaenus, the praetor of the Achaeans, not to dismiss the council without any business being introduced, said: &mdash;<quote>Achaeans, where are now those violent disputes, in which, at your feasts and meetings, whenever mention was made of Philip and the Romans, you scarcely refrained from blows?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Now, in a general assembly, summoned on that single business, when you have heard the arguments of the ambassadors on both sides, when the magistrates demand your opinions, when the herald calls you to declare your sentiments, you are struck dumb.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although your concern for the common safety be insufficient for determining the matter, cannot the party zeal which has attached you to one side or the other extort a word from any one of you?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> especially when none is so obtuse as not to perceive, that the time for declaring and recommending what each either wishes or thinks most advisable, must be at the present moment; that is, before we make any decree. When a decree shall have been once passed, every man, even such as previously may have disapproved the measure, must then support it as good and salutary.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These persuasions of the praetor, so far from prevailing on any one person to declare his opinion, did not excite, in all that numerous assembly, collected out of so many states, so much as a murmur or a whisper.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>






































<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the praetor, Aristaenus, again spoke as follows: &mdash;<quote>Chiefs of Achaea, you are not more at a loss for advice, than you are for words; but every one is unwilling to promote the interest of the public at a risk of danger to himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Were I in a private character, perhaps I too should be silent; but, as praetor, it is my duty to declare, that I see evidently, either that an audience of the council ought not to have been accorded to the ambassadors, or that they ought not to be dismissed from it without an answer. Yet how can I give them an answer, unless by a decree of yours?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And, since not one of you who have been called to this assembly either chooses or dares to make known his sentiments, let us examine (as if they were opinions proposed to our consideration) the speeches of the ambassadors delivered yesterday;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> supposing the speakers not to have required what was useful to themselves, but to have recommended what they thought most conducive to our advantage.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans, the Rho- <pb id="p.1417" n="1417"/>dians, and Attalus, request an alliance and friendship with us; and they demand to be assisted by us in the war in which they are now engaged against Philip. Philip reminds us of our league with him, and of the obligation of our oath; he requires only, that we declare ourselves on his side; and says, he will be satisfied if we do not intermeddle in the operations of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Does not the reason occur to the mind of any one of you, why those, who are not yet our allies, require more than he who is?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This arises not from modesty in Philip, nor from the want of it in the Romans. It is fortune, which, while it bestows confidence to requisitions on one side, precludes it on the other. We see nothing belonging to Philip but his ambassador: the Roman fleet lies at Cenchreae, exhibiting to our view the spoils of the cities of Eub&oelig;a.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> We behold the consul and his legions, at the distance of a small tract of sea, overrunning Phocis and Locris.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> You were surprised at Philip's ambassador, Cleomedon, showing such diffidence yesterday in his application to us to take arms on the side of the king against the Romans. But if we, in pursuance of the same treaty and oath, the sacredness of which he inculcated on us, were to ask of him, that Philip should protect us, both from Nabis and his Lacedaemonians, and also from the Romans, he would be utterly unable to find, not only a force with which to protect us, but even an answer to return.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As much so in truth as was Philip himself, who endeavoured, by promises of waging war against Nabis, to draw away our youth into Eub&oelig;a;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but finding that we would neither decree such assistance to him, nor choose to be embroiled in a war with Rome, forgot that alliance on which he now lays such stress, and left us to Nabis and the Lacedaemonians to be spoiled and plundered. Besides, to me the arguments of Cleomedon appeared utterly inconsistent.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He made light of the war with the Romans; and asserted, that the issue of it would be similar to that of the former, which they waged against Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If such be the case, why does he, at a distance, solicit our assistance; rather than come hither in person, and defend us, his old allies, both from Nabis and from the Romans? Us, do I say? Why, on this showing, has he suffered Eretria and Carystus to be taken? Why so many cities of Thessaly? Why Locris and Phocis? Why does he at pre- <pb id="p.1418" n="1418"/>sent suffer Elatia to be besieged?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Did he, either through compulsion, or fear, or choice, quit the straits of Epirus, and those impregnable fastnesses on the river Aous; and why, abandoning the pass which he was occupying, did he retire altogether into his own kingdom? If of his own will he gave up so many allies to the ravages of the enemy, what objection can he make to these allies consulting for their own safety?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> If through fear, he ought to pardon the like fear in us. If he retired defeated by force of arms, let me ask you, Cleomedon, shall we, Achaeans, be able to withstand the Roman arms, which you, Macedonians, have not withstood? Are we to give credit to your assertion, that the Romans do not employ, in the present war, greater forces or greater strength than they did in the former, rather than regard the facts themselves?

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In the first instance, they aided the Aetolians with a fleet; they sent not to the war either a consul as commander, or a consular army.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The maritime cities of Philip's allies were in terror and confusion; but the inland places were so secure against the Roman arms, that Philip ravaged the country of the Aetolians, while they in vain implored succour from those arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Whereas, in the present case, the Romans, after bringing to a final conclusion the Punic war, which they had supported for sixteen years in the bowels, as it were, of Italy, sent not auxiliaries to the Aetolians in their quarrels, but, being themselves principals, made a hostile invasion on Macedonia with land and sea forces at once. Their third consul is now pushing forward the war with the utmost vigour.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Sulpicius, engaging the king within the territory of Macedonia itself, has overthrown and put him to flight; and afterwards despoiled the most opulent part of his kingdom.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Then, again, when he was in possession of the strait of Epirus, where, from the nature of the ground, his fortifications, and the strength of his army, he thought himself secure, Quinctius drove him out of his camp; pursued him, as he fled into Thessaly; and, almost in the view of Philip himself, stormed the royal garrisons and the cities of his allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Supposing that there were no truth in what the Athenian ambassadors mentioned yesterday, respecting the cruelty, avarice, and lust of the king; supposing the crimes committed, in the country of Attica, against the gods, celestial and infernal, concerned <pb id="p.1419" n="1419"/>us not all;

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> that we had less to complain of than what the people of Cius and Abydos, who are far distant from us, have endured: let us then, if you please, forget even our own wounds;

<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> let the murders and ravages committed at Messena, and in the heart of Peloponnesus, the killing of his host Garitenes, at Cyparissia, almost in the very midst of a feast, in contempt of laws divine and human; the murder of the two Aratuses of Sicyon, father and son, though he was wont to call the unfortunate old man his parent; his carrying away the son's wife into Macedonia for the gratification of his vicious appetites, and all his violations of virgins and matrons;

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> &mdash;let all these, I say, be consigned to oblivion.

<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> Let us suppose our business were not with Philip, through dread of whose cruelty you are all thus struck dumb; for what other cause could keep you silent, when you have been summoned to a council? Let us imagine that we are treating with Antigonus, a prince of the greatest mildness and equity, to whose kindness we have all been highly indebted; would he require us to perform what at the time was impossible?

<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Peloponnesus is a peninsula, united to the continent by the narrow passage of an isthmus particularly exposed and open to the attacks of naval armaments. Now, if a hundred decked ships, and fifty lighter open ones, and thirty Issean barks, shall begin to lay waste our coasts, and attack the cities which stand exposed, almost on the very shore; shall we then retreat into the inland towns, as if we were not afflicted with an intestine war, though in truth it is rankling in our very bowels?

<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> When Nabis and the Lacedaemonians by land, and the Roman fleet by sea, shall press us, whence must I implore the support due from the king's alliance, whence the succours of the Macedonians?

<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> Shall we ourselves, with our own arms, defend, against the Roman forces, the cities that will be attacked? Truly, in the former war, we defended Dymae excellently well! The calamities of others afford us abundant examples; let us not seek how we may render ourselves an example to others.

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> Do not, because the Romans voluntarily desire your friendship, contemn that which you ought to have prayed for, nay, laboured with all your might to obtain.

<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> But, it is insinuated, that they are impelled by fear, in a country to which they are strangers; and that, wishing to shelter themselves under your assistance, they have recourse to your alliance in <pb id="p.1420" n="1420"/>the hope of being admitted into your harbours, and of there finding supplies of provisions.

<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> Now, at sea they are absolute masters; and instantly reduce to subjection every place at which they land. What they request, they have power to enforce.

<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Because they wish to treat you with tenderness, they do not allow you to take steps that must lead you to ruin. Cleomedon lately pointed out, as the middle and safest way, to remain inactive, and abstain from taking up arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> But that is not a middle way; it is no way at all. For, besides the necessity of either embracing or rejecting the Roman alliance, what other consequence can ensue from such conduct, than that, while we show no steady attachment to either side, as if we waited the event with design to adapt our counsels to fortune, we shall become the prey of the conqueror?

<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> Contemn not then, when it is spontaneously offered to your acceptance, what you ought to have solicited with your warmest prayers. The free option between the two, which you have this day, you will not always have.

<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> The same opportunity will not last long, nor will it frequently recur. You have long wished to deliver yourselves out of the hands of Philip, although you have not dared to make the attempt. Those have now crossed the sea, with large fleets and armies, who are able to rescue you to a state of freedom, without any trouble or danger to yourselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> If you reject such persons as allies, you can scarcely be of sane mind; but you must unavoidably have to deal with them, either as allies or as enemies.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit                  ="chapter" n="22"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This speech of the praetor was followed by a general murmur; some declaring their approbation, and others vehemently rebuking those who did so.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And now, not only individuals, but whole states were engaged in altercation among themselves; and at length among the magistrates, called Demiurgi, who are ten in number, the dispute was taken up with as much warmth as among the multitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Five of them declared, that they would propose the question concerning an alliance with Rome, and would take the votes on it; while five insisted, that it had been provided by law that neither the magistrates should have power to propose nor the council to pass any decree injurious to the alliance with Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This day, also, was spent in contention, and there remained now but one day more of the regular time of sitting; for, accord- <pb id="p.1421" n="1421"/>ing to the rule, the decree must be passed on the third day: and as that approached, the zeal of the parties was kindled into such a flame, that scarcely did parents refrain from offering violence to their own sons.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was present a man of Pallene, named Rhisiasus, whose son, Memnon, was a demiurgus, and was of that party which opposed the reading of the decree and taking the votes.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This man, for a long time, entreated his son to allow the Achaeans to take proper measures for their common safety, and not, by his obstinacy, to bring ruin on the whole nation;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but, finding that his entreaties had no effect, he swore that he would treat him, not as a son, but as an enemy, and would put him to death with his own hand.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By these threats he forced him, next day, to join the party that voted for the question being proposed. These, having now become the majority, proposed the question accordingly, while almost every one' of the states, openly approving the measure, showed plainly on which side they would vote.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whereupon the Dymaeans, Megalopolitans, with several of the Argives, rose up, and withdrew from the council; which step excited neither wonder nor disapprobation.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For when, in the memory of their grandfathers, the Megalopolitans had been expelled their country by the Lacedaemonians, Antigonus had re-instated them in their native residence; and, at a later period, when Dymae was taken and sacked by the Roman troops, Philip ordered that the inhabitants, wherever they were in servitude, should be ransomed, and not only restored them to their liberty, but their country.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As to the Argives, besides believing that the royal family of Macedonia derived its origin from them, the greater part were attached to Philip by personal acts of kindness and familiar friendship. For these reasons, when the council appeared disposed to order an alliance to be concluded with Rome, they withdrew;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and their secession was readily excused, in consideration of the many and recent obligations by which they were bound to the king of Macedon.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The rest of the Achaean states, on their opinions being demanded, ratified, by an immediate decree, the alliance with Attalus and the Rhodians.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That with the Romans, as it could not be perfected without an order from the people, they deferred until such time as ambassadors could be sent to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the present, it was resolved, that three ambassadors should <pb id="p.1422" n="1422"/>be sent to Lucius Quinctius; and that the whole force of the Achaeans should be brought up to Corinth, which city Quinctius, after taking Cenchreae, was then besieging.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Achaeans accordingly pitched their camp opposite to the gate that leads to Sicyon. The Romans made their approaches on the side of the city which faces Cenchreae; Attalus having drawn his army across the isthmus, towards Lechaeum, the port on the opposite sea. At first, they did not push forward their operations with any great degree of vigour, because they had hopes of a dissension breaking out between the townsmen and the king's troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But afterwards, learning that they all were of one mind; that the Macedonians exerted thamselves as if in defence of their common country; and that the Corinthians submitted to the orders of Androsthenes, commander of the garrison, as if he were their countryman, and elected by their own suffrages; the assailants had no other hopes but in force, arms, and their works.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They therefore brought up their mounds to the walls, though by very difficult approaches.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On that side where the Romans attacked, their ram had demolished a considerable part of the wall; and the Macedonians having run together to defend the place thus stripped of its works, a furious conflict ensued between themselves and the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At first, by reason of the enemy's superiority in number, the Romans were quickly repulsed; but being joined by the auxiliary troops of Attalus and the Achaeans, they restored the fight to an equality; so that there was no doubt that they would easily drive the Macedonians and Greeks from their ground.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But there were in the town a great multitude of Italian deserters; some of whom, having been in Hannibal's army, had, through fear of being punished by the Romans, followed Philip; others, having been sailors, had lately quitted the fleets, and gone over, in hopes of more honourable employment: despair of safety, therefore, in case of the Romans getting the better, inflamed these to a degree which might rather be called madness than courage.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Opposite to Sicyon is the promontory of Juno Acraea, as she is called, stretching out into the main, the passage to Corinth being about seven miles.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To this place Philocles, one of the king's generals, led, through B&oelig;otia, fifteen hundred soldiers; and there were barks from Corinth ready to take these troops on board, and carry them over to Lechaeum.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Attalus, on this, advised to burn the <pb id="p.1423" n="1423"/>works, and raise the siege immediately; Quinctius was for persisting more obstinately in the attempt. However, when he saw the king's troops posted at the gates, and that the sallies of the besieged could not easily be withstood, he came over to the opinion of Attalus. Thus, their design proving fruitless, they dismissed the Achaeans, and returned to their ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Attalus steered to Piraeus, the Romans to Corcyra.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the naval forces were thus employed, the consul, having encamped before Elatia, in Phocis, first endeavoured, by conferring with the principal inhabitants, to bring them over, and by their means to effect his purpose;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but on their answering that they had nothing in their power, because the king's troops were more numerous and stronger than the townsmen, he assaulted the city on all sides at once with arms and engines.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A battering-ram having been brought up, shattered a part of the wall that reached from one tower to another, and this falling with a prodigious noise and crash, left much of the town exposed.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On this a Roman cohort made an assault through the breach, while at the same time the townsmen, quitting their several posts, ran together from all parts to the place, which was endangered by the attack of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time others of the Romans climbed over the ruins of the wall, and brought up scaling-ladders to the parts that were standing. As the conflict attracted the eyes and attention of the enemy to one particular spot, the walls were scaled in several places, by which means the soldiers easily entered the town.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The noise and tumult which ensued so terrified the enemy, that quitting the place, which they had crowded together to defend, they all fled in panic to the citadel, accompanied by the unarmed multitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul having thus become master of the town, gave it up to be plundered, and then sent messengers into the citadel, offering the king's troops their lives, on condition of their laying down their arms, and departing. To the Elatians he offered their liberty; which terms being agreed to, in a few days after he got possession of the citadel.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In consequence of Philocles, the king's general, coming into Achaia, not only Corinth was delivered from the siege, but the city of Argos was betrayed into his hands by some of the principal inhabitants, after they had first sounded the minds of the populace.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had a custom, that, on the first <pb id="p.1424" n="1424"/>day of assembly, their praetors, for the omen's sake, should pronounce the names, Jupiter, Apollo, and Hercules; in addition to which, a rule had been made, that, along with these, they should join the name of king Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the conclusion of the alliance with the Romans, the herald did not make that addition;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> on which a murmur spread through the multitude, who would add the name of Philip, and insisting that the respect, due by law, should be paid as before; until at length the name was given out amidst universal approbation.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the encouragement afforded by this favourable disposition, Philocles was invited, who seized in the night a strong post called Larissa, seated on a hill which overhangs the city, and in which he placed a garrison.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the dawn of day, however, and as he was proceeding in order of battle to the forum, at the foot of the hill he was met by a line of troops, drawn up to oppose him. This was a body of Achaeans, lately posted there, consisting of about five hundred young men, selected out of all the states.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their commander was Aenesidemus, of Dymae. The king's general sent a person to recommend to them to evacuate the city, because they were not a match for the townsmen alone, who held the same sentiments as the Macedonians; much less when these were joined by the Macedonians, whom even the Romans had not withstood at Corinth.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This at first had no effect, either on the commander, or his men: and when they, soon after, perceived the Argives also in arms, coming, in a great body, from the opposite side, perceiving that their destruction was inevitable, they yet seemed determined to run every hazard, if their leader would persevere.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But Aenesidemus, unwilling that the flower of the Achaean youth should be lost, together with the city, made terms with Philocles, that they should have liberty to retire, while himself remained armed with a few of his dependents, in the position which he had occupied.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To a person sent by Philocles to inquire what he meant, he only answered, standing with his shield held out before him, that he meant to die in arms in defence of the city intrusted to his charge. Philocles then ordered some Thracians to throw their javelins at him and his attendants; and they were all put to death.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thus, notwithstanding the alliance concluded by the Achaeans with the Romans, two of their cities, and those of the greatest consequence, Argos and Corinth, were <pb id="p.1425" n="1425"/>still in the hands of Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Such were the services performed during that summer by the land and sea forces of Rome employed in Greece.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Gaul, the consul Sextus Aelius did nothing worth mention, though he had two armies in the province:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> one, which he had retained under their standards, although it ought to have been disbanded; and of this, which had served under Lucius Cornelius, proconsul, he had given the command to Caius Helvius, the praetor: the other he had brought with him into the province.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He spent nearly the whole summer in compelling the people of Cremona and Placentia to return to their colonies, from whence they had been driven to various places by the calamities of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While Gaul, beyond expectation, remained quiet through the whole year, an insurrection of the slaves was very near taking place in the neighbourhood of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The hostages, given by the Carthaginians, were kept in custody at Setia:

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> as they were the children of the principal families, they were attended by a great multitude of slaves; to this number many were added, in consequence of the late African war, and by the Setians themselves having bought, from among the spoil, several of those which had been captured.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having conspired together, they sent some of their number to engage in the cause the slaves of the country round Setia, and then those at Norba and Circeii. When every thing was fully prepared, they determined, during the games which were soon to be solemnized at the first-mentioned place, to attack the people while intent on the show, and when Setia had been taken in the midst of the slaughter and unexpected turmoil, then to seize on Norba and Circeii.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Information of this atrocious plot was brought to Rome, to Lucius Cornelius Merula, the city praetor. Two slaves came to him before daylight, and disclosed to him in order the whole proceedings and intentions of the conspirators.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The praetor, ordering them to be guarded in his own house, summoned a meeting of the senate;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and having laid before them the information of the discoverers, he was ordered to go himself to the spot, and examine into and crush the conspiracy.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Setting out, accordingly, with five lieutenant-generals, he compelled such as he found in the country to take the military oath, to arm, and follow him.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Having by this tumultuary kind of levy armed about two <pb id="p.1426" n="1426"/>thousand men, while all were ignorant of his destination, he came to Setia.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There the leaders of the conspiracy were instantly apprehended; on which, the remainder fled from the city; but parties were sent through the country to search them out. The services of the two who made the discovery, and of one free person employed, were highly meritorious.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The senate ordered a present to the latter of a hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">asses;</hi><note>322<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 18<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> to the slaves, twenty-five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>80<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 14<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 7<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> each, and their freedom. The price was paid to their owners out of the treasury.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Not long after, intelligence was received, that other slaves, belonging to the remains of the conspiracy, had formed a design of seizing Praeneste. The praetor, Lucius Cornelius, went thither, and inflicted punishment on near five hundred persons concerned in that wicked scheme.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The public were under apprehensions that the Carthaginian hostages and prisoners fomented these plots: watches were, therefore, kept at Rome in all the streets, which the inferior magistrates were ordered to go round and inspect; while the triumvirs of the prison, called the Quarry, were to keep a stricter guard than usual.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Circular letters were also sent by the praetor to all the Latin states, directing that the hostages should be confined within doors, and not at any time allowed the liberty of going into public;

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> and that the prisoners should be kept bound with fetters, of not less than ten pounds weight, and confined in no other place of custody than the common jail.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this year, ambassadors from king Attalus made an offering, in the Capitol, of a golden crown of two hundred and fifty-six pounds' weight, and returned thanks to the senate, because Antiochus, influenced by the authority of the Romans, had withdrawn his troops out of the territories of Attalus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During the same summer, two hundred horsemen, ten elephants, and two hundred thousand pecks of wheat, arrived from king Masinissa for the army in Greece. From Sicily also, and Sardinia, large supplies of provisions were sent, with clothing for the troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Sicily was then governed by Marcus Marcellus, Sardinia by Marcus Porcius Cato, a man of acknowledged integrity and purity of conduct, but deemed too severe in punishing usury.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He drove the usurers entirely out of the island; and restricted or abolished the contribu- <pb id="p.1427" n="1427"/>tions, usually paid by the allies, for maintaining the dignity of the praetors.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul, Sextus Aelius, coming home from Gaul to Rome to hold the elections, elected consuls, Caius Cornelius Cethegus and Quintus Minucius Rufus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two days after was held the election of praetors; and this year, for the first time, six praetors were appointed, in consequence of the increase of the provinces, and the extension of the bounds of the empire.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The persons elected were, Lucius Manlius Vulso, Caius Sempronius Tuditanus, Marcus Sergius Silus, Marcus Helvius, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and Lucius Atilius. Of these Sempronius and Helvius were, at the time, plebeian aediles.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The curule aediles were Quintus Minucius Thermus and Tiberius Sempronius Longus. The Roman games were four times repeated during this year.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On Caius Cornelius and Quintus Minucius becoming consuls, the first business of all was the arrangement of the provinces of the consuls and praetors.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Those of the praetors were the first settled, because that could be transacted by the lots. The city jurisdiction fell to Sergius; the foreign to Minucius; Atilius obtained Sardinia; Manlius, Sicily; Sempronius, the Hither Spain; and Helvius, the Farther.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the consuls were preparing to cast lots for Italy and Macedonia, Lucius Oppius and Quintus Fulvius, plebeian tribunes, stood in their way, alleging, that <quote>Macedonia was a very distant province, and that the principal cause which had hitherto retarded the progress

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> of the war, was, that when it was scarcely entered upon, and just at the commencement of operations, the former consul was always recalled. This was the fourth year since the declaration of war against Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The greater part of one year Sulpicius spent in seeking the king and his army; Villius, on the point of engaging the enemy, was recalled without any thing having been done.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius was detained at Rome, for the greater part of his year, by business respecting religion; nevertheless, he had so conducted affairs, that had he come earlier into the province, or had the cold season been at a greater distance, he might have put an end to hostilities.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was then just going into winter quarters; but, it was stated that he had brought the war into such a state, that if he were not prevented by a successor, he seemed likely to complete it in the course of the ensuing summer.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By such arguments the tribunes so far <pb id="p.1428" n="1428"/>prevailed, that the consuls declared that they would abide by the directions of the senate, if the tribunes would agree to do the same. Both parties having, accordingly, left the consultation perfectly free, a decree was passed, appointing the two consuls to the government of the province of Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Titus Quinctius was continued in command, until a successor should accede by a decree of the senate. To each, two legions were decreed; and they were ordered, with these, to carry on the war with the Cisalpine Gauls, who had revolted from the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A reinforcement of five thousand foot and three hundred horse was ordered to be sent into Macedonia to Quinctius, together with three thousand seamen.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was continued in the command of the fleet. To each of the praetors for the two Spains were granted eight thousand foot, of the allies and Latins, and four hundred horse; so that they might discharge the veteran troops in their provinces. They were further directed to fix the bounds which should divide the hither from the farther province.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Two additional lieutenant-generals were sent to the army in Macedonia, Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who had been consuls in that province.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was thought necessary, that before the consuls and praetors went abroad, some prodigies should be expiated. For the temples of Vulcan and Summanus,<note>Pluto, Summus Manium.</note> at Rome, and a wall and a gate at Fregellae, had been struck by lightning.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At Frusino, light had shone forth during the night. At Asculum, a lamb had been born with two heads and five feet. At Formiae, two wolves entering the town had torn several persons who fell in their way; and, at Rome, a wolf had made its way, not only into the city, but into the Capitol.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Caius Acilius, plebeian tribune, caused an order to be passed, that five colonies should be led out to the sea-coast; two to the mouths of the rivers Vulturnus and Liternus; one to Puteoli; and one to the fort of Salernum.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To these was added Buxentum. To each colony three hundred families were ordered to be sent. The commissioners appointed to conduct them thither, and who were to hold the office for three years, were Marcus Servilius Geminus, Quintus Minucius Thermus, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As soon as the levies, and such other business, religious and civil, as required their per- <pb id="p.1429" n="1429"/>sonal attendance, was finished, both the consuls set out for Gaul.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Cornelius took the direct road towards the Insubrians, who were then in arms, and had been joined by the Caenomanians. Quintus Minucius turned his route to the left side of Italy, and leading away his army to the lower sea, to Genoa, opened the campaign with an invasion of Liguria.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two towns, Clastidium and Litubium, both belonging to the Ligurians, and two states of the same nation, Celela and Cerdicium, surrendered to him. And now, all the states on this side of the Po, except the Boians among the Gauls and the Ilvatians among the Ligurians, were reduced to submission: no less, it is said, than fifteen towns and twenty thousand men surrendered themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then led his legions into the territory of the Boians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Boian army had, not very long before, crossed the Po, and joined the Insubrians and Caenomanians;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for, having heard that the consuls intended to act with their forces united, they wished to increase their own strength by this junction.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when information reached them that one of the consuls was ravaging the country of the Boians, a dispute instantly arose. The Boians demanded, that all, in conjunction, should carry succour to those who were attacked; while the Insubrians positively refused to leave their country defenceless.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In consequence of this dissension, the armies separated; the Boians went to defend their own territory, and the Insubrians, with the Caenomanians, encamped on the banks of the river Mincius.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> About five miles below this spot, the consul Cornelius pitched his camp close to the same river. Sending emissaries hence into the villages of the Caenomanians, and to Brixia, the capital of their tribe, he learned with certainty that their young men had taken arms without the approbation of the elders;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and that the Caenomanians had not joined in the revolt of the Insubrians by any public authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On which he invited to him the principal of the natives, and endeavoured to contrive and concert with them that the Caenomanians should separate from the Insubrians; and either march away and return home, or come over to the side of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This he was not able to effect; but so far, he received solemn assurances that, in case of a battle, they would either stand inactive, or, should any occasion offer, would even assist the Romans. The Insubrians knew not that such an agreement <pb id="p.1430" n="1430"/>had been concluded, but they harboured in their minds some kind of suspicion, that the fidelity of their confederates was wavering.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Wherefore, in forming their troops for battle, not daring to intrust either wing to them, lest, if they should treacherously give ground, they might cause a total defeat, they placed them in reserve behind the line.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At the beginning of the fight, the consul vowed a temple to Juno Sospita, provided the enemy should, on that day, be routed and driven from the field; on which the soldiers raised a shout, declaring, that they would insure to their commander the completion of his vow, and at the same time an attack was made on the enemy. The Insubrians did not stand even the first onset.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Some writers affirm, that the Caenomanians, falling on their rear during the heat of the engagement, caused as much disorder there as prevailed in their front: and that, thus assailed on both sides, thirty-five thousand of them were slain, five thousand seven hundred taken prisoners, among whom was Hamilcar, a Carthaginian general, who had been the cause of the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and that a hundred and thirty military standards and above two hundred waggons were taken.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On this, the towns of the Gauls, which had joined in the revolt of the Insubrians, surrendered to the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The other consul, Minucius, had at first traversed the territories of the Boians, with wide-spread ravaging parties; but afterwards, when that people left the Insubrians, and came home to defend their own property, he kept his men within their camp, expecting to come to a regular engagement with the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor would the Boians have declined a battle, if their spirits had not been depressed by hearing of the defeat of the Insubrians. Upon this, deserting their commander and their camp, they dispersed themselves through the several towns, each wishing to take care of his own effects.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thus they changed the enemy's method of carrying on the war: for, no longer hoping to decide the matter by a single battle, he began again to lay waste the lands, burn the houses, and storm the villages.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At this time, Clastidium was burned, and the legions were led thence against the Ilvatian Ligurians, who alone refused to submit.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That state, also, on learning that the Insubrians had been defeated in battle, and the Boians so terrified that they had not dared to try the fortune of an engagement, made a submis- <pb id="p.1431" n="1431"/>sion.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Letters from the consuls, containing accounts of their successes, came from Gaul to Rome at the same time. Marcus Sergius, city praetor, read them in the senate, and afterwards, by direction of the fathers, in an assembly of the people; on which a supplication, of four days' continuance, was decreed.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was by this time winter; and while Titus Quinctius, after the reduction of Elatia, had his winter quarters distributed in Phocis and Locris, a violent dissension broke out at Opus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One faction invited to their assistance the Aetolians, who were nearest at hand; the other, the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Aetolians arrived first; but the other party, which was the more powerful, refused them admittance, and, despatching a courier to the Roman general, held the city until his arrival.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The citadel was possessed by a garrison belonging to the king, and they could not be prevailed on to retire from thence, either by the threats of the people of Opus, or by the authority of the Roman consul's commands.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What prevented their being immediately attacked was, the arrival of an envoy from the king, to solicit the appointing of a time and place for a conference.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was granted to the king with great reluctance; not that Quinctius did not wish to see war concluded under his own auspices, partly by arms, and partly by negotiation:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for he knew not, yet, whether one of the new consuls would be sent out as his successor, or whether he should be continued in the command; a point which he had charged his friends and relations to labour for with all their might.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But he thought that a conference would answer this purpose;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that it would put it in his power to give matters a turn towards war, in case he remained in the province, or towards peace, if he were to be removed. They chose for the meeting a part of the sea-shore, in the Malian gulf, near Nicaea.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thither Philip came from Demetrias, with five barks and one ship of war: he was accompanied by some principal Macedonians, and an Achaean exile, name Cycliades, a man of considerable note.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> With the Roman general, were king Amynander, Dionysidorus, ambassador from king Attalus, Agesimbrotus, commander of the Rhodian fleet, Phaeneas, praetor of the Aetolians, and two Achaeans, Aristaenus and Xenophon.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Attended by these, the Roman general advanced to the brink of the shore, when the king had come forward to the prow of his vessel, as it lay at anchor; and said, <quote>If you <pb id="p.1432" n="1432"/>will come on the shore, we shall mutually speak and hear with more convenience.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This the king refused; and on Quinctius asking him, <quote>Whom do you fear?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> With the haughty spirit of royalty, he replied, <quote>Fear I have none, but of the immortal gods; but I have no confidence in the faith of those whom I see about you, and least of all in the Aetolians.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <quote>That danger,</quote> said the Roman, <quote>is equal to all in common who confer with an enemy, if no confidence subsists.</quote> <quote>But, Titus Quinctius,</quote> replied the king, <quote>if treachery be intended, the prizes of perfidy are not equal, namely, Philip and Phaeneas.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For it will not be so difficult for the Aetolians to find another praetor, as for the Macedonians to find another king in my place.</quote> &mdash;Silence then ensued.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman expected that he who solicited the conference should open it; and the king thought that he who was to prescribe, not he who received, terms of peace, ought to begin the conference.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length the Roman said, that "his discourse should be very simple; for he would only mention those articles, without which there could be no conditions of peace. These were, that the king should withdraw his garrisons from all the cities of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That he should deliver up to the allies of the Roman people the prisoners and deserters; should restore to the Romans those places in Illyricum of which he had possessed himself by force, since the peace concluded in Epirus; and to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, the cities which he had seized since the death of Ptolemy Philopater.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These were the terms which he required, on behalf of himself and the Roman people: but it was proper that the demands of the allies, also, should be heard.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The ambassador of king Attalus demanded <quote>restitution of the ships and prisoners taken in the sea-fight at Cius; and that Nicephorium, and the temple of Venus, which Philip had pillaged and defaced, should be restored as though they had not been injured.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Rhodians laid claim to Peraea, a tract on the continent, lying opposite to their island, which from early times had been under their jurisdiction; and they required that <quote>the garrisons should be withdrawn from Tassus, Bargylii, and Euroma, and from Sestus and Abydos on the Hellespont;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that Perinthus should be restored to the Byzantians, in right of their ancient title, and that all the sea-port towns and harbours of Asia should be free.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The <pb id="p.1433" n="1433"/>Achaeans demanded the restoration of Corinth and Argos. Phaeneas nearly repeated the demands made by the Romans, that the troops should withdraw out of Greece, and the Aetolians be put in possession of the cities which had formerly been under their dominion.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He was followed by Alexander, a man of eminence among the Aetolians, and, considering his country, not uneloquent.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He said, that <quote>he had long kept silence, not because he expected that any business would be effected in that conference, but because he was unwilling to interrupt any of the allies in their discourse.</quote> He asserted, that <quote>Philip was neither treating for peace with sincerity; and that he had never waged war with true courage, at any time:

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that in negotiating, he was insidious and fradulent; while in war he never fought on equal ground, nor engaged in regular battles; but, skulking about, burned and pillaged towns, and, when worsted, destroyed the prizes of victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But not in that manner did the ancient kings of Macedon behave; they decided the fate of the war in the field, and spared the towns as far as they were able, in order to possess the more opulent empire.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For what sort of conduct was it, to destroy the objects for the possession of which the contest was waged, and thereby leave nothing to himself but fighting? Philip had, in the last year, desolated more cities of his allies in Thessaly, than all the enemies that Thessaly ever had.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> On the Aetolians themselves he had made greater depredations, when he was in alliance with them, than since he became their enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He had seized on Lysimachia, after dislodging the praetor and garrison of the Aetolians. Cius also, a city belonging to their government, he razed from the foundation.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> With the same injustice he held possession of Thebes in Phthiotis, of Echinus, Larissa, and Pharsalus.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, provoked by this discourse of

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Alexander, pushed his ship nearer to the land, that he might be the better heard, and began to speak with much violence, particularly against the Aetolians. But Phaeneas, interrupting him, said that <quote>the business depended not upon words; he must either conquer in war, or submit to his superiors.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>That, indeed, is evident,</quote> said Philip, <quote>even to the blind,</quote> reflecting on Phaeneas, who had a disorder in his eyes: for he was naturally fonder of such pleasantries than became a king; and even in the midst of serious business, did not sufficiently restrain <pb id="p.1434" n="1434"/>himself from ridicule.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then began to express great indignation at the <quote>Aetolians assuming as much importance as the Romans, and insisting on his evacuating Greece; people who could not even tell what were its boundaries. For, of Aetolia itself, a large proportion, consisting of the Agraeans, Apodeotians, and Amphilochians, was no part of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Have they just ground of complaint against me for not refraining from war with their allies, when themselves, from the earliest period, follow, as an established rule, the practice of suffering their young men to carry arms against those allies, withholding only the public authority of the state; while very frequently contending armies have Aetolian auxiliaries on both sides?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I did not seize on Cius by force, but assisted my friend and ally, Prussias, who was besieging it, and Lysimachia I rescued from the Thracians. But since necessity diverted my attention from the guarding of it to this present war, the Thracians have possession of it. So much for the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To Attalus and the Rhodians I in justice owe nothing; for not to me, but to themselves, is the commencement of hostilities to be attributed. However, out of respect to the Romans, I will restore Peraea to the Rhodians, and to Attalus his ships, and such prisoners as can be found.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As to what concerns Nicephorium, and the temple of Venus, what other answer can I make to those

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> who require their restoration, than that I will take on myself the trouble and expense of replanting them &mdash;the

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> only way in which woods and groves which have been cut down can be restored, &mdash;since it is thought fit that, between kings, such kinds of demands should be made and answered.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The last part of his speech was directed to the Achaeans, wherein he enumerated, first, the kindnesses of Antigonus; then, his own towards their nation, desiring them to consider the decrees themselves had passed concerning him, which comprehended every kind of honour, divine and human; and to these he added their late decree, by which they had confirmed the resolution of deserting him.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He inveighed bitterly against their perfidy, but told them, that nevertheless he would give them back Argos. <quote>With regard to Corinth, he would consult with the Roman general;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and would, at the same time, inquire from him, whether he thought it right, that he (Philip) should evacuate only those cities which, being captured by himself, were <pb id="p.1435" n="1435"/>held by the right of war; or those, also, which he had received from his ancestors.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Achaeans and Aetolians were preparing to answer, but, as the sun was near setting, the conference was adjourned to the next day; and Philip returned to his station whence he came, the Romans and allies to their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the following day, Quinctius repaired to Nicaea, which was the place agreed on, at the appointed time; but neither Philip, nor any messenger from him, came for several hours. At length, when they began to despair of his coming, his ships suddenly appeared. He said, that <quote>the terms enjoined were so severe and humiliating, that, not knowing what to determine, he had spent the day in deliberation.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the general opinion was, that he had purposely delayed the business until late, that the Achaeans and Aetolians might not have time to answer him:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and this opinion he himself confirmed, by desiring that time might not be consumed in altercation, and, to bring the affair to some conclusion, that the others should retire, and leave him to converse with the Roman general.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For some time this was not admitted, lest the allies should appear to be excluded from the conference.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Afterwards, on his persisting in his desire, the Roman general, with the consent of all, taking with him Appius Claudius, a military tribune, advanced to the brink of the coast, and the rest retired.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king, with the two persons whom he had brought the day before, came on shore, where they conversed a considerable time in private.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What account of their proceedings Philip gave to his people is not well known: what Quinctius told the allies was, that <quote>Philip was willing to cede to the Romans the whole coast of Illyricum, and to give up the deserters and prisoners, if there were any.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That he consented to restore to Attalus his ships, and the seamen taken with them; and to the Rhodians the tract which they call Peraea. That he refused to evacuate Iassus and Bargylii.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the Aetolians he was ready to restore Pharsalus and Larissa; Thebes he would not restore: and that he would give back to the Achaeans the possession, not only of Argos, but of Corinth also.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This arrangement pleased none of the parties; neither those to whom the concessions were to be made, nor those to whom they were refused;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>for on that plan,</quote> they said, <quote>more would be lost than gained; nor could the grounds of contention ever be <pb id="p.1436" n="1436"/>removed, but by his withdrawing his forces from every part of Greece.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These expressions, delivered with eagerness and vehemence by every one in the assembly, reached the ears of Philip, though he stood at a distance.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He therefore requested of Quinctius, that the whole business might be deferred until the next day; and then he would, positively, either prevail on the allies, or suffer himself to be prevailed on by them.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The shore at Thronium was appointed for their meeting, and there they assembled early. Philip began with entreating Quinctius, and all who were present, not to harbour such sentiments as must embarrass a negotiation of peace;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and then desired time, while he could send ambassadors to Rome, to the senate, declaring, that <quote>he would either obtain a peace on the terms mentioned, or would accept whatever terms the senate should prescribe.</quote> None by any means approved of this; they said, he only sought a delay, and leisure to collect his strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But Quinctius observed, <quote>that such an objection would have been well founded, if it were then summer and a season fit for action;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> as matters stood, and the winter being just at hand, nothing would be lost by allowing him time to send ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For, without the authority of the senate, no agreement which they might conclude with the king would be valid; and besides, they would by this means have an opportunity, while the winter itself would necessarily cause a suspension of arms, to learn the authoritative decision of the senate.</quote> The other chiefs of the allies came over to this opinion:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and a cessation of hostilities for two months being granted, they resolved that each of their states should send an ambassador with the necessary information to the senate, and in order that it should not be deceived by the misrepresentations of Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To the above agreement for a truce, was added an article, that all the king's troops should be immediately withdrawn from Phocis and Locris.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With the ambassadors of the allies, Quinctius sent Amynander, king of Athamania; and, to add a degree of splendour to the embassy, a deputation from himself, composed of Quintus Fabius, the son of his wife's sister, Quintus Fulvius, and Appius Claudius.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On their arrival at Rome, the ambassadors of the allies were admitted to audience before those of the king. Their discourse, in general, was filled up with invectives against Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.1437" n="1437"/>What produced the greatest effect on the minds of the senate was, that, by pointing out the relative situations of the lands and

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> seas in that part of the world, they made it manifest to every one, that if the king held Demetrias in Thessaly, Chalcis in Eub&oelig;a, and Corinth in Achaia, Greece could not be free;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and they added, that Philip himself, with not more insolence than truth, used to call these the fetters of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The king's ambassadors were then introduced, and when they were beginning a long harangue, a short question cut short their discourse: &mdash;Whether he was willing to yield up the three above-mentioned cities? They answered, that they had received no specific instructions on that head: on which they were dismissed, the negotiation being left unsettled. Full authority was given to Quinctius to determine every thing relative to war and peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As this demonstrated clearly that the senate were not weary of the war, so he, who was more earnestly desirous of conquest than of peace, never afterwards consented to a conference with Philip; and even gave him notice that he would not admit any embassy from him, unless it came with information that he was retiring from the whole of Greece.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip now perceived that he must decide the matter in the field, and collect his strength about him from all quarters.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Being particularly uneasy in respect to the cities of Achaia, a country so distant from him, and also of Argos, even more, indeed, than of Corinth, he resolved, as the most advisable method, to put the former into the hands of Nabis, tyrant of Lacedaemon, in trust, as it were, on the terms, that if he should prove successful in the war, Nabis should redeliver it to him; if any misfortune should happen, he should keep it himself. Accordingly, he wrote to Philocles, who had the command in Corinth and Argos, to have a meeting with the tyrant.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philocles, besides coming with a valuable present, added to that pledge of future friendship between the king and the tyrant, that it was Philip's wish to unite his daughters in marriage to the sons of Nabis.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tyrant, at first, refused to receive the city on any other conditions than that of being invited to its protection by a decree of the Argives themselves: but afterwards.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> hearing that in a full assembly they had treated the name of the tyrant not only with scorn, but even with abhorrence, he thought he had now a <pb id="p.1438" n="1438"/>sufficient excuse for plundering them, and he accordingly desired Philocles to give him possession of the place as soon as he pleased.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nabis was admitted into the city in the night, without the privity of any of the inhabitants, and, at the first light, seized on the higher parts of it, and shut the gates.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A few of the principal people having made their escape, during the first confusion, the properties of all who were absent were seized as booty: those who were present were stripped of their gold and silver, and loaded with exorbitant contributions.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Such as paid these readily were discharged, without personal insult and laceration of their bodies; but such as were suspected of hiding or reserving any of their effects, were mangled and tortured like slaves.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then summoned an assembly, in which he promulgated two measures; one for an abolition of debts, the other for a distribution of the land, in shares, to each man &mdash;two firebrands in the hands of those who were desirous of revolution, for inflaming the populace against the higher ranks.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The tyrant, when he had the city of Argos in his power, never considering from whom or on what conditions he had received it, sent ambassadors to Elatia, to Quinctius, and to Attalus, in his winter quarters at Aegina, to tell them, that <quote>he was in possession of Argos;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that if Quinctius would come hither, and consult with him, he had no doubt but that every thing might be adjusted between them.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius, in order that he might deprive Philip of that strong-hold, along with the rest, consented to come;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> accordingly, sending a message to Attalus, to leave Aegina, and meet him at Sicyon, he set sail from Anticyra with ten quinqueremes, which his brother, Lucius Quinctius, happened to have brought a little before from his winter station at Corcyra, and passed over to Sicyon.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Attalus was there before him, who, representing that the tyrant ought to come to the Roman general, not the general to the tyrant, brought Quinctius over to his opinion, which was, that he should not enter the city of Argos.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not far from it, however, was a place called Mycenica; and there the parties agreed to meet.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius came, with his brother and a few military tribunes; Attalus, with his royal retinue; and Nicostratus, the praetor of the Achaeans, with a few of the auxiliary officers: and they there found Nabis waiting with his whole army.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He advanced, armed, and attended by his <pb id="p.1439" n="1439"/>armed guards, almost to the middle of the interjacent plain; Quinctius unarmed, with his brother and two military tribunes; the king was accompanied by one of his nobles, and the praetor of the Achaeans, unarmed likewise.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The tyrant, when he saw the king and the Roman general unarmed, opened the conference, with apologizing for having come to the meeting armed himself, and surrounded with armed men. <quote>He had no apprehensions,</quote> he said, <quote>from them; but only from the Argive exiles.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they then began to treat of the conditions of their friendship, the Roman made two demands: one, that the war with the Achaeans should be put an end to; the other, that he should send him aid against Philip. He promised the aid required; but, instead of a peace with the Achaeans, a cessation of hostilities was obtained, to last until the war with Philip should be concluded.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A debate concerning the Argives, also, was set on foot by king Attalus, who charged Nabis with holding their city by force, which was put into his hands by the treachery of Philocles; while Nabis insisted, that he had been invited by the Argives themselves to afford them protection.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king required a general assembly of the Argives to be convened, that the truth of that matter might be known. To this the tyrant did not object; but the king alleged, that the Lacedaemonian troops ought to be withdrawn from the city, in order to render the assembly free;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that the people should be left at liberty to declare their real sentiments.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tyrant refused to withdraw them, and the debate produced no effect. To the Roman general, six hundred Cretans were given by Nabis, who agreed with the praetor of the Achaeans to a cessation of arms for four months, and thus they departed from the conference.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Quinctius proceeded to Corinth, advancing to the gates with the cohort of Cretans, in order that it might be evident to Philocles, the governor of the city, that the tyrant had deserted the cause of Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philocles himself came out to confer with the Roman general; and, on the latter exhorting him to change sides immediately, and surrender the city, he answered in such a manner as showed an inclination rather to defer than to refuse the matter.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Corinth, Quinctius sailed over to Anticyra, and sent his brother thence, to sound the disposition of the people of Acarnania.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Attalus went from Argos to Sicyon. Here, on one side, the state <pb id="p.1440" n="1440"/>added new honours to those formerly paid to the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and, on the other, the king, besides having on a former occasion redeemed for them, at a vast expense, a piece of land sacred to Apollo, unwilling to pass by the city of his friends and allies without a token of munificence, made them a present of ten talents of silver,<note>1937<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></note> and ten thousand bushels of corn, and then returned to Cenchreae to his fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nabis, leaving a strong garrison at Argos, returned to Lacedaemon; and, as he himself had pillaged the men, he sent his wife to Argos to pillage the women.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> She invited the females to her house, sometimes singly, and sometimes several together, who were united by family connexion; and partly by fair speeches, partly by threats, stripped them, not only of their gold, but, at last, even of their garments, and every article of female attire.</p></div1> <div1 type="book" n="33"><head>BOOK XXXIII.</head>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SUCH were the occurrences of the winter. In the beginning of spring, Quinctius, having summoned Attalus to Elatia, and being anxious to bring under his authority the nation of the B&oelig;otians, who had until then been wavering in their dispositions, marched through Phocis, and pitched his camp at the distance of five miles from Thebes, the capital of B&oelig;otia.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next day, attended by one company of soldiers, and by Attalus, together with the ambassadors, who had come to him in great numbers from all quarters, he proceeded towards the city, having ordered the spearmen of two legions, being <pb id="p.1441" n="1441"/>two thousand men, to follow him at the distance of a mile.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About midway, Antiphilus, praetor of the B&oelig;otians, met him: the rest of the people stood on the walls, watching the arrival of the king and the Roman general.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Few arms and few soldiers appeared around them &mdash;the hollow roads, and the valleys, concealing from view the spearmen, who followed at a distance. When Quinctius drew near the city, he slackened his pace, as if with intention to salute the multitude, who came out to meet him;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but the real motive of his delaying was, that the spearmen might come up.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The townsmen pushed forward, in a crowd, before the lictors, not perceiving the band of soldiers who were following them close, until they arrived at the general's quarters. Then, supposing the city betrayed and taken, through the treachery of Antiphilus, their praetor, they were all struck with astonishment and dismay.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was now evident that no room was left to the B&oelig;otians for a free discussion of measures in the assembly, which was summoned for the following day.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> However, they concealed their grief, which it would have been both vain and unsafe to have discovered.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the assembly met, Attalus first rose to speak, and he began his discourse with a recital of the kindnesses conferred by his ancestors and himself on the Greeks in general, and on the B&oelig;otians in particular.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But, being now too old and infirm to bear the exertion of speaking in public, he lost his voice and fell;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and for some time, while they were carrying him to his apartments, (for he was deprived of the use of one half of his limbs,) the proceedings of the assembly were for a short time suspended.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then Aristaenus spoke on the part of the Achaeans, and was listened to with the greater attention, because he recommended to the B&oelig;otians no other measures than those which he had recommended to the Achaeans.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A few words were added by Quinctius, extolling the good faith rather than the arms and power of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A resolution was then proposed, by Dicaearchus of Plataea, for forming a treaty of friendship with the Roman people, which was read; and no one daring to offer any opposition, it was received and passed by the suffrages of all the states of B&oelig;otia.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the assembly broke up, Quinctius made no longer stay at Thebes than the sudden accident to Attalus made necessary.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When it appeared that the force of the disorder had not <pb id="p.1442" n="1442"/>brought the king's life into any immediate danger, but had only occasioned a weakness in his limbs, he left him there, to use the necessary means for recovery, and returned to Elatia, from whence he had come.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having now brought the B&oelig;otians, as formerly the Achaeans, to join in the confederacy, while all places were left behind him in a state of tranquillity and safety, he bent his whole attention towards Philip, and the remaining business of the war.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, on his part, as his ambassadors had brought no hopes of peace

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> from Rome, resolved, as soon as spring began, to levy soldiers through every town in his dominions: but he found a great scarcity of young men;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for successive wars, through several generations, had very much exhausted the Macedonians, and, even in the course of his own reign, great numbers had fallen, in the

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> naval engagements with the Rhodians and Attalus, and in those on land with the Romans. Mere youths, therefore, from the age of sixteen, were enlisted;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and even those who had served out their time, provided they had any remains of strength, were recalled to their standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having, by these means, filled up the numbers of his army about the vernal equinox, he drew together all his forces to Dius: he encamped them there in a fixed post;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and, exercising the soldiers every day, waited for the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> About the same time Quinctius left Elatia, and came by Thronium and Scarphea to Thermopylae. There he held an assembly of the Aetolians, which had been summoned to meet at Heraclea, to determine with what number of auxiliaries they should follow the Roman general to the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the third day, having learned the determination of the allies, he proceeded from Heraclea to Xyniae; and, pitching his camp on the confines between the Aenians and Thessalians, waited for the Aetolian auxiliaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Aetolians occasioned no delay. Six hundred foot and four hundred horse, under the command of Phaeneas, speedily joined him; and then Quinctius, to show plainly what he had waited for, immediately decamped.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On passing into the country of Phthiotis, he was joined by five hundred

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> Cretans of Gortynium, whose commander was Cydantes, with three hundred Apollonians, armed nearly in the same manner; and not long after, by Amynander, with one thousand two hundred Athamanian foot.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, being informed of the departure of the Romans <pb id="p.1443" n="1443"/>from Elatia, and considering that, on the approaching contest, his kingdom was at hazard, thought it advisable to make an encouraging speech to his soldiers;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in which, after he had expatiated on many topics often alluded to before, respecting the virtues of their ancestors, and the military fame of the Macedonians, he touched particularly on those considerations which at the time threw the greatest damp on their spirits, and on those by which they might be animated to some degree of confidence.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the defeat thrice suffered at the narrow passes near the river Aous, by the phalanx of the Macedonians, he opposed the repulse given by main force to the Romans at Atrax:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and even with respect to the former case, when they had not maintained possession of the pass leading into Epirus, he said, <quote>the first fault was to be imputed to those who had been negligent in keeping the guards; and the second, to the light infantry and mercenaries in the time of the engagement; but that, as to the phalanx of the Macedonians, it had stood firm on that occasion; and would for ever remain invincible, on equal ground, and in regular fight.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This body consisted of sixteen thousand men, the prime strength of the army, and of the kingdom. Besides these, he had two thousand targeteers, called Peltastae; of Thracians, and Illyrians of the tribe called Trallians, the like number of two thousand; and of hired auxiliaries, collected out of various nations, about one thousand; and two thousand horse. With this force the king waited for the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans had nearly an equal number; in cavalry alone they had a superiority, by the addition of the Aetolians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius, having decamped to Thebes in Phthiotis, and having received encouragement to hope that the city would be betrayed to him by Timon, a leading man in the state, came up close to the walls with only a small number of cavalry and some light infantry.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So entirely were his expectations disappointed, that he was not only obliged to maintain a fight with the enemy who sallied out against him, but would have incurred a fearful conflict had not both infantry

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> and cavalry been called out hastily from the camp, and come up in time. Not meeting with that success which he had too inconsiderately expected, he desisted from any further attempt to take the city at present.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had received certain information of the king being in Thessaly; but as he had not <pb id="p.1444" n="1444"/>yet discovered into what part of it he had come, he sent his soldiers round the country, with orders to cut timber and prepare palisades.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both Macedonians and Greeks had palisades; but the latter had not adopted the most convenient mode of using them, either with respect to carriage, or for the purpose of strengthening their fortifications.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They cut trees both too large and too full of branches for a soldier to carry easily along with his arms: and after they had fenced their camp with a line of these, the demolition of their palisade was no difficult matter;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for the trunks of large trees appearing to view, with great intervals between them, and the numerous and strong shoots affording the hand a good hold, two, or at most three young men, uniting their efforts, used to pull out one tree, which, being removed,

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> a breach was opened as wide as a gate, and there was nothing at hand with which it could be stopped up.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the Romans cut light stakes, mostly of one fork, with three, or at the most four branches; so that a soldier, with his arms slung at his back, can conveniently carry several of them together;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and then they stick them down so closely, and interweave the branches in such a manner, that it cannot be seen to what main stem any branch belongs; besides which, the boughs are so sharp, and wrought so intimately with each other, as to leave no room for a hand to be thrust between;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> consequently an enemy cannot lay hold of any thing capable of being dragged out, or, if that could be done, could he draw out the branches thus intertwined, and which mutually bind each other.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And even if, by accident, one should be pulled out, it leaves but a small opening, which is very easily filled up.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day Quinctius, causing his men to carry palisades with them, that they might be ready to encamp on any spot, marched forward a short way, and took post about six miles from Pherae;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> whence he sent scouts to discover in what part of Thessaly the king was, and what appeared to be his intention.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philip was then near Larissa, and as soon as he learned that the Roman general had removed from Thebes, being equally impatient for a decisive engagement, he proceeded towards the enemy, and pitched his camp about four miles from Pherae.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the day following, some light troops went out from both camps, to seize on certain hills, which overlooked the city. When, nearly at equal distance from the <pb id="p.1445" n="1445"/>summit which was intended to be seized, they came within sight of each other, they halted;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and sending messengers to their respective camps for directions, how they were to proceed on this unexpected meeting with the enemy, waited their return in quiet.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For that day, they were recalled to their camps, without having commenced any engagement. On the following day, there was a battle between the cavalry, near the same hills, in which the Aetolians bore no small part; and in which the king's troops were defeated, and driven into their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both parties were greatly impeded in the action, by the ground being thickly planted with trees; by the gardens, of which there were many in a place so near the city; and by the roads being enclosed between walls, and in some places shut up.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The commanders, therefore, were equally desirous of removing out of that quarter; and, as if by a preconcerted scheme, they both directed their route to Scotussa: Philip with the hope of getting a supply of corn there; the Roman intending to get before the enemy and destroy the crops.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The armies marched the whole day without having sight of each other in any place, the view being intercepted by a continued range of hills between them.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Romans encamped at Eretria, in Phthiotis; Philip, on the river Onchestus. But though Philip lay at Melambius, in the territory of Scotussa, and Quinctius near Thetidium, in Pharsalia, neither party knew with any certainty where his antagonist was.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the third day, there first fell a violent rain, which was succeeded by darkness equal to that of night, and this confined the Romans to

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> their camp, through fear of an ambuscade.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, intent on hastening his march, and in no degree deterred by the clouds, which after the rain lowered over the face of the country, ordered his troops to march:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and yet so thick a fog had obscured the day, that neither the standard-bearers could see the road, nor the soldiers the standards; so that all, led blindly by the shouts of uncertain guides, fell into disorder, like men wandering by night.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they had passed over the hills called Cynoscephalae, where they left a strong guard of foot and horse, they pitched their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although the Roman general staid at Thetidium, yet he detached ten troops of horse and one thousand foot, to find out where the enemy lay; warning them, however, to beware of ambuscades, which the darkness of the day would cover, even <pb id="p.1446" n="1446"/>in an open country.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When these arrived at the hills, where the enemy's guard was posted, struck with mutual fear, both parties stood, as if deprived of the power of motion. They then sent back messengers to their respective commanders; and when the first surprise subsided, they proceeded to action without more delay. The fight was begun by small advanced parties; and afterwards the numbers of the combatants were increased by reinforcements of men, who supported those who gave way.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In this contest the Romans, being far inferior to their adversaries, sent message after message to the general, that they were being overpowered; on which he hastily sent five hundred horse and two thousand foot, mostly Aetolians, under the command of two military tribunes, who relieved them, and restored the fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Macedonians, distressed in turn by this change of fortune, sent to beg succour from their king;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but as, on account of the general darkness from the fog, he had expected nothing less, on that day, than a battle, and had therefore sent a great number of men, of every kind, to forage, he was, for a considerable time, in great perplexity, and unable to form a resolution.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Subsequently, as the messengers still continued to urge him, and the covering of clouds was now removed from the tops of the mountains, and the Macedonian party was in view, having been driven up to the highest summit, and trusting for safety rather to the nature of the ground than to their arms, he thought it necessary, at all events, to

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> hazard the whole, in order to prevent the loss of a part, for want of support;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and, accordingly, he sent up Athenagoras, general of the mercenary soldiers, with all the auxiliaries, except the Thracians, joined by the Macedonian and Thessalian cavalry.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On their arrival, the Romans were forced from the top of the hill, and did not face about until they came to the level plain. The principal support which saved them from being driven down in disorderly flight, was the Aetolian horsemen.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Aetolians were then by far the best cavalry in Greece; in infantry, they were surpassed by some of their neighbours.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This affair was represented as more successful than the advantage gained in the battle could warrant; for people came, one after another, and calling out that the Romans were flying in a panic;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> so that, though reluctant and hesitating, declaring it a rash proceeding, and that he liked not either the <pb id="p.1447" n="1447"/>place or the time, yet he was prevailed upon to draw out his whole force to battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman general did the same, induced by necessity, rather than by the favourableness of the occasion. Leaving the right wing as a reserve, having the elephants posted in front, he, with the left, and all the right infantry, advanced against the enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> at the same time reminding his men, that <quote>they were going to fight the same Macedonians whom they had fought in the passes of Epirus, fenced, as they were, with mountains and rivers, and whom, after conquering the natural difficulties of the ground, they had dislodged and vanquished; the same, whom they had before defeated under the command of Publius Sulpicius, when they opposed their passage to Eordaea.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That the kingdom of Macedonia had been hitherto supported by its reputation, not by real strength; and that even that reputation had, at length, vanished.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius soon reached his troops, who stood in the bottom of the valley; and they, on the arrival of their general and the army, renewed the fight, and, making a vigorous onset, compelled the enemy again to turn their backs.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Philip, with the targeteers, and the right wing of infantry, (the main strength of the Macedonian army, called by them the phalanx,) advanced at a quick pace, having ordered Nicanor, one of his courtiers, to bring up the rest of his forces with all speed.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At first, on reaching the top of the hill, from a few arms and bodies lying there, he perceived that there had been an engagement on the spot, and that the Romans had been repulsed from it.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he likewise saw the fight now going on close to the enemy's works, he was elated with excessive delight;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but presently, observing his men flying back, and that the panic was on the other side, he was much embarrassed, and hesitated for some time, whether he should cause his troops to retire into the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then, as the enemy approached, he was sensible that his party, besides the losses which they suffered as they fled, must be entirely lost, if not speedily succoured; and as, by this time, even a retreat would be unsafe, he found himself compelled to put all to hazard, before he was joined by the other division of his forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He placed the cavalry and light infantry that had been engaged, on the right wing;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and ordered the targeteers, and the phalanx of Macedonians, to lay aside their spears, which their great length rendered unserviceable, and <pb id="p.1448" n="1448"/>to manage the business with their swords:

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> at the same time, that his line might not be easily broken, he lessened the extent of the front one half, and doubled the files within so that it might be deeper than it was broad. He ordered them also to close their files, so that man might join with man and arms with arms.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius, having received among the standards and ranks those who had been engaged with the enemy, gave the signal by sound of trumpet.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It is said, that such a shout was raised, as was seldom heard at the beginning of any battle; for it happened, that both armies shouted at once; not only the troops then engaged, but also the reserves, and those who were just then coming into the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king, fighting from the higher ground, had the better on the right wing, by means chiefly of the advantage of situation. On the left, all was disorder and confusion; particularly when that division of the phalanx, which had marched in the rear, was coming up.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The centre stood intent on the fight as on a spectacle which in no way concerned them. The phalanx, just arrived, (a column rather than a line of battle, and fitter for a march than for a fight,) had scarcely mounted the top of the hill:

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> before these could form, Quinctius, though he saw his men in the left wing giving

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> way, charged the enemy furiously, first driving on the elephants against them, for he judged that one part being routed would draw the rest after. The affair was no longer doubtful.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Macedonians, repelled by the first shock of the elephants, instantly turned their backs; and the rest, as had been foreseen, followed them in their retreat.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, one of the military tribunes, forming his design in the instant, took with him twenty companies of men; left that part of the army which was evidently victorious; and making a small circuit, fell on the rear of the enemy's right wing. Any army whatever, thus charged from the rear, must have been thrown into confusion. But to that confusion which under such circumstances would be common to all armies, there was in this case an additional cause.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The phalanx of the Macedonians, being heavy, could not readily face about; nor would they have been suffered to do it by their adversaries in front, who, although they gave way to them a little before, on this new occasion pressed them vigorously.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Besides, they lay under another inconvenience in respect of the ground; for, by <pb id="p.1449" n="1449"/>pursuing the retreating enemy down the face of the hill, they had left the top to the party who came round on their rear.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thus attacked on both sides, they were exposed for some time to great slaughter, and then betook themselves to flight, most of them throwing away their arms.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, with a small party of horse and foot, ascended a hill somewhat higher than the rest, to take a view of the situation of his troops on the left.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, when he saw them flying in confusion, and all the hills around glittering with Roman standards and arms, he withdrew from the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius, as he was pressing on the retreating enemy, observed the Macedonians suddenly raising up their spears, and not knowing what they meant thereby, he ordered the troops to halt.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, on being told that this was the practice of the Macedonians when surrendering themselves prisoners, he was disposed to spare the vanquished;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but the troops, not being apprized, either of the enemy having ceased fighting, or of the general's intention, made a charge on them, and the foremost having been cut down, the rest dispersed themselves and fled.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip hastened in disorderly flight to Temp&egrave;, and there halted one day at Gonni, to pick up any who might have survived the battle. The victorious Romans rushed into the Macedonian camp with hopes of spoil, but found it, for the most part, plundered already by the Aetolians. Eight thousand of the enemy were killed on that day, five thousand taken.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of the victors, about seven hundred fell.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If any credit is to be attached to Valerius Antias, who on every occasion exaggerates numbers enormously, the killed of the enemy on that day amounted to forty thousand; the prisoners taken, (in which article the deviation from truth is less extravagant,) to five thousand seven hundred, with two hundred and forty-nine military standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Claudius also asserts that thirty-two thousand of the enemy were slain, and four thousand three hundred taken.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> We have not given entire credit, even to the smallest of those numbers, but have followed Polybius, a safe authority with respect to all the Roman affairs, but especially those which were transacted in Greece.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip having collected, after the flight, such as, having been scattered by the various chances of the battle, had followed his steps, and having sent people to Larissa to burn <pb id="p.1450" n="1450"/>the records of the kingdom, lest they should fall into the hands of the enemy, retired into Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Quinctius set up to sale a part of the prisoners and booty, and part he bestowed on the soldiers; and then proceeded to Larissa, without having yet received any certain intelligence to what quarter Philip had betaken himself, or what were his designs.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To this place came a herald from the king, apparently to obtain a truce, until those who had fallen in battle should be removed and buried, but in reality to request permission to send ambassadors. Both were obtained from the Roman general; who, besides, added this message to the king, <quote>not to be too much dejected.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This expression gave much offence, particularly to the Aetolians, who were become very assuming, and who complained, that <quote>the general was quite altered by success.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Before the battle, he was accustomed to transact all business, whether great or small, in concert with the allies; but they had, now, no share in any of his counsels; he conducted all affairs entirely by his own judgment;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and was even seeking an occasion of ingratiating himself personally with Philip, in order that, after the Aetolians had laboured through all hardships and difficulties of the war, the Roman might assume to himself all the merit and all the fruits of a peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Certain it is, that he had treated them with less respect than formerly, but they did not know why they were thus slighted. They imagined that he was actuated by an expectation of presents from the king, though he was of a spirit incapable of yielding to any such passion of the mind;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but he was, with good reason, displeased at the Aetolians, on account of their insatiable greediness for plunder, and of their arrogance in assuming to themselves the honour of the victory &mdash;a claim so ill founded, as to offend the ears of all.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Besides, he foresaw that, if Philip were removed out of the way, and the strength of the kingdom of Macedonia entirely broken, the Aetolians would necessarily be regarded as the masters of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For these reasons, he intentionally did many things to lessen their importance and reputation in the judgment of the other states.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A truce for fifteen days was granted to the Macedonians, and a conference with the king himself appointed. Before the day arrived on which this was to be held, the Roman general called a council of the allies, and desired their opinions <pb id="p.1451" n="1451"/>respecting the terms of peace, proper to be prescribed.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Amynander, king of Athamania, delivered his opinion in a few words; that <quote>the conditions of peace ought to be adjusted in such a manner, as that Greece might have sufficient power, even without the interference of the Romans, to maintain the peace, and also its own liberty.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The address of the Aetolians was more harsh;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for, after a few introductory observations on the justice and propriety of the Roman general's conduct, in communicating his plans of peace to those who had acted with him as allies in the war, they insisted, that he was utterly mistaken, if he supposed that he could leave the peace with the Romans, or the liberty of Greece, on a permanent footing, unless Philip was either put to death or banished from his kingdom; both which he could easily accomplish, if he chose to pursue his present success."

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Quinctius, in reply, said, that <quote>the Aetolians, in giving such advice, attended not either to the maxims of the Roman policy, or to the consistency of their own conduct.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, in all the former councils and conferences, wherein the conditions of peace were discussed, they never once urged the pushing of the war to the utter ruin of the Macedonian:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and, as to the Romans, besides that they had, from the earliest periods, observed the maxim of sparing the vanquished, they had lately given a signal proof of their clemency in the peace granted to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But, not to insist on the case of the Carthaginians, how often had the confederates met Philip himself in conference, yet that it had never been urged that he should resign his kingdom: and, because he had been defeated in battle, was that a reason that their animosity should become implacable?

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Against an armed foe, men ought to engage with hostile resentment; towards the vanquished, the loftiest spirit was ever the most merciful.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The kings of Macedonia were thought to be dangerous to the liberty of Greece. Suppose that kingdom and nation extirpated, the Thracians, Illyrians, and in time the Gauls, (nations unsubjugated and savage,) would pour themselves into Macedonia first, and then into Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That they should not, by removing inconveniences which lay nearest, open a passage to others greater and more grievous.</quote> Here he was interrupted by Phaeneas, praetor of the Aetolians, who solemnly declared, that <quote>if Philip escaped now, he would soon raise a new and more dangerous <pb id="p.1452" n="1452"/>war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On which Quinctius said, &mdash;<quote>Cease wrangling, when you ought to deliberate. The king shall be bound down by such conditions as will not leave it in his power to raise a war.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit ="chapter" n="13"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The convention was then adjourned; and next day, the king came to the pass at the entrance of Temp&egrave;, the place appointed for a conference;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and the third day following was fixed for introducing him to a full assembly of the Romans and allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On this occasion Philip, with great prudence, intentionally avoided the mention of any of those conditions, without which peace could not be obtained, rather than suffer them to be extorted after discussion;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and declared, that he was ready to comply with all the articles which, in the former conference, were either prescribed by the Romans or demanded by the allies; and to leave all other matters to the determination of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although he seemed to have hereby precluded every objection, even from the most inveterate of his enemies, yet, all the rest remaining silent, Phaeneas, the Aetolian, said to him, &mdash;<quote>What!

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip, do you at last restore to us Pharsalus and Larissa, with Cremaste, Echinus, and Thebes in Phthiotis?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On Philip answering, that <quote>he would give no obstruction to their retaking the possession of them,</quote> a dispute arose between the Roman general and the Aetolians about Thebes; for Quinctius affirmed, that it became the property of the Roman people by the laws of war;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> because when, before the commencement of hostilities, he marched his army thither, and invited the inhabitants to friendship, they, although at full liberty to renounce the king's party, yet preferred an alliance with Philip to one with Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Phaeneas alleged, that, in consideration of their being confederates in the war, it was reasonable, that whatever the Aetolians possessed before it began, should be restored; and that, besides, there was, in the first treaty, a provisional clause of that purport, by which the spoils of war,

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> of every kind that could be carried or driven, were to belong to the Romans; and that the lands and captured cities should fall to the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>Yourselves,</quote> replied Quinctius, <quote>annulled the conditions of that treaty, at the time when ye deserted us, and made peace with Philip; but supposing it still remained in force, yet that clause could affect only captured cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Now, the states of Thessaly submitted to us by a voluntary act of their own.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash; <pb id="p.1453" n="1453"/>These words were heard by their allies with universal approbation; but to the Aetolians they were both highly displeasing at the present, and proved afterwards the cause of a war, and of many great disasters attending it.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The terms settled with Philip were, that he should give his son Demetrius, and some of his friends, as hostages; should pay two hundred talents;<note>38,750<hi rend="italics">l.</hi></note> and send ambassadors to Rome, respecting the other articles: for which purpose there should be a cessation of arms for four months. An engagement was entered into, that, in case the senate should refuse to conclude a treaty, his money and hostages should be returned to Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It is said, that one of the principal reasons which made the Roman general wish to expedite the conclusion of a peace, was, that he had received certain information of Antiochus intending to commence hostilities, and to pass over into Europe.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time, and, as some writers say, on the same day, the Achaeans defeated Androsthenes, the king's commander, in a general engagement near Corinth.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Philip, intending to use this city as a citadel, to awe the states of Greece, had invited the principal inhabitants to a conference, under pretence of agreeing with them as to the number of horsemen which the Corinthians could supply towards the war, and these he detained as hostages.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Besides the force already there, consisting of five hundred Macedonians and eight hundred auxiliaries of

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> various kinds, he had sent thither one thousand Macedonians, one thousand two hundred Illyrians, and of Thracians and Cretans (for these served in both the opposite armies) eight hundred.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To these were added B&oelig;otians, Thessalians, and Acarnanians, to the amount of one thousand, all carrying bucklers; with as many of the young Corinthians themselves, as filled up the number of six thousand men under arms, &mdash;a force which inspired Androsthenes with a confident wish to decide the matter in the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nicostratus, praetor of the Achaeans, was at Sicyon, with two thousand foot and one hundred horse; but seeing himself so inferior, both in the number and kind of troops, he did not go outside the walls:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the king's forces, in various excursions, were ravaging the lands of Pellene, Phliasus, and Cleone.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At last, reproaching the enemy with cowardice, they passed over into the territory of Sicyon, and, sailing round Achaia, <pb id="p.1454" n="1454"/>laid waste the whole coast.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As the enemy, while thus employed, spread themselves about too widely and too carelessly, (the usual consequence of too much confidence,) Nicostratus conceived hopes of attacking them by surprise. He therefore sent secret directions to all the neighbouring states, as to what day, and what number from each state, should assemble in arms at Apelaurus, a place in the territory of Stymphalia.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All being in readiness at the time appointed, he marched thence immediately;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and, without the knowledge of any one as to what he was contemplating, came by night through the territory of the Phliasians to Cleone.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had with him five thousand foot, of whom * * * * * *<note>In the original, the number is omitted, or lost.</note> were light-armed, and three hundred horse; with this force he waited there, having despatched scouts to watch on what quarter the enemy should make their irregular inroads.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Androsthenes, utterly ignorant of all these proceedings, set out from Corinth, and encamped on the Nemea, a river running between the confines of Corinth and Sicyon.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Here, dismissing one half of his troops, he divided the remainder into three parts, and ordered all the cavalry of each part to march in separate divisions, and ravage, at the same time, the territories of Pellene, Sicyon, and Phlius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, the three divisions set out by different roads. As soon as Nicostratus received intelligence of this at Cleone, he instantly sent forward a numerous detachment of mercenaries, to seize a pass at the entrance into the territory of Corinth;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and he himself quickly followed, with his troops in two columns, the cavalry proceeding before the head of each, as advanced guards.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In one column marched the mercenary soldiers and light infantry; in the other, the shield-bearers of the Achaeans and other states, who composed the principal strength of the army.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both infantry and cavalry were now within a small distance of the camp, and some of the Thracians had attacked parties of the enemy, who were straggling and scattered over the country, when the sudden alarm reached their tents.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The commander was thrown into the utmost perplexity; for, having never had a sight of the Achaeans, except occasionally on the hills before Sicyon, when they did not venture to come down into the plains, he had never imagined that they would come so far as Cleone.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He ordered <pb id="p.1455" n="1455"/>the stragglers to be recalled by sound of trumpet; commanded the soldiers to take arms with all haste; and, marching out of the gate at the head of thin battalions, drew up his line on the bank of the river.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His other troops, having scarcely had time to be collected and formed, did not withstand the enemy's first onset;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the Macedonians had surrounded their standards in by far the greatest numbers, and now kept the prospect of victory a long time doubtful. At length, being left exposed by the flight of the rest,

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> and pressed by two bodies of the enemy on different sides, by the light infantry on their flank, and by the shield-bearers and targeteers in front, and seeing victory declare against them, they at first gave ground; soon after, being vigorously pushed, they turned their backs;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and most of them, throwing away their arms and having lost all hope of defending their camp, made the best of their way to Corinth.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Nicostratus sent the mercenaries in pursuit of these; and the auxiliary Thracians against the party employed in ravaging the lands of Sicyon: occasioned great carnage in both instances, greater almost than occurred in the battle itself.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Of those who had been ravaging Pellene and Phlius, some, returning to their camp, ignorant of all that had happened, and without any regular order, fell in with the advanced guards of the enemy, where they expected their own.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Others, from the bustle which they perceived, suspecting what was really the case, fled and dispersed themselves in such a manner, that, as they wandered up and down, they were cut off by the very peasants. There fell, on that day, one thousand five hundred: three hundred were made prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All Achaia was thus relieved from their great alarm.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the battle at Cynoscephalae, Lucius Quinctius had invited to Corcyra some chiefs of the Acarnanians, the only state in Greece which had continued to maintain its alliance with the Macedonians; and there made some kind of scheme for a change of measures.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Two causes, principally, had retained them in friendship with the king: one was a principle of honour, natural to that nation; the other, their fear and hatred of the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A general assembly was summoned to meet at Leucas; but neither did all the states of Acarnania come thither, nor were those who did attend agreed in opinion. However, the magistrates and leading men prevailed so far, as to get a decree passed, thus privately, <pb id="p.1456" n="1456"/>for joining in alliance with the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This gave great offence to those who had not been present; and, in this ferment of the nation, Androcles and Echedemus, two men of distinction among the Acarnanians, being commissioned by Philip, had influence enough in the assembly, not only to obtain the repeal of the decree for an alliance

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> with Rome, but also the condemnation, on a charge of treason, of Archesilaus and Bianor, both men of the first rank in Acarnania, who had been the advisers of that measure; and to deprive Zeuxidas, the praetor, of his office, for having put it to the vote.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The persons condemned took a course apparently desperate, but successful in the issue: for, while their friends advised them to yield to the necessity of the occasion, and withdraw to Corcyra, to the Romans, they resolved to present themselves to the multitude;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and either, by that act, to mollify their resentment, or endure whatever might befall them.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they had introduced themselves into a full assembly, at first, a murmur arose, expressive of surprise; but presently silence took place, partly from respect to their former dignity, partly from commiseration of their present situation.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having been also permitted the liberty of speaking, at first they addressed the assembly in a suppliant manner; but, in the progress of their discourse, when they came to refute the charges made against them, they spoke with that degree of confidence which innocence inspires.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At last, they even ventured to utter some complaints, and to charge the proceedings against them with injustice and cruelty; and this had such an effect on the minds of all present, that, with one consent, they annulled all the decrees passed against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nevertheless, they came to a resolution, to renounce the friendship of the Romans, and return to the alliance with Philip.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These decrees were passed at Leucas, the capital of Acarnania, the place where all the states usually met in council.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As soon, therefore, as the news of this sudden change reached the lieutenant-general Flamininus, in Corcyra, he instantly set sail with the fleet for Leucas; and coming to an anchor at a place called Heraeus, advanced thence towards the walls with every kind of machine used in the attacking of cities;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> supposing that the first appearance of danger might bend the minds of the inhabitants to submission.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But seeing no prospect of effecting any thing, except by force, he began <pb id="p.1457" n="1457"/>to erect towers and sheds, and to bring up the battering-rams to the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The whole of Acarnania, being situated between Aetolia and Epirus, faces towards the west and the Sicilian sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Leucadia, now an island, separated from Acarnania by a shallow strait which was dug by the hand, was then a peninsula, united on its eastern side to Acarnania by a narrow isthmus: this isthmus was about five hundred paces in length, and in breadth not above one hundred and twenty.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the entrance of this narrow neck stands Leucas, stretching up part of a hill which faces the east and Acarnania: the lower part of the town is level, lying along the sea, which divides Leucadia from Acarnania.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus it lies open to attacks, both from the sea and from the land; for the channel is more like a marsh than a sea, and all the adjacent ground is solid enough to render the construction of works easy. In many places, therefore, at once the walls fell down, either undermined, or demolished by the ram.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the spirit of the besieged was as invincible as the town itself was favourably situated for the besiegers: night and day they employed themselves busily in repairing the shattered parts of the wall;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and, stopping up the breaches that were made, fought the enemy with great spirit, and showed a wish to defend the walls by their arms rather than themselves by the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And they would certainly have protracted the siege to a length unexpected by the Romans, had not some exiles of Italian birth, who resided in Leucas, admitted a band of soldiers into the citadel:

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> notwithstanding which, when those troops ran down from the higher ground with great tumult and uproar, the Leucadians, drawing up in a body in the forum, withstood them for a considerable time in regular fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Meanwhile the walls were scaled in many places; and the besiegers, climbing over the rubbish, entered the town through the breaches.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And now the lieutenant-general himself surrounded the combatants with a powerful force. Being thus hemmed in, many were slain, the rest laid down their arms, and surrendered to the conqueror.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> In a few days after, on hearing of the battle at Cynoscephalae, all the states of Acarnania made their submission to the lieutenant-general.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>























<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time, fortune, depressing the same party in every quarter at once, the Rhodians, in order to recover from Philip the tract on the continent called Peraea, which

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had <pb id="p.1458" n="1458"/>been in possession of their ancestors, sent thither their praetor, Pausistratus, with eight hundred Achaean foot, and about one thousand nine hundred men, made up of auxiliaries of various nations.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These were Gauls, Nisuetans, Pisuetans, Tamians, Areans from Africa, and Laodiceans from Asia.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With this force Pausistratus seized by surprise Tendeba, in the territory of Stratonice, a place exceedingly convenient for his purpose, without the knowledge of the king's troops who had held it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A reinforcement of one thousand Achaean foot and one hundred horse, called out for the same expedition, came up at the very time, under a commander called Theoxenus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Dinocrates, the king's general, with design to recover the fort, marched his army first to Tendeba, and then to another fort called Astragon, which also stood in the territory of Stratonice. Then, calling in all the garrisons, which were scattered in many different places, and the Thessalian auxiliaries from Stratonice itself, he led them on to Alabanda, where the enemy lay.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Rhodians were no way averse from a battle, and the camps being pitched near each other, both parties immediately came into the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Dinocrates placed five hundred Macedonians on his right wing, and the Agrians on his left;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the centre he formed of the troops which he had drawn together out of the garrisons of the forts; these were mostly Carians; and he covered the flanks with the cavalry, and the Cretan and Thracian auxiliaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Rhodians had on the right wing the Achaeans; on the left, mercenary soldiers; and in the centre a chosen band of infantry, a body of auxiliaries composed of troops of various nations.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The cavalry and what light infantry they had, were posted on the wings.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> During that day both armies remained on the banks of a rivulet, which ran between them, and, after discharging a few javelins, they retired into their camps. Next day, being drawn up in the same order, they fought a more important battle than could have been expected, considering the numbers engaged; for there were not more than three thousand infantry on each side, and about one hundred horse:

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> but they were not only on an equality with respect to numbers, and the kind of arms which they used, but they also fought with equal spirit and equal hopes.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> First, the Achaeans, crossing the rivulet, made an attack on the Agrians; then the whole line passed the river, almost at full speed.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The <pb id="p.1459" n="1459"/>fight continued doubtful a long time: the Achaeans, one thousand in number, drove back the four hundred from their position.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Then the left wing giving way, all exerted themselves against the right. On the Macedonians no impression could be made, so long as their phalanx preserved its order, each man clinging as it were to another:

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> but when, in consequence of their flank being left exposed, they endeavoured to turn their spears against the enemy, who were advancing upon that side, they immediately broke their ranks.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> This first caused disorder among themselves; they then turned their backs, and at last, throwing away their arms, and flying with precipitation, made the best of their way to Bargylii. To the same place Dinocrates also made his escape.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The Rhodians continued the pursuit as long as the day lasted, and then retired to their camp. There is every reason to believe, that, if the victors had proceeded with speed to Stratonice, that city would have been gained without a contest;

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> but the opportunity for effecting this was neglected, and the time wasted in taking possession of the forts and villages in Peraea.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> In the mean time, the courage of the troops in garrison at Stratonice revived; and shortly after, Dinocrates, with the troops which had escaped from the battle, came into the town, which, after that, was besieged and assaulted without effect; nor could it be reduced until a long time after that, when Antiochus took it.

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Such were the events that took place in Thessaly, in Achaia, and in Asia, all about the same time.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip was informed that the Dardanians, in contempt of the power of his kingdom, shaken as at that time it was,

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had passed the frontiers, and were spreading devastation through the upper parts of Macedonia:

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> on which, though he was hard pressed in almost every quarter of the globe, fortune on all occasions defeating his measures and those of his friends, yet, thinking it more intolerable than death to be expelled from the possession of Macedonia, he made hasty levies through the cities of his dominions; and, with six thousand foot and five hundred horse, defeated the enemy by a surprise near Stobi in Paeonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Great numbers were killed in the fight, and greater numbers of those who were scattered about in quest of plunder. As to such as found a road open for flight, without having even tried the chance of an engagement, they <pb id="p.1460" n="1460"/>hastened back to their own country.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After this enterprise, executed with a degree of success beyond what he met in the rest of his attempts, and which raised the drooping courage of his people, he retired to Thessalonica.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Seasonable as was the termination of the Punic war, in extricating the Romans from the danger of a quarrel with Philip, the recent triumph over Philip happened still more opportunely, when Antiochus, in Syria, was already making preparations for hostilities.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For besides that it was easier to wage war against them separately than if both had combined their forces together, Spain had, a little before this time, risen in arms in great commotion.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Antiochus, though he had in the preceding summer reduced under his power all the states in C&oelig;le-Syria belonging to Ptolemy, and retired into winter quarters at Antioch, yet allowed himself no relaxation from the exertions of the summer.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For resolving to exert the whole strength of his kingdom, he collected a most powerful force, both naval and military; and in the beginning of spring, sending forward by land his two sons, Ardues and Mithridates, at the head of the army, with orders to wait for him at Sardis, he himself set out

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> by sea, with a fleet of one hundred decked ships, besides two hundred lighter vessels, barks and fly-boats, designing to attempt the reduction of all the cities under the dominion of Ptolemy along the whole coast of Caria and Cilicia;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and, at the same time, to aid Philip with an army and ships, for as yet that war had not been brought to a conclusion.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Rhodians, out of a faithful attachment to the Roman people, and an affection for the whole race of the Greeks, have performed many honourable exploits, both on land and sea:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but never was their gallantry more eminently conspicuous than on this occasion, when, nowise dismayed at the formidable magnitude of the impending war, they sent ambassadors to tell the king, that he should not double the point of Cheledoniae, which is a promontory of Cilicia, rendered famous by an ancient treaty between the Athenians and the king of Persia;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that if he did not confine his fleet and forces to that boundary, they would meet him there and oppose him, not out of any ill will, but because they would not suffer him to join Philip and obstruct the Romans, who were restoring liberty to Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At this time Antiochus was pushing on the siege of Coracesium with his works; for, after he had got <pb id="p.1461" n="1461"/>possession of Zephyrium, Solae, Aphrodisias, and Corycus;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and doubling Anemurium, another promontory of Cilicia, had taken Selinus; when all these, and the other fortresses on that coast, had, either through fear or inclination, submitted without resistance, Coracesium shut its gates, and gave him a delay which he did not expect.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Here an audience was given to the ambassadors of the Rhodians, and although the purport of their embassy was such as might kindle passion in the breast of a king, yet he stifled his resentment, and answered, that <quote>he would send ambassadors to Rhodes, and would give them instructions to renew the old treaties, made by him and his predecessors, with that state;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and to assure them, that they need not be alarmed at his approach; that it would involve no injury or fraud either to them or their allies;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for that he was not about to violate the friendship subsisting between himself and the Romans, both his own late embassy to that people, and the senate's answers and decrees, so honourable to him, were a sufficient evidence.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Just at that time his ambassadors happened to have returned from Rome, where they had been heard and dismissed with courtesy, as the juncture required; the event of the war with Philip being yet uncertain.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While the king's ambassadors were haranguing to the above purpose, in an assembly of the people at Rhodes, a courier arrived with an account of the battle at Cynoscephalae having finally decided the fate of the war. Having received this intelligence, the Rhodians, now freed from all apprehensions of danger from Philip, resolved to oppose Antiochus with their fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nor did they neglect another object that required their attention; the protection of the freedom of the cities in alliance with Ptolemy, which were threatened with war by Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For, some they assisted with men, others by forewarning them of the enemy's designs; by which means they enabled the Cauneans, Mindians, Halicarnassians, and Samians to preserve their liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It were needless to attempt enumerating all the transactions as they occurred in that quarter, when I am scarcely equal to the task of recounting those which immediately concern the war in which Rome was engaged.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time king Attalus, having fallen sick at Thebes, and been carried thence to Pergamus, died at the age of seventy-one, after he had reigned forty-four years.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To this man for- <pb id="p.1462" n="1462"/>tune had given nothing which could inspire hopes of a throne except riches. By a prudent, and, at the same time, a splendid use of these, he begat, in himself first, and then in others, an opinion, that he was not undeserving of a crown.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Afterwards, having in one battle utterly defeated the Gauls, which nation was then the more terrible to Asia, as having but lately made its appearance there, he assumed the title

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> of king, and ever after exhibited a spirit equal to the dignity of that name.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He governed his subjects with the most perfect justice, and observed an unvarying fidelity towards his allies; gentle and bountiful to his friends; affectionate to his wife and four sons, who survived him; and he left his government established on such solid and firm foundations, that the possession of it descended to the third generation.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While this was the posture of affairs in Asia, Greece, and Macedonia, the war with Philip being scarcely ended, and the peace certainly not yet perfected, a desperate insurrection took place in the Farther Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcus Helvius was governor of that province.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He informed the senate by letter, that <quote>two chieftains, Colca and Luscinus, were in arms; that Colca was joined by seventeen towns, and Luscinus by the powerful cities of Carmo and Bardo; and that the people of the whole sea-coast, who had not yet manifested their disposition, were ready to rise on the first motion of their neighbours.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On this letter being read by Marcus Sergius, city praetor, the senate decreed, that, as soon as the election of praetors should be finished, the one to whose lot the government of Spain fell should, without delay, consult the senate respecting the commotions in that province.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time the consuls came

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> home to Rome, and, on their holding a meeting of the senate in the temple of Bellona, and demanding a triumph, in consideration of their successes in the war, Caius Atinius Labeo, and Caius Ursanius, plebeian tribunes, insisted that <quote>the consuls should propose their claims of a triumph separately, for they would not suffer the question to be put on both jointly, lest equal honours might be conferred where the merits were unequal.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Minucius urged, that they had both been appointed to the government of one province, Italy; and that, through the course of their administration, his colleague and himself had been united in sentiments and in counsels;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> to which Cornelius added, that, when the Boians were passing the Po, to assist the <pb id="p.1463" n="1463"/>Insubrians and Caenomanians against him, they were forced to return to defend their own country, from his colleague ravaging their towns and lands.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In reply the tribunes ac- knowledged, that the services performed in the war by Cor- nelius were so great, that <quote>no more doubt could be entertained respecting his triumph than respecting the ascribing of glory to the immortal gods.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless they insisted, that <quote>neither he nor any other member of the community should possess such power and influence as to be able, after obtaining the honour that was due to himself, to bestow the same distinction on a colleague, who immodestly demanded what he had not deserved.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The exploits of Quintus Minucius in Liguria were trifling skirmishes, scarcely deserving mention; and in Gaul he had lost great numbers of soldiers.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They mentioned even military tribunes, Titus Juvencius and Cneius Labeo, of the fourth legion, the plebeian tribune's brother, who had fallen in unsuccessful conflict, together with many other brave men, both citizens and allies: and they asserted, that <quote>pretended surrenders of a few towns and villages, fabricated for the occasion, had been made, without any pledge of fidelity being taken.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These altercations between the consuls and tribunes lasted two days:

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> at last the consuls, overcome by the obstinacy of the tribunes, proposed their claims separately.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To Cneius Cornelius a triumph was unanimously decreed: and the inhabitants of Placentia and Cremona added to the applause bestowed on

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the consul, by returning him thanks, and mentioning, to his honour, that they had been delivered by him from a siege; and that very many of them, when in the hands of the enemy, had been rescued from captivity.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quintus Minucius just tried how the proposal of his claim would be received, and finding the whole senate averse from it, declared, that by the authority of his office of consul, and pursuant to the example of many illustrious men, he would triumph on the Alban mount.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Caius Cornelius, being yet in office, triumphed over the Insubrian and Caenomanian Gauls. He produced a great number of military standards, and carried in the procession abundance of Gallic spoils in captured chariots.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Many Gauls of distinction were led before his chariot, and along with them, some writers say, Hamilcar, the Carthaginian general.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But what, more than all, attracted the eyes of the public, was a crowd of Cremonian and Placentian <pb id="p.1464" n="1464"/>colonists, with caps of liberty on their heads, following his chariot.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He carried in his triumph two hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi><note>766<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 18<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6 1/2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> and of silver denarii, stamped with a chariot, seventy-nine thousand.<note>2551<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 0<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 10<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> He distributed to each of his soldiers seventy <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi><note>4<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6 1/2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> to a horseman and a centurion double that sum.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Quintus Minucius, consul, triumphed on the Alban mount, over the Ligurian and Boian Gauls. Although this triumph was less respectable, in regard to the place and the fame of his exploits, and because all knew the expense was not issued from the treasury; yet, in regard of the number of standards, chariots, and spoils, it was nearly equal to the other. The amount of the money also was nearly equal.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Two hundred and fifty-four thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>820<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> were conveyed to the treasury, and of silver denarii, stamped with a chariot, fifty-three thousand two hundred.<note>1717<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 18<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> He likewise gave to the soldiers, horsemen, and centurions, severally, the same sums that his colleague had given.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the triumph, the election of consuls came on. The persons chosen were Lucius Furius Purpureo and Marcus Claudius Marcellus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next day, the following were elected praetors; Quintus Fabius Buteo, Tiberius Sempronius Longus, Quintus Minucius Thermus, Manius Acilius Glabrio, Lucius Apustius Fullo, and Caius Laelius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Toward the close of this year, a letter came from Titus Quinctius, with information that he had fought a pitched battle with Philip in Thessaly, and that the army of the enemy had been routed and put to flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This letter was read by Sergius, the praetor, first in the senate, and then, by the direction of the fathers, in a general assembly; and supplications of five days' continuance were decreed on account of those successes. Soon after arrived the ambassadors, both from Titus Quinctius and from the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Macedonians were conducted out of the city to the Villa Publica, where lodgings and every other accommodation were provided for them, and an audience of the senate was given them in the temple of Bellona. Not many words passed; for the Macedonians declared, that whatever terms the senate should prescribe, the king was ready to comply with them.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was decreed, that, conformably to ancient practice, ten ambassadors should be appointed, <pb id="p.1465" n="1465"/>and that, in council with them, the general, Titus Quinctius, should grant terms of peace to Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and a clause was added, that, in the number of these ambassadors, should be Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who in their consulships had held the province of Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the same day the inhabitants of Oossa having presented a petition, praying that the number of their colonists might be enlarged; an order was accordingly passed, that one thousand should be added to the list, with a provision, that

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> no persons should be admitted into that number who, at any time since the consulate of Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius, had been partisans of the enemy.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year the Roman games were exhibited in the circus, and on the stage, by the curule aediles, Publius Cornelius Scipio and Cneius Manlius Vulso, with an unusual degree of splendour, and were beheld with the greater delight, in consequence of the late successes in war. They were thrice repeated entire, and the plebeian games seven times.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These were exhibited by Manius Acilius Glabrio and Caius Laelius, who also, out of the money arising from fines, erected three brazen statues, to Ceres, Liber, and Libera.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Lucius Furius and Marcus Claudius Marcellus, having entered on the consulship, when the distribution of

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the provinces came to be agitated, and the senate appeared disposed to vote Italy the province of both, exerted themselves to get that of Macedonia put to the lot along with Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcellus, who of the two was the more eager for that province, by assertions that the peace was merely a feigned and delusive one, and that, if the army were withdrawn thence, the king would renew the war, caused some perplexity in the minds of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls would probably have carried the point, had not Quintus Marcius Rex and Caius Antinius Labeo, plebeian tribunes, declared, that they would enter their protest, unless they were allowed, before any further proceeding, to take the sense of the people, whether it was their will and order that peace be concluded with Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This question was put to the people in the Capitol, and every one of the thirty-five tribes voted on the affirmative side.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The public found the greater reason to rejoice at the ratification of the peace with Macedonia, as melancholy news was brought from Spain; and a letter was made public, announcing that <quote>the proconsul, Caius Sempro- <pb id="p.1466" n="1466"/>nius Tuditanus, had been defeated in battle in the Hither Spain;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that his army had been utterly routed and dispersed, and several men of distinction slain in the fight. That Tuditanus, having been grievously wounded, and carried out of the field, expired soon after.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Italy was decreed the province of both consuls, in which they were to employ the same legions which the preceding consuls had; and they were to raise four new legions, two for the city, and two to be in readiness to be sent whithersoever the senate should direct.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Titus Quinctius Flamininus was ordered to continue in the government of his province, with the army of two legions, then on the spot. The former prolongation of his command was deemed sufficient.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetors then cast lots for their provinces. Lucius Apustius Fullo obtained the city jurisdiction; Manius Acilius Glabrio, that between natives and foreigners; Quintus Fabius Buteo, Farther Spain:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Quintus Minucius Thermus, Hither Spain; Caius Laelius, Sicily; Tiberius Sempronius Longus, Sardinia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To Quintus Fabius Buteo and Quintus Minucius, to whom the government of the two Spains had fallen, it was decreed, that the consuls, out of the four legions raised by them, should give one each whichever they thought fit, together with four thousand foot and three hundred horse of the allies and Latin confederates;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and those praetors were ordered to repair to their provinces at the earliest possible time.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This war in Spain broke out in the fifth year after the former had been ended, together with the Punic war.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Spaniards now, for the first time, had taken arms in their own name, unconnected with any Carthaginian army or general. Before the consuls stirred from the city, however, they were ordered, as usual, to expiate the reported prodigies. Publius Villius, a Roman knight, on the road to Sabinia, had been killed by lightning, together with his horse. The temple of Feronia, in the Capenatian district, had been struck by lightning.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the temple of Moneta, the shafts of two spears had taken fire and burned.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A wolf, coming in through the Esquiline gate, and running through the most frequented part of the city, down into the forum, passed thence through the Tuscan and Maelian streets; and scarcely receiving a stroke, made its escape out of the Capenian gate.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These prodigies were expiated with victims of the larger kinds. <pb id="p.1467" n="1467"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Cneius Cornelius Lentulus, who had held the government of Hither Spain before Sempronius Tuditanus, entered the city in ovation, pursuant to a decree of the senate,

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> and carried in the procession one thousand five hundred and fifteen pounds' weight of gold, twenty thousand of silver; and in coin, thirty-four thousand five hundred and fifty denarii.<note>1115<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 13<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 3 1/2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Lucius Stretinius, from the Farther Spain, without making any pretensions to a triumph, carried into the treasury fifty thousand pounds' weight of silver;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and out of the spoils taken, built two arches in the cattle-market, at the fronts of the temple of Fortune and Mother Matuta, and one in the great Circus; and on these arches placed gilded statues. These were the principal occurrences during the winter.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At this time Quinctius was in winter quarters at Elatia. Among many requests, made to him by the allies, was that of the B&oelig;otians, namely, that their countrymen, who had served in the army with Philip, might be restored to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With this Quinctius readily complied; not because he thought them very deserving, but that, as king Antiochus was already suspected, he judged it advisable to conciliate every state in favour of the Roman interest.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It quickly appeared how very little gratitude existed among the B&oelig;otians; for they not only sent persons to give thanks to Philip for the restoration of their fellows, as if that favour had been conferred on them by him, and not by Quinctius and the Romans; but, at the next election, raised to the office of B&oelig;otarch a man named Brachyllas, for no other reason than because he had been commander of the B&oelig;otians serving in the army of Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> passing by Zeuxippus, Pisistratus, and the others, who had promoted the alliance with Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These men were both offended at the present and alarmed about the future consequences:

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for if such things were done when a Roman army lay almost at their gates, what would become of them when the Romans should have gone away to Italy, and Philip, from a situation so near, should support his own associates, and vent his resentment

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> on those who had been of the opposite party?</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was resolved, while they had the Roman army near at hand, to take off Brachyllas, who was the principal leader of the faction which favoured the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and they chose an opportunity for the deed, when, after having been at a public <pb id="p.1468" n="1468"/>feast, he was returning to his house inebriated, and accompanied by some of his debauched companions, who, for the sake of merriment, had been admitted to the crowded entertainment.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was surrounded and assassinated by six men, of whom three were Italians and three Aetolians. His companions fled, crying out for help; and a great uproar ensued among the people, who ran up and down, through all parts of the city, with lights: but the assassins made their escape through the nearest gate.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the first dawn, a full assembly was called together in the theatre, by the voice of a crier, as if in consequence of a previous appointment.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Many openly clamoured that Brachyllas was killed by those detestable wretches who accompanied him; but their private conjectures pointed to Zeuxippus, as author of the murder.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was resolved, however, that those who had been in company with him should be seized and examined in their presence.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While they were under examination, Zeuxippus, with his usual composure, came into the assembly, for the purpose of averting the charge from himself; yet said, that people were mistaken in supposing that so daring a murder was the act of such effeminate wretches as those who were charged with it, urging many plausible arguments to the same purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By which behaviour he led several to believe, that, if he were conscious of guilt, he would never have presented himself before the multitude, or, without being challenged by any, have made any mention of the murder.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Others were convinced that he intended, by thus unblushingly exposing himself to the charge, to throw off all suspicion from himself. Soon after, those men who were innocent were put to the torture; and, taking the universal opinion as having the effect of evidence, they named Zeuxippus and Pisistratus; but they produced no proof to show that they knew any thing of the matter.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Zeuxippus, however, accompanied by a man named Stratonidas, fled by night to Tanagra; alarmed by his own conscience rather than by the assertion of men who were privy to no one circumstance of the affair. Pisistratus, despising the informers, remained at Thebes.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A slave of Zeuxippus had carried messages backwards and forwards, and had been intrusted with the management of the whole business. From this man Pisistratus dreaded a discovery; and by that very dread forced him, against his will, to make one.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He sent a letter <pb id="p.1469" n="1469"/>to Zeuxippus, desiring him to <quote>put out of the way the slave who was privy to their crime; for he did not believe him as well qualified for the concealment of the fact as he was for the perpetration of it.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He ordered the bearer of this letter to deliver it to Zeuxippus as soon as possible; but he, not finding an opportunity of meeting him, put it into the hands of the very slave in question, whom he believed to be the most faithful to his master of any; and added, that it came from Pisistratus respecting a matter of the utmost consequence to Zeuxippus.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Struck by consciousness of guilt, the slave, after promising to deliver the letter, immediately opened it; and, on reading the contents, fled in a fright to Thebes and laid the information before the magistrate.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Zeuxippus, alarmed by the flight of his slave, withdrew to Athens, where he thought he might live in exile with greater safety. Pisistratus, after being examined several times by torture, was put to death.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This murder exasperated the Thebans, and all the B&oelig;otians, to the most rancorous animosity against the Romans, for they considered that Zeuxippus, one of the first men of the nation, had not been party to such a crime without the instigation of the Roman general.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To recommence a war, they had neither strength nor a leader; but they had recourse to private massacres, as being next to war, and cut off many of the soldiers, some as they came to lodge in their houses, others as they wandered about their winter quarters, or were on leave of absence for various purposes.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some were killed on the roads by parties lying in wait in lurking-places; others were seduced and carried away to inns, which were left uninhabited, and there put to death.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At last they committed these crimes, not merely out of hatred, but likewise from a desire of booty; for the soldiers on furlough generally carried money in their purses for the purpose of trading.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first a few at a time, afterwards greater numbers used to be missed, until all B&oelig;otia became notorious for those practices, and a soldier went beyond the bounds of the camp with more timidity than into an enemy's country.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius then sent deputies round the states, to make inquiry concerning the murders committed. The greatest number of murders were found to have been committed about the lake called Copais; there the bodies were dug out of the mud, and drawn up out <pb id="p.1470" n="1470"/>of the marsh, having had earthen jars or stones tied to them, so as to be dragged to the bottom by the weight. Many deeds of this sort were discovered to have been perpetrated at Acr&oelig;phia and Coronea.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius at first insisted that the persons guilty should be given up to him, and that, for five hundred soldiers, (for so many had been cut off,) the B&oelig;otians should pay five hundred talents.<note>96,875<hi rend="italics">l.</hi></note>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Neither of these requisitions being complied with, and the states only making verbal apologies, declaring, that none of those acts had been authorized by the public; Quinctius first sent ambassadors to Athens and Achaia, to satisfy the allies, that the war which he was about to make on the B&oelig;otians was conformable to justice and piety;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and then, ordering Publius Claudius to march with one-half of the troops to Acr&oelig;phia, he himself, with the remainder, invested Coronea; and these two bodies, marching by different roads from Elatia, laid waste all the country through which they passed.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The B&oelig;otians, dismayed by these losses, while every place was filled with fugitives, and while the terror became universal, sent ambassadors to the camp; and as these were refused admittance, the Achaeans and Athenians came to their assistance.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Achaeans had the greater influence as intercessors; inasmuch as they were resolved, in case they could not procure peace for the B&oelig;otians, to join them in the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Through the mediation of the Achaeans, however, the B&oelig;otians obtained admission and an audience of the Roman general; who, ordering them to deliver up the guilty, and to pay thirty talents<note>5821<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></note> as a fine, granted them peace, and raised the siege.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days after this, the ten ambassadors arrived from Rome, in pursuance of whose counsel, peace was granted to Philip on the following conditions:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>That all the Grecian states, as well those in Asia as those in Europe, should enjoy liberty, and their own laws: That from such of them as had been in the possession of Philip, he should withdraw his garrisons, particularly from the following places in Asia; Euromus, Pedasi, Bargylii, Iassus, Myrina, Abydus;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and from Thasus and Perinthus, for it was determined that these likewise should be free: That with respect to the freedom of Cius, Quinctius should write to Prusias, king of Bithynia, the resolutions of the senate, and of the ten ambassadors:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That <pb id="p.1471" n="1471"/>Philip should return to the Romans the prisoners and deserters, and deliver up all his decked ships, excepting five and the royal galley, &mdash;of

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> a size almost unmanageable, being moved by sixteen banks of oars: That he should not keep more than five hundred soldiers, nor any elephant: That he should not wage war beyond the bounds of Macedonia without permission from the senate:

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That he should pay to the Roman people one thousand talents:<note>193,750<hi rend="italics">l.</hi></note> one half at present, the other by instalments, within ten years.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Valerius Antias writes, that there was imposed on him an annual tribute of four thousand pounds' weight of silver, for ten years, and an immediate payment of twenty thousand pounds' weight.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The same author says, that an article was expressly inserted, that he should not make war on Eumenes, Attalus's son, who had lately come to the throne.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For the performance of these conditions hostages were received, among whom was Demetrius, Philip's son.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Valerius Antias adds, that the island of Aegina, and the elephants, were given as a present to Attalus, who was absent; to the Rhodians, Stratonice, and other cities of Caria which had been in the possession of Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and to the Athenians, the islands of Paros, Imbros, Delos, and Scyros.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While all the other states of Greece expressed their approbation of these terms of peace, the Aetolians alone, in private murmurs, made severe strictures on the determination of the ten ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They said, <quote>it consisted merely of an empty piece of writing varnished over with a fallacious appearance of liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For why should some cities be put into the hands of the Romans without being named, while others were particularized, and ordered to be enfranchised without such consignment; unless the intent was, that those in Asia, which, from their distant situation, were more secure from danger, should be free; but those in Greece, not being even mentioned by name, should be made their property: Corinth, Chalcis, and Oreum; with Eretria, and Demetrias.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor was this charge entirely without foundation: for there was some hesitation with respect to Corinth, Chalcis, and Demetrias; because, in the decree of the senate in pursuance of which the ten ambassadors had been sent from Rome, all Greece and Asia, except these three, were expressly ordered to be set at liberty;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but, with regard to these, ambassadors <pb id="p.1472" n="1472"/>were instructed, that, whatever measures the exigencies of the state might render expedient, they should determine to pursue in conformity to the public good and their own honour.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> King Antiochus was one of whom they did not doubt that, so soon as he was satisfied that his forces were adequate, he would cross over into Europe; and they were unwilling to let these cities, the possession of which would be so advantageous to him, lie open to his occupation.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius, with the ten ambassadors, sailed from Elatia to Anticyra, and thence to Corinth. Here the plans they had laid down respecting the liberation of Greece were discussed for about three days in a council of the ten ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Quinctius frequently urged, that <quote>every part of Greece ought to be set at liberty, if they wished to refute the cavils of the Aetolians; if they wished, that sincere affection and respect for the Roman nation should be universally entertained;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> or if they wished to convince the world that they had crossed the sea with the design of liberating Greece, and not of transferring the sovereignty of it from Philip to themselves.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Macedonians alleged nothing in opposition to the arguments made use of in favour of the freedom of the cities; but <quote>they thought it safer for those cities themselves that they should remain, for a time, under the protection of Roman garrisons, than be obliged to receive Antiochus for a master in the room of Philip.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their final determination was, that <quote>Corinth be restored to the Achaeans, but that a Roman garrison should continue in the citadel; and that Chalcis and Demetrias be retained, until their apprehensions respecting Antiochus should cease.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The stated solemnity of the Isthmian games was at hand. These have ever been attended by very numerous meetings, as well on account of the universal fondness entertained by this nation for exhibitions of skill in arts of every kind, as well as of contests in strength and swiftness of foot;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> as also, because of the convenience of the locality, which furnishes commercial advantages of all kinds by its two opposite seas, and by which it had obtained the character of a rendezvous for all the population of Asia and Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But on this occasion, all were led thither not only for their ordinary purposes, but by an eager curiosity to learn what was thenceforward to be the state of Greece, and what their own condition; while many at the same time not only formed opinions within themselves, <pb id="p.1473" n="1473"/>but uttered their conjectures in conversation. Scarcely any supposed that the Romans, victorious as they were, would withdraw from the whole of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They took their seats, as spectators; and a herald, preceded by a trumpeter, according to custom, advanced into the centre of the theatre, where notice of the commencement of the games is usually made, in a solemn form of words.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Silence being commanded by sound of trumpet, he uttered aloud the following proclamation: THE SENATE AND PEOPLE OF ROME, AND TITUS QUINCTIUS, THEIR GENERAL, HAVING SUBDUED KING PHILIP AND THE MACEDONIANS, DO HEREBY ORDER, THAT THE FOLLOWING STATES BE FREE, INDEPENDENT, AND RULED BY THEIR OWN LAWS: THE CORINTHIANS, PHOCIANS, AND ALL THE LOCRIANS; THE IS- LAND OF EUB&OElig;A, AND THE MAGNESIANS; THE THESSALIANS, PERRHAeBIANS,

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> AND THE ACHAeANS OF PHTHIOTIS. He then read a list of all the states which had been under subjection to king Philip. The joy occasioned by hearing these words of the herald was so great, that the people's minds were unable to conceive the matter at once.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Scarcely could they believe that they had heard them; and they looked at each other, marvelling as at the empty illusion of a dream. Each inquired of his neighbours about what immediately concerned himself, altogether distrusting the evidence of his own ears.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As every one desired not only to hear, but to see the messenger of liberty, the herald was called out again; and he again repeated the proclamation.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they were thus assured of the reality of the joyful tidings, they raised such a shout, and clapping of hands, and repeated them so often, as clearly to show that of all blessings none is more grateful to the multitude than liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The games were then proceeded through with hurry; for neither the thoughts nor eyes of any attended to the exhibitions, so entirely had the single passion of joy pre-occupied their minds, as to exclude the sense of all other pleasures.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But, when the games were finished, every one eagerly pressed towards the Roman general;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> so that by the crowd rushing to one spot, all wishing to come near him, and to touch his right hand, and throwing garlands and ribands, he was in some degree of danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was then about thirty-three years of age; and besides the vigour of youth, the grateful sensations excited by so eminent a harvest of glory, increased <pb id="p.1474" n="1474"/>his strength.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor was the general exultation exhausted in the presence of all the assembly, but, through the space of many days, was continually revived by sentiments and expressions of gratitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>There was a nation in the world,</quote> they said, <quote>which, at its own expense, with its own labour, and at its own risk, waged wars for the liberty of others.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And this was performed, not merely for contiguous states, or near neighbours, or for countries that made parts of the same continent; but they even crossed the seas for the purpose, that no unlawful power should subsist on the face of the whole earth;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but that justice, right, and law should every where have sovereign sway. By one sentence, pronounced by a herald, all the cities of Greece and Asia had been set at liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To have conceived hopes of this, argued a daring spirit; to have carried it into effect, was a proof of the most consummate bravery and good fortune.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius and the ten ambassadors then gave audience to the embassies of the several kings, nations, and states.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First of all, the ambassadors of king Antiochus were called. Their proceedings, here, were nearly the same as at Rome; a mere display of words unsupported by facts.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the answer given them was not ambiguous as formerly, during the uncertainty of affairs, and while Philip was unsubdued; for the king was required in express terms to evacuate the cities of Asia, which had been in possession either of Philip or Ptolemy; not to meddle with the free cities, or ever take arms against them, and to be in a state of peace and equality with all the cities of Greece wherever they might be.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Above all it was insisted on, that he should neither come himself into Europe, nor transport an army thither.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The king's ambassadors being dismissed, a general convention of the nations and states was immediately held; and the business was despatched with the greater expedition, because the resolutions of the ten ambassadors mentioned the several states by name.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To the people of Orestis, a district of Macedonia, in consideration of their having been the first who came over from the side of the king, their own laws were granted.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Magnesians, Perrhaebians, and Dolopians were likewise declared free. To the nation of the Thessalians, besides the enjoyment of liberty, the Achaean part of Phthiotis was granted, excepting Phthiotian Thebes and Pharsalus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Aetolians, demanding that Pharsalus and <pb id="p.1475" n="1475"/>Leucas should be restored to them in conformity to the treaty, were referred to the senate: but the council united to these, by authority of a decree, Phocis and Locris,

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> places which had formerly been annexed to them. Corinth, Triphylia, and Heraea, another city of Peloponnesus, were restored to the Achaeans.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The ten ambassadors were inclined to give Oreum and Eretria to king Eumenes, son of Attalus; but Quinctius dissenting, the matter came under the determination of the senate, and the senate declared those cities free; adding to them Carystus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lycus and Parthinia, Illyrian states, each of which had been under subjection to Philip, were given to Pleuratus. Amynander was ordered to retain possession of the forts, which he had taken from Philip during the war.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the convention broke up, the ten ambassadors, dividing the business among them, set out by different routes to give liberty to the several cities within their respective districts.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Lentulus went to Bargylii; Lucius Stertinius, to Hephaestia, Thasus, and the cities of Thrace; Publius Villius and Lucius Terentius to king Antiochus; and Cneius Cornelius to Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The last of these, after executing his commission with respect to smaller matters, asked Philip, whether he was disposed to listen to advice, not only useful but highly salutary.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To which the king answered that he was, and would give him thanks besides, if he mentioned any thing conducive to his advantage.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then earnestly recommended to him, since he had obtained peace with the Romans, to send ambassadors to Rome to solicit their alliance and friendship;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> lest, in case of Antiochus pursuing any hostile measure, he might be suspected of having lain in wait and seized the opportunity of the times for reviving hostilities. This meeting with Philip was at Temp&egrave; in Thessaly;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and on his answering that he would send ambassadors without delay, Cornelius proceeded to Thermopylae, where all the states of Greece are accustomed to meet in general assembly on certain stated days.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This is called the Pylaic assembly. Here he admonished the Aetolians, in particular, constantly and firmly to cultivate the friendship of the Roman people;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but some of the principal of these interrupted him with complaints, that the disposition of the

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Romans towards their nation was not the same since the victory, that it had been during the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> while others censured them with greater <pb id="p.1476" n="1476"/>boldness, and in a reproachful manner asserted, that <quote>without the aid of the Aetolians, the Romans could neither have conquered Philip, nor even have made good their passage into Greece.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To such discourses the Roman forbore giving an answer, lest the matter might end in an altercation, and only said, that if they sent ambassadors to Rome, every thing that was reasonable would be granted to them. Accordingly, they passed a decree for such mission, agreeably to his direction. &mdash; In this manner was the war with Philip concluded.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these transactions passed in Greece, Macedonia, and Asia, a conspiracy among the slaves had well nigh made Etruria an hostile province.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To examine into and suppress this, Manius Acilius the praetor, whose province was the administration of justice between natives and foreigners, was sent at the head of one of the two city legions. A number of them, who were by this time formed in a body, he reduced by force of arms, killing and taking many.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some, who had been the ringleaders of the conspiracy, he scourged with rods, and then crucified; some he returned to their masters.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls repaired to their provinces. Just as Marcellus entered the frontiers of the Boians, and while his men were fatigued with marching the whole length of the day, and as he was pitching his camp on a rising ground, Corolam, a chieftain of the Boians, attacked him with a very numerous force, and slew three thousand of his men:

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> several persons of distinction fell in that tumultuary engagement; amongst others, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Marcus Junius Silanus, praefects of the allies; and Aulus Ogulnius and Publius Claudius, military tribunes in the second legion.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans, notwithstanding, had courage enough to finish the fortification of their camp, and to defend it, in spite of an assault made on it by the enemy, elated by their success in the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcellus remained for some time in the same post, until he could tend the wounded, and revive the spirits of his men, after such a disheartening blow.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Boians, a nation remarkably impatient of delay, and quickly disgusted at a state of inaction, separated, and withdrew to their several forts and villages.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcellus then, suddenly crossing the Po, led his lesions into the territory of Comum, where the Insubrians, after rousing the people of the country to arms, lay encamped. The fierce Boian Gauls attacked him on his march, and their <pb id="p.1477" n="1477"/>first onset was so vigorous, as to make a considerable impression on his van.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On perceiving which, and fearing lest, if his men once gave way, they would be dislodged, he brought up a cohort of Marsians against the enemy, and ordered every troop of the Latin cavalry to charge them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The first and second charges of these having checked the enemy in their furious attack, the other troops in the Roman line, resuming courage, advanced briskly on the foe. The Gauls no longer maintained the contest, but turned their backs and fled in confusion.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Valerius Antias relates, that in that battle above forty thousand men were killed,

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> five hundred and seven military standards taken, with four hundred and thirty-two chariots, and a great number of gold chains, one of which, of great weight, Claudius says, was deposited as an offering to Jupiter, in his temple in the Capitol. The camp of the Gauls was taken and plundered the same day; and the town of Comum was reduced in a few days after.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> In a little time, twenty-eight forts came over to the consul. There is a doubt among writers, whether the consul led his legions first against the Boians, or against the Insubrians;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> so as to determine, whether the successful battle obliterated the disgrace of the defeat, or whether the victory obtained at Comum was tarnished by the disaster incurred among the Boii.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Soon after those matters had passed with such variety of fortune, Lucius Furius Purpureo, the other consul, came into the country of the Boians, through the Sappinian tribe.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He proceeded almost to the fort of Mutilus, when, beginning to apprehend that he might be enclosed between the Boians and Ligurians, he marched back by the road by which he came; and, making a long circuit, through an open and therefore safe country, arrived at the camp of his colleague.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After this junction of their forces, they overran the territory of the Boians, spreading devastation as far as the city of Felsina.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This city, with the other fortresses, and almost all the Boians, excepting only the young men who kept arms in their hands for the sake of plunder, and had at that time withdrawn into remote woods, made submission. The army was then led away against the Ligurians.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Boians thought that the Romans, as they were supposed to be at a great distance, would be the more careless in keeping their army together, and thereby afford an opportunity of attacking them un- <pb id="p.1478" n="1478"/>awares: with this expectation, they followed them by secret paths through the forests.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They did not overtake them: and therefore, passing the Po suddenly in ships, they ravaged all the country of the Laevans and Libuans; whence, as they were returning with the spoil of the country, they fell in with the Roman army on the borders of Liguria.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A battle was begun with more speed, and with greater fury, than if the parties had met with their minds prepared, and at an appointed time and place.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On this occasion it appeared to what degree of violence anger can stimulate men; for the Romans fought with such a desire of slaughter, rather than of victory, that they scarcely left one of the enemy to carry the news of their defeat.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On account of these successes, when the letters of the consuls were brought to Rome, a supplication for three days was decreed. Soon after, Marcellus came to Rome, and had a triumph decreed him by an unanimous vote of the senate. He triumphed, while in office, over the Insubrians and Comans.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The prospect of a triumph over the Boians he left to his colleague, because his own arms had been unfortunate in that country; those of his colleague, successful.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Large quantities of spoils, taken from the enemy, were carried in the procession in captured chariots, and many military standards; also, three hundred and twenty thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of brass,<note>1033<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 8<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> two hundred and thirty-four thousand of silver denarii,<note>2331<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> stamped with a chariot.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Eighty <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>5<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 2 1/4 <hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> were bestowed on each foot soldier, and thrice that value on each horseman and centurion.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During that year, king Antiochus, after having spent the winter at Ephesus, took measures for reducing, under his dominion, all the cities of Asia, which had formerly been members of the empire.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As to the rest, being either situated in plains, or having neither walls, arms, nor men in whom they could confide, he supposed they would, without difficulty, receive the yoke.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But Smyrna and Lampsacus openly asserted their independence: yet there was a danger that if what they claimed were conceded to these, the rest of the cities in Aetolia and Ionia would follow the example of Smyrna; and those on the Hellespont that of Lampsacus.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherefore he sent an army from Ephesus to invest Smyrna; and ordered the troops, which were at Abydos, to leave there only a small <pb id="p.1479" n="1479"/>garrison, and to go and lay siege to Lampsacus. Nor did he only alarm them by an exhibition of force.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By sending ambassadors, to make gentle remonstrances, and reprove the rashness and obstinacy of their conduct, he endeavoured to give them hopes that they might soon obtain the object of their wishes;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but not until it should appear clearly, both to themselves and to all the world, that they had gained their liberty through the kindness of the king, and not by any violent efforts of their own.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In answer to which, they said, that <quote>Antiochus ought neither to be surprised nor displeased, if they did not very patiently suffer the establishment of their liberty to be deferred to a distant period.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He himself, with his fleet, set sail from Ephesus in the beginning of spring, and steered towards the Hellespont. His army he transported to Madytus, a city in the Chersonese, and there joined his land and sea forces together.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The inhabitants having shut their gates, he surrounded the walls with his troops; and when he was just bringing up his machines to the walls, a capitulation was entered into. This diffused such fear through the inhabitants of Sestus and the other cities of the Chersonese, as induced them to submit.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then came, with the whole of his united forces, by land and sea, to Lysimachia; which finding deserted, and almost buried in ruins, (for the Thracians had, a few years before, taken, sacked, and burned it,) he conceived a wish to rebuild a city so celebrated, and so commodiously situated.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly, extending his care to every object at once, he set about repairing the walls and

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> houses, ransomed some of the Lysimachians who were in captivity, sought out and brought home others, who had fled and dispersed themselves through the Chersonese and Hellespontus, enrolled new colonists, whom he invited by prospects of advantages, and used every means to repeople it fully.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At the same time, that all fear of the Thracians might be removed, he went, in person, with one half of the land forces, to lay waste the nearest provinces of Thrace;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> leaving the other half, and all the crews of the ships, employed in the repairs of the city.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time Lucius Cornelius, who had been commissioned by the senate to accommodate the differences between the kings Antiochus and Ptolemy, stopped at Selymbria; and, of the ten ambassadors, Publius Lentulus from <pb id="p.1480" n="1480"/>Bargylii, and Publius Villius and Lucius Terentius from Thasus, came to Lysimachia.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hither came, likewise, Lucius Cornelius from Selymbria, and a few days after Antiochus from Thrace.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His first meeting with the ambassadors, and an invitation which he afterwards gave them, were friendly and hospitable; but when the business intrusted to them, and the present state of Asia, came to be treated of, the minds of both parties were exasperated.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans did not scruple to declare, that every one of his proceedings, from the time when he set sail from Syria, was displeasing to the senate; and they required restitution to be made, to Ptolemy, of all the cities which had been under his dominion.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>For, as to what related to the cities which had been in the possession of Philip, and which Antiochus, taking advantage of

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> a season when Philip's attention was turned to the war with Rome, had seized into his own hands, it would surely be an intolerable hardship, if the Romans were to have undergone such toils and dangers, on land and sea, for so many years, and Antiochus to appropriate to himself the prizes of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, though his coming into Asia might be passed over unnoticed by the Romans, as a matter not pertaining to them, yet when he proceeded so far as to pass over into Europe with all his land and naval forces, how much was this short of open war with the Romans? Doubtless, had he even passed into Italy, he would deny that intention. But the Romans would not wait to give him an opportunity of doing so.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this the king replied, that <quote>he wondered how it was, that the Romans were in the habit of diligently inquiring what ought to be done by king Antiochus; but never considered how far they themselves ought to advance on land or sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Asia was no concernment of the Romans, in any shape; nor had they any more right to inquire what Antiochus did in Asia, than Antiochus had to inquire what the Roman people did in Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With respect to Ptolemy, from whom they complained that cities had been taken, there was a friendly connexion subsisting between him and Ptolemy, and he was taking measures to effect speedily a connexion of affinity also;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> neither had he sought to acquire any spoils from the misfortunes of Philip, nor had he come into Europe <pb id="p.1481" n="1481"/>against the Romans, <hi rend="italics">but to recover the cities and lands of the Chersonese, which, having been the property of Lysimachus,</hi><note>Here is a chasm in the original, which is supplied from Polybius.</note> he considered as part of his own dominion; because, when Lysimachus was subdued, all things belonging to him became, by the right of conquest, the property of Seleucus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That, at times, when his predecessors were occupied by cares of different kinds, Ptolemy first, and afterwards Philip, usurping the rights of others, possessed themselves of several of these places, but who could doubt that the Chersonese and the nearest parts of Thrace belonged to Lysimachus?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To restore these to their ancient state, was the intent of his coming, and to build Lysimachia anew, (it having been destroyed by an inroad of the Thracians,) in order that his son, Seleucus, might have it for the seat of his empire.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These disputes had been carried on for several days, when a rumour reached them, but without any sufficiently certain authority, that Ptolemy was dead;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> which prevented the conferences coming to any issue: for both parties made a secret of their having heard it; and Lucius Cornelius, who was charged with the embassy to the two kings, Antiochus and Ptolemy, requested to be allowed a short space of time, in which he could have a meeting with the latter;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> because he wished to arrive in Egypt before any change of measures should take place in consequence of the new succession to the crown: while Antiochus believed that Egypt would be his own, if at that time he should take possession of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherefore, having dismissed the Romans, and left his son Seleucus, with the land forces, to finish the rebuilding of Lysimachia, as he had intended to do, he sailed, with his whole fleet, to Ephesus;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> sent ambassadors to Quinctius to treat with him about an alliance, assuring him that the king would attempt no innovations, and then, coasting along the shore of Asia, proceeded to Lycia.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having learned at Patarae that Ptolemy was living, he dropped the design of sailing to Egypt, but nevertheless steered towards Cyprus; and, when he had passed the promontory of Chelidonium, was detained some little time in Pamphylia, near the river Eurymedon, by a mutiny among his rowers.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he had sailed thence as far as the headlands, as they are called, of Sarus, such a dreadful storm arose as almost buried him and his whole fleet in the deep. Many <pb id="p.1482" n="1482"/>ships were broken to pieces, and many cast on shore; many swallowed so entirely in the sea, that not one man of their crews escaped to land.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Great numbers of his men perished on this occasion; not only persons of mean rank, rowers and soldiers, but even of his particular friends in high stations.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he had collected the relics of the general wreck, being in no capacity of making an attempt on Cyprus, he returned to Seleucia, with a far less numerous force than he had set out with. Here he ordered the ships to be hauled ashore, for the winter was now at hand, and proceeded to Antioch, where he intended to pass the winter. &mdash;In this posture stood the affairs of the kings.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome, in this year, for the first time, were created offices called <hi rend="italics">triumviri epulones;</hi> <note>It was their office to regulate the feasts of the gods.</note>these were Caius Licinius Lucullus, who, as tribune, had proposed the law for their creation, Publius Manlius, and Publius Porcius Laeca. These triumvirs, as well as the pontiffs, were allowed by law the privilege of wearing the purple-bordered gown.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The body of the pontiffs had this year a warm dispute with the city quaestors, Quintus Fabius Labeo and Lucius Aurelius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Money was wanted; an order having been passed for making the last payment to private persons of that which had been raised for the support of the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and the quaestors demanded it from the augurs and pontiffs, because they had not contributed their share while the war subsisted. The priests in vain appealed to the tribunes; and the contribution was exacted for every year in which they had not paid.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the same year two pontiffs died, and others were substituted in their room: Marcus Marcellus, the consul, in the room of Caius Sempronius Tuditanus, who had been a praetor in Spain; and Lucius Valerius, in the room of Marcus Cornelius Cethegus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> An augur also, Quintius Fabius Maximus, died very young, before he had attained to any public office; but no augur was appointed in his place during that year.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consular election was then held by the consul Marcellus. The persons chosen were, Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius Cato. Then were elected praetors, Caius Fabricius Luscinus, Caius Atinius Labeo, Cneius Manlius Vulso, Appius Claudius Nero, Publius Manlius, and Publius Porcius Laeca. The curule aediles, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and Caius Flaminius, made a distribution <pb id="p.1483" n="1483"/>to the people of one million pecks of wheat, at the price of two <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This corn the Sicilians had brought to Rome, out of respect to Caius Flaminius and his father; and he gave share of the credit to his colleague. The Roman games were solemnized with magnificence, and exhibited thrice entire.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The plebeian aediles, Cneius Domitius Aenobarbus and Caius Scribonius, chief curio, brought many farmers of the public pastures to trial before the people. Three of these were convicted; and out of the money accruing from fines imposed on them, they built a temple of Faunus in the island.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The plebeian games were exhibited for two days, and there was a

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> feast on occasion of the games.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius, on the ides of March, the day of their entering into office, consulted the senate respecting the provinces;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> who resolved, that <quote>whereas the war in Spain was grown so formidable, as to require a consular army and commander; it was their opinion, therefore, that the consuls should either settle between themselves, or cast lots, for Hither Spain and Italy as their provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That he to whom Spain fell should carry with him two legions, five thousand of the Latin confederates, and five hundred horse; together with a fleet of twenty ships of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That the other consul should raise two legions; for these would be sufficient to maintain tranquillity in the province of Gaul, as the spirits of the Insubrians and Boians had been broken the year before.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The lots gave Spain to Cato, and Italy to Valerius. The praetors then cast lots for their provinces: to Caius Fabricius Luscinus fell the city jurisdiction; Caius Atinius Labeo obtained the foreign; Cneius Manlius Vulso, Sicily; Appius Claudius Nero, Farther Spain; Publius Porcius Laeca, Pisa, in order that he might be at the back of the Ligurians; and Publius Manlius was sent into Hither Spain, as an assistant to the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius was continued in command for the year, as apprehensions were entertained, not only of Antiochus and the Aetolians, but likewise of Nabis, tyrant of Lacedaemon; and it was ordered that he should have two legions, for which, if there was any necessity for a further supply, the consuls were ordered to raise recruits, and send them into Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Appius Claudius was permitted to raise, in addition to the legion which Quintius Fabius had commanded, two thousand foot and two hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The <pb id="p.1484" n="1484"/>like number of new-raised foot and horse was assigned to Publius Manlius for Hither Spain; and the legion was given to him which had been under the command of Minucius, the praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To Publius Porcius Laeca, for Etruria, near Pisa, were decreed two thousand foot and five hundred horse, out of the army in Gaul. Sempronius Longus was continued in command in Sardinia.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The provinces being thus distributed, the consuls, before their departure from the city, were ordered, in accordance with a decree of the pontiffs, to proclaim a

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> sacred spring, which Aulus Cornelius Mammula, praetor, had vowed in pursuance of a vote of the senate, and an order of the people, in the consulate of Cneius Servilius and Caius Flaminius. It was celebrated twenty-one years after the vow had been made.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the same time, Caius Claudius Pulcher, son of Appius, was chosen and inaugurated into the office of augur, in the room of Quintus Fabius Maximus, who died the year before.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While people, in general, wondered that, though Spain had arisen in arms, they were neglecting the war, a letter was brought from Quintus Minucius, announcing that he had fought a pitched battle with the Spanish generals, Budar and Besasis, near the town of Tura, and had gained the victory: that twelve thousand of the enemy were slain; their general, Budar, taken; and the rest routed and dispersed." After the reading of this letter less alarm prevailed with respect to Spain, where a very formidable war had been apprehended.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The whole anxiety of the public was directed towards king Antiochus, especially after the arrival of the ten ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These, after relating the proceedings with Philip, and the conditions on which peace had been granted him, gave information, that <quote>there still subsisted a war of no less magnitude to be waged with Antiochus; that he had come over into Europe with a very numerous fleet and a powerful army; that, had not a delusive prospect of an opportunity of invading Egypt, raised by a more delusive rumour, diverted him to another quarter, all Greece would have quickly been involved in the flames of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor would even the Aetolians remain quiet, a race as well restless by nature as full of anger against the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That, besides, there was another evil, of a most dangerous nature, lurking in the bowels of Greece: Nabis, tyrant at present of Lacedaemon, but who would soon, <pb id="p.1485" n="1485"/>if suffered, become tyrant of all Greece, equalling in avarice and cruelty all the tyrants most remarkable in history.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For, if he were allowed to keep possession of Argos, which served as a citadel commanding the Peloponnesus, when the Roman armies should be brought home to Italy, Greece would have been in vain delivered out of bondage to Philip; because, instead of that king, who, supposing no other difference, resided at a distance, she would have for a master, a tyrant, close to her side.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On this intelligence being received from men of such respectable authority, and who had, besides, examined into all the matters which were reported, the senate, although

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> they deemed the business relating to Antiochus the more important, yet, as the king had, for some reason or other, gone home into Syria, they thought that the affair respecting the tyrant ought to be more promptly attended to.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After debating, for a long time, whether they should judge the grounds which they had at present sufficient whereon a declaration of war should be decreed, or whether they should empower Titus Quinctius to act, in the case respecting Nabis the Lacedaemonian, in such manner as he should judge conducive to the public interest; they left it in his hands.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For they thought the business of such a nature, that whether expedited or delayed, it could not very materially affect the general interest of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was deemed more important to endeavour to discover what line of conduct Hannibal and the Carthaginians would pursue, in case of a war breaking out with Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Persons of the faction which opposed Hannibal wrote continually to their several friends, among the principal men in Rome, that <quote>messages and letters were sent by Hannibal to Antiochus, and that envoys came secretly from the king to him. That, as some wild beasts can never be tamed, so the disposition of this man was irreclaimable and implacable.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That he sometimes complained, that the state was debilitated by ease and indolence, and lulled by sloth into a lethargy, from which nothing could rouse it but the sound of arms.</quote> These accounts were deemed probable, when people recollected the former war, which had not more been carried on than at first set on foot by the efforts of that single man.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Besides, he had by a recent act provoked the resentment of many men in power. <pb id="p.1486" n="1486"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The order of judges possessed, at that time, absolute power in Carthage; and this was owing chiefly to their holding the office during life.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The property, character, and life of every man was in their disposal. He who incurred the displeasure of one of that order, found an enemy in every one of them; nor were accusers wanting in a court where the justices were disposed to condemn.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While they were in possession of this despotism, (for they did not exercise their exorbitant power constitutionally,) Hannibal was elected praetor; and he summoned the quaestor before him.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The quaestor disregarded the summons, for he was of the opposite faction; and besides, as the practice was that, after the quaestorship men were advanced into the order of judges, the most powerful of all, he already assumed a spirit suited to the powers which he was shortly to possess.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hannibal, highly offended hereat, sent an officer to apprehend the quaestor; and, bringing him forth into an assembly of the people, he made heavy charges not against him alone, but on the whole order of judges; in consequence of whose arrogance and power, neither the magistracy nor the laws availed any thing.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, perceiving that his discourse was with willing ears attended to, and that the conduct of those men was incompatible with the freedom of the lowest classes, he proposed a law, and procured it to be enacted, that the <quote>judges should be elected annually; and that no person should hold the office two years successively.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, whatever degree of favour he acquired among the commons by this proceeding, he roused, in a great part of the nobility, an equal degree of resentment.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this he added another act, which, while it was for the advantage of the people, provoked personal enmity against himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The public revenues were partly wasted through neglect, partly embezzled, and divided among some leading men and magistrates; insomuch, that there was not money sufficient for the regular annual payment of the tribute to the Romans, so that private persons seemed to be threatened with a heavy tax.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Hannibal had informed himself of the amount of the revenues arising from taxes and port duties, for what purposes they were issued from the treasury, what proportion of them was consumed by the ordinary expenses of the state, and how much was alienated by embezzlement;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he asserted <pb id="p.1487" n="1487"/>in an assembly of the people, that if payment were enforced of the residuary funds, the taxes might be remitted to the subjects; and that the state would still be rich enough to pay the tribute to the Romans: which assertion he proved to be true.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But now those persons who, for several years past, had maintained themselves by plundering the public, were greatly enraged; as if this were ravishing from them their own property, and not as dragging out of their hands their ill-gotten spoil. Accordingly, they instigated the Romans against Hannibal, who were seeking a pretext for indulging their hatred against him.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A strenuous opposition was, however, for a long time made to this by Scipio Africanus, who thought it highly unbecoming the dignity of the Roman people to make themselves a party in the animosities and charges against Hannibal;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> to interpose the public authority among factions of the Carthaginians, not deeming it sufficient to have conquered that commander in the field, but to become as it were his prosecutors<note><hi rend="italics">Subscribere actioni</hi> is to join the prosecutor as an assistant; and

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the prosecutors were obliged <hi rend="italics">calumniam jurare,</hi> to swear that they did not carry on the prosecution through malice, or a vexatious design. Scipio, therefore, means to reprobate the interference of the Roman state, which would bring it into the situation of a common prosecutor in a court of

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> justice.</note> in a judicial process, and preferring an action against him. Yet at length the point was carried, that an embassy should be sent to Carthage to represent to the senate there, that Hannibal, in concert with king Antiochus, was forming plans for kindling a war. Three

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> ambassadors were sent, Caius Servilius, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and Quintus Terentius Culleo. These, when they had arrived at Carthage, by the advice of Hannibal's enemies, ordered, that any who inquired the cause of

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> their coming should be told, that they came to determine the disputes subsisting between the Carthaginians and Masinissa, king of Numidia; and this was generally believed. But Hannibal was not ignorant that he was the sole object aimed at by the Romans; and that, though they had granted peace to the Carthaginians, their war against him, individually, remained irreconcilable. He

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> therefore determined to give way to fortune and the times; and having already made every preparation for flight, he showed himself that day in the forum, in order to guard against suspicion; and, as soon as it grew dark, went in his common dress <pb id="p.1488" n="1488"/>to one of the gates, with his two attendants, who knew nothing of his intention.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Finding horses in readiness at a spot where he had ordered, he traversed by night a district which the Africans denominated Byzacium, and arrived, in the morning of the following day, at a castle of his own between Acholla and Thapsus. There a ship, ready fitted out and furnished with rowers, took him on board.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In this manner did Hannibal leave Africa, lamenting the misfortunes of his country oftener than his own.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He sailed over, the same day, to the island of Cercina, where he found in the port a number of merchant ships, belonging to the Ph&oelig;nicians, with their cargoes; and on landing was surrounded by a concourse of people, who came to pay their respects to him; on which he gave orders, that, in answer to any inquiries, it should be said that he had been sent as ambassador to Tyre.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Fearing, however, lest some of these ships might sail in the night to Thapsus or Adrumetum, and carry information of his having been seen at Cercina, he ordered a sacrifice to be prepared, and the masters of the ships, with the merchants, to be invited to the entertainment, and that the sails and yards should be collected out of the ships to form a shade on shore

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> for the company at supper, as it happened to be the middle of summer.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The feast of the day was as sumptuous, and well attended, as the time and circumstances allowed; and the entertainment was prolonged, with plenty of wine, until late in the night.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As soon as Hannibal saw an opportunity of escaping the notice of those who were in the harbour, he set sail.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The rest were fast asleep, nor was it early, next day, when they arose from their sleep, full of the illness of intoxication; and then, when it was too late, they set about replacing the sails in the ships, and fitting up the rigging, which employed several hours.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At Carthage, those who were accustomed to visit Hannibal met in a crowd, at the porch of his house; and when it was publicly known that he was not to be found, the whole multitude assembled in

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the forum, eager to gain intelligence of the man who was considered as the first in the state.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Some surmised that he had fled, as the case was; others, that he had been put to death through the treachery of the Romans; and there was visible in the expression of their countenances, that variety which might naturally be expected in a state divided <pb id="p.1489" n="1489"/>into factions, whereof each supported a different interest. At length intelligence was brought, that he had been seen at Cercina.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman ambassadors represented to the council, that <quote>proof had been laid before the senate at Rome, that formerly king Philip had been moved, principally by the instigation of Hannibal, to make war on the Roman people;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that lately, Hannibal had, besides, sent letters and messages to king Antiochus, that he had entered into plans for driving Carthage to revolt, and that he had now gone no whither but to king Antiochus. That he was a man who would never be content, until he had excited war in every part of the globe.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That such conduct ought not to be suffered to pass with impunity, if the Carthaginians wished to convince the Roman people that none of those things were done with their consent, or with the approbation of the state.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Carthaginians answered, that they were ready to do whatever the Romans required them.</p> 

<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Hannibal, after a prosperous voyage, arrived at Tyre; where, as a man illustrated by every description of honours, he was received by those founders of Carthage, as if in a se- cond native country, and here he staid a few days.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then sailed to Antioch; where, hearing that the king had already left the place, he procured an interview with his son, who was celebrating the solemnity of the games at Daphne, and who treated him with much kindness; after which, he set sail without delay.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At Ephesus, he overtook the king, who was still hesitating in his mind, and undetermined respecting a war with Rome: but the arrival of Hannibal proved an incentive of no small efficacy to the prosecution of that design.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the same time, the inclinations of the Aetolians also were alienated from the Roman alliance in consequence of the senate having referred to Quinctius their ambassadors, who demanded Pharsalus and Leucas, and some other cities, in conformity with the first treaty.</p></div1> <pb id="p.1490" n="1490"/><div1 type="book" n="34"><head>BOOK XXXIV.</head>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AMID the serious concerns of important wars, either scarcely brought to a close or impending, an incident intervened, trivial indeed to be mentioned, but which, through the zeal of the parties concerned, issued in a violent contest.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius, plebeian tribunes, proposed to the people the repealing of the Oppian law.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This law, which had been introduced by Caius Oppias, plebeian tribune, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius, during the heat of the Punic war, enacted that <quote>no woman should possess more than half an ounce of gold, or wear a garment of various colours, or ride in a carriage drawn by horses, in a city, or any town, or any place nearer thereto than one mile; except on occasion of some public religious solemnity.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcus and Publius Junius Brutus, plebeian tribunes, supported the Oppian law, and declared, that they would never suffer it to be repealed; while many of the nobility stood forth to argue for and against the motion proposed.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Capitol was filled with crowds, who favoured or opposed the law; nor could the matrons be kept at home, either by advice or shame, nor even by the commands of their husbands; but beset every street and pass in the city, beseeching the men as they went down to the forum, that in the present flourishing state of the commonwealth, when the private fortune of all was daily in- <pb id="p.1491" n="1491"/>creasing, they would suffer the women to have their former ornaments of dress restored.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This throng of women increased daily, for they arrived even from the country towns and villages; and they had at length the boldness to come up to the consuls, praetors, and magistrates, to urge their request.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> One of the consuls, however, they found especially inexorable &mdash; Marcus Porcius Cato, who, in support of the law proposed to be repealed, spoke to this effect: &mdash;</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"If, Romans, every individual among us had made it a rule to maintain the prerogative and authority of a husband with respect to his own wife, we should have less trouble with the whole sex.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But now, our privileges, overpowered at home by female contumacy, are, even here in the forum, spurned and trodden under foot; and because we are unable to withstand each separately, we now dread their collective body.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I was accustomed to think it a fabulous and fictitious tale, that, in a certain island, the whole race of males was utterly extirpated by a conspiracy of the women.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the utmost danger may be apprehended equally from either sex, if you suffer cabals, assemblies, and secret consultations to be held: scarcely, indeed, can I determine, in my own mind, whether the act itself, or the precedent that it affords, is of more pernicious tendency. The latter of these more particularly concerns us consuls, and the other magistrates: the former, yourselves, my fellow-citizens.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For, whether the measure proposed to your consideration be profitable to the state or not, is to be determined by you, who are about to go to the vote. As to the outrageous behaviour of these women, whether it be merely an act of their own, or owing to your instigations, Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius, it unquestionably implies culpable conduct in magistrates.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I know not whether it reflects greater disgrace on you, tribunes, or on the consuls: on you certainly, if you have, on the present occasion, brought these women hither for the purpose of raising tribunitian seditions;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> on us, if we suffer laws to be imposed on us by a secession of women, as was done formerly by that of the common people. It was not without painful emotions of shame, that I, just now, made my way into the forum through the midst of a band of women.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Had I not been restrained by respect for the modesty and dignity of some individuals among them, rather than of the whole number, and been unwilling that they should be <pb id="p.1492" n="1492"/>seen rebuked by a consul, I should have said to them, 'What sort of practice is this, of running out into public, besetting the streets, and addressing other women's husbands?

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Could not each have made the same request to her husband at home? Are your blandishments more seducing in public than in private; and with other women's husbands, than with your own?

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Although if the modesty of matrons confined them within the limits of their own rights, it did not become you, even at home, to concern yourselves about what laws might be passed or repealed here.' Our ancestors thought it not proper that women should perform any, even private business, without a director; but that they should be ever under the control of parents, brothers, or husbands.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> We, it seems, suffer them, now, to interfere in the management of state affairs, and to introduce themselves into the forum, into general assemblies, and into assemblies of election. For, what are they doing, at this moment, in your streets and lanes? What, but arguing, some in support of the motion of the plebeian tribunes; others, for the repeal of the law?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Will you give the reins to their intractable nature, and their uncontrolled passions, and then expect that themselves should set bounds to their licentiousness, when you have failed to do so?

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This is the smallest of the injunctions laid on them by usage or the laws, all which women bear with impatience:

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> they long for liberty; or rather, to speak the truth, for unbounded freedom in every particular. For what will they not attempt, if they now come off victorious?</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Recollect all the institutions respecting the sex, by which our forefathers restrained their undue freedom, and by which they subjected them to their husbands; and yet, even with the help of all these restrictions, you can scarcely keep them within bounds.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If, then, you suffer them to throw these off one by one, to tear them all asunder, and, at last, to be set on an equal footing with yourselves, can you imagine that they will be any longer tolerable by you?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The moment they have arrived at an equality with you, they will have become your superiors. But, forsooth, they only object to any new law being made against them: they mean to deprecate, not justice, but severity.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nay, their wish is, that a law which you have admitted, established by your suffrages, and confirmed by the practice and experience of so many years to be beneficial, should <pb id="p.1493" n="1493"/>now be repealed; that is, that, by abolishing one law, you should weaken all the rest.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No law perfectly suits the convenience of every member of the community: the only consideration is, whether, upon the whole, it be profitable to the greater part. If, because a law proves obnoxious to a private individual, that circumstance should destroy and sweep it away, to what purpose is it for the community to enact general laws, which those, with reference to whom they were passed, could presently repeal?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I should like, however, to hear what this important affair is which has induced the matrons thus to run out into public in this excited manner, scarcely restraining from pushing into the forum and the assembly of the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Is it to solicit that their parents, their husbands, children, and brothers may be ransomed from captivity under Hannibal? By no means: and far be ever from the commonwealth so unfortunate a situation.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Yet, even when such was the case, you refused this to their prayers. But it is not duty, nor solicitude for their friends; it is religion that has collected them together. They are about to receive the Idaean Mother, coming out of Phrygia from Pessinus! What motive, that even common decency will allow to be mentioned, is pretended for this female insurrection?

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Why, say they, that we may shine in gold and purple; that, both on festal and common days, we may ride through the city in our chariots, triumphing over vanquished and abrogated law, after having captured and wrested from you your suffrages; and that there may be no bounds to our expenses and our luxury.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>Often have you heard me complain of the profuse expenses of the women &mdash;often of those of the men; and that not only of men in private stations, but of the magistrates:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that the state was endangered by two opposite vices, luxury and avarice; those pests, which have been the ruin of all great empires.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These I dread the more, as the circumstances of the commonwealth grow daily more prosperous and happy; as the empire increases; as we have now passed over into Greece and Asia, places abounding with every kind of temptation that can inflame the passions; and as we have begun to handle even royal treasures: so much the more do I fear that these matters will bring us into captivity, rather than we them.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Believe me, those statues from Syracuse were brought into this city with hostile effect. I already <pb id="p.1494" n="1494"/>hear too many commending and admiring the decorations of Athens and Corinth, and ridiculing the earthen images of our Roman gods that stand on the fronts of their temples.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For my part I prefer these gods, &mdash;propitious as they are, and I hope will continue to be, if we allow them to remain in their own mansions.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the memory of our fathers, Pyrrhus, by his ambassador Cineas, made trial of the dispositions, not only of our men, but of our women also, by offers of presents: at that time the Oppian law, for restraining female luxury, had not been made; and yet not one woman accepted a present. What, think you, was the reason?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That for which our ancestors made no provision by law on this subject: there was no luxury existing which needed to be restrained.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As diseases must necessarily be known before their remedies, so passions come into being before the laws which prescribe limits to them. What called forth the Licinian law, restricting estates to five hundred acres, but the unbounded desire for enlarging estates?

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What the Cincian law, concerning gifts and presents, but that the plebeians<note>Previous to the passing of the Cincian law, about ten years before this time, the advocates who pleaded in the courts received fees and presents: and as all or most of these were senators, the plebeians are here represented as tributary to the senate. By the above law they were forbidden to receive either fees or presents.</note> had become

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> vassals and tributaries to the senate? It is not therefore in any degree surprising, that no want of the Oppian law, or of any other, to limit the expenses of the women, was felt at that time, when they refused to receive

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> gold and purple that was thrown in their way, and offered to their acceptance. If Cineas were now to go round the city with his presents, he would find numbers of women standing in the public streets to receive them. There are some passions, the causes or motives

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> of which I can no way account for. For that that should not be lawful for you which is permitted to another, may perhaps naturally excite some degree of shame or indignation; yet, when the dress of all is alike, why should any one of you fear, lest she should not be an object of observation? Of all kinds of shame, the worst, surely, is

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the being ashamed of frugality or of poverty; but the law relieves you with regard to both; since that which you have not it is unlawful for you to possess. This equalization, says the rich matron, is

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> the very thing that I cannot endure. Why do not I make <pb id="p.1495" n="1495"/>a figure, distinguished with gold and purple? Why is the poverty of others concealed under this cover of a law, so that it should be thought that, if the law permitted, they would have such things as they are not now able to procure? Romans, do you wish to excite among your wives an emulation of this sort, that the rich

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> should wish to have what no other can have; and that the poor, lest they should be despised as such, should extend their expenses beyond their means? Be assured, that when a woman once begins to be ashamed of what she ought not to be ashamed

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> of, she will not be ashamed of what she ought. She who can, will purchase out of her own purse; she who cannot, will ask her husband. Unhappy is the husband, both he who complies with the

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> request, and he who does not; for what he will not give himself, he will see given by another. Now, they openly solicit

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> favours from other women's husbands; and, what is more, solicit a law and votes. From some they obtain them; although, with regard to yourself, your property, or your children, they would be inexorable. So soon as the law shall cease to limit the expenses of your wife, you yourself will never be able to do so. Do not suppose that the matter will hereafter be in the same state in which it was before the law was made on the subject. It is safer that a wicked man

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> should even never be accused, than that he should be acquitted; and luxury, if it had never been meddled with, would be more tolerable than it will be, now, like a wild beast, irritated by having been chained, and then let loose. My opinion is, that the Oppian law ought, on no account, to be repealed. Whatever determination you may come to, I pray all the gods to prosper it.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit ="chapter" n="5"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After him the plebeian tribunes, who had declared their intention of protesting, added a few words to the same purport. Then Lucius Valerius spoke thus in support of the measure which he himself had introduced: &mdash;"If private persons only had stood forth to argue for and against the proposition which we have submitted to your consideration, I for my part, thinking enough to have been said on both sides, would have waited in silence for your determination.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But since a person of most respectable judgment, the consul, Marcus Porcius, has reprobated our motion, not only by the influence of his opinion, which, had he said nothing, would carry very great weight, but also in a long and careful discourse, it be- <pb id="p.1496" n="1496"/>comes necessary to say a few words in answer.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He has spent more words in rebuking the matrons, than in arguing against the measure proposed; and even went so far as to mention a doubt, whether the matrons had committed the conduct which he censured in them spontaneously or at our instigation.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I shall defend the measure, not ourselves: for the consul threw out those insinuations against us, rather for argument's sake, than as a serious charge.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He has made use of the terms cabal and sedition; and, sometimes, secession of the women: because the matrons had requested of you, in the public streets, that, in this time of peace, when the commonwealth is flourishing and happy, you would repeal a law that was made against them during a war, and in times of distress.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I know that these and other similar strong expressions, for the purpose of exaggeration, are easily found; and, mild as Marcus Cato is in his disposition, yet in his speeches he is not only vehement, but sometimes even austere. What new thing, let me ask, have the matrons done in coming out into public in a body on an occasion which nearly concerns themselves?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Have they never before appeared in public? I will turn over your own Antiquities,<note>Alluding to a treatise by Cato, upon the antiquities of Italy, entitled <quote>Origines,</quote> which is the word used here by Valerius.</note> and quote

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> them against you. Hear, now, how often they have done the same, and always to the advantage of the public. In the earliest period of our history, even in the reign of Romulus, when the Capitol had been taken by the Sabines, and a pitched battle

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> was fought in the forum, was not the fight stopped by the interposition of the matrons between the two armies? When, after the expulsion of the kings, the legions of the Volscians, under the command of Marcius Coriolanus, were encamped at the fifth stone, did not the matrons turn away that army, which would have overwhelmed this city? Again, when Rome was taken by the Gauls, whence was the city ransomed? Did not the matrons, by unanimous agreement, bring their gold into the public treasury? In the late war, not to go back

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> to remote antiquity, when there was a want of money, did not the funds of the widows supply the treasury? And when even new gods were invited hither to the relief of our distressed affairs, did not the matrons go out in a body to the sea-shore to receive the Idaean Mother? The cases, you will say, are dis- <pb id="p.1497" n="1497"/>similar. It is not

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> my purpose to produce similar instances; it is sufficient that I clear these women of having done any thing new. Now, what nobody wondered at their doing in cases which

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> concerned all in common, both men and women, can we wonder at their doing in a case peculiarly affecting themselves? But what have they done? We have proud ears, truly,

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> if, though masters disdain not the prayers of slaves, we are offended at being asked a favour by honourable women.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"I come now to the question in debate, with respect to which the consul's argument is twofold: for, first, he is displeased at the thought of any law whatever being repealed; and then, particularly, of that law which was made to restrain female luxury.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His former argument, in support of the laws in general, appeared highly becoming of a consul; and that on the latter, against luxury, was quite conformable to the rigid strictness of his morals.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There is, therefore, a danger lest, unless I shall show what, on each subject, was inconclusive, you may probably be led away by error.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For while I acknowledge, that of those laws which are instituted, not for any particular time, but for eternity, on account of their perpetual utility, not one ought to be repealed; unless either experience evince it to be useless, or some state of the public affairs render it so; I see, at the same time, that those laws which particular seasons have required, are mortal, (if I may use the term,) and changeable with the times.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Those made in peace are generally repealed by war; those made in war, by peace; as in the management of a ship, some implements are useful in good weather, others in bad.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As these two kinds are thus distinct in their nature, of which kind does that law appear to be which we now propose to repeal? Is it an ancient law of the kings, coeval with the city itself?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Or, what is next to that, was it written in the twelve tables by the decemvirs, appointed to form a code of laws?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Is it one, without which our ancestors thought that the honour of the female sex could not be preserved? and, therefore, have we also reason to fear, that, together with it, we should repeal the modesty and chastity of our females? Now, is there a man among you who does not know that this is a new law, passed not more than twenty years ago, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius?

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And as, without <pb id="p.1498" n="1498"/>it, our matrons sustained, for such a number of years, the most virtuous characters, what danger is there of their abandoning themselves to luxury on its being repealed? For, if that law had been passed for the purpose of setting a limit to the passions of the sex, there would be reason to fear lest the repeal of it might operate as an incitement to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But the real reason of its being passed, the time itself will show. Hannibal was then in Italy, victorious at Cannae: he already held possession of Tarentum, of Arpi, of Capua, and seemed ready to bring up his army to the city of Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Our allies had deserted us. We had neither soldiers to fill up the legions, nor seamen to man the fleet, nor money in the treasury.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Slaves, who were to be employed as soldiers, were purchased on condition of their price being paid to the owners at the end of the war. The farmers of the revenues had declared, that they would contract to supply corn and other matters, which the exigencies of the war required, to be paid for at the same time.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> We gave up our slaves to the oar, in numbers proportioned to our properties, and paid them out of our own incomes. All our gold and silver, in imitation of the example given by the senators, we dedicated to the use of the public.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Widows and minors lodged their money in the treasury. It was provided by law that we should not keep in our houses more than a certain quantity of wrought gold or silver, or more than a certain sum of coined silver or brass.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At such a time as this, were the matrons so eagerly engaged in luxury and dress, that the Oppian law was requisite to repress such practices; when the senate, because the sacrifice of Ceres had been omitted, in consequence of all the matrons being in mourning, ordered the mourning to end in thirty days? Who does not clearly see, that the poverty and distress of the state, requiring that every private person's money should be converted to the use of the public, enacted that law, with intent that it should remain in force so long only as the cause of enacting the law should remain?

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For if all the decrees of the senate and orders of the people, which were then made to answer the necessities of the times, are to be of perpetual obligation, why do we refund their money to private persons?

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Why do we contract for public works for ready money? Why are not slaves brought to serve in the army?

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Why do not we, private subjects, supply rowers as we did then? <pb id="p.1499" n="1499"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>Shall, then, every other class of people, every indi- vidual, feel the improvement in the condition of the state; and shall our wives alone reap none of the fruits of the public peace and tranquillity?

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Shall we men have the use of purple, wearing the purple-bordered gown in magistracies and priests' offices? Shall our children wear gowns bordered with purple? Shall we allow the privilege of wearing the toga praetexta to the magistrates of the colonies and borough towns, and to the very lowest of them here at Rome, the superintendents of the streets; and not only of wearing such an ornament of distinction while alive, but of being buried with it when dead; and shall we interdict the use of purple to women alone?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And when you, the husband, may wear purple in your great coat, will you not suffer your wife to have a purple mantle? Shall your horse be more splendidly caparisoned than your wife is clothed?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But with respect to purple, which will be worn out and consumed, I can see an unjust, indeed, but still a sort of reason, for parsimony; but with respect to gold, in which, excepting the price of the workmanship, there is no waste, what objection can there be? It rather serves as a reserve fund for both public and private exigencies, as you have already experienced. He says there will be no emulation between individuals, when no one is possessed of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But, in truth, it will be a source of grief and indignation to all, when they see those ornaments allowed to the wives of the Latin confederates of which they themselves have been deprived;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> when they see those riding through the city in their carriages, and decorated with gold and purple, while they are obliged to follow on foot, as if the seat of empire were in the country of the others, not in their own. This would hurt the feelings even of men, and what do you think must be its effect on those of weak women, whom even trifles can disturb?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Neither offices of state, nor of the priesthood, nor triumphs, nor badges of distinction, nor military presents, nor spoils, can fall to their share.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Elegance of appearance, and ornaments, and dress, these are the women's badges of distinction; in these they delight and glory; these our ancestors called the women's world.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What else do they lay aside when in mourning, except their gold and purple? And what else do they resume when the mourning is over?

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> How do they distinguish themselves on occasion of public thanksgivings and <pb id="p.1500" n="1500"/>supplications, but by adding unusual splendour of dress? But then, (it may be said,) if you repeal the Oppian law, should you choose to prohibit any of those particulars which the law at present prohibits, you will not have it in your power;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> your daughters, wives, and even the sisters of some, will be less under control.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The bondage of women is never shaken off without the loss of their friends; and they themselves look with horror on that freedom which is purchased with the condition of the widow or the orphan.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Their wish is, that their dress should be under your regulation, not under that of the law; and it ought to be your wish to hold them in control and guardianship, not in bondage; and to prefer the title of father or husband to that of master.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consul just now made use of some invidious terms, calling it a female sedition and secession; because, I suppose, there is danger of their seizing the sacred mount, as formerly the angry plebeians did; or the Aventine. Their feeble nature must submit to whatever you think proper to enjoin;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and, the greater power you possess, the more moderate ought you to be in the exercise of your authority.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although all these considerations had been urged against the motion and in its favour, the women next day poured out into public in much greater numbers, and in

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> a body beset the doors of the tribunes who had protested against the measure of their colleagues; nor did they retire until this intervention was withdrawn.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was then no further doubt but that every one of the tribes would vote for the repeal of the law. Thus was this law annulled, in the twentieth year after it had been made.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul Marcus Porcius, as soon as the Oppian law was abolished, sailed immediately, with twenty-five ships of war, of which five belonged to the allies, to the port of Luna, where he ordered the troops to assemble;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and having sent an edict along the sea-coast, to collect ships of every description, at his departure from Luna he left orders that they should follow him to the harbour of Pyrenaeus, as he intended to proceed thence against the enemy with his collective fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They accordingly, after sailing by the Ligurian mountains and the Gallic bay, congregated together on the day appointed. From thence they went to Rhoda, and forcibly dislodged a garrison of Spaniards that were in that fortress.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Rhoda they proceeded with a <pb id="p.1501" n="1501"/>favourable wind to Emporiae, and there landed all the forces, excepting the crews of the ships.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At that time, as at present, Emporiae consisted of two towns, separated by a wall. One was inhabited by Greeks from Phocaea, whence the Massilians also derive their origin; the other by Spaniards.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Greek town, being open towards the sea, had but a small extent of wall, not above four hundred paces in circuit; but the Spanish town, being farther back from the sea, had a wall three thousand paces in circumference.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A third kind of inhabitants was added by the deified Caesar settling a Roman colony there, after the final defeat of the sons of Pompey. At present they are all incorporated in one mass; the Spaniards first, and, at length, the Greeks; having been adopted into the Roman citizenship.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whoever had, at that period, observed the Greeks exposed on one side to the open sea, and on the other to the Spaniards, a fierce and warlike race, would have wondered by what cause they were preserved. Deficient in strength, they guarded against danger by regular discipline; of which, among even more powerful people, the best preservative is fear.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That part of the wall which faced the country, they kept strongly fortified, having but one gate, at which some one of the magistrates was continually on guard.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During the night, a third part of the citizens kept watch on the walls, posting their watches, and going their rounds, not merely from the force of custom, or in compliance with the law, but with as much vigilance as if an enemy were at their gates. They never admitted any Spaniard into the city, nor did they go outside the walls without precaution.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The passage to the sea was open to every one: but, through the gate, next to the Spanish town, none ever passed, but in a large body; these were generally the third division, which had watched on the walls the preceding night.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The cause of their going out was this:

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Spaniards, ignorant of maritime affairs, were fond of trafficking with them, and glad of an opportunity of purchasing, for their own use, the foreign goods, which the others imported in their ships; and, at the same time, of finding a market for the produce of their lands. The desire of this mutual intercourse caused the Spanish town to be freely open to the Greeks.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were thus the more protected as being sheltered under the friendship of the Romans, which they cultivated with as <pb id="p.1502" n="1502"/>much cordial zeal, though not possessed of equal resources, as the Massilians. On this account they received the consul, and his army, with kindness and cordiality.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Cato staid there a few days, until he could learn what force the enemy had, and where they lay; and, not to be idle during even that short delay, he spent the whole time in exercising his men. It happened to be the season of the year when the Spaniards had the corn in their barns.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He therefore ordered the purveyors not to purchase any corn, and sent them home to Rome, saying, that the war would maintain itself.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then, setting out from Emporiae, he laid waste the lands of the enemy with fire and sword, spreading terror and flight through the whole country.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, as Marcus Helvius was going home from Farther Spain, with an escort of six thousand men, given him by the praetor, Appius Claudius, the Celtiberians, with a very numerous force, met him near the city of Illiturgi.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Valerius says, that they had twenty thousand effective men; that twelve thousand of them were killed, the town of Illiturgi taken, and all the adult males put to the sword.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Helvius, soon after, arrived at the camp of Cato; and as the region was now free from enemies, he sent back the escort to Farther Spain, and proceeded to Rome, where, on account of his successful services, he entered the city with an ovation.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He carried into the treasury, of silver bullion, fourteen thousand pounds' weight; of coined, seventeen thousand and twenty-three denarii;<note>549<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 14<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></note> and Oscan<note>Osca, now Huesca, was a city in Spain, remarkable for silver mines near it.</note> denarii, one hundred and twenty thousand four hundred and thirty-eight.<note>659<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 11<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 9 1/2 <hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The reason for which the senate refused him a triumph was, because he fought under the auspices, and in the province, of another. He had returned, moreover, two years after the expiration of his office, because after he had resigned the government of the province to Quintus Minucius, he was detained there, during the succeeding year, by a severe and tedious sickness;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he therefore entered the city in ovation, only two months before his successor, Quintus Minucius, enjoyed a triumph.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The latter also brought into the treasury thirty-four thousand <pb id="p.1503" n="1503"/>eight hundred pounds' weight of silver, seventy-eight thousand denarii,<note>2430<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 11<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 3<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> and of Oscan denarii two hundred and seventy-eight thousand.<note>8889<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 9<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile, in Spain, the consul lay encamped at a small distance from Emporiae.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thither came three ambassadors from Bilistages, chieftain of the Ilergetians, one of whom was his son, representing, that <quote>their fortresses were besieged, and that they had no hopes of being able to hold out, unless the Roman troops came to their assistance.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Three thousand men,</quote> they said, <quote>would be sufficient;</quote> and they added, that, <quote>if such a force came to their aid, the enemy would not keep their ground.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To this the consul answered, that <quote>he was truly concerned for their danger and their fears; but that he had by no means so great an amount of forces, as that, while there lay in his neighbourhood such a powerful force of the enemy, with whom he daily expected a general engagement, he could safely diminish his strength by dividing his troops.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The ambassadors, on hearing this, threw themselves at the consul's feet, and with tears conjured him <quote>not to forsake them at such a perilous juncture.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, if rejected by the Romans, to whom could they apply? They had no other allies, no other hope on earth.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They might have escaped the present hazard, if they had consented to forfeit their faith, and to conspire with the rest; but no menaces, no appearances of danger, had been able to shake their constancy, because they hoped to find in the Romans abundant succour and support.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If there was no further prospect of this, if it was refused them by the consul, they called gods and men to witness, that reluctantly and under compulsion they must change sides, to avoid such sufferings as the Saguntines had undergone; and that they would perish together with the other states of Spain, rather than alone.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They were thus dismissed on that day without any positive answer. During the following night, the consul's thoughts were greatly perplexed and divided.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was unwilling to abandon these allies, yet equally so to diminish his army, which might either oblige him to decline a battle, or occasion danger in an engagement.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was firmly resolved, however, not to lessen his forces, lest he should in the mean time suffer some disgrace from the enemy; and there- <pb id="p.1504" n="1504"/>fore he judged it expedient, instead of real succour, to hold out hopes to the allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For he considered that, in many cases, but especially in war, mere appearances have had all the effect of realities; and that a person, under a firm persuasion that he can command resources, virtually has them; that by that very confidence he was insured in his hopes and efforts.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next day he told the ambassadors, that <quote>although he was afraid to lend a part of his forces to others, and so to weaken his own, yet that he was giving more attention to their circumstances and danger than to his own.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then gave orders to the third part of the soldiers of every cohort, to make haste and prepare victuals, which they were to carry with them on board ships, and that the vessels should be got in readiness against the third day.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He desired two of the ambassadors to carry an account of these proceedings to Bilistages and the Ilergetians; but, by kind treatment and presents, he prevailed on the chieftain's son to remain with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The ambassadors did not leave the place until they saw the troops embarked on board the ships; then reporting this at home as a matter of certainty, they spread, not only among their own people, but likewise among the enemy, a confident assurance of the approach of Roman succours.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, when a specious appearance had been sufficiently exhibited, ordered the soldiers to be recalled from the ships; and, as the season of the year now approached when it would be proper to enter on action, he pitched a winter camp at the distance of three miles from Emporiae.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From this post he frequently led out his troops to ravage the enemy's country; sometimes to one quarter, sometimes to another, as opportunity offered, leaving only a small guard in the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They generally began their march in the night, that they might proceed as far as possible from the camp, and surprise the enemy unawares; and this practice disciplined the new-raised soldiers, and great numbers of the enemy were cut off; so that they no longer dared to venture beyond the walls of their forts.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with the temper of the enemy, and of his own men, he ordered the tribunes and the praefects, with all the horsemen and centurions, to be called together, and addressed them thus:

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>The time is arrived, which you have often wished for, when you might have an opportunity of <pb id="p.1505" n="1505"/>displaying your valour. Hitherto you have waged war rather as marauders than as regular troops; you shall now meet your enemies hand to hand, in regular fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Henceforward you will have it in your power, instead of pillaging country places, to exhaust the treasures of cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Our fathers, at a time when the Carthaginians had in Spain both commanders and armies, and had themselves neither commander nor soldiers there, nevertheless insisted on its being an article of treaty, that the river Iberus should be the boundary of their empire.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now, when two praetors of the Romans, when a consul, and three armies are employed in Spain, and, for near ten years past, no Carthaginian has been in either of its provinces, yet we have lost that empire on the hither side of the Iberus.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This it is your duty to recover by your valour and arms; and to compel this nation, which is in a state rather of giddy insurrection than of steady warfare, to receive again the yoke which it has shaken off.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After thus generally exhorting them, he gave notice, that he intended to march by night to the enemy's camp; and then dismissed them to take refreshment.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At midnight, after having given his attention to the auspices, he began his march, that he might take possession of such ground as he chose, before the enemy should observe him. Having led his troops beyond their camp, he formed them in order of battle, and at the first light sent three cohorts close to their very ramparts.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The barbarians, surprised at the Romans appearing on their rear, ran hastily to arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the mean time, the consul observed to his men, <quote>Soldiers, you have no room for hope, but in your own courage; and I have, purposely, taken care that it should be so.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The enemy are between us and our camp; behind us is an enemy's country. What is most honourable, is likewise safest; namely, to place all our hopes in our own valour.</quote> He then ordered the cohorts to retreat, in order to draw out the barbarians by the appearance of flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Every thing happened as he had expected. The enemy, thinking that the Romans retired through fear, rushed out of the gate, and filled the whole space between their own camp and the line of their adversaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While they were hastily marshalling their troops, the consul, who had all his in readiness, and in regular array, attacked them when in disorder. He caused the cavalry from <pb id="p.1506" n="1506"/>both wings to advance first to the charge: but those on the right were immediately repulsed, and, retiring in disorder, spread confusion among the infantry also.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On seeing this, the consul ordered two chosen cohorts to march round the right flank of the enemy, and show themselves on their rear, before the two lines of infantry could close. The alarm which this gave the enemy, which had been thrown to a disadvantage by the cowardice of the Roman horse, restored the fight to an equality.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But such a panic had taken possession of both the cavalry and infantry of the right wing, that the consul laid hold of several with his own hand, and turned them about with their faces to the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As long as the fight was carried on with missile weapons, success was doubtful; and on the right wing, where the disorder and flight had first began, the Romans with difficulty kept their ground.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On their left wing, the barbarians were both hard pressed in in front; and looked back, with timidity, at the cohorts that threatened their rear. But when, after discharging their iron darts and large javelins, they drew their swords, the battle, in a manner, began anew.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They were no longer wounded by random blows from a distance, but, closing foot to foot, placed all their hope in courage and strength.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul's men were now spent with fatigue, he reanimated their courage by bringing up into the fight some subsidiary cohorts from the second line.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These formed a new front, and being fresh themselves, and with fresh weapons attacking the wearied enemy in the form of a wedge, by a furious onset they first forced their way through them; and then, when they were once broken, scattered them and put them to flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They returned towards their camp across the fields with all the speed they could make. When Cato saw the rout become general, he rode back to the second legion, which had been posted in reserve, and ordered the standards to be borne before it, and that it should advance in quick motion, and attack the camp of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If any of them, through too much eagerness, pushed forward beyond his rank, he himself rode up and struck them with his javelin, and also ordered the tribunes and centurions to chastise them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By this time the camp of the enemy was attacked, though the Romans were kept off from the works by stones, poles, and weapons of every sort. But, on the arrival of the fresh legion, <pb id="p.1507" n="1507"/>the assailants assumed new courage, and the enemy fought with redoubled fury in defence of their rampart.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul attentively examined every place himself, that he might break in at that quarter where he saw the weakest resistance. At a gate on the left, he observed that the guard was thin, and thither he led the first-rank men and spearmen of the second legion.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The party posted at the gate were not able to withstand their assault; while the rest, seeing the enemy within the rampart, abandoned the defence of the camp, and threw away their standards and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Great numbers were killed at the gates, being stopped in the narrow passages by the throng of their own men; and the soldiers of the second legion cut off the hindmost, while the rest were plundering the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> According to the account of Valerius Antias, there were above forty thousand of the enemy killed on that day. Cato himself, who was certainly no disparager of his own merits, says that a great many were killed, but he specifies no number.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The conduct of' Cato on that day is judged deserving of commendation in three particulars. First, in leading round his army so far from his camp and fleet, as to fight the battle in the very middle of the enemy, that his men might look for no safety but in their courage.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Secondly, in throwing the cohorts on the enemy's rear. Thirdly, in ordering the second legion, when all the rest were disordered by the eagerness of their pursuit, to advance at a full pace to the gate of the camp, in compact and regular order under their standards.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He delayed not to improve his victory; but having sounded a retreat, and brought back his men laden with spoil, he allowed them a few hours of the night for rest; and then led them out to ravage the country.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They spread their depredations the wider, as the enemy were dispersed in their flight; and this circumstance, no less than the defeat of the preceding day, obliged the Spaniards of Emporiae, and those of their neighbourhood, to make a submission.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Many also, belonging to other states, who had made their escape to Emporiae, surrendered; all of whom the consul received with kindness, and after refreshing them with victuals and wine, dismissed to their several homes.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He quickly decamped thence, and wherever the army proceeded on its march, he was met by ambassadors, surrendering their respective states;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> so that, by the <pb id="p.1508" n="1508"/>time when he arrived at Tarraco, all Spain on this side of the Ebro was in a state of perfect subjection; and the Roman prisoners, and those of their allies and the Latin confederates, who by various chances had fallen into the hands of the enemies in Spain, were brought back by the barbarians, as an offering to the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A rumour afterwards spread abroad, that Cato intended to lead his army into Turditania; and it was given out, with equal falsehood, that he meant to proceed to the remote inhabitants of the mountains.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On this groundless, unauthenticated report, seven forts of the Bergistans revolted; but the Roman, marching thither, reduced them to subjection without any battle worthy of narration. Not very long after, when the consul returned to Tarraco, and before he removed to any other place, the same persons revolted again.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were again subdued; but, on this second reduction, met not the same mild treatment; they were all sold by auction, that they might not any oftener disturb the peace.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the mean time, the praetor, Publius Manlius, having received the army from Quintius Minucius, whom he had succeeded, and joined to it the old army of Appius Claudius Nero, from Farther Spain, marched into Turditania.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of all the Spaniards, the Turditanians are reckoned the least warlike; nevertheless, relying on their great numbers, they went to oppose the march of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The cavalry, having been sent forward, at once broke their line; and with the infantry there was hardly any conflict.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The veteran soldiers, well acquainted with the enemy and their manner of fighting, effectually decided the battle. This engagement, however, did not terminate the war. The Turdulans hired ten thousand Celtiberians, and prepared to carry on the war with foreign troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul, meanwhile, alarmed at the rebellion of the Bergistans, and suspecting that the other states would act in like manner when occasion offered, took away their arms from all the Spaniards on this side of the Iberus;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> which proceeding affected them so deeply, that many laid violent hands on themselves; this fierce race considering that, without arms, life was of no value.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this was reported to the consul, he summoned before him the senators of every one of the states, to whom he spoke thus: <quote>It is not more our interest than it is your own, that you should not rebel; since your insurrections have, hitherto, always drawn more mis- <pb id="p.1509" n="1509"/>fortune on the Spaniards than labour on the Roman armies.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To prevent such things happening in future, I know but one method, which is, to put it out of your power to rebel.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I wish to effect this in the gentlest way, and that you would assist me therein with your advice. I will follow none with greater pleasure than what yourselves shall offer.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They all remaining silent, he told them that he would give them a few days' time to consider the matter.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When, on being called together, even in the second meeting, they uttered not a word, in one day he razed the walls of all their fortresses; and marching against those who had not yet submitted, he received in every country, as he passed through, the submission of all the neighbouring states.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Segestica alone, an important and opulent city, he reduced by works and engines.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>






<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Cato had greater difficulties to surmount, in subduing the enemy, than had those commanders who came first into Spain; for this reason, that the Spaniards, through disgust at the Carthaginian government, came over to their side; whereas he had the task of enforcing their submission to slavery, in a manner, after they had been in full enjoyment of liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Besides, he found the whole province in a state of commotion; insomuch, that some were in arms, and others were compelled to join in the revolt by being besieged, nor would they have been able to hold out any longer if they had not received timely succour.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But so vigorous was the spirit and capacity of the consul, that there was no kind of business, whether great or small, which he did not himself attend to and perform;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and he not only planned and ordered, but generally executed in person such measures as were expedient; nor did he practise a more strict and rigorous discipline over any one than over himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In spare diet, watching, and labour, he vied with the meanest of his soldiers; nor, excepting the honour of his post, and the command, had he any peculiar distinction above the rest of the army.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Celtiberians, summoned forth by the enemy for hire, as above mentioned, rendered the war in Turditania more difficult to the praetor, Publius Manlius. The consul, therefore, in compliance with a letter from the praetor, led his legions thither.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Celtiberians and Turditanians were lying in separate camps at the approach of the Romans, who began immediately to skirmish with the Turditanians, making <pb id="p.1510" n="1510"/>attacks on their advanced guards; and they constantly came off victorious from every engagement, however rashly undertaken.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul ordered some military tribunes to enter into a conference with the Celtiberians, and to offer them their choice of three proposals: first, to come over, if they wished, it, to the Romans, and receive double the pay for which they had agreed with the Turditanians:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the second, to depart to their own homes, on receiving assurance, under the sanction of

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the public faith, that it should not operate to their injury that they had joined the enemies of the Romans: the third was, that, if they were absolutely determined on war, they should appoint a day and place to decide the matter with him by arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Celtiberians desired a day's time for consideration;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and an assembly was held, but in great confusion, from the Turditanians mingling in it, so that no resolution could be come to.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Although it was uncertain whether there was to be war or peace with the Celtiberians, the Romans, nevertheless, just as though the latter were determined on, brought provisions from the lands and forts of the enemy, and soon ventured to go within their fortifications, relying on private truces, as they would on a common intercourse established by authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the consul found that he could not entice the enemy to a battle, he first led out a number of cohorts, lightly accoutred, in regular order, to ravage a part of the country which was yet unhurt;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> then hearing that all the baggage of the Celtiberians was deposited at Saguntia, he proceeded thither to attack that town, but was unable, notwithstanding, to provoke them to stir.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Paying, therefore, his own troops and those of Minucius, he left the bulk of his army in the praetor's camp, and, with seven cohorts, returned to the Iberus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With that small force he took several towns. The Sidetonians, Ausetanians, and Suessetanians came over to his side.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Lacetanians, a remote and wild nation, still remained in arms; partly through their natural ferocity, and partly through consciousness of guilt, in having laid waste, by sudden incursions, the country of the allies, while the consul and his army were employed in the war with the Turditanians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He therefore marched to attack their capital, not only with the Roman cohorts, but also with the troops of the allies, who were justly incensed against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The town <pb id="p.1511" n="1511"/>was stretched out into considerable length, but had not proportionable breadth.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the distance of about four hundred paces from it he halted, and leaving there a party composed of chosen cohorts, he charged them not to stir from that spot until he himself should come to them; and then he led round the rest of the men to the farther side of the town. The greater part of his auxiliary troops were Suessetanians, and these he ordered to advance and assault the wall.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Lacetanians, knowing their arms and standards, and remembering how often they had themselves, with impunity, committed every kind of outrage and insult in their territory, how often defeated and routed them in pitched battles, hastily threw open a gate, and all, in one body, rushed out against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Suessetanians scarcely stood their shout, much less their onset;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and the consul, on seeing this happen, just as he had foreseen, galloped back under the enemy's wall to his cohorts, brought them up quickly to that part of the city where all

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> was silence and solitude, in consequence of the Lacetanians having sallied out on the Suessetanians, and took possession of every part of it before the Lacetanians returned; who, having nothing now left but their arms, soon surrendered themselves also.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The conqueror marched thence, without delay, to the fort of Vergium. This was, almost entirely, a receptacle of robbers and plunderers, and thence incursions were made on the peaceable parts of the province.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One of the principal inhabitants deserted out of the place to the consul, and endeavoured to excuse himself and his countrymen; alleging, that <quote>the management of affairs was not in their hands; for the robbers, having gained admittance, had reduced the fort entirely under their own power.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul ordered him to return home, and pretend some plausible reason for having been absent; and then, <quote>when he should see him advancing to the walls,

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and the robbers intent on defending the city, to seize the citadel with such men as favoured his party.</quote> This was executed according to his directions.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The double alarm, from the Romans scaling the walls in front, and the citadel being seized on their rear, at once entirely confounded the barbarians. The consul, having taken possession of the place, ordered, that those who had secured the citadel should, with their relations, be set at liberty, and enjoy their pro- <pb id="p.1512" n="1512"/>perty, the rest of the natives he commanded the quaestor to sell; and he put the robbers to death.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having restored quiet in the province, he settled the iron and silver mines on such a footing, that they produced a large revenue;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and, in consequence of the regulations then made, the province daily increased in riches.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On account of these services performed in Spain, the senate decreed a supplication for three days.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During this summer, the other consul, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, fought a pitched battle with a body of the Boians in Gaul, near the forest of Litanae, and gained a complete victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Eight thousand of the Gauls are said to have been slain; the rest, desisting from further opposition, retired quietly to their several villages and lands.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> During the remainder of the summer, the consul kept his army near the Po, at Placentia and Cremona, and repaired the buildings in these cities which had been demolished in the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While the affairs of Italy and Spain were in this posture, Titus Quinctius had spent the winter in Greece, in such a manner, that, excepting the Aetolians, who neither had gained rewards of victory adequate to their hopes, nor were capable of being long contented with a state of quiet, all Greece, being in full enjoyment of the blessings of peace and liberty, were highly pleased with their present state; and they admired not more the Roman general's bravery in arms, than his temperance, justice, and moderation in victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now a decree of the senate was brought to him, containing a denunciation of war against Nabis the Lacedaemonian.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On reading it, Quinctius summoned a convention of deputies from all the allied states, to be held, on a certain day, at Corinth. Whither when many persons of the first rank came together, from all quarters, forming a very full assembly, from which even the Aetolians were not absent, he addressed them in this manner: &mdash;<quote>The

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Romans and Greeks, in the war which they waged against Philip, were united in affections and councils, and they had each no less their separate reasons for entering into it.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For he had violated friendship with the Romans; first by aiding our enemies, the Carthaginians; and then by attacking our allies here: and, towards you, his conduct was such, that even if we had been willing to forget our own injuries, those offered by him to you would have constituted a sufficient occasion of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the business to be considered this day <pb id="p.1513" n="1513"/>has relation wholly to yourselves:

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for the subject which I propose to your consideration is, whether you choose to suffer Argos, which, as you know, has been seized by Nabis, to remain under his dominion;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> or whether you judge it reasonable, that a city of such high reputation and antiquity, seated in the centre of Greece, should be restored to liberty, and placed in the same state with the rest of the cities of Peloponnesus and of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This question, as you see, merely respects yourselves; it concerns not the Romans in any degree, excepting so far as the one city being left in subjection to tyranny hinders their glory, in having liberated Greece, from being full and complete.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If, however, you are not moved by regard for that city, nor by the example, nor by the danger of the contagion of that evil spreading wider, we, for our parts, shall rest content. On this subject I desire your opinions, resolved to abide by whatever the majority of you shall determine.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the address of the Roman general, the several deputies proceeded to give their opinions.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The ambassador of the Athenians extolled, to the utmost of his power, and expressed the greatest gratitude for the kindness of the Romans towards Greece, <quote>in having, when applied to for assistance, brought them succours against Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and now, without being applied to, voluntarily offering assistance against the tyrant Nabis.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He at the same time severely censured the conduct of some, who, in their discourses, <quote>depreciated those kindnesses, and propagated evil surmises of the future, when it would better become them rather to return thanks for the past.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was evident that this was pointed at the Aetolians: wherefore Alexander, deputy of that nation, having first inveighed against the Athenians, who, having formerly been the most strenuous supporters of liberty, now betrayed the general cause, for the sake of recommending themselves by flattery.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then complained that <quote>the Achaeans, formerly soldiers of Philip, and lately, on the decline of his fortune, deserters from him, had regained possession of Corinth, and were so acting as that they might acquire Argos;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> while the Aetolians, who had first opposed their arms to Philip, who had always been allies of the Romans, and who had stipulated by treaty, that, on the Macedonian being conquered, the lands and cities should be theirs, were defrauded of Echinus and <pb id="p.1514" n="1514"/>Pharsalus.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He charged the Romans with insincerity, because, <quote>while they put forth empty professions of establishing liberty, they held possession of Demetrias and Chalcis by their garrisons;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> though, when Philip hesitated to withdraw his garrisons from those places, they always urged against him, that the Grecians would never be free while Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth were in the hands of the others.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And, lastly, that they named Argos and Nabis merely as a pretext for remaining in Greece, and keeping their armies there.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Let them carry away their legions to Italy; and the Aetolians were ready to undertake, either that Nabis should voluntarily withdraw his forces from Argos, on terms; or they would compel him by force of arms to comply with the unanimous judgment of Greece.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This arrogant speech called up, first, Aristaenus, praetor of the Achaeans, who said: &mdash;<quote>Forbid

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> it, Jupiter, supremely good and great, and imperial Juno, the tutelar deity of Argos, that that city should be staked as a prize between the Lacedaemonian tyrant and the Aetolian plunderers, under such unhappy circumstances, that its being retaken by you should be productive of more calamitous consequences than its capture by him. Titus Quinctius, the sea lying between us, does not secure us from those robbers; what then will become of us, should they procure themselves a stronghold in the centre of Peloponnesus?

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They have nothing Grecian but the language, as they have nothing human but the shape. They live under customs and rites more brutally savage than any barbarians, nay, than wild beasts themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherefore, Romans, we beseech you, not only to recover Argos from Nabis, but also to establish the affairs of Greece on such a footing, as to leave these countries adequately secured from the robberies of the Aetolians.</quote> The rest concurring in these censures on the Aetolians, the Roman general said, that <quote>he had himself intended to have answered them, but that he perceived all so highly incensed against those people, that the general resentment required rather to be appeased than irritated.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Satisfied, therefore, with the sentiments entertained of the Romans, and of the Aetolians, he would simply put this question: What was the general opinion concerning war with Nabis, in case of his refusing to restore Argos to the Achaeans?</quote> When all had pronounced for war, he recommended to them, <pb id="p.1515" n="1515"/>to send in their shares of auxiliary troops, each state in proportion to its ability.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He even sent an ambassador to the Aetolians; rather to make them disclose their sentiments, which was the actual result, than with any hope of obtaining their concurrence.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He gave orders to the military tribunes, to bring up the army from Elatia. To the ambassadors of Antiochus, who, at this time, proposed to treat of an alliance, he answered, that <quote>he could say nothing on the subject in the absence of the ten ambassadors. They must go to Rome, and apply to the senate.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as the troops arrived from Elatia, Quinctius set out to lead them towards Argos.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When near Cleonae he was met by the praetor, Aristaenus, with ten thousand Achaean foot and one thousand horse; and having joined forces, they pitched their camp at a small distance from thence.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Next day they marched down into the plains of Argos, and fixed their post about four miles from that city.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The commander of the Lacedaemonian garrison was Pythagoras, the tyrant's son-in-law, and his wife's brother; who, on the approach of the Romans, posted strong guards in both the citadels, for Argos has two, and in every other place that was commodious for defence, or exposed to danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But, while thus employed, he could by no means dissemble the dread inspired by the approach of the Romans; and, to the alarm from abroad, was added an insurrection within.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was an Argive, named Damocles, a youth of more spirit than prudence, who held conversations, with proper persons, on a design of expelling the garrison; at first, with the precaution of imposing an oath, but afterwards, through his eager desire to add strength to the conspiracy, he estimated people's sincerity with too little caution.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While he was in conference with his accomplices, an officer, sent by the commander of the garrison, summoned him to appear before him, and he perceived that his design was betrayed;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> on which, exhorting the conspirators, who were present, to take arms with him, rather than be tortured to death, he went on with a few companions towards

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the forum, crying out to all who wished the preservation of the state, to follow him as the vindicator and author of their liberty. He could prevail on none to join him; for they saw no prospect of any attainable advantage, and much less any sufficiently powerful support.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While he exclaimed in this <pb id="p.1516" n="1516"/>manner, the Lacedaemonians surrounded him and his party, and put them to death.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Many others were afterwards seized, the greater part of whom were executed, and the remaining few thrown into prison.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> During the following night, great numbers, letting themselves down from the walls by ropes, came over to the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As these men affirmed, that if the Roman army had been at the gates, this commotion would not have ended without effect;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that, if the camp was brought nearer, the Argives would not remain inactive; Quinctius sent some horsemen and infantry, lightly accoutred, who, meeting at the Cylarabis, a place of exercise, less than three hundred paces from the city, a party of Lacedaemonians, who sallied out of a gate, engaged them, and, without much difficulty, drove them back into the town;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and the Roman general encamped on the very spot where the battle had been fought.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There he passed one day, on the look-out if any new commotion might arise; but perceiving that the inhabitants were quite depressed by fear, he called a council concerning the besieging of Argos. All the deputies of Greece, except Aristaenus, were of one opinion, that, as that city was the sole object of the war, with it the war should commence.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This was by no means agreeable to Quinctius;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but he listened, with evident marks of approbation, to Aristaenus, arguing in opposition to the joint opinion of all the rest; while he himself added, that "as the war was undertaken in favour of the Argives,

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> against the tyrant, what could be less proper than to leave the enemy in quiet, and lay siege to Argos? For his part, he was resolved to point his arms against the main object of the war, Lacedaemon and the tyrant.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then dismissed the meeting, and sent out light-armed cohorts to collect forage. Whatever was ripe in the adjacent country, they reaped, and brought together; and what was green they trod down and destroyed, that the enemy might not subsequently get it.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then proceeded over Mount Parthenius, and, passing by Tegaea, encamped on the third day at Caryae; where he waited for the auxiliary troops of the allies, before he entered the enemy's territory.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Fifteen hundred Macedonians came from Philip, and four hundred horsemen of the Thessalians; and now the Roman general had no occasion to wait for more auxiliaries, having abundance; but he was obliged to stop for supplies of <pb id="p.1517" n="1517"/>provisions, which he had ordered the neighbouring cities to furnish.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He was joined also by a powerful naval force; Lucius Quinctius had already come from Leucas, with forty ships; eighteen ships of war had arrived from the Rhodians; and king Eumenes was cruising among the Cyclades, with ten decked ships, thirty barks, and smaller vessels of various sorts.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Of the Lacedaemonians themselves, also, a great many, who had been driven from home by the cruelty of the tyrants, came into the Roman camp, in hopes of being reinstated in their country; for the number was very great of those who had been banished by the several despots, during many generations, since they first got Lacedaemon into their power.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The principal person among the exiles was Agesipolis, to whom the sovereignty of Lacedaemon belonged in right of his birth;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> but who had been driven out when an infant by Lycurgus, after the death of Cleomenes, who was the first tyrant of Lacedaemon.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although Nabis was enclosed between such powerful armaments on land and sea, and, on a comparative view of his own and his enemy's strength, could scarcely conceive any degree of hope;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> yet he did not desist from the war, but brought, from Crete, a thousand chosen young men of that country in addition to a thousand whom he had before; he had, besides, under arms, three thousand mercenary soldiers, and ten thousand of his countrymen, with the peasants, who belonged to the fortresses.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He fortified the city with a ditch and rampart; and lest any intestine commotion should arise, curbed the people's spirits by fear, punishing them with extreme severity, as he could not hope for good wishes towards a tyrant.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As he had his suspicions respecting some of the citizens, he drew out all his forces to a field called Dromos, (the course,) and ordered the Lacedaemonians to be called to an assembly without their arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then formed a line of armed men round the place where they were assembled, observing briefly, <quote>that he ought to be excused, if, at such a juncture, he feared and guarded against every thing that might happen;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and that, if the present state of affairs subjected any to suspicion, it was their advantage to be prevented from attempting any design, rather than to be punished for attempting it: he therefore intended,</quote> he said, <quote>to keep certain persons in custody, until the storm, which then threatened, should <pb id="p.1518" n="1518"/>have passed over;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and would discharge them as soon as the enemy should have been driven away, from whom the danger would be less, when proper precaution was taken against internal treachery.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then ordered the names of about eighty of the principal young men to be called over, and as each answered to his name, he put them in custody. On the night following, they were all put to death.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some of the Helotes, a race of rustics, who have been feudal vassals even from the earliest times, being charged with an intention to desert, they were driven with stripes through all the streets, and put to death. The terror which this excited so confounded the multitude, as to deter them from all attempts to effect a revolution.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He kept his forces within the fortifications, knowing that he was not a match for the enemy in the field; and, besides, he was afraid to leave the city, while all men's minds were in a state of such suspense and uncertainty.</p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius, when all his preparations were now sufficiently made, decamped; and, on the second day, came to Sellasia, on the river &OElig;nus, on the spot where it is said Antigonus, king of Macedonia, fought a pitched battle with Cleomenes, tyrant of Lacedaemon.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Being told that the ascent from thence was difficult, and the passes narrow, he made a short circuit by the mountains, sending forward a party to make a road, and came, by a tolerably broad and open passage, to the river Eurotas, where it flows almost immediately under the walls of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here, the tyrant's auxiliary troops attacked the Romans, while they were forming their camp, together with Quinctius himself, (who, with a division of cavalry and light troops, had advanced beyond the rest,) and threw them into a state of alarm and confusion; not expecting any thing of the kind, as no one had opposed them throughout their whole march, and they had passed, as it were, through a friendly territory.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The disorder lasted a considerable time, the infantry calling for aid on the cavalry, and the cavalry on the infantry, each having but little confidence in himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At length, the foremost ranks of the legions came up; and no sooner had the cohorts of the vanguard taken part in the fight, than those who had lately been an object of dread were driven back in terror into the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans, retiring so far from the wall as to be out of the reach of weapons, stood there for some time in battle-array; and then, none of the <pb id="p.1519" n="1519"/>enemy coming out against them, retired to their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Next day Quinctius led on his army in regular order along the bank of the river, passed the city, to the foot of the mountain of Menelaus, the legionary cohorts marching in front, and the cavalry and light infantry bringing up the rear.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nabis kept his mercenary troops, on whom he placed his whole reliance, in readiness, and drawn up in a body, within the walls, intending to attack the rear of the enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and, as soon as the last of their troops passed by, these rushed out of the town, from several places at once, with as great fury as the day before.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The rear was commanded by Appius Claudius, who having beforehand prepared his men to expect such an event, that it might not come upon them unawares, instantly made his troops face about, and presented an entire front to the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A regular engagement, therefore, took place, as if two complete lines had encountered, and it lasted a considerable time; but at length Nabis's troops betook themselves to flight, which would have been attended with less dismay and danger, if they had not been closely pressed by the Achaeans, who were well acquainted with the ground. These made dreadful havoc, and dispersing them entirely, obliged the greater part to throw away their arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Quinctius encamped near Amyclae; and afterwards, when he had utterly laid waste all the pleasant and thickly inhabited country round the city, not one of the enemy venturing out of the gates, he removed his camp to the river Eurotas. From thence he ravaged the valley lying under Taygetus, and the country reaching as far as the sea.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time, Lucius Quinctius got possession of the towns on the sea-coast; of some, by their voluntary surrender; of others, by fear or force.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, learning that the Lacedaemonians made Gythium the repository of all their naval stores, and that the Roman camp was at no great distance from the sea, he resolved to attack that town with his whole force.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was, at that time, a place of considerable strength; well furnished with great numbers of native inhabitants and settlers from other parts, and with every kind of warlike stores.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Very seasonably for Quinctius, when commencing an enterprise of no easy nature, king Eumenes and the Rhodian fleet came to his assistance.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The vast multitude of seamen, collected out of the three fleets, finished in a <pb id="p.1520" n="1520"/>few days all the works requisite for the siege of a city so strongly fortified, both on the land side and on that next the sea. Covered galleries were soon brought up; the wall was undermined, and, at the same time, shaken with battering- rams.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By the frequent shocks given with these, one of the towers was thrown down, and, by its fall, the adjoining wall on each side was laid flat.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans, on this, attempted to force in, both on the side next the port, to which the approach was more level than to the rest, hoping to divert the enemy's attention from the more open passage, and, at the same time, to enter the breach caused by the falling of the wall.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were near effecting their design of penetrating into the town, when the assault was suspended by the prospect which was held out of the surrender of the city. This, however, was subsequently dissipated.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Dexagoridas and Gorgopas commanded there, with equal authority. Dexagoridas had sent to the Roman general a message that he would give up the city;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and, after the time and the mode of proceeding had been agreed on, he was slain as a traitor by Gorgopas, and the defence of the city was maintained with redoubled vigour by this single commander. The further prosecution of the siege would have been much more difficult, had not Titus Quinctius arrived with a body of four thousand chosen men.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He showed his army in order of battle, on the brow of a hill at a small distance from the city; and, on the other side, Lucius Quinctius plied the enemy hard with his engines, both on the quarter of the sea, and of the land; on which Gorgopas was compelled to adopt that proceeding, which, in the case of another, he had punished with death.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After stipulating for liberty to carry away the soldiers

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> whom he had there as a garrison, he surrendered the city to Quinctius.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Previous to the surrender of Gythium, Pythagoras, who had been left as commander at Argos, having intrusted the defence of the city to Timocrates of Pellene, with a thousand mercenary soldiers, and two thousand Argives, came to Lacedaemon and joined Nabis.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although Nabis had been greatly alarmed at the first arrival of the Roman fleet, and the surrender of the towns on the sea-coast, yet, as long as Gythium was held by his troops, he had quieted his apprehensions with that scanty hope;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but when he heard that Gythium, too, was given up to the Ro- <pb id="p.1521" n="1521"/>mans, and saw that he had no room for any kind of hope on the land, where

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> every place round was in the hands of the enemy, and that he was totally excluded from the sea, he considered that he must yield to fortune. He first sent a messenger into the Roman camp, to learn whether permission would be given to send ambassadors.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This being consented to, Pythagoras came to the general, with no other commission than to propose a conference between that commander and the tyrant.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A council was summoned on the proposal, and every one present agreeing in opinion that a conference should be granted, a time and place were appointed.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They came, with moderate escorts, to some hills in the interjacent ground; and leaving their cohorts there, in posts open to the view of both parties, they went down to the place of meeting;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nabis attended by a select party of his body-guards; Quinctius by his brother, king Eumenes, Sosilaus, the Rhodian, Aristaenus, praetor of the Achaeans, and a few military tribunes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>




















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the tyrant, having the choice given him either to speak first or to listen, began thus: <quote>Titus Quinctius, and you who are present, if I could collect from my own reflections the reason of your having either declared or actually made war against me, I should have waited in silence the issue of my destiny.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But in the present state of things, I could not repress my desire of knowing, before I am ruined, the cause for which my ruin is resolved on.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And in truth, if you were such men as the Carthaginians are represented to be,-men who considered the obligation of faith, pledged in alliances, as in no degree sacred, I should not wonder if you were the less scrupulous with respect to your conduct towards me.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, instead of that, when I look at you, I perceive that you are Romans: men who allow treaties to be the most solemn of religious acts, and faith, pledged therein, the strongest of human ties.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, when I look back at myself, I am confident I am one who, as a member of the community, am, in common with the rest of the Lacedaemonians, included in a treaty subsisting with you, of very ancient date; and likewise have, lately, during the war with Philip, concluded anew, in my own name, a personal friendship and alliance with you. But it appears I have violated and cancelled that treaty, by holding possession of the city of Argos.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In what manner shall I defend this?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By the consideration of the fact, <pb id="p.1522" n="1522"/>or of the time. The consideration of the fact furnishes me with a twofold defence: for, in the first place, in consequence of an invitation from the inhabitants themselves, and of their voluntary act of surrender, I accepted the possession of that city, and did not seize it by force. In the next place, I accepted it, when the city was in league with Philip, not in alliance with you.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the consideration of the time acquits me, inasmuch as when I was in actual possession of Argos, the alliance was entered into between you and me, and you stipulated that I should send you aid against Philip, not that I should withdraw my garrison from that city.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In this dispute, therefore, so far as it relates to Argos, I have unquestionably the advantage, both from the equity of the proceeding, as I gained possession of a city which belonged not to you, but to your enemy; and as I gained it by its own voluntary act, and not by forcible compulsion;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and also from your own acknowledgment; since, in the articles of our alliance, you left Argos to me.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But then, the name of tyrant, and my conduct, are strong objections against me: that I call forth slaves to a state of freedom; that I carry out the indigent part of the populace, and give them settlements in lands.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With respect to the title by which I am styled, I can answer thus: That, let me be what I may, I am the same now that I was at the time when you yourself, Titus Quinctius, concluded an alliance with me.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> I remember, that I was then styled king by you; now, I see, I am called tyrant. If, therefore, I had since altered the style of my office, I might have an account to render of my fickleness: as you choose to alter it, that account should be rendered by you.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As to what relates to the augmenting the number of the populace, by giving liberty to slaves, and the distribution of lands to the needy; on this head, too, I might defend myself by a reference to time.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> These measures, of what complexion soever they are, I had practised before you formed friendship with me, and received my aid in the war against Philip. But, if I did the same things, at this moment, I would not say to you, how did I thereby injure you, or violate the friendship subsisting between us?

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> but that, in so doing, I acted agreeably to the practice and institutions of my ancestors. Do not estimate what is done at Lacedaemon by the standard of your own laws and constitution.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> There is no necessity for comparing <pb id="p.1523" n="1523"/>particular institutions: you are guided in your choice of a horseman, by the quantity of his property; in your choice of a foot soldier, by the quantity of his property; and your plan is, that a few should abound in wealth, and that the body of the people should be in subjection to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Our lawgiver did not choose that the administration of government should be in the hands of a few, such as you call a senate; or that this or that order of citizens should have a superiority over the rest: but he considered that, by equalizing the property and dignity of all, he should multiply the number of those who were to bear arms for their country.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> I acknowledge that I have enlarged on these matters, beyond what consists with the conciseness customary with my countrymen, and that the sum of the whole might be comprised in few words: that, since I first commenced a friendship with you, I have given you no just cause to repent it.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>





















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman general answered: <quote>We never contracted any friendship or alliance with you, but with Pelops, the right and lawful king of Lacedaemon:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> whose authority, while the Carthaginian, Gallic, and other wars, succeeding one another, kept us constantly employed, the tyrants, who after him held Lacedaemon under forced subjection, usurped into their own hands, as did you also during the late war with Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For what could be less fitting, than that we, who were waging war against Philip, in favour of the liberty of Greece, should contract friendship with a tyrant, and a tyrant the most cruel and violent towards his subjects that ever existed?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, even supposing that you had not either seized or held Argos by iniquitous means, it would be incumbent on us, when we are giving liberty to all Greece, to reinstate Lacedaemon also in its ancient freedom, and the enjoyment of its own laws, which you just now spoke of, as if you were a rival of Lycurgus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Shall we take pains to make Philip's garrisons evacuate Tassus and Bargylii; and shall we leave Lacedaemon and Argos, those two most illustrious cities, formerly the lights of Greece, under your feet, that their continuance in bondage may tarnish our title of deliverers of Greece? But the Argives took part with Philip: we excuse you from taking any concern in that cause, so that you need not be angry with them on our behalf.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We have received sufficient proof, that the guilt of that proceeding is chargeable <pb id="p.1524" n="1524"/>on two only, or, at most, three persons, and not on the state; just, indeed, as in the case of the invitation given to you and to your army, and your reception into the citadel, not one step was taken by public authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We know, that the Thessalians, Phocians, and Locrians, with unanimous consent, joined in espousing the cause of Philip; yet we have given liberty to them in common with the rest of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> How then can you suppose we shall conduct ourselves towards the Argives, who are acquitted of having publicly authorized misconduct?

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> You said, that your inviting slaves to liberty, and the distribution of lands among the indigent, were objected to you as crimes; and crimes, surely, they are, of no small magnitude. But what are they in comparison with those atrocious deeds, that are daily perpetrated by you and your adherents, in continual succession?

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Show us a free assembly of the people, either at Argos or Lacedaemon, if you wish to hear a true recital of the crimes of the most abandoned tyranny.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To omit all other instances of older date, what a massacre did your son-in-law, Pythagoras, make at Argos almost before my eyes! What another did you yourself perpetrate, when I was nearly within the confines of the Lacedaemonians!

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Now, give orders, that the persons whom you took out of the midst of an assembly, and committed to prison, after declaring, in the hearing of all your countrymen, that you would keep them in custody, be produced in their chains, that their wretched parents may know that those are alive, for whom, under a false impression, they are mourning.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Well, but you say, though all these things were so, Romans, how do they concern you? Can you say this to the deliverers of Greece; to people who crossed the sea, and have maintained a war on sea and land, to effect its deliverance?

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Still you tell us, you have not directly violated the alliance, or the friendship established between us. How many instances must I produce of your having done so?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But I will not go into a long detail; I will bring the matter to a short issue. By what acts is friendship violated? Most effectually by these two: by treating our friends as foes; and by uniting yourself with our enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Each of these has been done by you. For Messene, which had been united to us in friendship, by one and the same bond of alliance with Lacedaemon, you, while professing yourself our ally, reduced to subjection by force of <pb id="p.1525" n="1525"/>arms, though you knew it was in alliance with us;

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and you contracted with Philip, our professed enemy, not only an alliance, but even an affinity, through the intervention of his general, Philocles:

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> and waging actual war against us, with your piratical ships, you made the sea round Malea unsafe, and you captured and slew more Roman citizens almost than Philip himself; and to our ships conveying provisions to our armies the coast of Macedonia itself was less dangerous, than the promontory of Malea.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Cease, therefore, to vaunt your good faith, and the obligations of treaties;

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> and, dropping a popular style of discourse, speak as a tyrant, and as an enemy.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Aristaenus then began, at first to advise, and afterwards even to beseech Nabis, while it was yet in his power, and he had the opportunity, to consider what was best for himself and his interests.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then mentioned the names of several tyrants in the neighbouring states who had resigned their authority, and restored liberty to their people, and afterwards spent among their fellow citizens not only a secure but an honoured old age.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These observations having been reciprocally made and listened to, the approach of night broke up the conference. Next day Nabis said, that he was willing to cede Argos, and withdraw his garrison, since such was the desire of the Romans, and to deliver up the prisoners and deserters;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and if they demanded any thing further, he requested that they would set it down in writing, that he might deliberate on it with his friends.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus the tyrant gained time for consultation; and Quinctius also, on his part, called a council, to which he summoned the chiefs of the allies. The greatest part were of opinion, that <quote>they ought to persevere in the war, and that the tyrant should be altogether got rid of;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> otherwise the liberty of Greece would never be secure. That it would have been much better never to have entered on the war than to drop it after it was begun;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for this would be a kind of approbation of his tyrannical usurpation, and which would establish

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> him more firmly, as giving the countenance of the Roman people to his ill-acquired authority, and that he would quickly spirit up many in other states to plot against the liberty of their countrymen.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The wishes of the general himself tended rather to peace; for he saw that, as the enemy was shut up in the town, nothing remained but a siege, and that must be very tedious. For it was not Gythium that they <pb id="p.1526" n="1526"/>must besiege, though even that place had been gained by capitulation, not by assault; but Lacedaemon, a city most powerful in men and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The only hope which they could have formed was, that, on the first approach of their army, dissensions and insurrections might have been raised within: but, though the standards had been seen to advance almost to the gates, not one person had stirred.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To this he added, that <quote>Villius the ambassador, returning from Antiochus, brought intelligence, that the peace was an unsound one; and that the king had come over into Europe with a much more powerful armament by sea and land than before.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Now, if the army should be engaged in the siege of Lacedaemon, with what other forces could the war be maintained against a king of his great power and strength?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These arguments he urged openly; but beneath all this there lay a concealed anxiety lest one of the new consuls should be appointed to the province of Greece;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and then the honour of terminating the war, in which he had proceeded so far, must be yielded to a successor.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Finding that he could not, by opposition, make any alteration in the sentiments of the allies, by pretending to go over to their opinion, he led them all into a concurrence in his plan.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Be it so,</quote> said he, <quote>and may success attend us: let us lay siege to Lacedaemon, since that is your choice. However, as a business so slow in its progress, as you know the besieging of cities to be, very often wears out the patience of the besiegers sooner than that of the besieged, you ought at once to make up your minds to this, that we must pass the winter under the walls of Lacedaemon.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If this delay involved only toil and danger, I would recommend to you to prepare your minds and bodies to support these. But, in the present case, vast expenses also will be requisite for the construction of works, for machines and engines, sufficient

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> for the siege of so great a city, and for procuring stores of provisions for the winter to serve you and us: therefore, to prevent your being suddenly disconcerted, or shamefully deserting an enterprise which you had engaged in, I think it will be necessary

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> for you to write home to your respective states, and learn what degree of spirit and of strength each possesses. Of auxiliary troops I have a sufficient number, and to spare; but the more numerous we are, the more numerous will be our wants.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The country of the enemy has nothing left but the naked soil. <pb id="p.1527" n="1527"/>Besides, the winter is at hand, which will render it difficult to convey what we may stand in need of from distant places.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech first turned their thoughts to the domestic evils prevailing in their several states; the indolence of those who remained at home; the envy and misrepresentations to which those who were serving abroad were liable; that a state of freedom was a difficult one in which to procure unanimity; the want of public funds, and people's backwardness to contribute out of their private property.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Their inclinations being thus suddenly changed, they gave full power to the general,

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> to do whatever he judged conducive to the general interest of the Roman people and their allies.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then Quinctius, consulting only his lieutenant-generals and military tribunes, drew up the following conditions on which peace should be made with the tyrant:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>That there should be a suspension of arms for six months, between Nabis on one part, and the Romans, king Eumenes, and the Rhodians on the other. That Titus Quinctius and Nabis should immediately send ambassadors to Rome, in order that the peace might be ratified by authority of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That, whatever day a written copy of these conditions should be delivered to Nabis, on that day should the armistice commence; and, within ten days after, his garrisons should be withdrawn from Argos, and all other towns in the territory of the Argives; all which towns should be entirely evacuated, restored to freedom, and delivered to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That no slave, whether belonging to the king, the public, or a private person, be removed out of any of them; and if any had been removed before, that they be faithfully restored to their owners.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That he should return the ships, which he had taken from the maritime states; and should not have any other than two barks; and these to be navigated with no more than sixteen oars.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That he should restore to all the states in alliance with the Roman people, the prisoners and deserters in his hands; and to the Messenians, all the effects that could be discovered, and which their possessors could own.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That he should, likewise, restore to the exiled Lacedaemonians their children, and their wives, who chose to follow their husbands; provided that no woman should be obliged, against her will, to go with her husband into exile.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That such of the mercenary soldiers of Nabis as had deserted him, and gone either to their own <pb id="p.1528" n="1528"/>countries or to the Romans, should have all their effects faithfully returned to them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That he should hold possession of no city in the island of Crete; and that such as were then in his possession should be given up to the Romans. That he should not form any alliance, or wage war, with any of the Cretan states, or with any other.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That he should withdraw all his garrisons from those cities, which he should give up, and which had put themselves, and their country, under the dominion and protection of the Roman people; and should take care that, in future, he should restrain both himself and his subjects from molesting them.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That he should not build any town or fort in his own, or any other territory. That, to secure the performance of these conditions, he should give five hostages, such as the Roman general should choose, and among them his own son: and should pay, at present, one hundred talents of silver; and fifty talents, annually, for eight years.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These articles were put into writing, and sent into Lacedaemon, the camp having been removed, and brought nearer to the town.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The tyrant saw nothing in them that gave him much satisfaction, excepting that, beyond his hopes, no mention had been made of bringing back the exiles. But what mortified him most of all, was, the depriving him of his shipping, and of the maritime towns: for the sea had been a source of great profit to him; his piratical vessels having continually infested the whole coast from the promontory of Malea.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Besides, he found in the young men of those towns recruits for his army, who made by far the best of his soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Though he discussed those conditions in private with his confidential friends, yet, as the ministers in the courts of kings, faithless in other respects, are particularly so with respect to the concealing of secrets, rumour soon made them all public. The public, in general, expressed not so great a disapprobation of the whole of the terms, as did individuals, of the articles particularly affecting themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Those who had the wives of the exiles in marriage, or had possessed themselves of any of their property, were provoked, as if they were to lose what was their own, and not to make restitution of what belonged to others.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The slaves, who had been set at liberty by the tyrant, perceived plainly, not only that their enfranchisement would be annulled, but that their servitude <pb id="p.1529" n="1529"/>would be much more severe than it had been before, when they should be again put under the power of their incensed masters.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The mercenary soldiers were dissatisfied, because, in consequence of a peace, their pay would cease; and they knew also, that they could not return among their own countrymen, who detested not tyrants more than they did their abettors.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They at first spoke of these matters, in their circles, with murmurs of discontent; and afterwards, suddenly ran to arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From which tumultuous proceeding, the tyrant perceived that the passions of the multitude were of themselves sufficiently inflamed, and immediately ordered a general assembly to be summoned.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here he explained to them the terms which the Romans strove to impose, to which he falsely added others, more severe and humiliating. While, on the mention of each particular, sometimes the whole assembly, sometimes different parties, raised a shout of disapprobation, he asked them, <quote>What answer they wished him to give; or what they would have him do?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On which all, as it were with one voice, cried out, <quote>To give no answer, to continue the war;</quote> and they began, as is common with a multitude, every one to encourage the rest, to keep up their spirits, and cherish good hopes, observing, that <quote>fortune favours the brave.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Animated by these expressions, the tyrant assured them, that Antiochus, and the Aetolians, would come to their assistance; and that he had, in the mean time, resources abundantly sufficient for the maintenance of a siege.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The very mention of peace had vanished from the minds of all, and unable to contain themselves longer in quiet, they ran out in parties against the advanced guards of the enemy. The sally of these few skirmishers, and the weapons which they threw, immediately removed all doubt from the Romans that the war was to continue.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During the four following days, several slight encounters took place, at first without any decisive result; but, on the fifth day after, in a kind of regular engagement, the Lacedaemonians were

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> beaten back into the town, in such a panic, that several Roman soldiers, pressing close on the rear of the fugitives, entered the city through open spaces, not secured with a wall, of which, at that time, there were several.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then Quinctius, having, by this repulse, effectually checked the sallies of the enemy, and being fully convinced <pb id="p.1530" n="1530"/>that he had now no alternative, but must besiege the city, sent persons to bring up all the marine forces from Gythium; and, in the mean time, rode himself, with some military tribunes, round the walls, to take a view of the situation of the place.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In former times, Sparta had no wall; of late, the tyrants had built walls in the places where the ground was open and level; but the higher places, and those more difficult of access, they secured by placing guards of soldiers instead of fortifications.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had sufficiently examined every circumstance, having resolved on making a general assault, he surrounded the city with all his forces, the number of which, Romans and allies, horse and foot, naval and land forces, all together, amounted to fifty thousand men.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some brought scaling-ladders, some fire-brands, some other matters, wherewith they might not only assail the enemy, but strike terror. The orders were, that on raising the shout, all should advance at once, in order that the Lacedaemonians, being alarmed at the same time in every quarter, might be at a loss where, first, to make head, or whither to bring aid.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The main force of his army he formed in three divisions, and ordered one to attack on the side of the Ph&oelig;beum, another on that of the Dictynneum, and the third near a place called Heptagoniae, all which are open places without walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Though surrounded on all sides by such a violent alarm, the tyrant, at first, attentive to every sudden shout and hasty message, either ran up himself, or sent others, wherever the greatest danger pressed;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but, afterwards, he was so stunned by the horror and confusion that prevailed all around, as to become incapable either of giving proper directions, or of hearing what was said, and to lose, not only his judgment, but almost his reason.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For some time the Lacedaemonians maintained their ground against the Romans, in the narrow passes; and three armies, on each side, fought, at one time, in different places.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Afterwards, when the heat of the contest increased, the contest was, by no means, an equal one: for the Lacedaemonians fought with missile arms, against which the Roman soldiers, by means of their large shields, easily defended themselves, and many of their blows either missed, or were very weak;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for, the narrowness of the place causing them to be closely crowded together, they neither had room to discharge their weapons with a previous run, which gives great force to them, nor clear and steady footing while they made their throw <pb id="p.1531" n="1531"/>Of those, therefore, discharged against the

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> front of the Romans, none pierced their bodies, few even their shields; but several were wounded by those who surrounded them from higher places.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And presently, when they advanced a little, they were hurt unawares, both with javelins, and tiles also thrown from the tops of the houses.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On this they raised their shields over their heads; and joining them so close together as to leave no room for injury from such random casts, or even for the insertion of a javelin, by a hand within reach, they pressed forward under cover of this tortoise fence.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For some time the narrow streets, being thronged with a multitude of their own soldiers, and also of the enemy, considerably retarded the progress of the Romans; but when once, by gradually pushing back the enemy, they gained the wider streets of the city, the impetuosity of their attack could no longer be withstood.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While the Lacedaemonians, having turned their backs, fled precipitately to the higher places, Nabis, being utterly confounded, as if the town were already taken, began to look about for a way to make his escape.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pythagoras, while in other respects he displayed the spirit and conduct of a general, was now the sole means of saving the city from being taken.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For he ordered the buildings nearest to the wall to be set on fire; and these being instantly in a blaze, those who, on another occasion, would have brought help to extinguish the fire, now helping to increase it, the roofs tumbled on the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and not only fragments of the tiles, but also the half-burned timber, reached the soldiers: the flames spread wide, and the smoke caused a degree of terror even greater than the danger.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In consequence, the Romans who were without the city, and were just then making the principal attack, retired from the wall; and those who were within, fearing lest the fire, rising behind them, should put it out of their power to rejoin the rest of the army, began to retreat. Whereupon Quinctius, seeing how matters stood, ordered a general retreat to be sounded.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash;Thus, being at length recalled from a city which they had nearly taken, they returned to their camp.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius, conceiving greater hopes from the fears of the enemy than from the immediate effect of his operations, kept them in a continual alarm during the three succeeding days; sometimes harassing them with assaults, sometimes <pb id="p.1532" n="1532"/>enclosing several places with works, so as to leave no passage open for flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These menaces had such an effect on the tyrant that he again sent Pythagoras to solicit peace. Quinctius, at first, rejected him with disdain, ordering him to quit the camp; but afterwards, on his suppliant entreaties, and throwing himself at his feet, he admitted him to an audience.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The purport of his discourse, at first, was, an offer of implicit submission to the will of the Romans; but this availed nothing, being considered as nugatory and indecisive.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The business was, at length, brought to this issue, that a truce should be made on the conditions delivered in writing a few days before, and the money and hostages were accordingly received.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While the tyrant was kept shut up by the siege, the Argives, receiving frequent accounts, one after another, that Lacedaemon was on the point of being taken, and having themselves resumed courage on the departure of Pythagoras, with the strongest part of his garrison, looked now with contempt on the small number remaining in the citadel;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and, being headed by a person named Archippus, drove the garrison out. They gave Timocrates, of Pellene, leave to retire, with solemn assurance of sparing his life, in consideration of' the mildness which he had shown in his government.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the midst of this rejoicing, Quinctius arrived, after having granted peace to the tyrant, dismissed Eumenes and the Rhodians from Lacedaemon, and sent back his brother, Lucius Quinctius, to the fleet.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Nemaean games, the most celebrated of all the festivals, and their most splendid public spectacle, had been omitted, at the regular time, on account of the disasters of the war: the state now, in the fulness of their joy, ordered them to be celebrated on the arrival of the Roman general and his army;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and appointed the general, himself, president of the games. There were many circumstances which heightened their happiness:

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> their countrymen, whom Pythagoras, lately, and, before that, Nabis, had carried away, were brought home from Lacedaemon; those who on the discovery of the conspiracy by Pythagoras, and when the massacre was already begun, had fled from home, now returned; they saw their liberty restored, after a long interval, and beheld, in their city, the Romans, the authors of its restoration, whose only view, in making war on the tyrant, was the sup- <pb id="p.1533" n="1533"/>port of their interest.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The freedom of the Argives was, also, solemnly announced, by the voice of a herald, on the very day of the Nemaean games. Whatever pleasure the Achaeans felt on Argos being reinstated in the general council of Achaia, it was, in a great measure, alloyed by Lacedaemon being left in slavery, and the tyrant close at their side.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As to the Aetolians, they loudly railed at that measure in every meeting. They remarked, that <quote>the war with Philip was not ended until he evacuated all the cities of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But Lacedaemon was left to the tyrant, while the lawful king, who had been, at the time, in the Roman camp, and others, the noblest of the citizens, must live in exile:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> so that the Roman nation was become a partisan of Nabis in his tyranny.</quote> Quinctius led back his army to Elatia, whence he had set out to the Spartan war.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Some writers say, that the tyrant's method of carrying on hostilities was not by sallies from the city, but that he encamped in the face of the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and that, after he had declined fighting a long time, waiting for succours from the Aetolians, he was forced to come to an engagement, by an attack which the Romans made on his foragers, when, being defeated in that battle,

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> and beaten out of his camp, he sued for peace, after fifteen thousand of his men had been killed, and more than four thousand made prisoners.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nearly at the same time, arrived at Rome a letter from Titus Quinctius, with an account of his proceedings at Lacedaemon; and another, out of Spain, from Marcus Porcius, the consul; whereupon the senate decreed a supplication, for three days, in the name of each.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The other consul, Lucius Valerius, as his province had remained quiet since the defeat of the Boians at the wood of Litana, came home to Rome to hold the elections.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, a second time, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus, were elected consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The fathers of these two had been consuls in the first year of the second Punic war. The election of praetors was then held, and the choice fell on Publius Cornelius Scipio, two Cneius Corneliuses, Merenda and Blasio, Cneius Domitius Aenobarbus, Sextus Digitius, and Titus Juvencius Thalna. As soon as the elections were finished, the consul returned to his province.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The inhabitants of Ferentinum, this year, laid claim to a privilege unheard of before; that Latins, giving in their names for a Roman colony, should be <pb id="p.1534" n="1534"/>deemed citizens of Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Some colonists, who had given in their names for Puteoli, Salernum, and Buxentum, assumed, on that ground, the character of Roman citizens; but the senate determined that they were not.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the year, wherein Publius Scipio Africanus, a second time, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus were consuls, two ambassadors from the tyrant Nabis came to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate gave them audience in the temple of Apollo, outside the city. They entreated that a peace might be concluded on the terms settled with Quinctius, and obtained their request.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the question was put concerning the provinces, the majority of the senate were of opinion, that, as the wars in Spain and Macedonia were at an end, Italy should be the province of both the consuls; but Scipio contended that one consul was sufficient for Italy, and that Macedonia ought to be decreed to the other;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that <quote>there was every reason to apprehend a dangerous war with Antiochus, for he had already, of his own accord, come into Europe;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and how did they suppose he would act in future, when he should be encouraged to a war, on one hand, by the Aetolians, avowed enemies of their state, and stimulated, on the other, by Hannibal, a general famous for his victories over the Romans?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While the consular provinces were in dispute, the praetors cast lots for theirs. The city jurisdiction fell to Cneius Domitius; the foreign, to Titus Juvencius: Farther Spain, to Publius Cornelius; Hither Spain, to Sextus Digitius; Sicily, to Cneius Cornelius Blasio; Sardinia, to Cneius Cornelius Merenda.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was resolved, that no new army should be sent into Macedonia, but that the one which was there should be brought home to Italy by Quinctius, and disbanded;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that the army which was in Spain, under Marcus Porcius Cato, should likewise be disbanded; that Italy should be the province of both the consuls, and that they should raise two city legions;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> so that, after the disbanding of the armies, mentioned in the resolution of the senate, there should be in all eight Roman legions.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A sacred spring had been celebrated, in the preceding year, during the consulate of Marcus Porcius and Lucius Valerius; but Publius Licinius, one of the pontiffs, having made a report, first, to the college of pontiffs, and afterwards.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> under the sanction of the college, to the senate. that it had not <pb id="p.1535" n="1535"/>been duly performed, they resolved, that it should be celebrated anew, under the direction of the pontiffs; and that the great games, vowed together with it, should be exhibited at the same expense which was customary;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that the sacred spring should be deemed to comprehend all the cattle born between the calends of March and the day preceding the calends of May, in the year of the consulate of Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempronius Longus.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then followed the election of censors. Sextus Aelius Paetus, and Caius Cornelius Cethegus, being created censors, named as prince of the senate the consul Publius Scipio, whom the former censors likewise had appointed. They passed by only three senators in the whole, none of whom had enjoyed the honour of a curule office.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They obtained, on another account, the highest degree of credit with that body; for, at the celebration of the Roman games, they ordered the curule aediles to set apart places for the senators, distinct from those of the people, whereas, hitherto, all the spectators used to sit promiscuously. Of the knights, also, very few were deprived of their horses; nor was severity shown towards any rank of men. The gallery of the temple of Liberty, and the Villa Publica, were repaired and enlarged by the same censors.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The sacred spring, and the votive games, were celebrated, pursuant to the vow of Servius Sulpicius Galba, when consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While every one's thoughts were engaged by the shows then exhibited, Quintus Pleminius, who, for the many crimes against gods and men committed by him at Locri, had been thrown into prison, procured men who were to set fire by night to several parts of the city at once, in order that, while the town was thrown into consternation by this nocturnal disturbance, the prison might be broken open.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But this plot was disclosed by some of the accomplices, and the affair was laid before the senate. Pleminius was thrown into a lower dungeon, and there put to death.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this year colonies of Roman citizens were settled at Puteoli, Vulturnum, and Liternum; three hundred men in each place.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Colonies of Roman citizens were likewise established at Salernum and Buxentum. The lands allotted to them had formerly belonged to the Campanians. Tiberius Sempronius Longus, who was then consul, Marcus Servilius, and Quintus Minucius Thermus, were the triumviri who <pb id="p.1536" n="1536"/>settled the colony.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Other commissioners also, Decius Junius Brutus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, and Marcus Helvius, led a colony of Roman citizens to Sipontum, into a district which had belonged to the Arpinians. To Tempsa, likewise, and to Croto, colonies of Roman citizens were led out.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The lands of Tempsa had been taken from the Bruttians, who had formerly expelled the Greeks from them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Croto was possessed by Greeks. In ordering these establishments, there were named, for Croto, &mdash;Cneius Octavius, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, and Caius Pletorius; for Tempsa, &mdash;Lucius Cornelius Merula, and Caius Salonius. Several prodigies were observed at Rome that year, and others reported, from other places.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the forum, comitium, and Capitol, drops of blood were seen, and several showers of earth fell, and the head of Vulcan was surrounded with a blaze of fire.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was reported, that a stream of milk ran in the river at Interamna; that, in some reputable families at Ariminum, children were born without eyes and nose; and one, in the territory of Picenum, that had neither hands nor feet.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These prodigies were expiated according to an order of the pontiffs; and the nine days' festival was celebrated, because the Hadrians had sent intelligence that a shower of stones had fallen in their fields.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Gaul, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, proconsul, in a pitched battle near Mediolanum, completely overthrew the Insubrian Gauls, and the Boians; who, under the command of Dorulacus, had crossed the Po, to rouse the Insubrians to arms. Ten thousand of the enemy were slain.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About this time his colleague, Marcus Porcius Cato, triumphed over Spain. He carried in the procession twenty-five thousand pounds' weight of unwrought silver, one hundred and three thousand silver denarii,<note>3971<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 17<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> five hundred and forty of Oscan silver,<note>17<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 8<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 9<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> and one thousand four hundred pounds' weight of gold. Out of the booty, he distributed to each of his soldiers two hundred and seventy <hi rend="italics">asses;</hi><note>17<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 5 1/2 <hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> and three times that amount to each horseman.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Tiberius Sempronius, consul, proceeding to his province, led his legions, first, into the territory of the Boians.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At this time Boiorix their chieftain, with his two brothers, after having drawn out the whole nation into the field to renew the war, pitched his camp in the open country, that it might be evident that he was prepared to fight in <pb id="p.1537" n="1537"/>case the enemy should pass the frontiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the consul understood what a numerous force and what a degree of resolution the enemy had, he sent an express to his colleague, requesting him, <quote>if he thought proper, to hasten to join him;</quote> adding, that <quote>he would act on the defensive, and defer engaging in battle, until his arrival.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The same reason which made the consul wish to decline an action, induced the Gauls, whose spirits were raised by the backwardness of their antagonists, to bring it on as soon as possible, that they might finish the affair before the two consuls should unite their forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> However, during two days, they did nothing more than stand in readiness for battle, if any should come out against them. On the third, they advanced furiously to the rampart, and assaulted the camp on every side at once.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul immediately ordered his men to take arms, and kept them quiet, under arms, for some time; both to add to the foolish confidence of the enemy, and to arrange his troops at the gates, through which each party was to sally out.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The two legions were ordered to march by the two principal gates; but, in the very pass of the gates, the Gauls opposed them in such close bodies as to stop up the way.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The fight was maintained a long time in these narrow passes; nor were their hands or swords much employed in the business, but pushing with their shields and bodies, they pressed against each other, the Romans struggling to force their

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> standards beyond the gates, the Gauls, to break into the camp, or, at least, to hinder the Romans from issuing forth.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> However, neither party could make the least impression on the other, until Quintus Victorius, a first centurion, and Caius Atinius, a military tribune, the former of the second, the latter of the fourth legion, had taken a course often tried in desperate conflicts; snatching the standards from the officers who carried them, and throwing them among the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In the struggle to recover the standards, the men of the second legion first made their way out of the gate.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These were now fighting on the outside of the rampart, the fourth legion still entangled in the gate, when a new alarm arose on the opposite side of the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Gauls had broke in by the Quaestorian gate, and had slain the quaestor, Lucius Postumius, surnamed Tympanus, with Marcus Atinius and Publius Sempronius, praefects of the allies, <pb id="p.1538" n="1538"/>who made an obstinate resistance; and also, near two hundred soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The camp in that part had been taken, when a cohort of those who are called Extraordinaries, having been sent by the consul to defend the Quaestorian gate, killed some who had got within the rampart, drove out the rest, and opposed others who were attempting to break in.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> About the same time, the fourth legion, and two cohorts of Extraordinaries, burst out of the gate; and thus there were three battles, in different places, round the camp; while the various kinds of shouts raised by them, called off the attention of the combatants from their own immediate conflict to the uncertain casualties which threatened their friends. The battle was maintained until mid-day with equal strength, and with nearly equal hopes.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At length, the fatigue and heat so far got the better of the soft relaxed bodies of the Gauls, who are incapable of enduring thirst, as to make most of them give up the fight; and the few who stood their ground, were attacked by the Romans, routed, and driven to their camp. The consul then gave the signal for retreat, on which the greater part retired; but some, eager to continue the fight, and hoping to get possession of the camp, pressed forward to the rampart, on which the Gauls, despising their small number, rushed out in a body.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans were then routed in turn, and compelled, by their own fear and dismay, to retreat to their camp, which they had refused to do at the command of their general.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus now flight and now victory alternated on both sides. The Gauls, however, had eleven thousand killed, the Romans but five thousand. The Gauls retreated into the heart of their country, and the consul led his legions to Placentia.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Some writers say, that Scipio, after joining his forces to those of his colleague, overran and plundered the country of the Boians and Ligurians, as far as the woods and marshes suffered him to proceed; others, that, without having effected any thing material, he returned to Rome to hold the elections.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>









<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Titus Quinctius passed the entire winter season of this year at Elatia, where he had established the winter quarters of his army, in adjusting political arrangements, and reversing the measures which had been introduced in the several states under the arbitrary domination of Philip and his deputies, who crushed the rights and liberties of <pb id="p.1539" n="1539"/>others, in order to augment the power of those who formed a faction in their favour.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Early in the spring he came to Corinth, where he had summoned a general convention. Ambassadors having attended from every one of the states, so as to form a numerous assembly, he addressed them in a long speech, in which, beginning from the first commencement of friendship between the Romans and the nation of the Greeks, he enumerated the proceedings of the commanders who had been in Macedonia before him, and likewise his own.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His whole narration was heard with the warmest approbation, except when he came to make mention of Nabis; and then they expressed their opinion, that it was utterly inconsistent with the character of the deliverer of Greece to have left seated, in the centre of one of its most respectable states, a tyrant, who was not only insupportable to his own country, but a terror to all the states in his neighbourhood.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whereupon Quinctius, not unacquainted with this tendency of their feelings, freely acknowledged, that <quote>if the business could have been accomplished without the entire destruction of Lacedaemon, no mention of pence with the tyrant ought ever to have been listened to;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but that, when it was not possible to crush him otherwise than by the utter ruin of this most important city, it was judged more eligible to leave the tyrant in a state of debility, stripped of almost every kind of power to do injury to any, than to suffer the city, which must have perished in the very process

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> of its delivery being effectuated, to sink under remedies too violent for it to support.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To the recital of matters past, he subjoined, that <quote>his intention was to depart shortly for Italy, and to carry with him all his troops;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that they should hear, within ten days, of the garrisons having evacuated Demetrias; and that Chalcis, the citadel of Corinth, should be before their own eyes evacuated to the Achaeans:

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that all the world might know whose habit it was to deceive, that of the Romans or the Aetolians, who had spread insinuations, that the cause of liberty had been unwisely intrusted to the Romans, and that they had only received as

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> their masters the Romans in exchange for the Macedonians. But they were men who never scrupled what they either said or did.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The rest of the nations he advised to form their estimate of friends from deeds, not from words; and to satisfy themselves whom they ought to trust, and <pb id="p.1540" n="1540"/>against whom they ought to be on their guard;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> to use their liberty with moderation: for, when regulated by prudence, it was productive of happiness both to individuals and to states;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but, when pushed to excess, it became not only obnoxious to others, but to the possessors of it themselves an unbridled and headstrong impulse.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He recommended, that those at the head of affairs, and all the several ranks of men in each particular state, should cultivate harmony between themselves; and that all should direct their views to the general interest of the whole.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For, while they acted in concert, no king or tyrant would be sufficiently powerful against them: but discord and dissension gave every advantage to those who might plot against them; as the party worsted in a domestic dispute generally join themselves with foreigners, rather than submit to a countryman of their own.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then exhorted them, as the arms of others had procured their liberty, and the good faith of foreigners had restored it to them, to apply now their own diligent care to the watching and guarding of it;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that the Roman people might perceive that those on whom they had bestowed liberty were deserving of it, and that their kindness had not been ill placed.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On hearing these admonitions, such as parental tenderness might dictate, every one present shed tears of joy;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and they affected his feelings to such a degree as to interrupt his discourse.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For some time a confused noise prevailed, from those who were expressing their approbation of his words, and charging each other to treasure up those expressions in their minds and hearts, as if they had been uttered by an oracle.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then silence ensuing, he requested of them to make diligent search for such Roman citizens as were in servitude among them, and to send them into Thessaly to him, within two months;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> observing, that <quote>it would not be honourable to themselves, that, in a land restored to liberty, its deliverers should remain in servitude.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To this all exclaimed with acclamations that they returned him thanks on this account in addition to others, that they had been reminded of the discharge of a duty so indispensably incumbent on their gratitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was a vast number of these who had been made

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> prisoners in the Punic war, and sold by Hannibal when their countrymen refused to ransom them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That they were very numerous, is proved by what Polybius says, that this <pb id="p.1541" n="1541"/>business cost the Achaeans

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> one hundred talents,<note>19,375<hi rend="italics">l.</hi></note> though they had fixed the price to be paid for each captive, to the owner, so low as five hundred denarii.<note>16<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 11<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For, at that rate, there were one thousand two hundred in Achaia. Calculate now, in proportion to this, how many were probably in all Greece.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the convention broke up, they saw the garrison march down from the citadel of Corinth, proceed forward to the gate, and depart. The general followed them, accompanied by the whole assembly, who, with loud acclamations, blessed him as their preserver and deliverer.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length, taking leave of these, and dismissing them, he returned to Elatia by the same road through which he came. He thence sent Appius Claudius, lieutenant-general, with all the troops, ordering him to march through Thessaly and Epirus, and to wait

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> for him at Oricum, whence he intended to embark the army for Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He also wrote to his brother, Lucius Quinctius, lieutenant-general, and commander of the fleet, to collect thither transport ships from all the coasts of Greece. He himself proceeded to Chalcis; and, after sending away the garrisons, not only from that city, but likewise from Oreum and Eretria, he held there a congress of the Eub&oelig;an states, whom he reminded of the condition in which he had found their affairs, and of that in which he was leaving them; and then dismissed the assembly.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then proceeded to Demetrias, and removed the garrison. Accompanied by all the citizens, as at Corinth and Chalcis, he pursued his route into Thessaly, where the states were not only to be set at liberty, but also to be reduced from a state of utter anarchy and confusion into some tolerable order; for they had been thrown into confusion, not only through the faults of the times, and the violence and licentiousness of royalty, but also through the restless disposition of the nation, who, from the earliest times, even to our days, have never conducted any election, or assembly, or council, without dissensions and tumult.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He chose both senators and judges, with regard, principally, to their property, and made that party the most powerful in the state to whom it was most important that all things should be tranquil and secure.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had completed these regulations in Thessaly, he went on, through Epirus, to Oricum, whence he intended <pb id="p.1542" n="1542"/>to take his passage.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From Oricum all the troops were transported to Brundusium. From this place to the city, they passed the whole length of Italy, in a manner, like a triumph; the captured effects which they brought with them forming a train as large as that of the troops themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they arrived at Rome, the senate assembled outside the city, to receive from Quinctius a recital of his services; and, with high satisfaction, a well-merited triumph was decreed him.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His triumph lasted three days. On the first day were carried in procession, armour, weapons, brazen and marble statues, of which he had taken greater numbers from Philip than from the states of Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the second, gold and silver wrought, unwrought, and coined. Of unwrought silver, there were eighteen thousand pounds' weight; and of wrought, two hundred and seventy thousand; consisting of many vessels of various sorts, most of them engraved, and several of exquisite workmanship; also a great many others made of brass; and, besides these, ten shields of silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The coined silver amounted to eighty-four thousand of the Attic coin, called Tetradrachmus, containing each of silver about the weight of four denarii.<note>10,849<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 18<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></note>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of gold there were three thousand seven hundred and fourteen pounds, and one shield wholly of gold: and of the gold coin called Philippics, fourteen thousand five hundred and fourteen.<note>936<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></note>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the third day were carried golden crowns, presented by the several states, in number one hundred and fourteen; then the victims.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Before his chariot went many illustrious persons, captives and hostages, among whom were Demetrius, son of king Philip, and Armenes, a Lacedaemonian, son of the tyrant Nabis. Then Quinctius himself rode into the city, followed by a numerous body of soldiers, as the whole army had been brought home from the province.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Among these he distributed two hundred and fifty <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>16<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 1 1/4 <hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> to each footman, double to a centurion, triple to a horseman.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Those who had been redeemed from captivity added to the grandeur of the procession, walking after him with their

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> heads shaven.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the latter part of this year Quintus Aelius Tubero, plebeian tribune, in pursuance of a decree of the senate, proposed to the people, and the people ordered, that <quote>two Latin colonies should be settled, one in Bruttium, the other in the ter- <pb id="p.1543" n="1543"/>ritory of Thurium.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For making these settlements commissioners were appointed, who were to hold the office for three years; for Bruttium, Quintus Naevius, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and Marcus Furius Crassipes; and for the district of Thurium, Cneius Manlius, Quintus Aelius, and Lucius Apustius. The assemblies of election to these two appointments were held in the Capitol by Cneius Domitius, city praetor.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Several temples were dedicated this year: one of Juno Sospita, in the herb market, vowed and contracted for four years before, in the time of the Gallic war, by Cneius Cornelius, consul; and the same person, now censor, performed the dedication.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Another of Faunus, the building of which had been agreed for two years before, and a fund formed for it out of fines estreated by the aediles, Caius Scribonius and Cneius Domitius; the latter of whom, now city praetor, dedicated it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Quintus Marcius Ralla, constituted commissioner for the purpose, dedicated the temple of Fortuna Primigenia, on the Quirinal Hill.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius Sempronius Sophus had vowed this temple ten years before, in the Punic war; and, being afterwards censor, had employed persons to build it.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Caius Servilius, duumvir, also dedicated a temple of Jupiter, in the island. This had been vowed in the Gallic war, six years before, by Lucius Furius Purpureo, who afterwards, when consul, contracted for the building. &mdash;Such were the transactions of that year.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Scipio came home from his province of Gaul to choose new consuls. The consular comitia were accordingly held, in which Lucius Cornelius Merula and Quintus Minucius Thermus were chosen.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next day were chosen praetors, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, Caius Scribonius, Marcus Valerius Messala, Lucius Porcius Licinus, and Caius Flaminius. The curule aediles of this year, Caius Atilius Serranus and Lucius Scribonius, first exhibited the Megalesian theatrical games.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the Roman games, celebrated by these aediles, the senators, for the first time, sat separate from the people, which, as every innovation usually does, gave occasion to various observations.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some considered this as <quote>an honour, shown at length to that most respectable body, and which ought to have been done long before;</quote> while others contended, that <quote>every addition made to the grandeur of the senate was a diminution of the dignity of the people;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.1544" n="1544"/>and that all such distinctions as set the orders of the state at a distance from each other, were equally subversive of liberty and concord.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During five hundred and fifty-eight years,</quote> they asserted, <quote>all the spectators had sat promiscuously: what reason then had now occurred, on a sudden, that should make the senators disdain to have the commons intermixed with them in the theatre, or make the rich disdain the poor man as a fellow-spectator?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was an unprecedented gratification of pride and over-bearing vanity, never even desired, and never instituted, by the senate of any other nation.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is said, that even Africanus himself at last became sorry for having proposed that matter in his consulship: so difficult is it to bring people to approve of any alteration of ancient customs; they are always naturally disposed to adhere to old practices, except those which experience evidently condemns.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the year, which was the consulate of Lucius Cornelius and Quintus Minucius, such frequent reports of earthquakes were brought, that people grew weary, not only of the matter itself, but of the religious rites enjoined in consequence;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for neither could the senate be convened, nor the business of the public be transacted, the consuls were so constantly employed in sacrifices and expiations.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At last, the decemvirs were ordered to consult the books; and, in pursuance of their answer, a supplication was performed during three days.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> People offered prayers at all the shrines, with garlands on their heads; and an order was published, that all the persons belonging to one family should pay their worship together;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and the consuls, by direction of the senate, published an edict, that, on any day whereon religious rites should be ordered, in consequence of the report of an earthquake, no person should report another earthquake on that day.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the consuls first, and afterwards the praetors, cast lots for their provinces. Cornelius obtained Gaul; Minucius, Liguria; Caius Scribonius, the city jurisdiction; Marcus Valerius, the foreign; Lucius Cornelius, Sicily; Lucius Porcius, Sardinia; Caius Flaminius, Hither Spain; and Marcus Fulvius, Farther Spain.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consuls supposed that, for that year, they should have

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> no employment of a military kind, a letter was brought from Marcus Cincius, who was commander at Pisae, announcing, that <quote>twenty thousand armed Ligurians, in con- <pb id="p.1545" n="1545"/>sequence of a conspiracy of that whole nation, formed in the meetings of their several districts, had first wasted the lands of Luna, and then, passing through the territory of Pisae, had overrun the whole sea-coast.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In consequence of this intelligence, the consul Minucius, whose province Liguria was, by direction of the senate,

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> mounted the rostrum, and published orders, that <quote>the two legions, enlisted the year before, should, on the tenth day from that, attend him at Arretium;</quote> and mentioned his intention of levying two legions for the city in their stead.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He likewise gave notice to the magistrates and ambassadors of such of the allies, and of the Latin confederates, as were bound to furnish soldiers, to attend him in the Capitol.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Of these he wrote out a list, amounting to fifteen thousand foot and five hundred horse, proportioning the contingent of

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> each state to the number of its young men, and ordered those present to go directly from the spot to the gate of the city; and, in order to expedite the business, to proceed to raise the men.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To Fulvius and Flaminius were assigned, to each three thousand Roman foot, and a reinforcement of one hundred horse, with five thousand foot of the Latin allies, and two hundred horse; and orders were given to those praetors, to disband the old troops immediately on their arrival in their provinces.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Although great numbers of the soldiers belonging to the city legions had made application to the plebeian tribunes, to take cognizance of the cases of such men as claimed exemption from the service, on account either of having served out their time, or of bad health; yet a letter from Tiberius Sempronius banished all thoughts of such proceeding;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for in this it was announced that <quote>fifteen thousand of the Ligurians had come into the lands of Placentia, and wasted them with fire and sword, to the very walls of that city and the bank of the Po; and that the Boian nation were looking out for an occasion to rebel.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In consequence of this information, the senate passed a vote, that <quote>there was a Gallic tumult subsisting, and that it would be improper for the plebeian tribunes to take cognizance of the claims of the soldiers, so as to prevent their attending, pursuant to the proclamation;</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and they added an order, that the Latin confederates, who had served in the army of Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius, and had been discharged by those consuls, should re-assemble, on whatever day and in whatever <pb id="p.1546" n="1546"/>place of Etruria the consul Lucius Cornelius should appoint;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and that the consul Lucius Cornelius, on his way to his province, should enlist, arm, and carry with him all such persons as he should think fit, in the several towns and countries through which he was to pass, and should have authority to discharge such of them, and at such times, as he might judge proper.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the consuls had finished the levies, and were gone to their provinces, Titus Quinctius demanded, that <quote>the senate should receive an account of the regulations which he, in concert with the ten ambassadors, had settled; and, if they thought proper, ratify them by their authority.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He told them, that <quote>they would accomplish this the more easily, if they were first to give audience to the ambassadors, who had come from all parts of Greece, and a great part of Asia, and to those from the two kings.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These embassies were introduced to the senate by the city praetor, Caius Scribonius, and all received kind answers.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As the discussion of the affair with Antiochus required too much time, it was referred to the ten ambassadors, some of whom had conferred with the king in Asia, or at Lysimachia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Directions were given to Titus Quinctius, that, in conjunction with these, he should listen to the representations of the king's ambassadors, and should give them such answer as comported with the dignity and interest of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the head of the embassy were Menippus and Hegesianax; the former of whom said, that <quote>he could not conceive what intricacy there was in the business of their embassy, as they came simply to ask friendship, and conclude an alliance.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Now, there were three kinds of treaties, by which kings and states formed friendships with each other: one, when terms were dictated to a people vanquished in war; for after all their possessions have been surrendered to him who has proved superior in war, he has the sole power of judging and determining what portion of them the vanquished shall hold, and of what they shall be deprived.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The second, when parties, equally matched in war, conclude a treaty of peace and friendship on terms of equality; for then demands are proposed and restitution made, reciprocally, in a convention; and if, in consequence of the war, confusion has arisen with respect to any parts of their properties, the matter is adjusted on the footing either of an- <pb id="p.1547" n="1547"/>cient right or of the mutual convenience of the parties.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The third kind was, when parties who had never been foes, met to form a friendly union by a social treaty: these neither dictate nor receive terms, for that is the case between a victor and a party vanquished.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As Antiochus came under this last description, he wondered, he said, that the Romans should think it becoming to dictate terms to him; as to which of the cities of Asia they chose should be free and independent, which should be tributary, and which of them the king's troops and the king himself should be prohibited to enter.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That a peace of this kind might be ratified with Philip, who was their enemy, but not a treaty of alliance with Antiochus, their friend.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Quinctius answered: <quote>Since you choose to deal methodically, and enumerate the several modes of contracting alliances, I also will lay down two conditions, without which you may tell your king, that there are no means of contracting any friendship with the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One, that, if he does not choose that we should concern ourselves in the affairs of the cities in Asia, he must himself keep entirely out of Europe.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The other, that if he does not confine himself within the limits of Asia, but passes over into Europe, the Romans will think themselves at full liberty to maintain the friendships which they have already formed with the states of Asia, and also to contract new ones.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On this Hegesianax exclaimed, that <quote>this proposition was unworthy to be listened to, as its tendency was to exclude Antiochus from the cities of Thrace and the Chersonese, &mdash;places

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> which his great-grandfather, Seleucus, had acquired with great honour, after vanquishing Lysimachus in war and killing him in battle, and had left to his successors; and part of which, after they had been seized by the Thracians, Antiochus had, with equal honour, recovered by force of arms; as well as others which had been deserted, &mdash;as Lysimachia, for instance, he had repeopled, by calling home the inhabitants; &mdash;and several, which had been destroyed by fire, and buried in ruins, he had rebuilt at a vast expense.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What kind of resemblance was there, then, in the cases of Antiochus being ejected from possessions so acquired and so recovered; and of the Romans refraining from intermeddling with Asia, which had never been theirs?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Antiochus wished to obtain the friendship of the Romans; but <pb id="p.1548" n="1548"/>so that its acquisition would be to his honour, and not to his shame.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In reply to this, Quinctius said, &mdash;<quote>Since we are deliberating on what would be honourable, and which, indeed, with a people who held the first rank among the nations of the world, and with so great a king, ought to be the sole, or at least the primary object of regard;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> tell me, I pray you, which do you think more honourable, to wish to give liberty to all the Grecian cities in every part of the world; or to make them slaves and vassals?

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Since Antiochus thinks it conducive to his glory, to reduce to slavery those cities, which his great-grandfather held by the right of arms, but which his grandfather or father never occupied as their property;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> while the Roman people, having undertaken the patronage of the liberty of the Greeks, deem it incumbent on their faith and constancy not to abandon it.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As they have delivered Greece from Philip, so they have it in contemplation to deliver, from Antiochus, all the states of Asia which are of the Grecian race.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For colonies were not sent into Aeolia and Ionia to be enslaved to kings; but with design to increase the population, and to propagate that ancient race in every part of the globe.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Hegesianax hesitated, and could not deny, that the cause of liberty carried a more honourable semblance than that of slavery, Publius Sulpicius, who was the eldest of the ten ambassadors, said, &mdash;<quote>Let us cut the matter short.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Choose one of the two conditions clearly propounded just now by Quinctius; or deem it superfluous to negotiate about an alliance.</quote> But Menippus replied, <quote>We neither will, nor can, accede to any proposition by which the dominions of Antiochus would be diminished.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Next day, Quinctius brought into the senate-house all the ambassadors of Greece and Asia, in order that they might learn the dispositions entertained by the Roman people, and by Antiochus, towards the Grecian states.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then acquainted them with his own demands, and those of the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and desired them to <quote>assure their respective states, that the same disinterested zeal and courage, which the Roman people had displayed in defence of their liberty against the encroachments of Philip, they would, likewise, exert against those of Antiochus, if he should refuse to retire out of Europe.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On this, Menippus earnestly besought Quinctius and the senate, <quote>not to be hasty in forming their <pb id="p.1549" n="1549"/>determination, which, in its effects, might disturb the peace of the whole world;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to take time to themselves, and allow the king time for consideration; that, when informed of the conditions proposed, he would consider them, and either obtain some relaxation in the terms, or accede to them for the sake of peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly, the business was deferred entire; and a resolution passed, that the same ambassadors should be sent to the king who had attended him at Lysimachia, &mdash;Publius Sulpicius, Publius Villius, and Publius Aelius.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scarcely had these begun their journey, when ambassadors from Carthage brought information, that Antiochus was evidently preparing for war, and that Hannibal was employed in his service; which gave reason to fear, that a Punic war might break out at the same time.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hannibal, on leaving his own country, had gone to Antiochus, as was mentioned before, and was held by the king in high estimation, not so much for his other qualifications, as because, to a person who had long been revolving schemes for a war with Rome, there could not be any fitter participator of his counsels on such a subject.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His opinion was always one and the same, that the war should be carried on in Italy:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> because <quote>Italy would supply a foreign enemy both with men and provisions; but, if it were left in quiet, and the Roman people were allowed to employ the strength and forces of Italy, in making war beyond the limits of that country, no king or nation would be able to cope with them.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He demanded, for himself, one hundred decked ships, ten thousand foot, and one thousand horse. <quote>With this force,</quote> he said, "he would first repair to Africa; and he had confident hopes, that he should be able to prevail on the Carthaginians to revive hostilities. If they should hesitate, he would raise a war against the Romans in some part of Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That the king ought to cross over into Europe with all the rest of his force, and keep his army in some part of Greece; not to pass over immediately into Italy, but to be in readiness to do so; which would sufficiently conduce to the imposing character and the reported magnitude of the war.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had brought the king to agree in his opinion, he judged it necessary to predispose the minds of his countrymen to the same; but he durst not send a letter, lest it might, by some accident, be intercepted, and his plans by that means be discovered.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He had found at Ephesus a Tyrian called <pb id="p.1550" n="1550"/>Aristo, and in several less important commissions, had discovered him to possess a good degree of ingenuity. This man he now loaded with presents and promises of rewards, which were confirmed by the king himself, and sent him to Carthage with messages.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He told him the names of the persons whom it was necessary that he should see, and furnished him with secret tokens, by which they would know, with certainty, that the messages came from him.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On this Aristo's appearing at Carthage, the reason of his coming was not discovered by Hannibal's friends sooner than by his enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first, the subject was bruited about in their circles and at their tables;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and at last some persons declared in the senate, that <quote>the banishment of Hannibal answered no purpose, if, while resident in another country, he was still able to propagate designs for changing the administration, and disturbing the quiet of the state by his intrigues.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That a Tyrian stranger, named Aristo, had come with a commission from Hannibal and king Antiochus; that certain men daily held secret conferences with him, and were concocting that in private, the consequences of which would soon break out, to the ruin of the public.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This produced a general outcry, that <quote>Aristo ought to be summoned, and examined respecting the reason of his coming; and if he did not disclose it, to be sent to Rome, with ambassadors accompanying him: that they had already suffered enough of punishment in atonement of the headstrong rashness of one individual;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that the faults of private citizens should be at their own risk, and the state should be preserved free, not only from guilt, but even from the suspicion of it.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Aristo, being summoned, contended for his innocence; and urged, as his strongest defence, that he had brought no letter to any person whatever:

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but he gave no satisfactory reason for his coming, and was chiefly embarrassed by the fact which they urged, that he had conversed solely with men of the Barcine faction.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A warm debate ensued; some earnestly pressing, that he should be immediately seized as a spy, and kept in custody; while others insisted, that there were not sufficient grounds for such violent measures; that <quote>putting strangers into confinement, without reason, was a step that afforded a bad precedent; for that the same would happen to the Carthaginians at Tyre, and other marts, where they frequently traded.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The question was ad- <pb id="p.1551" n="1551"/>journed on that day.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Aristo practised on the Carthaginians a Carthaginian artifice; for having early in the evening hung up a written tablet, in the most frequented place of the city, over the tribunal where the magistrates daily sat, he went on board his ship at the third watch, and fled. Next day, when the suffetes had taken their seats to administer justice, the tablet was observed, taken down, and read.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Its contents were, that <quote>Aristo came not with a private commission to any person, but with a public one to the elders;</quote> by this name they called the senate. The imputation being thus thrown on the state, less pains were taken in searching into the suspicions harboured of a few individuals:

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> however, it was determined, that ambassadors should be sent to Rome, to represent the affair to the consuls and the senate, and, at the same time, to complain of the injuries received from Masinissa.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Masinissa observed that the Carthaginians were looked on with jealousy by others, and were full of dissensions among themselves;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the nobles being suspected by the senate, on account of their conferences with Aristo, and the senate by the people, in consequence of the information given by the same Aristo, he thought that, at such a conjuncture, he might successfully encroach on their rights; and accordingly he laid waste their country along the sea-coast, and compelled several cities, which were tributary to the Carthaginians, to pay their taxes to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This tract they call Emporiae; it forms the shore of the lesser Syrtis, and has a fertile soil; one of its cities is Leptis, which paid a tribute to the Carthaginians of a talent a day.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At this time, Masinissa not only ravaged that whole tract, but, with respect to a considerable part of it, disputed the right of possession with the Carthaginians;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and when he learned that they were sending to Rome, both to justify their conduct, and, at the same time, to make complaints of him, lie likewise sent ambassadors to Rome, to load them with suspicions, and to discuss the right to the taxes.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Carthaginians were heard first, and their account of the Tyrian stranger gave the senate no small uneasiness, as they dreaded being involved in war with Antiochus and the Carthaginians at the same time. What contributed chiefly to strengthen a suspicion of evil designs, was, that though they had

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> resolved to seize Aristo, and send him to Rome, they had not placed a guard either on himself or his ship. Then be- <pb id="p.1552" n="1552"/>gan the controversy with the king's ambassadors, on the claims of the territory in dispute.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Carthaginians supported their cause by a boundary claim, urging that <quote>it must belong

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> to them, as being within the limits which Scipio, after conquering the country, had fixed as the boundaries which should be under Carthaginian rule;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and also, by the acknowledgment of the king, who, when he was going in pursuit of Aphir, a fugitive from his kingdom, then hovering about Cyrene, with a party of Numidians, had solicited as a favour a passage through that very district, as being confessedly a part of the Carthaginian dominions.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Numidians insisted, <quote>that they were guilty of misrepresentation, with respect to the limits fixed by Scipio; and if a person chose to recur to the real origin of their property, what title had the Carthaginians to call any land in Africa their own: foreigners and strangers, to whom had been granted precariously, for the purpose of building a city, as much ground as they could encompass with the cuttings of a bull's hide?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Whatever acquisitions they had made beyond Byrsa, their original settlement, they held by fraud and violence; for, in relation to the land in question, so far were they from being able to prove uninterrupted possession, from the time when it was first acquired, that they cannot even prove that they ever possessed it for any considerable time.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As occasions offered, sometimes they, sometimes the kings of Numidia, had held the dominion of it; and the possession of it had always been held by the party which had the greatest armed force.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They requested the senate to suffer the matter to remain on the same footing on which it stood before the Carthaginians became enemies to the Romans, or the king of Numidia their friend and ally; and not to interfere, so as to hinder whichever party was able, from keeping possession.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> &mdash;The senate resolved to tell the ambassadors of both parties, that they would send persons into Africa to determine the present controversy between the people of Carthage and the king. They accordingly sent Publius Scipio Africanus, Caius Cornelius Cethegus, and Marcus Minucius Rufus;

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> for, had the case been otherwise, Scipio alone, either from his own knowledge of the business, or the influence which he possessed, and to which he had a just claim on both parties, could, with a nod, have ended the controversy.</p></div1> <div1 type="book" n="35"><head>BOOK XXXV.</head>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the beginning of the same year, Sextus Digitius, praetor in the Hither Spain, fought with those states which, after the departure of Marcus Cato, had, in great numbers, recommenced hostilities, numerous battles, but none deserving of particular mention; and all so unfavourable to him, that he scarcely delivered to his successor half the number of men that he had received.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In consequence of this, every state in Spain would certainly have resumed new courage, had not the other praetor, Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of Cneius, been successful in several engagements on the other side of the Iberus;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and, by these means, diffused such a general terror, that no less than fifty towns came over to his side. These exploits Scipio performed in his praetorship.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Afterwards, when propraetor, as the Lusitanians, after ravaging the farther province, were returning home, with an immense booty, he

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> attacked them on their march, and continued the engagement from the third hour of the day to the eighth, before any advantage was gained on either side. He was inferior to the <pb id="p.1554" n="1554"/>enemy in number of men, but he had the advantage of them in other respects:

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> with his troops formed in a compact body, he attacked a long train, encumbered with multitudes of cattle; and with his soldiers fresh, engaged men, fatigued by a long march; for the enemy had set out at the third watch, and besides travelling the remainder of the night, had continued their route to the third hour of the day;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> nor had they been allowed any rest, as the battle immediately succeeded the toil of the march.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Wherefore, though at the beginning they retained some vigour of body and spirits, and, at first, threw the Romans into disorder, yet, after some time, the fight became equal. In this critical situation the proprietor made a vow to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, in case he should defeat and cut off the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Romans then made a more vigorous push, and the Lusitanians gave way, and, in a little time, turned their backs. As the victors pursued them briskly, no less than twelve thousand of them were slain, and five hundred and forty taken prisoners, most of whom were horsemen.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There were taken, besides, a hundred and thirty-four military standards. Of the Roman army, but seventy-three men were lost. The battle was fought at a small distance from the city of Ilipa.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thither Publius Cornelius led back his victorious army, amply enriched with spoil; all which was exposed to view under the walls of the town, and permission given to the owners to claim their effects.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The remainder was put into the hands of the quaestor to be sold, and the money produced by the sale was distributed among the soldiers.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the time when these occurrences happened in Spain, Caius Flaminius, the praetor, had not yet set out from Rome:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> therefore these events, as well prosperous as adverse, were reported by himself and his friends in the strongest representations;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and he laboured to persuade the senate, that, as a very formidable war had blazed out in his province, and he was likely to receive from Sextus Digitius a very small remnant of an army, and that, too, terrified and disheartened, they ought to decree one of the city legions to him, in order that, when lie should have united to it

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the soldiers levied by himself, pursuant to the decree of the senate, he might select from the whole number six thousand five hundred foot and three hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He said, that <quote>with such a legion as that, (for very little confidence could be placed on the troops <pb id="p.1555" n="1555"/>of Sextus Digitius,) he would conduct the war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the elder part of the senate insisted, that <quote>decrees of the senate were not to be passed in consequence of rumours fabricated by private persons for the gratification of magistrates; and that no intelligence should be deemed authentic except it were either written by the praetors, from their provinces, or brought by their deputies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If there was a tumultuous commotion in Spain, they advised a vote, that tumultuary soldiers should be levied by the praetor in some other country than Italy.</quote> The senate's intention was that such description of men should be raised in Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Valerius Antias says, that Caius Flaminius sailed to Sicily for the purpose of levying troops, and that, on his voyage thence to Spain, being driven by a storm to Africa, he enlisted there many stragglers who had belonged to the army of Publius Africanus;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and that, to the levies made in those two provinces, he added a third in Spain.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Italy the war, commenced by the Ligurians, grew daily more formidable. They now invested Pisae, with an army of forty thousand men; for multitudes flocked to them continually, led by the reports of the war and the expectation of booty. The consul, Minucius, came to Arretium, on the day which he had fixed for the assembling of the troops.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thence he led them, in order of battle, towards Pisae; and though the enemy had removed their camp to the other side of the river at a distance of no more than three miles from the place, the consul marched into the city, which evidently owed its preservation to his coming.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Next day he also encamped on the other side of the river, about a mile from the enemy; and by slight skirmishes protected the lands of the allies from their depredations.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He did not think it prudent to hazard a general engagement, because his troops were raw, composed of many different kinds of men, and not yet so well known among themselves that they could rely on one another.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Ligurians depended so much on their numbers, that they not only came out and offered battle, willing to risk every thing on the issue of it; but, from their superfluity of men, they sent out many parties along the frontiers to plunder;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and whenever a large quantity of cattle, and other prey, was collected, there was an escort always in readiness to convey it into their forts and towns. <pb id="p.1556" n="1556"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the operations remained at a stand at Pisae, the other consul, Lucius Cornelius Merula, led his army through the extreme borders of the Ligurians, into the territory of the Boians, where the mode of proceeding was quite the reverse of that which took place in the war of Liguria.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul took the field; the enemy refused to fight; and the Romans, when no one would come out against them, went out in parties to plunder, while the Boians chose to let their country be laid waste with impunity rather than venture an engagement in defence of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When all places were completely ravaged with fire and sword, the consul quitted the enemy's lands, and marched towards Mutina, in a careless manner, as through a pacific population.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Boians, when they learned that the enemy had withdrawn beyond their frontiers, followed him as secretly as possible, watching an opportunity for an ambuscade; and, having gone by his camp in the night, took possession of a defile through which the Romans were to pass.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But as they were not able to effect this with sufficient secrecy, the consul, who usually began his march late in the night, now waited until day, lest, in the disorderly fight likely to ensue, darkness might increase the confusion; and though he did not stir before it was light, yet he sent forward a troop of horse to explore the country.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When intelligence was brought by them of the number and situation of the enemy, he ordered the baggage to be heaped together in the centre, and the veterans to throw up a rampart round it; and then, with the rest of the army in order of battle, he advanced towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Gauls did the same, when they found that their stratagem was detected, and that they were to engage in a fair and regular battle, where success must depend on valour alone.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The battle began about the second hour. The left brigade of the allies, and the Extraordinaries, fought in the first line, and were commanded by two lieutenant-generals of consular dignity, Marcus Marcellus and Tiberius Sempronius, who had been consul the year before.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The present consul was sometimes employed in the front of the line, sometimes in keeping back the legions in reserve, that they might not, through eagerness for fighting, come up to the attack until the signal was given.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He ordered the two Minucii, Quintus and Publius, military tribunes, to lead off the cavalry of <pb id="p.1557" n="1557"/>the legions into open ground, at some distance from the line; and "when he should give them the signal, to charge the enemy through the clear space.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While he was thus employed, a message came from Tiberius Sempronius Longus, that the Extraordinaries could not support the onset of the Gauls; that great numbers had already fallen; and that partly through weariness, partly through fear, the ardour of the survivors was much abated.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He recommended it therefore to the consul, if he thought proper, to send up one or other of the two legions, before the army suffered disgrace.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The second legion was accordingly sent, and the Extraordinaries were ordered to retire. By the legion coming up, with its men fresh, and the ranks complete in their numbers, the fight was renewed with vigour.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The left wing was withdrawn out of the action, and the right took its place in the van. The intense heat of the sun discomposed the Gauls, whose bodies were very ill qualified to endure it: nevertheless, keeping their ranks close, and leaning sometimes on each other, sometimes on their bucklers, they withstood the attack of the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> which, when the consul observed, in order to break their ranks, he ordered Caius Livius Salinator, commander of the allied cavalry, to charge them at full speed, and the legionary cavalry to remain in reserve.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This tempest of cavalry first confused and disordered, and at length entirely broke the line of the Gauls; yet it did not make them fly.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That was prevented by their officers, who, when they quitted their posts, struck them on the back with their spears, and compelled them to return to their ranks: but the allied cavalry, riding in among them, did not suffer them to recover their order.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consul exhorted his soldiers to <quote>continue their efforts a little longer, for victory was within their reach; to press the enemy, while they saw them disordered and dismayed; for, if they were suffered to recover their ranks, they would enter on a fresh battle with doubtful success.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He ordered the standard-bearers to advance with the standards, and then, all exerting themselves at once, they at length forced the enemy to give way. As soon as they turned their backs, and fled precipitately on every side, the legionary cavalry was sent in pursuit of them.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On that day, fourteen thousand of the Boians were slain; one thousand and ninety-two taken &mdash;as were seven hundred and twenty-one horsemen, and three of their commanders, with <pb id="p.1558" n="1558"/>two hundred and twelve military standards, and sixty-three chariots.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Nor did the Romans gain the victory without loss of blood: of themselves, or their allies, were lost above five thousand men, twenty-three centurions, four praefects of the allies, and two military tribunes of the second legion, Marcus Genucius and Marcus Marcius.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Letters from both the consuls arrived at Rome nearly at the same time. That of Lucius Cornelius gave an account of the battle fought with the Boians at Mutina;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that of Quintus Minucius, from Pisae, mentioned, that <quote>the holding of the elections had fallen to his lot, but that affairs in Liguria were in so uncertain a position, that he could not depart thence without bringing ruin on the allies, and material injury on the commonwealth.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He therefore advised that, if the senate thought proper, they should direct his colleague (as his war was decided) to return to Rome for the elections.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He said, if Cornelius should object to this, because that employment had not fallen to his lot, he would certainly do whatever the senate should order; but he begged them to consider again and again, whether it would not be more to the advantage of the republic, that an interregnum should take place, than that the province should be left by him in such a state.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate gave directions to Caius Scribonius to send two deputies of senatorian rank to the consul, Lucius Cornelius, to communicate to him the letter sent by his colleague to the senate, and to acquaint him, that if he did not come to Rome to elect new magistrates, the senate were resolved, rather than Quintus Minucius should be called away from a war, in which no progress had been made, to suffer an interregnum to take place.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The deputies sent brought back his answer, that he would come to Rome, to elect new magistrates.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The letter of' Lucius Cornelius, which contained an account of the battle with the Boians, occasioned a debate in the senate; for Marcus Claudius, lieutenant-general, in private letters to many of the senators, had written,

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> <quote>that they might thank the fortune of the Roman people, and the bravery of the soldiers, that the affair had been successful.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That the conduct of the consul had been the cause of a great many men being lost, and of the enemy's army, for the annihilation of which an opportunity had been offered, having made its escape. That what made the loss of men the greater was, the reinforcements, <pb id="p.1559" n="1559"/>necessary to support them when distressed, coming up too late from the reserve; and that, what enabled the enemy to slip out of their hands was, the signal being given too tardily to the legionary cavalry, and their not being allowed to pursue the fugitives.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was agreed, that no resolution should be hastily passed on the subject; and the discussion was accordingly adjourned to a fuller meeting.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Another concern also pressed upon them, namely, that the public was heavily distressed by usurious practices;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and although avarice had been restricted by many laws respecting usury, yet a fraudulent course had been adopted &mdash;that of transferring the securities to subjects of some of the allied states, who were not bound by those laws, by which means usurers over-whelmed their debtors by unlimited interest.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On considering of the best method for putting a stop to this evil the senate decreed, that a certain day should be fixed on for it, the next approaching festival of the infernal deities; and that any of the allies who should from that day lend money to the Roman citizens, should register the transaction; and that all proceedings respecting such money, lent after that day, should be regulated by the laws of whichever of the two states the debtor should choose.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In some time after, when the great amount of debt, contracted through this kind of fraud, was discovered

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> by means of the registries, Marcus Sempronius, plebeian tribune, by direction of the senate, proposed to the people, and the people ordered, that the laws relative to money lent between Roman citizens and subjects of any of the allied states, or Latin confederacy, should be the same as those between Roman citizens. Such were the transactions in Italy, civil and military.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In Spain the war was far from being so formidable as the exaggerations of report had represented it.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In Hither Spain, Caius Flaminius took the town of Ilucia, in the country of the Oretanians, and then marched his army into winter quarters. Several engagements took place during the winter, but none deserving of particular mention, directed against incursions of robbers rather than of the enemy; and yet with various success, and not without the loss of some men. More important services were performed by Marcus Fulvius.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He fought a pitched battle near the town of Toletum, against the Vaccaeans, Vectonians, and Celtiberians; routed and dispersed their combined forces, and took prisoner their king, Hilermus. <pb id="p.1560" n="1560"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this passed in Spain, the day of election was drawing near. Lucius Cornelius, therefore, the consul, left Marcus Claudius, lieutenant-general, in command of the army, and came to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After representing in the senate the services which he had performed, and the present state of the province, he expostulated with the conscript fathers on

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> their not having ordered a thanksgiving to the immortal gods, when so great a war was so happily terminated by one successful battle; and then demanded, that they would at the same time decree a supplication and a triumph.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, before the question was put, Quintus Metellus, who had been consul and dictator, said, that, <quote>letters had been brought at the same time from the consul, Lucius Cornelius, to the senate, and from Marcus Marcellus, to a great part of the senators; which letters contradicted each other, and for that reason the consideration of the business had been adjourned, in order that it might be debated when the writers of those letters should be present.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had expected, therefore, that the consul, who knew that the lieutenant-general had written something to his disadvantage, would, when he himself was obliged to come, have brought him with him to Rome; especially, as the command of the army would, with more propriety, have been committed to Tiberius Sempronius, who already possessed authority, than to the lieutenant-general.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As the case stood at present, it appeared as if the latter was kept out of the way designedly, lest he might assert in person the same things which he had written in his letters;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and, face to face, either substantiate his charges, or, if he had alleged any thing untrue, be convicted of misrepresentation, until the truth should be clearly discovered.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For this reason he was of opinion, that the senate should not, at present, assent to either of the decrees demanded by the consul.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he, however, persisted with undiminished energy in putting the question, that a thanksgiving should be ordered, and himself allowed to ride into the city in triumph; the plebeian tribunes, Marcus and Caius Titinius, declared, that they would enter their protest, if the senate passed any decree on the subject.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the preceding year, Sextus Aelius Paetus and Caius Cornelius Cethegus were created censors. Cornelius now closed the lustrum.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The number of citizens rated was a hundred and forty-three thousand seven hundred and four.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Extraordinary quantities of rain fell in this year, and the Ti- <pb id="p.1561" n="1561"/>ber overflowed the lower parts of the city; and some buildings near the Flumentan gate were even laid in ruins. The C&oelig;limontan gate was struck by lightning, as was the wall on each side of it, in several places.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At Aricia, Lanuvium, and on the Aventine, showers of stones fell. From Capua, a report was brought that a very large swarm of wasps flew into the forum, and settled on the temple of Mars; that they had been carefully collected, and burnt.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On account of these prodigies, the decemvirs were ordered to consult the books; the nine days' festival was celebrated, a supplication proclaimed, and the city purified. At the same time, Marcus Porcius Cato dedicated a chapel to Maiden Victory, near the temple of Victory, two years after he had vowed it.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During this year, a Latin colony was established in the Thurian territory by commissioners appointed for the purpose, Cneius Manlius Vulso, Lucius Apustius Fullo, and Quintus Aelius Tubero, who had proposed the order for its settlement.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There went out thither three thousand foot and three hundred horsemen; a very small number in proportion to the extent of the land.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thirty acres might have been given to each footman, and sixty to a horseman, but, by the advice of Apustius, a third part was reserved, that they might afterwards, when they should judge proper, send out thither a new colony. The footmen received twenty acres each, the horsemen forty.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year was now near a close, and with regard to the election of consuls, emulation was more fiercely kindled than was ever known before.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The candidates, both patrician and plebeian, were many and powerful: Publius Cornelius Scipio, son to Cneius, and who had lately come home from Spain, having performed great exploits; Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, who had commanded the fleet in Greece; and</p> <p>Cneius Manlius Vulso; these were the patricians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then there were, of plebeian rank, Caius Laelius, Cneius Domitius, Caius Livius Salinator, and Manius Acilius.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The eyes of all men were turned on Quinctius and Cornelius; for, being both patricians, they sued for one place; and they were both of them recommended by high and recent renown in war. Above every thing else, the brothers of the candidates, the two most illustrious generals of the age, increased the violence of the struggle.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Scipio's fame was the more splendid, <pb id="p.1562" n="1562"/>and in proportion to its greater splendour, the more obnoxious to envy. That of Quinctius was the most recent, as he had triumphed in the course of that very same year.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Besides, the former had now for almost ten years been continually in people's sight; which circumstance, by the mere effect of satiety, causes great characters to be less revered. He had been a second time consul after the final defeat of Hannibal, and also censor.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All Quinctius's claims to the favour of the public were fresh and new; since his triumph, he had neither asked nor received any thing from the people; <quote>he solicited,</quote> he said, <quote>in favour of his own brother, not of a half-brother; in favour of his lieutenant-general, and partner in the administration of the war;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> his brother having conducted the operations by sea, while he did the same on land.</quote> By these arguments he carried his point.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His brother was preferred to the brother of Africanus, though supported by the whole Cornelian family, and while one of the same family presided at the election, and notwithstanding the very honourable testimony given by the senate, in his favour, when it adjudged him to be the best man in the state: and as such, appointed him to receive the Idaean Mother into the city, when she was brought from Pessinus.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Lucius Quinctius and Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus were elected consuls; so that, not even with respect to the plebeian consul, could Africanus prevail; for he employed his interest in favour of Caius Laelius.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Next day were elected praetors, Lucius Scribonius Libo, Marcus Fulvius Centumalus, Aulus Atilius Serranus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, Lucius Valerius Tappus, and Quintus Salonius Sarra. The aedileship of this year was highly distinguished, namely, that of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Lucius Aemilius Paulus. They prosecuted to conviction many of the farmers of the public pastures, and with the money accruing from the fines, placed gilded shields in the upper part of the temple of Jupiter.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They built one colonnade, on the outside of the gate Tergemina, to which they added a wharf on the Tiber: and another, reaching from the Frontinal gate to the altar of Mars, to serve as a passage into the field of Mars.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For a long time, nothing worth recording had occurred in Liguria; but, towards the end of this year, the Roman affairs there were twice brought into great peril;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for the consul's camp, being assaulted, was with difficulty preserved; <pb id="p.1563" n="1563"/>and a short time after, as the Roman army was marching through a defile, the Ligurians seized on the opening through which they were to pass.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul, when he found that passage stopped up, faced about, resolved to return: but the entrance behind, also, was occupied by a party of the enemy, and the disaster of Caudium not only occurred to the memory of the Romans, but was in a manner represented to their eyes. The consul had, among his auxiliary troops, about eight hundred Numidian horsemen, whose commanding officer undertook to force a passage with his troops, on whichever side the consul should choose.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He only desired to be told on which part the greater number of villages lay, for on them he meant to make an attack;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and the first thing he intended doing was, to set fire to the houses, in order that the alarm, which this should occasion, might induce the Ligurians to quit their posts in the defile, and hasten to different quarters to carry assistance to their friends. The consul highly commended him, and gave him assurance of ample rewards.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Numidians mounted their horses, and began to ride up to the advanced posts of the enemy, but without making any attack. Nothing could appear, on the first view, more contemptible.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both men and horses were of a small size and thin make, the riders unaccoutred and unarmed, excepting that they carried javelins in their hands; and the horses without bridles, and awkward in their gait, running with their necks stiff and their heads stretched out.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The contempt, conceived from their appearance, they took pains to increase; sometimes falling from their horses, and making themselves objects of derision and ridicule. The consequence was, that the enemy, who at first had been alert, and ready on their posts, in case of an attack, now, for

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the most part, laid aside their arms, and sitting down amused themselves with looking at them. The Numidians often rode up, then gallopped back, but still contrived to get nearer to the pass, as if they were unable to manage their horses, and were carried away against their will.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At last, setting spurs to them, they broke out through the midst of the enemy's posts, and getting into the open country, set fire to all the houses near the road.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They then set fire to the nearest village, while they ravaged all around with fire and sword. At first the sight of the smoke, then the shouts of the affrighted inhabitants, at last the old people and chil- <pb id="p.1564" n="1564"/>dren, who fled for shelter, created great disorder in the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In consequence of which the whole of their army, without plan, and without command, ran off, each to take care of his own;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the camp was in a moment deserted; and the consul, delivered from the blockade, made good his march to the place whither he intended to go.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>



















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But neither the Boians nor the Spaniards, with whom they had been at war during that year, were such bitter and inveterate foes to the Romans as the nation of the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These, after the departure of the Roman armies from Greece, had, for some time, entertained hopes that Antiochus would come and take possession of Europe, without opposition; and that neither Philip nor Nabis would continue quiet.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But, seeing no active measures begun, in any quarter, they resolved, lest their designs might be damped by delay, to create some agitation and disturbance; and, with this view, they summoned a general assembly at Naupactum.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Here Thoas, their praetor, after complaining of the injurious behaviour of the Romans, and the present state of Aetolia, and asserting, that <quote>of all the nations and states of Greece, they had been most unhonoured, after the victory which they themselves had been the means of obtaining,</quote> moved, that ambassadors should be sent to each of the kings;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> not only to sound their dispositions, but, by such incentives as suited the temper of each, to urge them to a war with Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Damocritus was sent to Nabis, Nicander to Philip, and Dicaearchus, the praetor's brother, to Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To the Lacedaemonian tyrant Damocritus represented, that, <quote>by the maritime cities being taken from him, his government was left enervated; for from them he had drawn his soldiers, as well as his ships and seamen. He was now pent up almost within the walls of his capital, while he saw the Achaeans domineering over the whole Peloponnesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Never would he have another opportunity of recovering his rights, if he suffered the one that now offered to pass by. There was no Roman army in Greece, nor would the Romans deem Gythium, or the other towns on the coast of Laconia, sufficient cause for transporting their legions a second time into that country.</quote> These arguments were used for the purpose of provoking the passions of Nabis; in order that when Antiochus should come into Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the other, conscious of having infringed the treaty of amity with <pb id="p.1565" n="1565"/>Rome, by injuries offered to its allies, might unite himself with him.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nicander excited Philip, by arguments somewhat similar; and he had more copious matter for discourse, as the king had been degraded from a more elevated state than the tyrant, and more possessions also had been taken from him. In addition to this, he introduced the ancient renown of the Macedonian kings, and the whole world pervaded by the victorious marches of that nation.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>The plan which he proposed,</quote> he said, <quote>was free from any danger, either in the commencement or in the issue. For he did not advise that Philip should stir until Antiochus should have come into Greece with an army;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and, considering that, without the aid of Antiochus, he had maintained a war so long against the combined forces of the Romans and Aetolians, with what possible force could the Romans withstand him, when joined by Antiochus, and supported by the aid of the Aetolians, who, on the former occasion, were more dangerous enemies than the Romans?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He added the circumstance of Hannibal being general; <quote>a man born a foe to the Romans, who had slain greater numbers, both of their commanders and soldiers, than were left surviving.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Such were the representations of Nicander to Philip. Dicaearchus addressed other arguments to Antiochus. In the first place, he told him, that <quote>the spoils of Philip belonged to the Romans, but the victory over him to the Aetolians; that none other than the Aetolians had afforded to the Romans admittance into Greece, and that the same people supplied them with the strength which enabled them to conquer.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He next set forth the numerous forces, both horse and foot, which they were willing to furnish to Antiochus, for the purpose of the war; what quarters they would assign to his land armament, what harbours for his naval forces.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He then asserted whatever falsehoods he pleased, respecting Philip and Nabis; that <quote>both were ready to recommence hostilities, and would greedily lay hold on the first opportunity of recovering what they had lost in war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Thus did the Aetolians labour, in every part of the world, to stir up war against the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The kings, however, either took no steps in it or took them too late.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nabis immediately despatched emissaries through all the towns on the coast, to sow dissensions among the inhabitants: some of the men in power he brought over to his party <pb id="p.1566" n="1566"/>by presents; others, who more firmly adhered to the alliance with Rome, he put to death.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The charge of' protecting all the Lacedaemonians on the coast, had been committed by Titus Quinctius to the Achaeans; they therefore instantly sent ambassadors to the tyrant, to remind him of his treaty with the Romans, and to warn him against violating a peace which he had so earnestly sued for.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They also sent succours to Gythium which he had already besieged, and ambassadors to Rome to make known these transactions.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> King Antiochus having, this winter, solemnized the nuptials of his daughter with Ptolemy, king of Egypt, at Raphia, in Ph&oelig;nicia, returned thence to Antioch, and came, towards the end of the season, through Cilicia, after passing Mount Taurus, to the city of Ephesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Early in the spring, he sent his son Antiochus thence into Syria, to guard the remote frontiers of his dominions, lest, during his absence, any commotion might arise behind him and then he marched himself, with all his land forces, to attack the Pisidians, inhabiting the country near Sida.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At this time, Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, the Roman ambassadors, who were sent to Antiochus, as above mentioned, having received orders to wait on Eumenes, first came to Elaea, and thence went up to Pergamus, for the palace of Eumenes was there. Eumenes was very desirous of a war against Antiochus, for he thought that, if peace continued, a king so much superior in power would be a troublesome neighbour;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but that, in case of hostilities, he would prove no more a match for the Romans than Philip had been; and that, either he would be entirely removed out of the way, or, should peace be granted to him, after a defeat he (Eumenes) might reasonably expect, that a great deal of what should be taken from Antiochus would fall to his own share;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> so that, in future, he might be very well able to defend himself against him, without any aid from the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and even if any misfortune were to happen, it would be better for him, in conjunction with the Romans, to undergo any turn of fortune, than, standing alone, either suffer himself to be ruled by Antiochus, or, on refusal, be compelled to submission by force of arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Therefore, with all his influence, and every argument which he could devise, he urged the Romans to a war.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Sulpicius, falling sick, staid at Pergamus. Villius, on hearing that the king was carrying on war in Pisidia. went <pb id="p.1567" n="1567"/>on to Ephesus, and, during a few days that he halted in that city, took pains

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> to procure frequent interviews with Hannibal, who happened to be there at the time, in

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> order to sound his intentions, if possible, and to remove his apprehensions of danger threatening him from the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> No other business, indeed, of any kind was brought forward at these meetings; yet they accidentally produced an important consequence, as effectually as if it had been intentionally sought; the lowering Hannibal in the esteem of the king, and rendering him more obnoxious to suspicion in every matter.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Claudius, following the history written in Greek by Acilius, says, that Publius Africanus was employed in this embassy, and that it was he who conversed with Hannibal at Ephesus. He even relates one of their conversations, in which Scipio asked Hannibal, <quote>whom he thought the greatest captain?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and that he answered, <quote>Alexander, king of Macedonia; because, with a small band, he defeated armies whose numbers were beyond reckoning;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and because he had overrun the remotest regions, the merely visiting of which was a thing above human aspiration.</quote> Scipio then asked, <quote>to whom he gave the second place?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and he replied, <quote>To Pyrrhus; for he first taught the method of encamping;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and besides, no one ever showed more exquisite judgment, in choosing his ground, and disposing his posts; while he also possessed the art of conciliating mankind to himself to such a degree, that the nations of Italy wished him, though a foreign prince, to hold the sovereignty among them, rather than the Roman people, who had so long possessed the dominion of that part of the world.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On his proceeding to ask, <quote>whom he esteemed the third?</quote> Hannibal replied, <quote>Myself, beyond doubt.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On this Scipio laughed, and added, <quote>What would you have said if you had conquered me?</quote> <quote>Then,</quote> replied the other, <quote>I would have placed Hannibal, not only before Alexander and Pyrrhus, but before all other commanders.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This answer, turned with Punic dexterity, and conveying an unexpected kind of flattery, was highly grateful to Scipio, as it set him apart from the crowd of commanders, as one of incomparable eminence.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Ephesus, Villius proceeded to Apamea, whither Antiochus, on hearing of the coming of the Roman delegates, came to meet him.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In this congress, at Apamea, the debates were similar to those which passed at Rome, between Quinc- <pb id="p.1568" n="1568"/>tius and the king's ambassadors. The news arriving of the death of Antiochus, the king's son, who, as just now mentioned, had been sent into Syria, broke off the conference.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was great mourning in the court, and excessive regret for this young man; for he had given such indications of his character, as afforded evident proof that, had a longer life been allotted him, he would have displayed the talents of a great and just prince.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The more he was beloved and esteemed by all, the more was his death a subject of suspicion, namely, that his father, thinking that his heir trod too closely on the heels of his own old age, had him taken off by poison, by some eunuchs, who recommend themselves to kings by the perpetration of such foul deeds.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> People mentioned also, as another motive for that clandestine act of' villany, that, as he had given Lysimachia to his son Seleucus, he had no establishment of the like kind, which he could give to Antiochus, for the purpose of banishing him also to a distance, under pretext of doing him honour.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless, an appearance of deep mourning was maintained in the court for several days; and the Roman ambassador, lest his presence at that inauspicious time might be troublesome, retired to Pergamus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king, dropping the prosecution of the war which he had begun, went back to Ephesus; and there, keeping himself shut up in the palace, under colour of grief, held secret consultations with a person called Minio, who was his principal favourite.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Minio was utterly ignorant of the state of all foreign nations; and, accordingly, estimating the strength of the king from his successes in Syria or Asia, lie was confident that Antiochus had not only superiority from the merits of his cause, and that the demands of the Romans were highly unreasonable; but also, that he would prove the more powerful in war.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As the king wished to avoid further debate with the envoys, either because he had found no advantage to result from the former conference, or because he was too much discomposed by recent grief, Minio undertook to say whatever was requisite for his interest, and persuaded him to invite for that purpose the ambassadors from Pergamus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By this time Sulpicius had recovered his health; both himself and Villius, therefore, came to Ephesus. Minio apologized for the king not being present, and the business was entered upon.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then Minio, in a studied speech, said, <quote>I <pb id="p.1569" n="1569"/>find, Romans, that you profess very specious intentions, (the liberating of the Grecian states,) but your actions do not accord with your words. You lay down one rule for Antiochus, and follow another yourselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For, how are the inhabitants of Smyrna and Lampsacus better entitled to the character of Greeks, than the Neapolitans, Rhegians, and Tarentines, from whom you exact tribute, and ships, in pursuance of a treaty?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Why do you send yearly to Syracuse, and other Grecian cities of Sicily, a praetor, vested with sovereign power, and attended by his rods and axes? You can, certainly, allege no other reason than this, that, having conquered them in war, you imposed these terms on them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Admit, then, on the part of Antiochus, the same reason with respect to Smyrna and Lampsacus, and the cities belonging to Ionia and Aeolia.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Conquered by his ancestors, they were subjected to tribute and taxes, and he only reclaims an ancient right. I would have you answer him on these heads, if you mean a fair discussion, and do not merely seek a pretence for war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Sulpicius answered, <quote>Antiochus has acted with some modesty in choosing that, since no other arguments could be produced in his favour, any other person should utter these rather than himself. For, what similarity is there in the cases of those states which you have brought into comparison?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From the Rhegians, Neapolitans, and Tarentines we require what they owe us by treaty, in virtue of a right invariably exercised, in one uniform course, since they first came under our power; a right always asserted, and never intermitted.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Now, can you assert, that, as these states have, neither of themselves, nor through any other, ever refused conforming to the treaty, so the Asiatic states, since they once came under the power of Antiochus's ancestors, have been held in uninterrupted possession by your reigning kings;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that some of them have not been subject to the dominion of Philip, some to that of Ptolemy; and that others have not, for many years, maintained themselves in a state of independence, no one calling it in question?

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For, if the circumstance of their having been once subject to a foreigner, when crushed under the severity of the times, conveys a right to enforce that subjection again after a lapse of so many generations, what can be said of our having delivered Greece from Philip, but that nothing was accomplished by us; and that his successors may reclaim <pb id="p.1570" n="1570"/>Corinth, Chalcis, Demetrias, and the whole nation of Thessaly?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But why do I plead the cause of those states, which it would

<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> be fitter that both we and the king should hear pleaded by themselves?</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He then desired, that the deputies of those states should be called, for they had been prepared beforehand, and kept in readiness by Eumenes, who reckoned, that every share of strength that should be taken away from Antiochus, would become an accession to his own kingdom.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Many of them were introduced; and, while each enforced his own complaints, and sometimes demands, and blended together the reasonable with the unreasonable, they changed the debate into a mere altercation. The ambassadors, therefore, without conceding or carrying any one point, returned to Rome just as they had come, leaving every thing in an undecided state.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On their departure the king held a council, on the subject of a war with Rome, in which each spoke more violently than his predecessor; for every one thought, that the more bitterly he inveighed against the Romans, the greater share of favour he might expect to obtain.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> One animadverted upon the insolence of their demands, in which they presume to impose terms on Antiochus, the greatest king in Asia, as they would on the vanquished Nabis.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>Although to Nabis they left absolute power over his own country, and its capital, Lacedaemon, yet it seems to them a matter for indignation, that Smyrna and Lampsacus should yield obedience to Antiochus.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> &mdash;Others said, that <quote>to so great a monarch, those cities were but a trivial ground of war, scarcely worth mention;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but, that the beginning of unjust impositions was always made in the case of matters of little consequence; unless, indeed, it could be supposed, that the Persians, when they demanded earth and water from the Lacedaemonians, stood in need of a scrap of the land or a draught of the water.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The proceedings of the Romans, respecting the two cities, were meant as a trial of the same sort. The rest of the states, when they saw that two had shaken off the yoke, would go over to the party of that nation which professed the patronage of liberty.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If freedom was not actually preferable to servitude, yet the hope of bettering their circumstances by a change, was more flattering to every one than any present situation.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was, in the council, an Acarnanian named <pb id="p.1571" n="1571"/>Alexander, who had formerly been a friend of Philip, but had lately left him, to follow the more opulent court of Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And as being well skilled in the affairs of Greece, and not unacquainted with the Romans, he was admitted by the king into such a degree of intimacy, that he shared even in his secret councils.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As if the question to be considered were not, whether there should be war or not, but where and in what manner it should be carried on, he affirmed, that <quote>he saw an assured prospect of victory, provided the king would pass into Europe and choose some part of Greece for the seat of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the first place, the Aetolians, who lived in the centre of Greece, would be found in arms, ready to take the lead in the most perilous operations.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, in the two extremities of Greece, Nabis, on the side of Peloponnesus, would put every thing in motion, to recover the city of Argos, and the maritime cities, from which he had been expelled by the Romans, and pent up within the walls of Lacedaemon:

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> while, on the side of Macedonia, Philip would be ready for the field the moment he heard the alarm sounded. He knew,</quote> he said, <quote>his spirit, he knew his temper; he knew that, (as in the case with wild beasts, confined by bars or chains,) for a long time past, he had been revolving the fiercest resentments in his breast.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He remembered, also, how often, during the war, that prince had prayed to all the gods to grant him Antiochus as an assistant; and, if that prayer were now heard with favour, he would not hesitate an instant to resume his arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was only requisite that there should be no delay, no procrastination; for success depended chiefly on securing beforehand commodious posts and proper allies: besides, Hannibal ought to be sent immediately into Africa, in order to distract the attention of the Romans.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal was not called to this consultation, having become suspected by the king, and not having subsequently been held in any honour, on account of his conferences with Villius, and he had not since shown him any mark of regard.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This affront, at first, he bore in silence; but afterwards thought it better to take some proper opportunity to inquire the reason of the king's suddenly withdrawing his favour, and to clear himself of blame.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Without any preface, he asked the cause of the king's displeasure; and having heard it, said, <quote>Antiochus, when I was yet an infant, my father, Hamilcar, <pb id="p.1572" n="1572"/>at a time when he was offering sacrifice, brought me up to the altars, and made me take an oath, that I never would be a friend to the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Under the obligation of this oath, I carried arms against them for thirty-six years; this oath, on peace being made, drove me out of my country, and brought me an exile to your court; and this oath shall guide me, should you disappoint my hopes, until I traverse every quarter of the globe, where I can understand that there are resources, to find out enemies to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If, therefore, your courtiers have conceived the idea of ingratiating themselves with you by insinuating suspicions of me, let them seek some means of advancing their reputation otherwise than at my expense.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I hate, and am hated by, the Romans. That I speak the truth in this, my father, Hamilcar, and the gods are witnesses. Whenever, therefore, you shall employ your thoughts on a plan of waging war with Rome, consider Hannibal as one of your firmest friends. If circumstances force you to adopt peaceful measures, on such a subject employ some one else with whom to deliberate.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This discourse not only affected the king much, but even reconciled him to Hannibal. They departed from the council with the resolution that the war should be undertaken.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome, people in their conversations anticipated, indeed, Antiochus as an enemy, but they had hitherto prepared nothing for such a war but their expectations.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Italy was decreed the province of both the consuls, who received directions to settle between themselves, or draw lots, which of them should preside at the elections of the year;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and it was ordered, that he who should be disengaged from that business, should hold himself in readiness, in case there should be occasion, to lead the legions any where out of that country.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To the said consul, permission was given to levy two new legions, and twenty thousand foot, and nine hundred horse, among the allies and Latin confederates.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To the other consul were decreed the two legions which had been commanded by Lucius Cornelius, consul of the preceding year; and from the same army, a body of allies and Latins, amounting to fifteen thousand foot and five hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quintus Minucius was continued in command, with the forces which he then had in Liguria; as a supplement to which, four thousand Roman foot and five hundred horse were ordered to be enlisted, and <pb id="p.1573" n="1573"/>five thousand foot and two hundred and fifty horse to be demanded from the allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The duty of departing from Italy, whithersoever the senate should order, fell to Cneius Domitius; Gaul, and the holding the elections, to Lucius Quinctius.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The praetors then cast lots for their provinces: to Marcus Fulvius Centumalus fell the city jurisdiction; to Lucius Scribonius Libo, the foreign; Lucius Valerius Tappus obtained Sicily; Quintus Salonius Sarra, Sardinia; Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, Hither Spain; and Marcus Atilius Serranus, Farther Spain. But the provinces of the two last were changed, first by a decree of the senate, which was afterwards confirmed by an order of the people.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The fleet and Macedonia were assigned to Atilius; Bruttium to Baebius.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Flaminius and Fulvius were continued in command in both the Hither and Farther Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To Baebius Tamphilus, for the business of Bruttium, were decreed the two legions which had served in the city the year before; and he was ordered to demand from the allies, for the same service, fifteen thousand foot and five hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Atilius was ordered to build thirty ships of five banks of oars: to bring out, from the docks, any old ones that were fit for service, and to raise seamen. An order was also given to the consul, to supply him with two thousand of the allied and Latin footmen, and a thousand Roman.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The destination of these two praetors, and their two armaments, one on land and the other on sea, was declared to be intended against Nabis, who was now carrying on open hostilities against the allies of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But it was thought proper to wait the return of the ambassadors sent to Antiochus, and the senate ordered the consul Cneius Domitius not to leave the city until they arrived.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetors, Fulvius and Scribonius, whose province was the administration of justice at Rome, were charged to provide a hundred quinqueremes, besides the fleet which Atilius was to command.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before the consul and praetors set out for their provinces, a supplication was performed on account of some prodigies. A report was brought from Picenum, that a goat had produced six kids at a birth.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was said that a boy was born at Arretium who had but one hand; that, at Amiternum, a shower of earth fell;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> a gate and wall at Formiae were struck by lightning; and, what was more alarming than all, an ox, belonging to the consul, Cneius Domitius, spoke <pb id="p.1574" n="1574"/>these words, &mdash;<quote>Rome, take care of thyself.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To expiate the other prodigies, a supplication was performed; the ox was ordered by the aruspices to be carefully preserved and fed. The Tiber, pouring into the city with more destructive violence than last year, swept away two bridges, and many buildings, particularly about the Flumentan gate.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A huge rock, loosened from its seat, either by the rains, or by an earthquake so slight that no other effect of it was perceived, tumbled down from the Capitol into the Jugarian street, and buried many people under it. In the country, many parts of which were overflowed, much cattle was carried away, and a great destruction of farm houses took place.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Previous to the arrival of the consul, Lucius Quinctius, in his province, Quintus Minucius fought a pitched battle with the Ligurians, in the territory of Pisae, slew nine thousand of the enemy, and putting the rest to flight,

<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> drove them within their works, which were assaulted and defended in an obstinate contest until night came on.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> During the night, the Ligurians stole away unobserved; and, at the first dawn, the Romans took possession of their deserted camp, where the quantity of booty found was the less, because the enemy frequently sent home the spoil taken in the country. Minucius, after this, allowed them no respite.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From the territory of Pisae he marched into that of the Ligurians, and, with fire and sword, utterly destroyed their forts and towns, where the Roman soldiers were abundantly enriched with

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the spoils of Etruria which the ravagers had sent home.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time, the ambassadors, who had been sent to the kings, returned to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As they brought no information of such a nature as called for any immediate declaration of war, (except against the Lacedaemonian tyrant, whom the Achaean ambassadors also represented as invading the sea-coast of Laconia, in breach of treaty,) Atilius, the praetor, was sent with the fleet to Greece, for the protection of the allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was resolved, that, as there was nothing to be apprehended from Antiochus at present, both the consuls should go to their provinces; and, accordingly, Domitius marched into the country of the Boians, by the shorter road, through Ariminum, and Quinctius through Liguria.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The two armies of the consuls, proceeding by these different routes, spread devastation wide over the enemy's country. In <pb id="p.1575" n="1575"/>consequence of which, first a few of their horsemen, with their commanders, then their whole senate, and at last all who possessed either property or dignity, to the number of one thousand five hundred, came over and joined the consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In both Spains, likewise, success attended the Roman arms during this year.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, in one, Caius Flaminius, after a siege, took Litabrum, a strong and opulent city, and made prisoner Corribilo, a powerful chieftain; and, in the other, Marcus Fulvius, the proconsul, fought two successful battles, with two armies of the enemy. He captured Vescelia and Holo, two towns belonging to the Spaniards, with many of their forts, and others spontaneously revolted to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, advancing into the territory of Oretum, and having, there also, taken two cities, Noliba and Cusibis, he proceeded to the river Tagus. Here stood Toletum, a small city, but strong from its situation.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While he was besieging this place, a numerous army of Vectonians came to relieve the Toletans, but he overthrew them in a general engagement, and having defeated the Vectonians, took Toletum by means of his works.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this juncture the wars in which they were actually engaged, caused not so great anxiety in the minds of the senate, as the expectation of one with Antiochus, which had not yet commenced.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For although, through their ambassadors, they had, from time to time, made careful inquiries into every particular, yet rumours, rashly propagated without authentic foundation, intermixed many falsehoods with the truth.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Among the rest, a report was spread, that Antiochus intended, as soon as he should come into Aetolia, to send a fleet immediately into Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate, therefore, though they had already despatched the praetor, Atilius, with a squadron to Greece,

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> yet, considering that not only a military force, but also the influence of reputation, would be necessary towards securing the attachment of the allies, they sent into Greece, in quality of ambassadors, Titus Quinctius, Caius Octavius, Cneius Servilius, and Publius Villius; at the same time ordering, in their decree, that Marcus Baebius should lead forward his legions from Bruttium to Tarentum and Brundusium, so that, if occasion required, he might transport them thence into Macedonia.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They also ordered, that Marcus Fulvius, the praetor, should send a fleet of thirty ships to protect the coast of Sicily; and that, whoever had the direc- <pb id="p.1576" n="1576"/>tion of that fleet, should be invested with supreme authority. To this commission was appointed Lucius Oppius Salinator, who had been plebeian aedile the year before.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They likewise determined, that the same praetor should write to his colleague, Lucius Valerius, that <quote>there was reason to apprehend that the ships of king Antiochus would pass over from Aetolia to Sicily;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for which reason the senate judged it proper, that, in addition to the army which he then had, he should enlist tumultuary soldiers, to the number of twelve thousand foot and four hundred horse, with which he might be able to defend that coast of his province which lay next to Greece.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This enlistment the praetor carried on, not only from Sicily, but from the circumjacent islands; and strengthened all the towns on the coast which lay opposite to Greece with garrisons.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the rumours already current, the arrival of Attalus, the brother of Eumenes, added confirmation, for he brought intelligence that king Antiochus had crossed the Hellespont with his army, and that the Aetolians were putting themselves into such a posture, that by the time of his arrival they would be in arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thanks were given to Eumenes, in his absence, and to Attalus, who was present; and there were decreed to him free lodgings and every accommodation; that he should be presented with two horses, two suits of horsemen's armour, vases of silver to a hundred pounds' weight, and of gold to twenty pounds.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As one messenger after another brought intelligence that the war was on the point of breaking out, it was judged expedient that consuls should be elected as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Wherefore the senate passed a decree, that the praetor, Marcus Fulvius, should instantly despatch a letter to the consul, informing him, that it was the will of the senate that he should leave the command of the province and army to his lieutenant-generals, and return to Rome;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that, when on the road, he should send on before him an edict appointing the assemblies for the election of consuls.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul complied with the letter; and having sent forward the edict, arrived at Rome. There was, this year also, a warm competition, three patricians suing for one place: Publius Cornelius Scipio, son to Cneius, who had suffered a disappointment the year before, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, and Cneius Manlius Vulso.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consulship was conferred on Publius Scipio, that it might <pb id="p.1577" n="1577"/>appear that the honour had only been delayed, and not refused to a person of such character.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The plebeian colleague, joined with him, was Manius Acilius Glabrio. Next day were created praetors, Lucius Aemilius Paulus, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Marcus Junius Brutus, Aulus Cornelius Mammula, Caius Livius, and Lucius Oppius; the two last, both of them, surnamed Salinator. This was the same Oppius who had conducted the fleet of thirty ships to Sicily.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While the new magistrates were settling the distribution of their provinces, orders were despatched to Marcus Baebius to pass over, with all his forces, from Brundusium to Epirus, and to keep the army stationed near Apollonia;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and Marcus Fulvius, city praetor, was commissioned to build fifty new quinqueremes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the precautions taken by the Roman people to guard against every attempt of Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At this time, Nabis did not procrastinate hostilities, but, with his utmost force, carried on the siege of Gythium; and, being incensed against the Achaeans, for having sent succours to the besieged, he ravaged their lands.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Achaeans would not venture to engage in war, until their ambassadors should come back from Rome, and acquaint them with the sentiments of the senate:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but as soon as these returned, they summoned a council at Sicyon, and also sent deputies to Titus Quinctius to ask his advice.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the council, all the members were inclined to vote for an immediate declaration of war; but a letter from Titus Quinctius, in which he recommended waiting for the Roman praetor and fleet, caused some hesitation.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While some of the principal members persisted in their first opinion, and others argued that they ought to follow the counsel of the person to whom they of themselves had applied for advice, the generality waited to hear the sentiments of Philop&oelig;men.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was praetor of Achaia at the time, and surpassed all his contemporaries both in wisdom and influence. He first observed, that <quote>it was a wise rule, established among the Achaeans, that their praetor, when he proposed a question concerning war, should not himself declare an opinion:</quote> and then he desired them to <quote>fix their determination among themselves as soon as possible;</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> assuring them, that <quote>their praetor would faithfully and carefully carry their decrees into execution; and would use his best endeavours, that, as far <pb id="p.1578" n="1578"/>as depended on human prudence, they should not repent either of peace or war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These words had more influence in inciting them to war, than if, by openly arguing in favour of it, he had betrayed an eager desire for the management of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> War was therefore unanimously resolved on: the time and mode of conducting it were left to the praetor without restriction.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philop&oelig;men's own judgment, indeed, besides it being the opinion of Quinctius, pointed it out as best to wait for the Roman fleet, which might succour Gythium by sea;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> but fearing that the business would not endure delay, and that not only Gythium, but the party which had been sent to protect the city, would fall into the hands of the enemy, he drew out the ships of the Achaeans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The tyrant also, with the view of cutting off any supplies that might be brought to the besieged by sea, had fitted out a small squadron, consisting of only three ships of war, with some barks and cutters, as his former fleet had been given up to the Romans, according to the treaty.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In order to try the activity of these vessels, as they were then new, and, at the same time, to have every thing in fit condition for a battle, he put out to sea every day, and exercised both the rowers and marines in mock-fights; for he thought that all his hopes of succeeding in the siege depended on the circumstance of his cutting off all supplies by sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The praetor of the Achaeans, in respect of skill for conducting operations on land, was equal to any of the most celebrated commanders both in capacity and experience, yet with naval affairs he was quite unacquainted.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Being an inhabitant of Arcadia, an inland country, he was ignorant even of all foreign affairs, excepting that he had once served in Crete as commander of a body of auxiliaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was an old ship of four banks of oars, which had been taken eighty years before, as it was conveying Nicaea, the wife of Craterus, from Naupactum to Corinth.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Led by the reputation of this ship, for it had formerly been reckoned a very famous vessel when in the king's fleet, he ordered it,

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> though now quite rotten, and falling asunder through age, to be brought out from Aegium. The fleet sailed with this ship at its head, Tiso of Patrae, the commander, being on board it, when the ships of the Lacedaemonians from Gythium came within view.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the first shock, against a new and firm vessel, that old one, which before ad- <pb id="p.1579" n="1579"/>mitted the water through every joint, was shattered to pieces, and the whole crew were made prisoners. On the loss of the commander's ship, the rest of the fleet fled as fast as each could by means of its oars.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Philop&oelig;men himself made his escape in a light advice-boat, nor did he stop his flight until he arrived at Patrae. This untoward event did not in the least damp the spirit of a man so well versed in military affairs, and who had experienced so many vicissitudes of fortune.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the contrary, as he had failed of success in the naval line, in which he had no experience, he even conceived, thence, the greater hopes of succeeding in another, wherein he had acquired knowledge; and he affirmed, that he would quickly put an end to the tyrant's rejoicing.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nabis, being both elated by this adventure, and entertaining a confident hope that he had not now any danger to apprehend from the sea, resolved to shut up the passages on the land also, by parties stationed in proper posts.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With this view, he drew off a third part of his forces from the siege of Gythium, and encamped them at Pleiae, a place which commands both Leucae and Acriae, on the road by which the enemy's army seemed likely to advance.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While his quarters were here, and very few of his men had tents, (the generality of them having formed huts of reeds interwoven, and which they covered with leaves of trees, to serve merely as

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> a shelter,) Philop&oelig;men, before he came within sight, resolved to surprise him by an attack of such a kind as he did not expect.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He drew together some small ships in a remote creek, on the coast of the territory of Argos, and embarked on board them a body of light-armed soldiers, mostly targeteers, furnished with slings, javelins, and other light kinds of weapons.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then coasted along the shore, until he came to a promontory near Nabis's post. Here he landed; and made his way, by night, through paths with which he was well acquainted, to Pleiae, and while the sentinels were fast asleep, as being in no immediate apprehension, he set fire to the huts in every part of the camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Great numbers perished in the flames before they could discover the enemy's arrival, and those who did discover it could give no assistance; so that nearly the whole was destroyed by fire and sword.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From both these means of destruction, however, a very small number made their escape, and fled to the principal camp before Gythium.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The enemy <pb id="p.1580" n="1580"/>having been thus smitten with disaster, Philop&oelig;men forthwith led on his forces to ravage the district of Tripolis, a part of the Lacedaemonian territory, lying

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> next to the frontiers of the Megalopolitans, and carrying off thence a vast number of men and cattle, withdrew before the tyrant could send a force from Gythium to protect the country.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He then collected his whole force at Tegea, to which place he summoned a council of the Achaeans and their allies; at which were present, also, deputies from the Epirots and Acarnanians.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Here it was resolved, that as the minds of his men were now sufficiently recovered from the shame of the disgrace suffered at sea, and those of the enemy dispirited, he should march directly to Lacedaemon; for he considered that by this measure alone could the enemy be drawn off from the siege of Gythium.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On entering the enemy's country, he encamped the first day at Caryae; and, on that very day, Gythium was taken. Ignorant of that event, Philop&oelig;men advanced to the Barbosthenes, a mountain ten miles from Lacedaemon.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> On the other side, Nabis, after taking possession of Gythium, set out, at the head of a body of light troops, marched hastily by Lacedaemon, and seized on a place called the Camp of Pyrrhus, which post he did not doubt that the Achaeans intended to occupy. From thence he proceeded to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> From the length of their train in consequence of the narrowness of the road, they spread over a space of almost five miles. The line was closed by the cavalry and the greatest part of the auxiliaries, because Philop&oelig;men expected that the tyrant would attack him in the rear with his mercenary troops, in whom he placed his principal confidence.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Two unforeseen circumstances at once filled him with uneasiness: one, the post at which he aimed being pre-occupied; the other, the enemy having met him in front, where, as the road lay through very uneven ground, he did not see how the battalions could advance without the support of the light troops.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philop&oelig;men was possessed of an admirable degree of skill and experience, in conducting a march, and choosing his station; having made these points his principal study, not only in times of war, but likewise during peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whenever he was making a journey to any place and came to a defile where the passage was difficult, it was his practice, first, to examine the nature of the ground on every side. When <pb id="p.1581" n="1581"/>journeying alone, he meditated within himself; if he had company, he asked them, <quote>If an enemy should appear in that place, what course ought he to adopt, if they should attack him in front;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> what, if on this flank, or on that; what, if on the rear; for he might happen to meet them while his men were formed with a regular front, or when they were in the loose order of march, fit only for the road.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He would proceed to examine, either in his own mind, or by asking questions, <quote>What ground he himself would choose; what number of soldiers, or what kind of arms (which was a very material point) he ought to employ; where he should deposit the baggage, where the soldiers' necessaries, where the unarmed multitude;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> with what number and what kind of troops he should guard them, and whether it would be better to prosecute his march as intended, or to return back by the way he came; what spot, also, he should choose for his camp; how large a space he should enclose within the lines;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> where he could be conveniently supplied with water; where a sufficiency of forage and wood could be had; which would be his safest road on decamping next day, and in what form the army should march?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In such studies and inquiries he had, from his early years, so frequently exercised his thoughts, that, on any thing of the kind occurring, no expedient that could be devised was new to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On this occasion, he first ordered the army to halt; then sent forward to the van the auxiliary Cretans, and the horsemen called Tarentines, each leading two spare horses; and, ordering the rest of the cavalry to follow, he seized on a rock which stood over a rivulet, from which he might be supplied with water.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Here he collected together all the baggage with all the suttlers and followers of the army, placing a guard of soldiers round them; and then he fortified his camp, as the nature of the place required. The pitching of tents in such rugged and uneven ground was a difficult task. The enemy were distant not more than five hundred paces.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Both drew water from the same rivulet, under escorts of light troops; but, before any skirmish took place, as usual between men encamped so near to each other, night came on. It was evident, however, that they must, unavoidably, fight next day at the rivulet, in support of the watering parties.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Wherefore, during the night, Philop&oelig;men concealed, in a <pb id="p.1582" n="1582"/>valley remote from the view of the enemy, as great a number of targeteers as the place was capable of hiding.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At break of day, the Cretan light infantry and the Tarentine horse began an engagement on the bank of the rivulet. Telemnastus, a Cretan, commanded his countrymen; Lycortas of Megalopolis, the cavalry.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The enemies' watering party also was guarded by Cretan auxiliaries and Tarentine horsemen. The fight was, for a considerable time, doubtful, as the troops on both sides were of the same kind, and armed alike;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but as the contest advanced, the tyrant's auxiliaries gained an advantage, both by their superiority of numbers, and because Philop&oelig;men had given directions to his officers, that, after maintaining the contest for a short time, they should betake themselves to flight, and draw the enemy on to the place of the ambuscade. The latter, pursuing the runaways, in disorderly haste, through the valley, were most of them wounded and slain, before they discovered their concealed foe.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The targeteers had posted themselves in such order, as far as the breadth of the valley allowed, that they easily gave a passage to their flying friends, through openings in their ranks;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> then starting up themselves, hale, fresh, and in regular order, they briskly attacked the enemy, whose ranks were broken, who were scattered in confusion, and were, besides, exhausted with fatigue and wounds.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The victory was no longer doubtful; the tyrant's troops instantly turned their backs, and flying with much more precipitation than they had pursued, were driven into their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Great numbers were killed and taken in the pursuit; and the consternation would have spread through the camp also, had not Philop&oelig;men ordered a retreat to be sounded; for he dreaded the ground (which was rough and dangerous to advance on without caution) more than he did the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Judging, both from the issue of the battle and from the disposition of the enemy's leader, in what apprehension he then was, he sent to him one of the auxiliary soldiers in the character of a deserter, to assure him positively, that the Achaeans had resolved

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> to advance, next day, to the river Eurotas, which runs almost close to the walls, in order to intercept his way, so that the tyrant could have no retreat to the city when he required it, and to prevent any provisions being brought thence to the <pb id="p.1583" n="1583"/>camp;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that they intended, at the same time, to try whether any could be prevailed on to desert his cause. Although the deserter did not gain entire credit, yet he afforded to one, who was full of apprehensions, a plausible pretext for leaving his camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the day following, he ordered Pythagoras, with the auxiliaries and cavalry, to mount guard before the rampart;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and then, marching out himself with the main body of the army, as if intending to offer battle, he ordered them to return with all haste to the city.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Philop&oelig;men saw their army marching precipitately through a narrow and steep road, he sent all his cavalry, together with the Cretan auxiliaries, against the guard of the enemy, stationed in the front of their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These, seeing their adversaries approach, and perceiving that their friends had abandoned them, at first attempted to retreat within their works; but afterwards, when the whole force of the Achaeans advanced in order of battle, they were seized with fear, lest, together with the camp itself, they might be taken;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> they resolved, therefore, to follow the body of their army, which, by this time, had proceeded to a considerable distance in advance.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Immediately, the targeteers of the Achaeans assailed and plundered the camp, and the rest set out in pursuit of the enemy. The road was such, that a body of men, even when undisturbed by any fear of a foe, could not, without difficulty, make its way through it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But when an attack was made on their rear, and the shouts of terror, raised by the affrighted troops behind, reached to the van, they threw down their arms, and fled, each for himself, in different directions, into the woods which lay on each side of the road.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In an instant of time, the way was stopped up with heaps of weapons, particularly spears, which, falling mostly with their points towards the pursuers, formed a kind of palisade across the road.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Philop&oelig;men ordered the auxiliaries to push forward, whenever they could, in pursuit of the enemy, who would find it a difficult matter, the horsemen particularly, to continue their flight; while he himself led away the heavy troops through more open ground to the river Eurotas.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There he pitched his camp a little before sun-set, and waited for the light troops which he had sent in chase of the enemy. These arrived at the first watch, and brought intelligence, that Nabis, with a few attendants, had made his way into the city, <pb id="p.1584" n="1584"/>and that the rest of his army, unarmed and dispersed, were straggling through all parts of the woods;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> whereupon, he ordered them to refresh themselves, while he himself chose out a party of men, who, having come earlier into camp, were, by this time, both recruited by food and a little rest; and, ordering them to carry nothing with them but their swords, he marched them out directly, and posted them in the roads which led from two of the gates, one towards Pherae, the other towards the Barbosthenes: for he supposed, that through these the flying enemy would make their retreat.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor was he mistaken in that opinion; for the Lacedaemonians, as long as any light remained, retreated through the centre of the woods in the most retired paths. As soon as it grew dusk, and they saw lights in the enemy's camp, they kept themselves in paths concealed from view; but having passed it by, they then thought that all was safe, and came down into the open roads, where they were intercepted by the parties lying in wait;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and there such numbers of them were killed and taken, that of the whole army scarcely a fourth part effected their escape.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As the tyrant was now pent up within the city, Philop&oelig;men employed the greatest part of thirty succeeding days in ravaging the lands of the Lacedaemonians; and then, after greatly reducing, and almost annihilating the strength of the tyrant, he returned home, while the Achaeans extolled him as equal in the glory of his services to the Roman general, and indeed, so far as regarded the war with Lacedaemon, even deemed him superior.</p> 

<milestone unit ="chapter" n="31"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Achaeans and the tyrant were carrying on the war in this manner, the Roman ambassadors made a circuit through the cities of the allies; being anxious lest the Aetolians might seduce some of them to join the party of Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They took but little pains, in their applications to the Achaeans; because, knowing their animosity against Nabis, they thought that they might be safely relied on with regard to other matters.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They went first to Athens, thence to Chalcis, thence to Thessaly; and, after addressing the Thessalians, in a full assembly, they directed their route to Demetrias, to which place a council of the Magnetians was summoned.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There a more studied address required to be delivered; for a great many of the leading men were disaffected to the Romans, and entirely devoted to the interests of An- <pb id="p.1585" n="1585"/>tiochus and the Aetolians;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> because, at the time when accounts were received that Philip's son, who was a hostage, would be restored to him, and the tribute imposed on him remitted, among other groundless reports it had been given out, that the Romans also intended to restore Demetrias to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Rather than that should take place, Eurylochus, a deputy of the Magnetians, and others of that faction, wished for a total change of measures to be effected by the coning of Antiochus and the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In opposition to those, it was necessary to reason in such a manner, that, in dispelling their mistaken fear, the ambassadors should not, by cutting off his hopes at once, give any disgust to Philip, to whom more importance attached, in all respects, than to the Magnetians.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They only observed to the assembly, that, <quote>as Greece in general was under an obligation to the Romans for their kindness in restoring its liberty, so was their state in particular.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For there had not only been a garrison of Macedonians in their capital, but a palace had been built in it, that they might have a master continually before their eyes.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But all that had been done would be of no effect, if the Aetolians should bring thither Antiochus, and settle him in the abode of Philip, so that a new and unknown king should be set over them, in the place of an old one, with whom they had been long acquainted.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their chief magistrate is styled Magnetarch. This office was then held by Eurylochus, who assuming confidence from this powerful station, openly declared that he and the Magnetians saw no reason to dissemble their having heard the common report about the restoration of Demetrias to Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> to prevent which, the Magnetians were bound to attempt and to hazard every thing; and, in the eagerness of discourse, he was carried to such an inconsiderate length, as to throw out, that, <quote>at that very time Demetrias was only free in appearance; and that, in reality, all things were at the nod of the Romans.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Immediately after this expression there was a general murmur of dissent in the assembly; some of whom showed their approbation, others expressed indignation at his presumption, in uttering it. As to Quinctius, he was so inflamed with anger, that, raising his hands towards heaven, he invoked the gods to witness the ungrateful and perfidious disposition of the Magnetians.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> This struck terror into the whole assembly; and one of the deputies, named Zeno, who <pb id="p.1586" n="1586"/>had acquired a great degree of influence, by his judicious course of conduct in life, and by having been always an avowed supporter of the interests of the Romans, with tears besought Quinctius, and the other ambassadors, <quote>not to impute to the state the madness of an individual.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Every man,</quote> he said, <quote>was answerable for his own absurdities. As to the Magnetians, they were indebted to Titus Quinctius and the Roman people, not only for liberty, but for every thing that mankind hold valuable or sacred.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> By their kindness, they were in the enjoyment of every blessing, for which they could ever petition the immortal gods; and, if struck with phrensy, they would sooner vent their fury on their own persons, than violate the friendship with Rome.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>His entreaties were seconded by the prayers of the whole assembly; on which Eurylochus retired hastily from the council, and passing to the gate through private streets, fled away into Aetolia.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As to the Aetolians, they now gave plainer indications of their intention to revolt every day; and it happened, that at this very time Thoas, one of their leading men, whom they had sent to Antiochus, returned, and brought back with him an ambassador from the king, named Menippus.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These two, before the council met to give them audience, filled every one's ears with pompous accounts of the naval and land forces that were coming;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>a vast army,</quote> they said, <quote>of horse and foot was on its march from India; and, besides, that they were bringing such a quantity of gold and silver, as was sufficient to purchase the Romans themselves;</quote> which latter circumstance they knew would influence the multitude more than any thing else.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was easy to foresee what effects these reports would produce in the council; for the Roman ambassadors received information of the arrival of those men, and of all their proceedings.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And although the matter had almost come to a rupture, yet Quinctius thought it advisable, that some ambassadors of the allies should be present in that council, who might remind the Aetolians of their alliance with Rome, and who might have the courage to speak with freedom in opposition to the king's ambassador.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Athenians seemed to be the best qualified for this purpose, by reason of the high reputation of their state, and also from their long-standing alliance with the Aetolians. Quinctius, therefore, requested of them to send ambassadors to the <pb id="p.1587" n="1587"/>Panaetolic council. At the first meeting, Thoas made a report of the business of his embassy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After him, Menippus was introduced, who said, that <quote>it would have been best for all the Greeks, residing both in Greece and Asia, if Antiochus could have taken a part in their affairs, while the power of Philip was yet unbroken;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for then every one would have had what of right belonged to him, and the whole would not have come under the dominion and absolute disposal of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But even as matters stand at present,</quote> said he, <quote>provided you have constancy enough to carry into effect the measures which you have adopted, Antiochus will be able, with the assistance of the gods and the alliance of the Aetolians, to reinstate the affairs of Greece in their former rank of dignity, notwithstanding the low condition to which they have been reduced.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But this dignity consists in a state of freedom which stands by its own resources, and is not dependent on the will of another.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Athenians, who were permitted to deliver their sentiments next after the king's ambassadors, omitting all mention of Antiochus, reminded the Aetolians of their alliance with Rome, and the benefits conferred by Titus Quinctius on the whole body of Greece;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and admonished them, <quote>not inconsiderately to break off that connexion by the undue precipitation of their counsels; that passionate and adventurous schemes, however flattering at first view, prove difficult in the execution, and disastrous in the issue;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> that as the Roman ambassadors, and among them Titus Quinctius, were within a small distance, it would be better, while all hostilities were as yet uncommenced, to discuss, in conference, any matters in dispute, than to rouse Europe and Asia to a dreadful war.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The multitude, ever fond of novelty, warmly espoused the cause of Antiochus, and gave their opinion, that the Romans should not even be admitted into the council; but, by the influence chiefly of the elder members, a vote was passed, that the council should give audience to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On being acquainted, by the Athenians, with this determination, Quinctius thought it desirable to go into Aetolia;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for he thought that, <quote>either he should be able to effect some change in their designs; or that it would be manifest to all mankind, that the blame of the war would lie on the Aetolians, and that the Romans would be warranted in taking arms by justice, and, <pb id="p.1588" n="1588"/>in a manner, by necessity.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On arriving there, Quinctius, in his discourse to the council, began with the first formation of the alliance between the Romans and the Aetolians, and enumerated how many times the faith of the treaty had been violated by them.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then enlarged a little on the rights of the states concerned in the dispute, and added, that, <quote>notwithstanding, if they thought that they had any reasonable demand to make, it would surely be infinitely better to send

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> ambassadors to Rome, whether they chose to argue the case or to make a request to the senate, than that the Roman people should enter the lists with Antiochus, while the Aetolians acted as marshals of the field; not without great disturbance to the affairs of the world, and to the utter ruin of Greece.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That <quote>no people would feel the fatal consequences of such a war sooner than the first promoters of it.</quote> This prediction of the Roman was disregarded.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thoas, and others of the same faction, were then heard with general approbation; and they prevailed so far, that, without adjourning the meeting, or waiting for the absence of the Romans, a decree was passed that Antiochus should be invited to vindicate the liberty of Greece, and decide the dispute between the Aetolians and the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To the insolence of this decree, their praetor, Damocritus, added a personal affront: for on Quinctius asking him for a copy of the decree, without any respect to the dignity of the person to whom he spoke, he told him, that <quote>he had, at present, more pressing business to despatch;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but he would shortly give him the decree, and an answer, in Italy, from his camp on the banks of the Tiber.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Such was the degree of madness which possessed, at that time, both the nation of the Aetolians and their magistrates.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius and the ambassadors returned to Corinth. The Aetolians, that they might appear to intend taking every step through Antiochus, and none directly of themselves, and, sitting inactive, to be waiting for the arrival of the king, though

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> they did not, after the departure of the Romans, hold a council of the whole nation, yet endeavoured, by their Apocleti, (a more confidential council, composed of persons selected from the rest,) to devise schemes for setting Greece in commotion.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was well known to them all, that in the several states the principal people, particularly those of the best characters, were disposed to maintain the Roman alliance, and well pleased <pb id="p.1589" n="1589"/>with the present state of affairs; but that the populace, and especially such as were not content with their position, wished for a general revolution.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Aetolians, at one day's sitting, formed a scheme, the very conception of which argued not only boldness, but impudence, &mdash;that of making themselves masters of Demetrias, Chalcis, and Lacedaemon. One of their principal men was sent to each of these places; Thoas to Chalcis, Alexamenus to Lacedaemon, Diocles to Demetrias.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This last was assisted by the exile Eurylochus, whose flight, and the cause of it, have been mentioned above, because there was no other prospect of his restoration to his country.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Eurylochus, by letter, instructed his friends and relations, and those of his own faction, to order his wife and children to assume a mourning dress:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and, holding the badges of supplicants, to go into a full assembly, and to beseech each individual, and the whole body, not to suffer a man, who was innocent and uncondemned, to grow old in exile. The simpleminded were moved by compassion; the ill-disposed and seditious, by the hope of seeing all things thrown into confusion, in consequence of the tumults which the Aetolians would excite; and every one voted for his being recalled.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These preparatory measures being effected, Diocles, at that time general of the horse, with all the cavalry, set out under pretext of escorting to his home the exile, who was his guest.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having, during that day and the following night, marched an extraordinary length of way, and arrived within six miles of the city at the first dawn, he chose out three troops, at the head of which he went on before the rest of the cavalry, whom he ordered to follow.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he came near the gate he made all his men dismount, and lead their horses by the reins, without keeping their ranks, but like travellers on a journey, in order that they might appear to be the retinue of the general, rather than a military force.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Here he left one troop at the gate, lest the cavalry, who were coming up, might be shut out; and then, holding Eurylochus by the hand, conducted him to his house through the middle of the city and the forum, and through crowds who met and congratulated him.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In a little time the city was filled with horsemen, and convenient posts were seized; and then parties were sent to the houses of persons of the opposite faction, to put them to death. In this manner Demetrias fell into the hands of the Aetolians. <pb id="p.1590" n="1590"/></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>




















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Lacedaemon, the city was not to be attempted by force, but the tyrant to be entrapped by stratagem.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For though he had been stripped of the maritime towns by the Romans, and afterwards shut up within the walls of his city by the Achaeans, they supposed that whoever took the first opportunity of killing him would engross the whole thanks of the Lacedaemonians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The pretence which they had for sending to him, was, that he had long solicited assistance from them, since, by their advice, he had renewed the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A thousand foot were put under the command of Alexamenus, with thirty horsemen, chosen from among the youth.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These received a charge from Damocritus, the praetor, in the select council of the nation, mentioned above, <quote>not to suppose that they were sent to a war with the Achaeans; or even on other business, which any one might ascertain to himself from his own conjectures. Whatever sudden enterprise circumstances might direct Alexamenus to undertake, that (however unexpected, rash, or daring) they were to hold themselves in readiness to execute with implicit obedience; and should understand that to be the matter, for the sole purpose of effecting which they had been sent abroad.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With these men, thus pre-instructed, Alexamenus came to the tyrant, and, immediately on approaching him, filled him with hopes; telling him, that <quote>Antiochus had already come over into Europe;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that he would shortly be in Greece, and would cover the lands and seas with men and arms; that the Romans would find that they had not Philip to deal with: that the numbers of the horsemen, footmen, and ships, could not be reckoned; and that the train of elephants, by their mere appearance, would effectually daunt the enemy:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that the Aetolians were prepared to come to Lacedaemon with their entire force, whenever occasion required; but that they wished to show the king, on his arrival, a numerous body of troops:

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that Nabis himself, likewise, ought to take care not to suffer his soldiers to be enervated by inaction, and dwelling in houses; but to lead them out, and make them perform their evolutions under arms, which, while it exercised their bodies, would also rouse their courage; that the labour would become lighter by practice, and might even be rendered not unpleasing by the affability and kindness of their commander.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thenceforward, the troops used frequently to be drawn out under the walls of the city, <pb id="p.1591" n="1591"/>in a plain near the river Eurotas. The tyrant's life-guards were generally posted in the centre.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He himself, attended by three horsemen at the most, of whom Alexamenus was commonly one, rode about in front, and went to view both wings to their extremities. On the right wing were the Aetolians; both those who had been before in his army as auxiliaries, and the thousand who came with Alexamenus.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Alexamenus made it his custom to ride about with Nabis through a few of the ranks, offering such advice as seemed most suitable;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> then to join his own troops in the right wing; and presently after, as if having given the orders which the occasion might require, to return to the tyrant.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But, on the day which he had fixed for the perpetration of the deed of death, after accompanying the tyrant for a little time, he withdrew to his own soldiers, and addressed the horsemen, sent from home with him, in these words:

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <quote>Young men, that deed is now to be dared and done which you were ordered to execute valiantly under my guidance.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Have your courage and your hands ready, that none may fail to second me in whatever he sees me attempt. If any one shall hesitate, and prefer any scheme of his own to mine, let him rest assured that there is no return to his home for him.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Horror seized them all, and they well remembered the charge which they had received at setting out. The tyrant was now coming from the left wing.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Alexamenus ordered his horsemen to rest their lances, and keep their eyes fixed on him; and in the mean time he himself re-collected his spirits, which had been discomposed by the meditation of such a desperate attempt. As soon as the tyrant came near, he charged him; and driving his spear through his horse, brought the rider to the ground.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The horsemen aimed their lances at him as he lay, and after many ineffectual strokes against his coat of mail, their points at length penetrated his body, so that, before relief could be sent from the centre, he expired.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Alexamenus, with all the Aetolians, hastened away, to seize on the palace. Nabis's life-guards were at first struck with horror, the act being

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> perpetrated before their eyes;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> then, when they observed the Aetolian troops leaving the place, they gathered round the tyrant's body, where it was left, forming, instead of guardians of his life or avengers of his death, a mere group of spectators. Nor would any one have stirred, <pb id="p.1592" n="1592"/>if Alexamenus had immediately called the people to an assembly, and, with his arms laid aside, there made a speech suitable to the occasion, and afterwards kept a good number of Aetolians in arms, without violence being offered to any one.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Instead of which, by a fatality which ought to attend all designs founded in treachery, every step was taken that could tend to hasten the destruction of those who had committed it.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The commander, shut up in the palace, wasted a day and a night in searching out the tyrant's treasures; and the Aetolians, as if they had stormed the city, of which they wished to be thought the deliverers, betook themselves to plunder.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The insolence of their behaviour, and at the same time contempt of their numbers, gave the Lacedaemonians courage to assemble in a body, when some said, that they ought to drive out the Aetolians, and resume their liberty, which had been ravished from them at the very time when it seemed to be restored; others, that, for the sake of appearance, they ought to associate with them some one of the royal family, as the director of their efforts.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was a very young boy of that family, named Laconicus, who had been educated with the tyrant's children; him they mounted on a horse, and taking arms, slew all the Aetolians whom they met straggling through the city. They then assaulted the palace, where they killed Alexamenus, who, with a small party, attempted resistance.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Others of the Aetolians, who had collected together round the Chalciaecon, that is, the brazen temple of Minerva, were cut to pieces. A few, throwing away their arms, fled, some to Tegea, others to Megalopolis, where they were seized by the magistrates, and sold as slaves.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Philop&oelig;men, as soon as he heard of the murder of the tyrant, went to Lacedaemon, where, finding all in confusion and consternation, he called together the principal inhabitants, to whom he addressed a discourse, (such as ought to have been made by Alexamenus,) and united the Lacedaemonians to the confederacy of the Achaeans.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To this they were the more easily persuaded, because, at that very juncture, Aulus Atilius happened to arrive at Gythium with twenty-four quinqueremes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile, Thoas, in his attempt on Chalcis, had by no means the same good fortune

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> as Eurylochus had in getting possession of Demetrias;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> although, (by the intervention of Euthymidas, a man of considerable consequence, who, after the <pb id="p.1593" n="1593"/>arrival of Titus Quinctius and the ambassadors, had been banished by those who adhered to the Roman alliance;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and also of Herodorus, who was a merchant of Cios, and who, by means of his wealth, possessed a powerful influence at Chalcis,) he had engaged a party, composed of Euthymidas's faction, to betray the city into his hands.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Euthymidas went from Athens, where he had fixed his residence, first to Thebes, and thence to Salganea; Herodorus to Thronium.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At a small distance, on the Malian bay, Thoas had two thousand foot and two hundred horse, with as many as thirty light transport ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With these vessels, carrying six hundred footmen, Herodorus was ordered to sail to the island of Atalanta, that, as soon as he should perceive the land forces approaching Aulus and the Euripus, he might pass over from thence to Chalcis;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> to which place Thoas himself led the rest of his forces, marching mostly by

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> night, and with all possible expedition.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mictio and Xenoclides, who were now, since the banishment of Euthymidas, in possession of the supreme power, either of themselves suspected the matter, or received some information of it, and were at first so greatly terrified, that they saw no prospect of safety but in flight;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but afterwards, when their fright subsided, and they considered that, by such a step, they would betray and desert not only their country, but the Roman alliance, they applied their minds to the following plan.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It happened that, at that very time, there was a solemn anniversary festival, celebrated at Eretria, in honour of Diana Amarynthis, which was always attended by great numbers, not only of the natives, but also of the Carystians:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> thither they sent envoys to beseech the Eretrians and Carystians, <quote>as having been born in the same isle, to compassionate their situation; and, at the same time, to show their regard to the friendship of Rome: not to suffer Chalcis to become the property of the Aetolians;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that if they should possess Chalcis they would obtain possession of all Eub&oelig;a: and to remind them, that they had found the Macedonians grievous masters, but that the Aetolians would be much more intolerable.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consideration of the Romans chiefly influenced those states, as they had lately experienced both their bravery in war, and their justice and liberality in success.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both states, therefore, armed, and sent the main strength of their young men. To these the people of Chalcis <pb id="p.1594" n="1594"/>intrusted the defence of the walls, and they themselves, with their whole force, crossed the Euripus, and encamped at Salganea.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From that place they despatched, first a herald, and afterwards ambassadors, to ask the Aetolians, for what word or act of theirs, friends and allies came thus to invade them.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thoas, commander of the Aetolians, answered, that <quote>he came not to attack them, but to deliver them from the Romans; that they were fettered at present with a brighter chain indeed, but a much heavier one, than when they had a Macedonian garrison in their citadel.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The men of Chalcis replied, that <quote>they were neither under bondage to any one, nor in need of the protection of any.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The ambassadors then withdrew from the meeting, and returned to their countrymen. Thoas and the Aetolians (who had no other hopes than in

<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> a sudden surprise, and were by no means in a capacity to undertake a regular war, and the siege of a city so well secured against any attack from the land or the sea) returned home.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Euthymidas, on hearing that his countrymen were encamped at Salganea, and that the Aetolians had retired, went back from Thebes to Athens.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Herodorus, after waiting several days at Atalanta, attentively watching for the concerted signal in vain, sent an advice-boat to learn the cause of the delay; and, understanding that the enterprise was abandoned by his associates, returned to Thronium from whence he had come.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius, having been informed of these proceedings, came with the fleet from Corinth, and met Eumenes in the Euripus of Chalcis.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was agreed between them, that king Eumenes should leave there five hundred of his soldiers, for the purpose of a garrison, and should go himself to Athens.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius proceeded to Demetrias, as he had purposed from the first, hoping that the relief of Chalcis would prove a strong inducement to the Magnetians to renew the alliance with Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And, in order that such of them as favoured his views might have some support at hand, he wrote to Eunomus, praetor of the Thessalians, to arm the youth; sending Villius forward to Demetrias, to sound the inclinations of the people: but not with a view to take any step in the business, unless a considerable number of them were disposed to revive the former treaty of amity.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Villius, in a ship of five banks of oars, came to the mouth of the harbour, and the whole multitude of the Magnetians hastened out thither. Villius then asked, <pb id="p.1595" n="1595"/>whether they chose that he should consider himself as having come to friends, or to enemies?

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Eurylochus, the Magnetarch, answered, that <quote>he had come to friends; but desired him not to enter the harbour, but to suffer the Magnetians to live in freedom and harmony; and not to attempt, under the show of friendly converse, to seduce the minds of the populace.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then followed an altercation, not a conference, the Roman upbraiding the Magnetians with ingratitude, and forewarning them of the calamities impending over them; the multitude, on the other side, clamorously reproaching him, and reviling, sometimes the senate, sometimes Quinctius.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Villius, therefore, unable to effect any part of his business, went back to Quinctius, who despatched orders to the Thessalian praetor, to lead his troops home, while himself returned with his ships to Corinth.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The affairs of Greece, blended with those of Rome, have carried me away, as it were, out of my course: not that they were in themselves deserving of a recital, but because they constituted the causes of the war with Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the consular election, for thence I digressed, the consuls, Lucius Quinctius and Cneius Domitius, repaired to their provinces; Quinctius to Liguria, Domitius against the Boians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Boians kept themselves quiet; nay, the senators, with their children, and the commanding officers of the cavalry, with their troops, amounting in all to one thousand five hundred, surrendered to the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul laid waste the country of the Ligurians to a wide extent, and took some forts: in which expeditions he not only acquired booty of all sorts, together with many prisoners, but he also recovered several of his countrymen, and of the allies, who had been in the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this year a colony was settled at Vibo, in pursuance of a decree of the senate and an order of the people; three thousand seven hundred footmen, and three hundred horsemen, went out thither, conducted by the commissioners Quintus Naevius, Marcus Minucius, and Marcus Furius Crassipes.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fifteen acres of ground were assigned to each footman, double that quantity to a horseman. This land had been last in possession of the Bruttians, who had taken it from the Greeks.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> About this time two dreadful causes of alarm happened at Rome, one of which continued long, but was less active than the other. An earthquake lasted through <pb id="p.1596" n="1596"/>thirty-eight days; during all which time there was a total cessation of business, amidst anxiety and fears. On account of this event, a supplication was performed of three days' continuance. The other was not a mere fright, but attended with the actual loss of many lives.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In consequence of a fire breaking out in the cattle-market, the conflagration, among the houses near to the Tiber, continued through all that day and the following night, and all the shops, with wares of very great value, were reduced to ashes.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year was now almost at an end, while the rumours of impending hostility, and, consequently, the anxiety of the senate, daily increased.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They therefore set about adjusting the provinces of the magistrates elect, in order that they might be all the more intent on duty.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They decreed, that those of the consuls should be Italy, and whatever other place the senate should vote, for every one knew that a war against Antiochus was now a settled point.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That he, to whose lot the latter province fell, should have under his command, &mdash;of Roman citizens, four thousand foot and three hundred horse; and of the Latin confederates, six thousand foot and four hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul, Lucius Quinctius, was ordered to levy these troops, that no delay might be occasioned, but that the new consul might be able to proceed immediately to any place which the senate should appoint.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Concerning the provinces of the praetors, also, it was decreed, that the first lot should comprehend the two jurisdictions, both that between natives, and that between them and foreigners; the second should be Bruttium; the third, the fleet, to sail wherever the senate should direct; the fourth, Sicily; the fifth, Sardinia; the sixth, Farther Spain.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> An order was also given to the consul Lucius Quinctius, to levy two new legions of Roman citizens, and of the allies and Latins twenty thousand foot and eight hundred horse. This army they assigned to the praetor to whom should fall the province of Bruttium.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Two temples were dedicated this year to Jupiter in the Capitol; one of which had been vowed by Lucius Furius Purpureo, when praetor during the Gallic war; the other by the same, when consul. Quintus Marcius Ralla, duumvir, dedicated both. Many severe sentences were passed this year on usurers, who were prosecuted, as private persons, by the curule aediles, Marcus Tuccius and Publius Junius Brutus.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <pb id="p.1597" n="1597"/>Out of the fines imposed on those who were convicted, gilded chariots, with four horses, were placed in the

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> recess of Jupiter's temple in the Capitol, over the canopy of the shrine, and also twelve gilded bucklers. The same aediles built a portico on the outside of the Triple Gate, in the Carpenters' Square.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Romans were busily employed in preparing for a new war, Antiochus, on his part, was not idle.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Three cities detained him some time, Smyrna, Alexandria in Troas, and Lampsacus, which hitherto he had not been able either to reduce by force, or to persuade into a treaty of amity; and he was unwilling, on going into Europe, to leave these behind (as enemies). A deliberation also respecting Hannibal occasioned him further delay.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> First, the open ships, which the king was to have sent with him to Africa, were slowly prepared, and afterwards a consultation was set on foot whether he ought to be sent at all, chiefly by Thoas the Aetolian;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> who, after setting all Greece in commotion, came with the account of Demetrias being in the hands of his countrymen; and as he had, by false representations concerning the king, and multiplying, in his assertions, the numbers of his forces, exalted the expectations of many in Greece;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> so now, by the same artifices, lie puffed up the hopes of the king; telling him, that "every one was inviting him with their prayers, and that there would be a general rush to the shore, from which the people could catch a view of the royal fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He even had the audacity to attempt altering the king's judgment respecting Hannibal when it was nearly settled. For he alleged, that <quote>the fleet ought not to be weakened by sending away any part of it, but that if ships must be

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> sent no person was less fit for the command than Hannibal, for he was an exile and a Carthaginian, to whom his own circumstances or his disposition might daily suggest a thousand new schemes.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then as to his military fame, by which, as by a dowry, he was recommended to notice, it was too splendid for an officer acting under a king.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king ought to be the grand object of view; the king ought to appear the sole leader, the sole commander. If Hannibal should lose a fleet or an army the amount of the damage would be the same as if the loss were incurred by any other general;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but should success be obtained, all the honour would be ascribed to Hannibal, and not to Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Besides, if the war should prove so fortunate as to terminate finally in <pb id="p.1598" n="1598"/>the defeat of the Romans, could it be expected that Hannibal would live under a king; subject, in short, to an individual; he who could scarcely bear subjection to his own country?

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That he had not so conducted himself from early youth, having embraced the empire of the globe in his hopes and aspirations, that in his old age he would be likely to endure a master. The king wanted not Hannibal as a general: as an attendant and a counsellor in the business of the war, he might properly employ him.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A moderate use of such abilities would be neither unprofitable nor dangerous;

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> but if advantages of the highest nature were sought through him, they, probably, would be the destruction both of the giver and the receiver.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There are no dispositions more prone to envy than those of persons whose mental qualifications are inferior to their birth and rank in life; because they are indignant both at the merit and the possessions of another. The design of the expedition, to be commanded by Hannibal, the only one thought of that could be of use, in the beginning of the war, was immediately laid aside.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king, highly flattered by the defection of Demetrias from the Romans to the Aetolians, resolved to delay no longer his departure into Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Before the fleet weighed anchor he went up from the shore to Ilium, to offer sacrifice to Minerva. Immediately on his return he set sail with forty decked ships and sixty open ones, followed by two hundred transports, laden with provisions and warlike stores.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He first touched at the island of Imbrus; thence he passed over to Sciathus; whence, after collecting the ships which had been separated during the voyage, he proceeded to Pteleum, the nearest part of the continent. Here, Eurylochus the Magnetarch, and other principal Magnetians from Demetrias, met him.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Being greatly gratified by their numerous appearance, he carried his fleet the next day into the harbour of their city.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At a small distance from the town he landed his forces, which consisted of ten thousand foot, five hundred horse, and six elephants; a force scarcely sufficient to take possession of Greece alone, much less to sustain a war with Rome. The Aetolians, as soon as they were informed of Antiochus's arrival at Demetrias, convened a general council, and passed a decree, inviting him into their country.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king had already left Demetrias, (for he knew that such a decree was to be passed,) and had advanced as far as Phalera <pb id="p.1599" n="1599"/>on the Malian bay.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here the decree was presented to him, and then he proceeded to Lamia, where he was received by the

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> populace with marks of the warmest attachment, with clapping of hands and shouting, and other signs by which the extravagant joy of the vulgar is testified.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he came into the council he was introduced by Phaeneas, the praetor, and other persons of eminence, who, with difficulty, made way for him through the crowd.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, silence being ordered, the king addressed himself to the assembly. He began with accounting for his having come with a force so much smaller than every one had hoped and expected.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>That,</quote> he said, <quote>ought to be deemed the strongest proof of the warmth of his good-will towards them; because, though he was not sufficiently prepared in any particular, and though the season was yet too early for sailing, he had, without hesitation, complied with the call of their ambassadors, and had believed that when the Aetolians should see him among them they would be satisfied that in

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> him, even if he were unattended, they might be sure of every kind of support.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But he would also abundantly fulfil the hopes of those, whose expectations seemed at present to be disappointed. For as soon as the season of the year rendered navigation safe, he would cover all Greece with arms, men, and horses, and all its coasts with fleets.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He would spare neither expense, nor labour, nor danger, until he should remove the Roman yoke from their necks, and render Greece really free, and the Aetolians the first among its states.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That, together with the armies, stores of all kinds were to come from Asia. For the present the Aetolians ought to take care that his men might be properly supplied with corn, and other accommodations, at reasonable rates.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having addressed them to this purport, and with universal approbation, the king withdrew.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After his departure a warm debate ensued between two of the Aetolian chiefs, Phaeneas and Thoas. Phaeneas declared his opinion, that it would be better to employ Antiochus, as a

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> mediator of peace, and an umpire respecting the matters in dispute with the Roman people, than as leader in a war. That <quote>his presence and his dignified station would impress the Romans with awe, more powerfully than his arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That in many cases men, for the sake of avoiding war, voluntarily remit preten- <pb id="p.1600" n="1600"/>sions, which force and arms would never compel them to forego.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thoas, on the other hand, insisted, that <quote>Phaeneas's motive was not a love of peace, but a wish to embarrass their preparations for war, with the view that, through the tediousness of the proceedings, the king's vigour might be relaxed, and the Romans gain time to put themselves in readiness.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That they had abundant proof from experience, after so many embassies sent to Rome, and so many conferences with Quinctius in person, that nothing reasonable could ever be obtained from the Romans in the way of negotiation; and that they would not, until every hope of that sort was out of sight, have implored the aid of Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That as he had appeared among them sooner than any had expected, they ought not to sink into indolence, but rather to petition the king, that since he had come in person, which was the great point of all, to support the rights of Greece, he would also send for his fleets and armies. For the king, at the head of an army, might obtain something, but without that could have very little influence with the Romans, either in the cause of the Aetolians, or even in his own.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This opinion was adopted, and the council voted, that the title of general should be conferred on the king. They also nominated thirty distinguished men with whom he might deliberate on any business which he might think proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> &mdash;The council was then broken up, and all went home to their respective states.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day the king held a consultation with their select council, respecting the place from whence his operations should commence.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They judged it best to make the first trial on Chalcis, which had lately been attempted in vain by the Aetolians; and they thought that the business required rather expedition than any great exertion or preparation.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly the king, with a thousand foot, who had followed him from Demetrias, took his route through Phocis; and the Aetolian chiefs, going by another road, met at Cheronaea a small number of their young men whom they had called to arms, and thence, in ten decked ships, proceeded after him. Antiochus pitched his camp at Salganea, while himself, with the Aetolian chiefs, crossed the Euripus in the ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had advanced a little way from the harbour, the magistrates and other chief men of Chalcis came out before their gate. A small number from each side met to confer together.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The <pb id="p.1601" n="1601"/>Aetolians warmly recommended to the others, <quote>without violating the friendship subsisting between them and the Romans, to receive the king also as a friend and ally; for that he had crossed into Europe not for the purpose of making war, but of vindicating the liberty of Greece; and of vindicating it in reality, not in words and pretence merely, as the Romans had done.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nothing could be more advantageous to the states of Greece than to embrace the alliance of both, as they would then be always secure against ill-treatment from either, under the guarantee and protection of the other.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If they refuse to receive the king, they ought to consider what they would have immediately to suffer;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the aid of the Romans being far distant, and Antiochus, whom with their own strength they could not possibly resist, in character of an enemy at their gates.</quote> To this Mictio, one of the Chalcian deputies, answered that <quote>he wondered who those people were, for the vindicating of whose liberty Antiochus had left his own kingdom, and come over into Europe.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For his part he knew not any state in Greece which either contained a garrison, or paid tribute to the Romans, or was bound by a disadvantageous treaty, and obliged to submit to terms which it did not like.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The people of Chalcis, therefore, stood not in need, either of any assertor of their liberty, which they already enjoyed, or of

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> any armed protector, since, through the kindness of the Roman people, they were in possession of both liberty and peace. They did not slight the friendship of the king, nor that of the Aetolians themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The first instance of friendship, therefore, that they could give, would be to quit the island and go home;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> for, as to themselves, they were fully determined not only not to admit them within their walls, but not even to agree to any alliance, but with the approbation of the Romans.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When an account of this conference was brought to the king, at the ships where lie had staid, he resolved for the present to return to Demetrias; for he had not come to them with a sufficient number of men to attempt any thing by force.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At Demetrias he held another consultation with the Aetolians, to determine what was next to be done, as their first effort had proved fruitless.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was agreed that they should make trial of the B&oelig;otians, Achaeans, and Amynander, king of the Athamanians. The B&oelig;otian nation they believed to have <pb id="p.1602" n="1602"/>been disaffected to the Romans, ever since the death of Brachyllas, and the consequences which followed it.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Philop&oelig;men, chief of the Achaeans, they supposed to hate, and be hated by, Quinctius, in consequence of a rivalship for fame in the war of Laconia.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Amynander had married Apama, daughter of a Megalopolitan, called Alexander, who, pretending to be descended from Alexander the Great, had given the names of Philip and Alexander to his two sons, and that of Apama to his daughter;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and when she was raised to distinction, by her marriage to the king, Philip, the elder of her brothers had followed her into Athamania.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This man, who happened to be naturally vain, the Aetolians and Antiochus persuaded to hope (as he was really of the royal family) for the sovereignty of Macedonia, on condition of his prevailing on Amynander and the Athamanians to join Antiochus;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and these empty promises produced the intended effect, not only on Philip but likewise on Amynander.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Achaia, the ambassadors of Antiochus and the Aetolians were admitted to an audience of the council

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> at Aegium, in the presence of Titus Quinctius. The ambassador of Antiochus was heard prior to the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He, with all that pomp and parade which is common among those who are maintained by the wealth of kings, covered, as far as the empty sound of words could go, both lands and seas (with forces). He said, that <quote>an innumerable body of cavalry was coming over the Hellespont into Europe; some of them cased in coats of mail, whom they call Cataphracti; others discharging arrows on horseback;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and, what rendered it impossible to guard against them, shooting with the surest aim even when their backs were turned, and their horses in full retreat.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To this army of cavalry, sufficient to crush the forces of all Europe, collected into one body,</quote> he added another of infantry of many times its number; and to terrify them, repeated the names of nations scarcely ever heard of before: talking of Dahans, Medes, Elymaeans, and Cadusians.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>As to the naval forces, no harbours in Greece were capable of containing them; the right squadron was composed of Sidonians and Tyrians; the left of Aradians and Sidetians, from Pamphylia, &mdash;nations which none others had ever equalled, either in courage, or skill in sea affairs.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, as to money, and other requisites for the support of war, it was needless for <pb id="p.1603" n="1603"/>him to speak. They themselves knew, that the kingdoms of Asia had always abounded in gold. The Romans, therefore, had not now to deal with Philip, or with Hannibal; the one a principal member of a commonwealth, the other confined merely to the limits of the kingdom of Macedonia; but with the great monarch of all Asia, and part of Europe.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless, though he had come from the remotest bounds of the East to give freedom to Greece, he did not demand any thing from the Achaeans, that could injure the fidelity of their engagements with the Romans, their former friends and allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For he did not require them to take arms on his side against them; but only, that they should not join themselves to either party. That, as became common friends, they should wish for peace to both parties, and not intermeddle in the war.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Archidamus, ambassador of the Aetolians, made nearly the same request: that, as was their easiest and safest way, they should stand neuter; and, as mere spectators of the war, wait for the decision of the fortunes of others, without any hazard to their own interests.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He afterwards was betrayed, by the intemperance of language, into invectives, sometimes against the Romans in general, sometimes against Quinctius himself in particular;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> charging them with ingratitude, and upbraiding them, as being indebted to the valour of the Aetolians, not only for the victory over Philip, but even for their preservation; for, <quote>by their exertions, both Quinctius himself and his army had been saved. What duty of a commander had he ever discharged?

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He used to see him, indeed, in the field, taking auspices; sacrificing, and offering vows, like an insignificant soothsaying priest; while he himself was, in his defence, exposing his person to the weapons of the enemy.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Quinctius replied, that <quote>Archidamus had calculated his discourse for the numerous auditors, rather than for the persons to whom it was particularly addressed.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the Achaeans very well knew, that the bold spirit of the Aetolians consisted entirely in words, not in deeds; and was more displayed in their councils and assemblies than in the field.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had therefore been indifferent concerning the sentiments of the Achaeans, to whom he and his countrymen were conscious that they were thoroughly known; and studied to recommend himself to the king's ambassadors, and, through <pb id="p.1604" n="1604"/>them, to their absent master.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, if any person had been hitherto ignorant of the cause which had united Antiochus and the Aetolians, it was easy to discover it from the language of their ambassadors. By the false representations made by both parties, and boasts of strength which neither possessed, they mutually puffed up each other; and were themselves puffed up with vain expectations:

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> one party talking of Philip being vanquished by them, the Romans being protected by their valour, and the rest of what you have just heard; and that you, and the other states and nations, would follow their party. The king, on the other side, boasting of clouds of horsemen and footmen, and covering the seas with his fleets.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king,</quote> he added, <quote>was exceedingly like a supper that I remember at the house of my host at Chalcis, who is both a man of worth, and an excellent conductor of a feast. Having been kindly entertained by him at midsummer, when we wondered how he could, at that time of the year, procure such plenty and variety of game, he, not

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> being so vain-glorious as these men, told us, with a pleasant smile, that the variety was owing to the dressing, and that what appeared to be the flesh of many different wild animals, was entirely of tame swine.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This may be aptly applied to the forces of the king, which were so ostentatiously displayed a while ago; that those various kinds of armour, and multitudinous names of nations, never heard of before, Dahans, and Medes, and Caducians, and Elymaeans, are nothing more than Syrians, a race possessed of such grovelling souls, as to be much fitter for slaves than for soldiers.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I wish, Achaeans, that I could exhibit to your view the rapid excursions of this mighty monarch from Demetrias; first, to Lamia, to the council of the Aetolians; then to Chalcis. You should behold, in the royal camp, about the number of two small legions, and these incomplete.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> You should see the king, now, in a manner begging corn from the Aetolians, to be measured out to his soldiers; then, striving to borrow money at interest to pay them; again, standing at the gates of Chalcis, and presently, on being refused admittance, returning thence into Aetolia, without having effected any thing, except indeed the taking a peep at Aulis and the Euripus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Both Antiochus had done wrong in trusting to the Aetolians, and the Aetolians in trusting to the king's vain boastings. For which reason, you ought the less to be deceived by them, and <pb id="p.1605" n="1605"/>rather to confide in the tried and approved fidelity of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For, with respect to your not interfering in the war, which they recommend as your best course, nothing, in fact, can be more contrary to your interest:

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> for then, without gaining thanks or esteem, you will become the prize of the conqueror.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He was thought to have replied to both by no means unsuitably; and there was no difficulty in bringing an audience, prepossessed in his favour, to give their approbation to his discourse.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In fact, there was no debate or doubt started, but all concurred in voting, that the nation of the Achaeans would regard, as their friends or foes, those who were judged to be such by the Roman people, and in ordering war to be declared against both Antiochus and the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They also, by the direction of Quinctius, sent immediate succours of five hundred men to Chalcis, and five hundred to the Piraeus;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for affairs at Athens were in a state not far from a civil war, in consequence of the endeavours, used by some, to seduce the venal populace, by hopes of largesses, to take part with Antiochus. But at length Quinctius was called thither by those who were of the Roman party; and Apollodorus, the principal adviser of a revolt, being publicly charged therewith by one Leon, was condemned and driven into exile.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus, from the Achaeans also, the embassy returned to the king with a discouraging answer. The B&oelig;otians made no definitive reply; they only said, that <quote>when Antiochus should come into B&oelig;otia, they would then deliberate on the measures proper to be pursued.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Antiochus heard, that both the Achaeans and king Eumenes had sent reinforcements to Chalcis, he resolved to act with the utmost expedition, that his troops might get the start of them, and, if possible, intercept the others as they came; and he sent thither Menippus with about three thousand soldiers, and Polyxenidas with the whole fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In a few days after, he marched himself, at the head of six thousand of his own soldiers, and a smaller number of Aetolians, as many as could be collected in haste, out of those who were at Lamia.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The five hundred Achaeans, and a small party sent by king Eumenes, being guided by Xenoclides, of Chalcis, (the roads being yet open,) crossed the Euripus, and arrived at Chalcis in safety.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Roman sol- diers, who were likewise about five hundred, came, after Me- <pb id="p.1606" n="1606"/>nippus had fixed his camp under Salganea, at Hermaeus, the place of passage from B&oelig;otia to the island of Eub&oelig;a.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They had with them Mictio, who had been sent from Chalcis to Quinctius, deputed to solicit that very reinforcement;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and when he perceived that the passes were blocked up by the enemy, he quitted the road to Aulis, and turned away to Delium, with intent to pass over thence to Eub&oelig;a.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Delium is a temple of Apollo, standing over the sea, five miles distant from Tanagra; and the passage thence, to the nearest part of Eub&oelig;a, is less than four miles.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As they were in this sacred building and grove, sanctified with all that religious awe and those privileges which belong to temples, called by the Greeks asylums, (war not being yet either proclaimed, or so far commenced as that they had heard of swords being drawn, or blood shed any where,) the soldiers, in perfect tranquillity, amused themselves, some with viewing the temple and groves;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> others with walking about unarmed, on the strand; and a great part had gone different ways in quest of wood and forage; when, on a sudden, Menippus attacked them in that scattered condition, slew many, and took fifty of them prisoners.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Very few made their escape, among whom was Mictio, who was received on board a small trading vessel. Though this event caused much grief to Quinctius and the Romans, on account of the loss of

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> their men, yet it seemed to add much to the justification of their cause in making war on Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Antiochus, when arrived with his army so near as Aulis, sent again to Chalcis a deputation, composed partly of his own people, and partly of Aetolians, to treat on the same grounds as before, but with heavier denunciations of vengeance: and, notwithstanding all the efforts of Mictio and Xenoclides to the contrary, he easily gained his object, that the gates should be opened to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those who adhered to the Roman interest, on the approach of the king, withdrew from the city. The soldiers of the Achaeans, and Eumenes, held Salganea; and the few Romans, who had escaped, raised, for the security of the place, a little fort on the Euripus.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Menippus laid siege to Salganea, and the king himself to the fort. The Achaeans and Eumenes' soldiers first surrendered, on the terms of being allowed to retire in safety. The Romans defended the Euripus with more obstinacy.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But even these, when they were completely invested both by land and <pb id="p.1607" n="1607"/>sea, and saw the machines and engines prepared for an assault, sustained the siege no longer.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The king, having thus got possession of the capital of Eub&oelig;a, the other cities of the island did not even refuse to obey his authority; and he seemed to himself to have signalized the commencement of the war by an important acquisition, in having brought under his power so great an island, and so many cities conveniently situated.</p></div1> <div1 type="book" n="36"><head>BOOK XXVI.</head>

in which the Romans are victorious.</p></argument>



<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PUBLIUS CORNELIUS SCIPIO, son of Cneius, and Manius Acilius Glabrio, the consuls, on their assuming the administration, were ordered by

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the senate, before they settled any thing respecting their provinces, to perform sacrifices, with victims of the greater kinds, at all the shrines, where the Lectisternium was usually celebrated for the greater part of the year; and to offer prayers, that the business which the state had in contemplation, concerning a new war, might terminate prosperously and happily for the senate and people of Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At every one of those sacrifices, appearances were favourable, and the propitious omens were found in the first victims. Accordingly, the auspices gave this answer: &mdash;That, by this war, the boundaries of the Roman empire would be enlarged; and that victory and triumph were portended.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When this answer was reported, the senate, having their minds now freed from superstitious fears, ordered this question to be proposed to the people;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>Was it their will, and did they order, that war should be undertaken against king Antiochus, and all who should join his party?</quote> And that if that <pb id="p.1608" n="1608"/>order passed, then the consuls were, if they thought proper, to lay the business entire before the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius Cornelius got the order passed; and then the senate decreed, that the consuls should cast lots for the provinces of Italy and Greece; that he to whose lot Greece fell, should, in addition to the number of soldiers enlisted and raised from the allies by Quinctius for that province, pursuant to a decree of the senate, take under his command that army, which, in the

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> preceding year, Marcus Baebius, praetor, had, by order of the senate, carried over to Macedonia. Permission was also granted him, to receive succours from the allies, out of Italy, if circumstances should so require, provided their number did not exceed five thousand.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was resolved, that Lucius Quinctius, consul of the former year, should be commissioned as a lieutenant-general in that war.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The other consul, to whom Italy fell, was ordered to carry on the war with the Boians, with whichever he should choose of the two armies commanded by the consuls of the last year; and to send the other to Rome; and these were ordered to be the city legions, and ready to march to whatever place the senate should direct.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Things being thus adjusted in the senate, excepting the assignment of his particular province to each of the magistrates, the consuls were ordered to cast lots. Greece fell to Acilius, Italy to Cornelius.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The lot of each being now determined, the senate passed a decree, that <quote>inasmuch as the Roman people had, at that time, ordered war to be declared against king Antiochus, and those who were under his government, the consuls should command a supplication to be performed, on account of that business; and that Manius Acilius, the consul, should vow the great games to Jupiter, and offerings at all the shrines.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This vow was made by the consul in these words, which were dictated by Publius Licinius, chief pontiff: <quote>If the war, which the people has ordered to be undertaken against king Antiochus, shall be concluded agreeably to the wishes of the senate and

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> people of Rome, then, O Jupiter, the Roman people will, through ten successive days, exhibit the great games in honour of thee, and offerings shall be presented at all the shrines, of such value as the senate shall direct.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whatever magistrate shall celebrate those games, and at whatever time and place, let the celebration be deemed proper, and the offerings rightly and duly made.</quote> The two <pb id="p.1609" n="1609"/>consuls then proclaimed a supplication for two days.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the consuls had determined their provinces by lot, the praetors, likewise, immediately cast lots for theirs. The two civil jurisdictions fell to Marcus Junius Brutus; Bruttium, to Aulus Cornelius Mammula; Sicily, to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus; Sardinia, to Lucius Oppius Salinator; the fleet, to Caius Livius Salinator; and Farther Spain, to Lucius Aemilius Paullus.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The troops for these were settled thus: &mdash;to Aulus Cornelius were assigned the new soldiers, raised last year by Lucius Quinctius, the consul, pursuant to the senate's decree; and he was ordered to defend the whole coast near Tarentum and Brundusium.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lucius Aemilius Paullus was directed to take with him into Farther Spain, (to fill up the numbers of the army, which he was to receive from Marcus Fulvius, propraetor,) three thousand new-raised foot and three hundred horse, of whom two-thirds should be Latin allies, and the other third Roman citizens.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> An equal reinforcement was sent to Hither Spain to Caius Flaminius, who was continued in command. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was ordered to receive both the province and army from Lucius Valerius, whom he was to succeed;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and, if he thought proper, to retain Lucius Valerius, as pro-praetor, in the

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> province, which he was to divide with him in such a manner, that one division should reach from Agrigentum to Pachynum, and the other from Pachynum to Tyndarium, and the sea-coasts whereof Lucius Valerius was to protect with a fleet of twenty ships of war.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The same praetor received a charge to levy two-tenths of corn, and to take care that it should be carried to the coast, and thence conveyed into Greece.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Lucius Oppius was likewise commanded to levy a second tenth in Sardinia; but it was resolved that it should be transported, not into Greece, but to Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Caius Livius, the praetor, whose lot was the command of the fleet, was ordered to sail, at the earliest time possible, to Greece with thirty ships, which were ready, and to receive the other fleet from Atilius.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The praetor, Marcus Junius, was commissioned to refit and arm the old ships which were in the dock-yards; and, for this fleet, to enlist the sons of freemen as crews.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Commissaries were sent into Africa, three to Carthage, and a like number to Numidia, to procure corn to be carried into Greece; for which the Roman people were to pay the <pb id="p.1610" n="1610"/>value.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so attentive was the state to the making of every preparation and provision necessary for the carrying on of this

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> war, that the consul, Publius Cornelius, published an edict, that <quote>no senator, nor any who had the privilege of giving an opinion in the senate, nor any of the inferior magistrates, should go so far from the city of Rome as that they could not return the same day; and that five senators should not be absent from the city at the same time.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A dispute which arose with the maritime colonies, for some time retarded Caius Livius, the praetor, when actively engaged in fitting out the fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For, when they were impressed for manning the ships, they appealed to the tribunes of the people, by whom the cause was referred to the senate. The senate, without one dissenting voice, resolved, that those colonies were not entitled to exemption from the sea-service.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The colonies which disputed with the praetor on the subject of exemption were, Ostia, Fregenae, Castrumnovum, Pyrgi, Antium, Tarracina, Minturnae, and Sinuessa.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul, Manius Acilius, then, by direction of the senate, consulted the college of heralds, <quote>whether a declaration of war should be made to Antiochus in person, or whether it would be sufficient to declare it at some garrison town; whether they directed a separate declaration against the Aetolians, and whether their alliance and friendship ought not to be renounced before war was declared.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The heralds answered, that <quote>they had given their judgment before, when they were consulted respecting Philip, that it was of no consequence whether the declaration were made to himself in person, or at one of his garrisons.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That, in their opinion, friendship had been already renounced; because, after their ambassadors had so often demanded restitution, the Aetolians had not thought proper to make either restitution or apology.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That these, by their own act, had made a declaration of war against themselves, when they

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> seized, by force, Demetrias, a city in alliance with Rome;

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> when they laid siege to Chalcis by land and sea; and brought king Antiochus into Europe, to make war on the Romans.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Every preparatory measure being now completed, the consul, Manius Acilius, issued an edict, that the <quote>soldiers enlisted, or raised from among the allies by Titus Quinctius, and who were under orders to go with him to his province; as, likewise, the military tribunes of the first and third legions, should <pb id="p.1611" n="1611"/>assemble at Brundusium, on the ides of May.</quote><note>15th May.</note> He himself, on the fifth before the nones of May,<note>3rd May.</note> set out from the city in his military robe of command.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At the same time the praetors, likewise, departed for their respective provinces.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A little before this time, ambassadors came to Rome from the two kings, Philip of Macedonia and Ptolemy of Egypt, offering aid of men, money, and corn towards the support of the war. From Ptolemy was brought a thousand pounds' weight of gold, and twenty thousand pounds' weight of silver.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> None of this was accepted. Thanks were returned to the kings. Both of them offered to come, with their whole force, into Aetolia.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Ptolemy was excused from that trouble; and Philip's ambassadors were answered, that the senate and people of Rome would consider it as a kindness if he should lend his assistance to the consul, Manius Acilius.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Ambassadors came, likewise from the Carthaginians, and from king Masinissa. The Carthaginians made an offer of sending a thousand pecks<note>Here is, doubtless, some word dropped in the original; so small a quantity could never have been deemed an object for one powerful state to offer to another. Commentators suppose

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> it to have been <hi rend="italics">one hundred</hi> thousand.</note> of wheat, and five hundred thousand of barley to the army, and half that quantity to Rome; which they requested the Romans to accept from them as a

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> present. They also offered to fit out a fleet

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> at their own expense, and to give in, immediately, the whole amount of the annual tribute-money which they were bound to pay for many years to come. The ambassadors of Masinissa promised, that their king should send five hundred thousand pecks of wheat, and three

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> hundred thousand of barley, to the army in Greece, and three hundred thousand of wheat, and two hundred and fifty thousand of barley, to Rome; also five hundred horse, and twenty elephants, to the consul Acilius. The answer given to both, with regard to the corn, was, that the Roman people would make use of it, provided they would receive payment for the same. With regard to the

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> fleet offered by the Carthaginians, no more was accepted than such ships as they owed by treaty; and, as to the money, they were told, that none would be taken before the regular days of payment.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were occurring at Rome, Antiochus, <pb id="p.1612" n="1612"/>during the winter season at Chalcis, endeavoured to bring over several of the states by ambassadors sent among them; while many of their own accord sent deputies to him; as the Epirots, by the general voice of the nation, and the Eleans from Peloponnesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Eleans requested aid against the Achaeans; for they supposed, that, since the war had been declared against Antiochus contrary to their judgment, the Achaeans would first turn their arms against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> One thousand foot were sent to them, under the command of Euphanes, a Cretan. The embassy of the Epirots showed no mark whatever of a liberal or candid disposition. They wished to ingratiate themselves with the king; but, at the same time, to avoid giving cause of displeasure to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They requested him, <quote>not hastily to make them a party in the dispute, exposed, as they were, opposite to Italy, and in the front of Greece, where they must necessarily undergo the first assaults of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If he himself, with his land and sea forces, could take charge of Epirus, the inhabitants would eagerly receive him in all their ports and cities. But if circumstances allowed him not to do that, then they earnestly entreated him not to subject them, naked and defenceless, to the arms of the Romans.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their intention in sending him this message evidently was, that if he declined going into Epirus, which they rather supposed would be the case, they were not implicated with relation to the Roman armies, while they sufficiently recommended themselves to the king by their willingness to receive him on his coming;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and that, on the other hand, if he should come, even then they would have hopes of being pardoned by the Romans, for having yielded to the strength of a prince who was present among them, without waiting for succour from them, who were so far distant.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this so evasive embassy, as he did not readily think of a proper answer, he replied, that he would send ambassadors to them to confer upon such matters as were of common concernment both to him and them.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Antiochus went himself into B&oelig;otia, holding out ostensibly those causes of resentment against the Romans which I have already mentioned, &mdash;the death of Brachyllas, and the attack made by Quinctius on Coronea, on account of the massacre of the Roman soldiers;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> while the real ones were, that the former excellent policy of that nation, with respect both <pb id="p.1613" n="1613"/>to public and private concerns, had, for several generations, been on the decline; and that great numbers were in such circumstances, that they could not long subsist without some change in affairs.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Through multitudes of the principal B&oelig;otians, who every where flocked out to meet him, he arrived at Thebes. There, notwithstanding that he had (both at Delium, by the attack made on the Roman troops, and also at Chalcis) already commenced hostilities, by enterprises of neither a trifling nor of a dubious nature, yet, in a general council of the nation, he delivered a speech of the same import with that which he delivered in the first conference at Chalcis, and that used by his ambassadors in the council of the Achaeans;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that <quote>what he required of them was, to form a league of friendship with him, not to declare war against the Romans.</quote> But not a man among them was ignorant of his meaning.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> However, a decree, disguised under a slight covering of words, was passed in his favour against the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After securing this nation also on his side, he returned to Chalcis; and, having despatched letters, summoning the chief Aetolians to meet him at Demetrias, that he might deliberate with them on the general plan of operations, he came thither with his ships on the day appointed for the council.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Amynander, likewise, was called from Athamania to the consultation; and Hannibal the Carthaginian, who, for a long time before, had not been asked to attend, was present at this assembly.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The subject of their deliberation was in reference to the Thessalian nation; and every one present was of opinion, that their concurrence ought to be sought.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The only points on which opinions differed were, that some thought the attempt ought to be made immediately; while others judged it better to defer it for the winter season, which was then about half spent, until the beginning of spring.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Some advised to send ambassadors only; others, that the king should go at the head of all his forces, and if they hesitated, terrify them into compliance.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>






















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although the present debate turned chiefly on these points, Hannibal, being called on by name to give his opinion, led the king, and those who were present, into the consideration of the general conduct of the war, by a speech to this effect:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;<quote>If I had been employed in your councils since we came first into Greece, when you were consulting about <pb id="p.1614" n="1614"/>Eub&oelig;a, the Achaeans, and B&oelig;otians, I would have offered the same advice which I shall offer you this day, when your thoughts are employed about the Thessalians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> My opinion is, that, above all things, Philip and the Macedonians should by some means or other be brought into a participation in this war.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For, as to Eub&oelig;a, as well as the B&oelig;otians and Thessalians, who can doubt that, having no strength of their own, they will ever court the power that is present; and will make use of the same fear, which governs their councils, as an argument for obtaining pardon?

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That, as soon as they shall see a Roman army in Greece, they will turn away to that government to which they have been accustomed? Nor are they to blame, if, when the Romans were at so great a distance, they did not choose to try your force, and that of your army, who were on the spot.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> How much more advisable, therefore, and more advantageous would it be, to unite Philip to us, than these; as, if he once embarks in the cause, he will have no room for retreat, and as he will bring with him such a force, as will not only be an accession to a power at war with Rome, but was able, lately, of itself, to withstand the Romans!

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With such an ally, (I wish to speak without offence,) how could I harbour a doubt about the issue; when I should see the very persons through whom the Romans prevailed against Philip, now ready to act against them? The Aetolians, who, as all agree, conquered Philip, will fight in conjunction with Philip against the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Amynander and the Athamanian nation, who, next to the Aetolians, performed the greatest services in that war, will stand on our side.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Philip, at the time when you remained inactive, sustained the whole burden of the war.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now, you and he, two of the greatest kings, will, with the force of Asia and Europe, wage war against one state; which, to say nothing of my own fortune with them, either prosperous or adverse, was certainly, in the memory of our fathers, unequal to a dispute with a single king of Epirus; what then, I say, must it be in competition with you two? But it may be asked, What circumstances induce me to believe that Philip may be brought to a union with us?

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> First, common utility, which is the strongest cement of union; and next, you, Aetolians, are yourselves my informants.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For Thoas, your ambassador, among the other arguments which he used to urge, for the purpose of drawing Antiochus into <pb id="p.1615" n="1615"/>Greece, always above all things insisted upon this, &mdash;that Philip expressed extreme indignation that the conditions of servitude had been imposed on him under the appearance of conditions of peace: comparing the king's anger to that of a wild beast chained, or shut up, and wishing to break the bars that confined it.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Now, if his temper of mind is such, let us loose his chains; let us break these bars, that he may vent, upon the common foe, this anger so long pent up. But should our embassy fail of producing any effect on him, let us then take care, that if we cannot unite him to ourselves, he may not be united to our enemies.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Your son, Seleucus, is at Lysimachia; and if, with the army which he has there, he shall pass through Thrace, and once begin to make depredations on the nearest parts of Macedonia, he will effectually divert Philip from carrying aid to the Romans, to the protection, in the first place, of his own dominions.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such is my opinion respecting Philip. With regard to the general plan of the war, you have, from the beginning, been acquainted with my sentiments:

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> and if my advice had been listened to, the Romans would not now hear that Chalcis in Eub&oelig;a was taken, and a fort on the Euripus reduced, but that Etruria, and the whole coast of Liguria and Cisalpine Gaul, were in a blaze of war; and, what is to them the greatest cause of alarm, that Hannibal was in Italy. Even as matters stand at present, I recommend it to you, to call home all your land and sea forces; let storeships with provisions follow the fleet; for, as we are here too few for the exigencies of the war, so are we too many for the scanty supplies of necessaries.

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> When you shall have collected together the whole of your force, you will divide the fleet, and keep one division stationed at Corcyra, that the Romans may not have a clear and safe passage;

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> and the other you will send to that part of the coast of Italy which is opposite Sardinia and Africa; while you yourselves, with all the land forces, will proceed to the territory of Bullium.

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> In this position you will hold the command of all Greece; you will give the Romans reason to think, that you intend to sail over to Italy; and you will be in readiness so to do, if occasion require.

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> This is my advice; and though I may not be the most skilful in every kind of warfare, yet surely I must have learned, in a long series of both good and bad fortune, how to wage war against the Romans. For the execution of <pb id="p.1616" n="1616"/>the measures which I have advised, I promise you my most faithful and zealous endeavours.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Whatever plan you shall consider the best, may the gods grant it their approbation.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such, nearly, was the counsel given by Hannibal, which the hearers rather commended at the time, than actually executed. For not one article of it was carried into effect, except the sending Polyxenidas to bring over the fleet and army from Asia. Ambassadors were sent to Larissa, to the diet of the Thessalians.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Aetolians and Amynander appointed a day for the assembling of their troops at Pherae, and the king with his forces came thither immediately.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While he waited there for Amynander and the Aetolians, he sent Philip, the Megalopolitan, with two thousand men, to collect the bones of the Macedonians round Cynoscephalae, where the final battle had been fought with king Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> being advised to this, either in order to gain favour with the Macedonians and draw their displeasure on the king for having left his soldiers unburied, or having of himself, through the spirit of vain-glory incident to kings, conceived such a design, &mdash;splendid indeed in appearance, but really insignificant. There is a mount there formed of the bones which had been scattered about, and were then collected into one heap.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although this step procured him no thanks from the Macedonians, yet it excited the heaviest displeasure of Philip;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> in consequence of which, he who had hitherto intended to regulate his counsels by the fortune of events, now sent instantly a message to the propraetor, Marcus Baebius, that <quote>Antiochus had made an irruption into Thessaly; that, if he thought proper, he should move out of his winter quarters, and that he himself would advance to meet him, that they might consider together what was proper to be done.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Antiochus lay encamped near Pherae, where the Aetolians and Amynander had joined him, ambassadors came to him from Larissa, desiring to know on account of what acts or words of theirs he had made war on the Thessalians;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> at the same time requesting him to withdraw his army; and that if there seemed to him any necessity for it he would discuss it with them by commissioners.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the mean time, they sent five hundred soldiers, under the command of Hippolochus, to Pherae, as a reinforcement; but these, being debarred of access by the king's troops, who blocked up all the roads, retired to <pb id="p.1617" n="1617"/>Scotussa.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king answered the Larissan ambassadors in mild terms, that <quote>he came into their country, not with a design of making war, but of protecting and establishing the liberty of the Thessalians.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He sent a person to make a similar declaration to the people of Pherae; who, without giving him any answer, sent to the king, in the capacity of ambassador, Pausanias, the first magistrate of their state.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He offered remonstrances of a similar kind with those which had been urged in behalf of the people of Chalcis, at the first conference, on the strait of the Euripus, as the cases were similar, and urged some with a greater degree of boldness;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> on which the king desired that they would consider seriously before they adopted a resolution, which, while they were overcautious and provident of futurity, would give them immediate cause of repentance, and then dismissed him.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the Pheraeans were acquainted with the result of this embassy, without the smallest hesitation they determined to endure whatever the fortune of war might bring on them, rather than violate their engagements with the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They accordingly exerted their utmost efforts to provide for the defence of their city; while the king, on his part, resolved to assail the walls on every side at once;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and considering, what was evidently the case, that it depended on the fate of this city, the first which he had besieged, whether he should for the future be despised or dreaded by the whole nation of the Thessalians, he put in practice every where all possible means of striking them with terror.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The first fury of the assault they supported with great firmness; but in some time, great numbers of their men being either slain or wounded, their resolution began to fail.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Having soon been so reanimated by the rebukes of their leaders, as to resolve on persevering in their resistance, and having abandoned the exterior circle of the wall, as their numbers now began to fail, they withdrew to the interior part of the city, round which had been raised a fortification of less extent. At last, being overcome by distress, and fearing that if they were taken by storm they might meet no mercy from the conqueror, they capitulated.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The king then lost no time; but while the alarm was fresh, sent four thousand men against Scotussa, which surrendered without delay, observing the recent example of those in Pherae; who, at length compelled by sufferings, had done that which <pb id="p.1618" n="1618"/>at first they had obstinately refused.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Together with the town, Hippolochus and the Larissan garrison were yielded to him, all of whom were dismissed uninjured by the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> who hoped that such behaviour would operate powerfully towards conciliating the esteem of the Larissans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having accomplished all this within the space of ten days after his arrival at Pherae, he marched with his whole force to Cranon, which he took immediately on his arrival.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then took Cypaera and Metropolis, and the forts which lay around them; and now every town in all that tract was in his power, except Atrax and Gyrton.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He next resolved to lay siege to Larissa, for he thought that (either through dread inspired by the storming of the other towns, or in consideration of his kindness in dismissing the troops of their garrison, or being led by the example of so many cities surrendering themselves) they would not continue longer in their obstinacy.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having ordered the elephants to advance in front of the battalions, for the purpose of striking terror, he approached the city with his army in order of battle, on which the minds of a great number of the Larissans became irresolute and perplexed, between their fears of the enemy at their gates, and their respect for their distant allies.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Meantime, Amynander, with the Athamanian troops, seized on Pellinaeus; while Menippus, with three thousand Aetolian foot and two hundred horse, marched into Perrhaebia, where he took Mallaea and Cyretiae by assault, and ravaged the lands of Tripolis.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After executing these enterprises with despatch, they returned to the king at Larissa just when he was holding a council on the method of proceeding with regard to that place.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On this occasion there were opposite opinions: for some thought that force should be applied; that there was no time to be lost, but that the walls should be immediately attacked with works and machines on all sides at once; especially as the city stood in a plain, the entrances open, and the approaches every where level.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While others represented at one time the strength of the city, greater beyond comparison than that of Pherae;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> at another, the approach of the winter season, unfit for any operation of war, much more so for besieging and assaulting cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While the king's judgment was in suspense between hope and fear, his courage was raised by ambassadors happening to arrive just at the time <pb id="p.1619" n="1619"/>from Pharsalus, to make surrender of their city. In the mean time Marcus Baebius had a meeting with Philip in Dassaretia; and, in conformity to their joint opinion, sent Appius Claudius to reinforce Larissa, who, making long marches through Macedonia, arrived at that summit of the mountains which overhang Gonni.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The town of Gonni is twenty miles distant from Larissa, standing at the opening of the valley called Tempe. Here, by laying out his camp more widely than his numbers required, and kindling more fires than were necessary, he imposed on the enemy the opinion which he wished, that the whole Roman army was there, and king Philip along with them.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Antiochus, therefore, pretending the near approach of winter as his motive, staid but one day longer, then withdrew from Larissa, and returned to Demetrias. The Aetolians and Athamanians retired to their respective countries. Appius, although he saw that, by the siege being raised, the purpose of his commission was fulfilled, yet resolved to go down to Larissa, to strengthen the resolution of the allies against future contingencies.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thus the Larissans enjoyed a twofold happiness, both because the enemy had departed from their country,

<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> and because they saw a Roman garrison within their city.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Antiochus went from Demetrias to Chalcis, where he became captivated with a young woman, daughter of Cleoptolemus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he had plied her father, who was unwilling to connect himself with a condition in life involving such serious consequences, first by messages, and afterwards by personal importunities, and had at length gained his consent; he celebrated his nuptials in the same manner as if it were a time of profound peace. Forgetting the two important undertakings in which he was at once engaged, &mdash;the war with Rome, and the liberating of Greece, &mdash;he banished every thought of business from his mind, and spent the remainder of winter in feasting and the pleasures connected with wine; and then in sleep, produced rather by fatigue than by satiety with these things.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The same spirit of dissipation seized all his officers who commanded in the several winter quarters, particularly those stationed in B&oelig;otia, and even the common men abandoned themselves to the same indulgences;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> not one of whom ever put on his armour, or kept watch or guard, or did any part of the duty or business of a soldier.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When, <pb id="p.1620" n="1620"/>therefore, in the beginning of spring, the king came through Phocis to Chaeronea, where he had appointed the general assembly of all the troops, he perceived at once that the soldiers had spent the winter under discipline no more rigid than that of their commander.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He ordered Alexander, an Acarnanian, and Menippus, a Macedonian, to lead his forces thence to Stratum, in Etolia; and he himself, after offering sacrifice to Apollo at Delphi, proceeded to Naupactum.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After holding a council of the chiefs of Aetolia, he went by the road which leads by Chalcis and Lysimachia to Stratum, to meet his army, which was coming along the Malian bay.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here Mnasilochus, a man of distinction among the Acarnanians, being bribed by many presents, not only laboured himself to dispose that nation in favour of the king, but had brought to a concurrence in the design their praetor, Clytus, who was at that time invested with the highest authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This latter, finding that the people of Leucas, the capital of Acarnania, could not be easily seduced to defection, because they were afraid of the Roman fleets, one under Atilius, and another at Cephallenia, practised an artifice against them. He observed in the council, that the inland parts of Acarnania should be guarded from danger, and that all who were able to bear arms ought to march out to Medio and Thurium, to prevent those places from being seized by Antiochus, or the Aetolians;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> on which there were some who said, that there were no necessity for all the people to be called out in that hasty manner, for a body of five hundred men would be sufficient for the purpose.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Having got this number of soldiers at his disposal, he placed three hundred in garrison at Medio, and two hundred at Thurium, with the design that they should fall into the hands of the king, and serve hereafter as hostages.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time, ambassadors from the king came to Medio, whose proposal being heard, the assembly began to consider what answer should be returned to the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when some advised to adhere to the alliance with Rome, and others, not to reject the friendship of the king; but Clitus offered an opinion, which seemed to take a middle course between the other two, and which was therefore adopted.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was, that ambassadors should be sent to the king, to request of him to allow the people of Medio to deliberate on a subject of such great importance in a general assembly of the Acarnanians.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.1621" n="1621"/>Mnasilochus, and some others of his faction, were studiously included in this embassy; who, sending private messengers to desire the king to bring up his army, wasted time on purpose;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> so that the ambassadors had scarcely set out, when Antiochus appeared in the territory, and presently at the gates of the city; and, while those who were not concerned in the plot were all in hurry and confusion, and hastily called the young men to arms, he was conducted into the place by Clitus and Mnasilochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> One party of the citizens now joined him through inclination, and those who were of different sentiments were compelled by fear to attend him. He then calmed their apprehensions by a discourse full of mildness; and in the hope of experiencing his clemency, which was reported abroad, several of the states of Acarnania went over to his side.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Medio he went to Thurium, whither he had sent on before him the same Mnasilochus, and his colleagues in the embassy.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the detection of the treachery practised at Medio rendered the Thurians more cautious, but not more timid. They answered him explicitly, that they would form no new alliance without the approbation of the Romans: they then shut their gates, and posted soldiers on the walls.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Most seasonably for confirming the resolution of the Acarnanians, Cneius Octavius, being sent by Quinctius, and having received a party of men and a few ships from Aulus Postumius, whom Atilius had appointed his lieutenant to command at Cephallenia, arrived at Leucas, and filled the allies with hope;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> assuring them, that the consul Manius Acilius had already crossed the sea with his legions, and that the Roman camp was in Thessaly.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As the season of the year, which was by this time favourable for sailing, strengthened the credibility of this report, the king, after placing a garrison in Medio and some other towns of Acarnania, retired from Thurium and returned through the cities of Aetolia and Phocis to Chalcis.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time, Marcus Baebius and king Philip, after the meeting which they had in the winter in Dassaretia, when they sent Appius Claudius into Thessaly to raise the siege of Larissa, had returned to winter quarters, the season not being sufficiently advanced for entering on action;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but now in the beginning of spring, they united their forces, and marched into Thessaly. Antiochus was then in Acarnania.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As soon as they entered that country, Philip laid siege to <pb id="p.1622" n="1622"/>Mallaea, in the territory of Perrhaebia, and Baebius, to Phacium.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This town of Phacium he took almost at the first attempt, and then reduced Phaestus with the same rapidity. After this, he retired to Atrax; and from thence having seized on Cyretiae and Eritium, and placed garrisons in the places which he had reduced, he again joined Philip, who was carrying on the siege of Mallaea.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the arrival of the Roman army, the garrison, either awed by its strength, or hoping for pardon, surrendered themselves, and the combined forces marched, in one body, to recover the towns which had been seized by the Athamanians.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These were Aeginium, Ericinum, Gomphi, Silana, Tricca, Melib&oelig;a, and Phaloria.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then they invested Pellinaeum, where Philip of Megalopolis was in garrison, with five hundred foot and forty horse; but before they made an assault, they sent messengers to warn Philip not to expose himself to the last extremities;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> to which he answered, with much confidence, that he could intrust himself either to the Romans or the Thessalians, but never would put himself in the power of the Macedonian.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When it appeared that recourse must be had to force, and that Limnaea might be attacked at the same time; it was agreed, that the king should go against Limnaea, while Baebius staid to carry on the siege of Pellinaeum.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It happened that, just at this time, the consul, Manius Acilius, having crossed the sea with twenty thousand foot, two thousand horse, and fifteen elephants, ordered some military tribunes, chosen for the purpose, to lead the infantry to Larissa, and he himself with the cavalry came to Limnaea, to Philip.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Immediately on the consul's arrival a surrender was made without hesitation, and the king's garrison, together with the Athamanians, were delivered up. From Limnaea the consul went to Pellinaeum.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here the Athamanians surrendered first, and afterwards Philip of Megalopolis. King Philip, happening to meet the latter as he was coming out from the town, ordered his attendants, in derision, to salute him with the title of king;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and he himself, coming up to him, with a sneer, highly unbecoming his own exalted station, addressed him as Brother. Having been brought before the consul he was ordered to be kept in confinement, and soon after was sent to Rome in chains.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All the rest of the Athamanians, together with the soldiers of king Antiochus, who <pb id="p.1623" n="1623"/>had been in garrison in the towns which surrendered about that time, were delivered over to Philip. They amounted to three thousand men. The consul went thence to Larissa, in order to hold a consultation on the general plan of operations; and on his way was met by ambassadors from Pieria and Metropolis, with the surrender of those cities.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip treated the captured, particularly the Athamanians, with great kindness, in order that through them he might conciliate their countrymen; and having hence conceived hopes of getting Athamania into his possession, he first sent forward the prisoners to their respective states, and then marched his army thither.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These also, making mention of the king's clemency and generosity towards them, exerted a powerful influence on the minds of their fellow-countrymen;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and Amynander, who, by his presence, had retained many in obedience, through the respect paid to his dignity, began now to dread that he might be delivered up to Philip, who had been long his professed enemy, or to the Romans, who were justly incensed against him for his late defection.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He, therefore, with his wife and children, quitted the kingdom, and retired to Ambracia. Thus all Athamania came under the authority and dominion of Philip. The consul delayed a few days at Larissa, for the purpose chiefly of refreshing the horses, which, by the voyage first, and marching afterwards, had been much harassed and fatigued; and when he had renewed the vigour of his army by a moderate share of rest, he marched to Cranon.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On his way, Pharsalus, Scotussa, and Pherae were surrendered to him, together with the garrisons placed in them by Antiochus.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He asked these men whether any of them chose to remain with him; and one thousand having declared themselves willing, he gave them to Philip; the rest he sent back, unarmed, to Demetrias. After this he took Proerna, and the forts adjacent; and then began to march forwards toward the Malian bay.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When he drew near to the pass on which Thaumaci is situated, all the young men of that place, having taken arms and quitted the town, placed themselves in ambush in the woods and roads, and thence, from the higher grounds, made attacks on the Roman troops as they marched.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consul first sent people to talk with them from a short distance, and deter them from such a mad proceeding; but, finding that they persisted in their undertaking, he sent round a <pb id="p.1624" n="1624"/>tribune, with two companies of soldiers, to cut off the retreat of the men in arms, and took possession of the defenceless city. The shouting on the capture of the city having been heard from behind, a great slaughter was made of those who had been in ambuscade, and who fled homewards from all parts of the woods.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From Thaumaci the consul came, on the second day, to the river Spercheus;

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and, sending out parties, laid waste the country of the Hypataeans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During these transactions, Antiochus was at Chalcis; and now, perceiving that he had gained nothing from Greece agreeable, except winter quarters and a disgraceful marriage at Chalcis, he warmly blamed Thoas, and the fallacious promises of the Aetolians;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> while he admired Hannibal, not only as a prudent man, but as the predicter of all those events which were then transpiring.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> However, that he might not still further defeat his inconsiderate enterprise by his own inactivity, he sent requisitions to the Aetolians, to arm all their young men, and assemble in a body at Lamia. He himself also immediately led thither about ten thousand foot (the number having been filled up out of the troops which had come after him from Asia) and five hundred horse.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their assembly on this occasion was far less numerous than ever before, none attending but the chiefs with a few of their vassals. These affirmed that they had, with the utmost diligence, tried every method to bring into the field as great a number as possible out of their respective states, but that they had not prevailed either by argument, persuasion, or authority, against those who declined the service.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Being disappointed thus on all sides, both by his own people, who delayed in Asia, and by his allies, who did not fulfil those engagements by which they had prevailed on him to comply with

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> their invitation, the king retired beyond the pass of Thermopylae. A range of mountains here divides Greece in the same manner as Italy is divided by the ridge of the Apennines.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Outside the strait of Thermopylae, towards the north, lie Epirus, Perrhaebia, Magnesia, Thessaly, the Achaean Phthiotis, and the Malian bay;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> on the inside, towards the south, the greater part of Aetolia, Acarnania, Phocis, Locris, B&oelig;otia, and the adjacent island of Eub&oelig;a, the territory of Attica, which stretches out like a promontory into the sea, and, behind that, the Peloponnesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This range of mountains, <pb id="p.1625" n="1625"/>which extends from Leucas and the sea on the west, through Aetolia to the opposite sea on the east, is so closely covered with thickets and craggy rocks, that, not to speak of an army, even persons lightly equipped for travelling can with difficulty find paths through which they can pass.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The hills at the eastern extremity are called &OElig;ta, and the highest of them Callidromus; in a valley, at the foot of which, reaching to the Malian bay, is a passage not broader than sixty paces. This is the only military road by which an army can be led, even if it should not be opposed.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The place is therefore called Pyle, the gate; and by some, on account of a warm spring, rising just at the entrance of it, Thermopyle.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is rendered famous by the memorable battle of the Lacedaemonians against the Persians, and by their still more glorious death.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With a very inferior portion of spirit, Antiochus now pitched his camp within the enclosures of this pass, the difficulties of which he increased by raising fortifications;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and when he had completely strengthened every part with a double rampart and trench, and, wherever it seemed requisite, with a wall formed of the stones which lay scattered about in abundance,

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> being very confident that the Roman army would never attempt to force a passage there, he sent away one half of the four thousand Aetolians, the number that had joined him, to garrison Heraclea, which stood opposite the entrance of the defile, and the other half to Hypata;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for he concluded, that the consul would undoubtedly attack Heraclea, and he received accounts from many hands, that all the districts round Hypata were being laid waste.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul, after ravaging the lands of Hypata first, and then those of Heraclea, in both which places the Aetolian detachments proved useless, encamped opposite to the king, in the very entrance of the pass, near the warm springs; both parties of the Aetolians shutting themselves up in Heraclea.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Antiochus, who, before he saw the enemy, thought every spot perfectly well fortified, and secured by guards, now began to apprehend, that the Romans might discover some paths among the hills above, through which they could make their way;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for he had heard that the Lacedaemonians formerly had been surrounded in that manner by the Persians, and Philip, lately, by the Romans themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He therefore despatched a messenger to the Aetolians at Heraclea, desiring them to afford him so <pb id="p.1626" n="1626"/>much assistance, at least in the war, as to seize and secure the tops of the hills, so that the Romans might not be able to pass them at any part.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When this message was received, a dissension arose among the Aetolians: some insisted that they ought to obey the king's orders, and go; others, that they ought to lie still at Heraclea, and wait the issue, whatever it might be;

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for if the king should be defeated by the consul, their forces would be fresh, and in readiness to carry succour to their own states in the neighbourhood; and if he were victorious, they could pursue the Romans, while scattered in their flight.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Each party not only adhered positively to its own plan, but even carried it into execution; two thousand lay still at Heraclea; and two thousand, divided into three parties, took possession of the summits called Callidromus, Rhoduntia, and Tichiuns.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>

















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul saw that the heights were possessed by the Aetolians, he sent against those posts two men of consular rank, who acted as lieutenant-generals, with two thousand chosen troops; &mdash;Lucius Valerius Flaccus against Rhoduntia and Tichiuns, and Marcus Porcius Cato against Callidromus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, before he led on his forces against the enemy, he called them to an assembly, and thus briefly addressed them: <quote>Soldiers, I see that the greater part of you who were present, of all ranks, are men who served in this same province, under the conduct and auspices of Titus Quinctius.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now, in the Macedonian war, the pass at the river Aous was much more difficult than this before us.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For this is only a gate, a single passage, formed as it were by nature; every other in the whole tract, between the two seas, being impassable. In the former case, there were stronger fortifications, and placed in more advantageous situations.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The enemy's army was both more numerous, and composed of very superior men; for they were Macedonians, Thracians, and Illyrians, &mdash;all nations of the fiercest spirit; your present opponents are Syrians, and Asiatic Greeks, the most unsteady of men, and born for slavery.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The commander, there, was a king of extraordinary warlike abilities, improved by practice from his early youth, in wars against his neighbours, the Thracians and Illyrians, and all the adjoining nations. But this man is one who (to say nothing of his former life) after coming over from Asia into Europe to make war on the Roman <pb id="p.1627" n="1627"/>people, has,

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> during the whole length of the winter, accomplished no more memorable exploit, than the taking a wife, for passion's sake, out of a private house, and a family obscure even among its neighbours; and now as a newly married man, surfeited as it were with nuptial feasts, comes out to fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> His chief reliance and strength was in the Aetolians, &mdash;a nation of all others the most faithless and ungrateful, as you have formerly experienced, and as Antiochus now experiences; for they neither joined him with numbers, nor could they be kept in the camp; and, besides, they are now in a state of dissension among themselves.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Although they requested permission to defend Hypata and Heraclea, yet they defended neither; but one half of them fled to the tops of the mountains, while the others shut themselves up in Heraclea.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The king himself, plainly confessing that, so far from daring to meet us in battle on the level plain, he durst not even encamp in open ground, has abandoned all that tract in front, which he boasted of having taken from us and Philip, and has hid himself behind the rocks; not even appearing in the opening of the pass, as it is said the Lacedaemonians did formerly, but drawing back his camp completely within it.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> What difference is there, as a demonstration of fear, between this and his shutting himself up within the walls of a city to stand a siege? But neither shall the straits protect Antiochus, nor the hills which they have seized, the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Sufficient care and precaution have been used on every quarter, that you shall have nothing to contend with in the fight but the enemy himself. On your parts, you have to consider, that you are not fighting merely for the liberty of Greece;

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> although, were that all, it would be an achievement highly meritorious to deliver that country now from Antiochus and the Aetolians, which you formerly delivered from Philip; and that the wealth in the king's camp will not be the whole prize of your labour; but that the great collection of stores, daily expected from Ephesus, will likewise become your prey; and also, that you will open a way for the Roman power into Asia and Syria, and all the most opulent realms to the extremity of the East.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What then must be the consequence, but that, from Gades to the Red Sea, we shall have no limit but the ocean, which encircles in its embrace the whole orb of the earth; and that all mankind shall regard the Roman name with a de- <pb id="p.1628" n="1628"/>gree of veneration next to that which they pay to the divinities?

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For the attainment of prizes of such magnitude, prepare a spirit adequate to the occasion, that, to-morrow, with the aid of the gods, we may

<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> decide the matter in the field.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this discourse he dismissed the soldiers, who, before they went to their repast, got ready their armour and weapons.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the first dawn, the signal of battle being displayed, the consul formed his troops with a narrow front, adapted to the nature and the straitness of the ground. When the king saw the enemy's standards in motion, he likewise drew out his forces. He placed in the van, before the rampart, a part of his light infantry; and behind them, as a support, close to the fortifications, the main strength of his Macedonians, whom they call Sarissophori.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the left wing of these, at the foot of the mountain, he posted a body of javelin-bearers, archers, and slingers; that from the higher ground they might annoy the naked flank of the enemy:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and on the right of the Macedonians, to the extremity of the works, where the deep morasses and quicksands, stretching thence to the sea, render the place impassable, the elephants with their usual guard; in the rear of them, the cavalry; and then, with a moderate interval between, the rest of his forces as a second line.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Macedonians, posted before the rampart, for some time easily withstood the efforts which the Romans made every where to force a passage; for they received great assistance from those who poured down from the higher ground a shower of leaden balls from their slings, and of arrows, and javelins, all together.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But afterwards, the enemy pressing on with greater and now irresistible force, they were obliged to give ground, and, filing off from the rear, retire within the fortification. Here, by extending their spears before them, they formed as it were a second rampart, for the rampart itself was of such a moderate height

<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> that, while it afforded to its defenders a higher situation, they at the same time, by the length of their spears, had the enemy within reach underneath.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many, inconsiderately approaching the work, were run through the body; and they must either have abandoned the attempt and retreated, or have lost very great numbers, had not Marcus Porcius come from the summit of Callidromus, whence he had dislodged the Aetolians, after killing the greater part of them. These he had surprised, <pb id="p.1629" n="1629"/>quite unprepared, and mostly asleep, and now he appeared on the hill which overlooked the camp.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Flaccus had not met the same good fortune at Tichiuns and Rhoduntia; having failed in his attempts to approach those fastnesses.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Macedonians, and others, in the king's camp, as long as, on account of the distance, they could distinguish nothing more than a body of men in motion, thought they were the Aetolians, who, on seeing the fight, were coming to their aid.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when, on a nearer view, they knew the standards and arms, and thence discovered their mistake, they were all instantly seized with such a panic, that they threw down their arms and fled.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Both the fortifications retarded the pursuers, and the narrowness of the valley through which the troops had to pass; and, above all, the circumstance that the elephants were on the rear of the enemy. These the infantry could with difficulty pass, and the cavalry could by no means do so, their horses being so frightened, that they threw one another into greater confusion than when in battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The plundering of the camp also caused a considerable delay.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But, notwithstanding all this, the Romans pursued the enemy that day as far as Scarphea, killing and taking on the way great numbers both of men and horses, and also killing such of the elephants as they could not capture; and then they returned to their camp.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This had been attacked, during the time of the action, by the Aetolians who were occupying Heraclea as a garrison, but the enterprise, which certainly showed no want of boldness, was not attended with any success.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul, at the third watch of the following night, sent forward his cavalry in pursuit of the enemy; and, as soon as day appeared, set out at the head of the legions.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king had got far before him, as he did not halt in his precipitate flight until he came to Elatia. There having collected the survivors of the battle and the retreat, he, with a very small body of half-armed men, betook himself to Chalcis.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Roman cavalry did not overtake the king himself at Elatia; but they cut off a great part of his soldiers, who either halted through weariness, or wandered out of the way through mistake, as they fled without guides through unknown roads;

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> so that, out of the whole army, not one escaped except five hundred, who kept close about the king; and even of the ten thousand men, whom, on the authority of Polybius, we <pb id="p.1630" n="1630"/>have mentioned as brought over by the king from Asia, a very trifling number got off.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But what shall we say if we are to believe Valerius Antias, who records that there were in the king's army sixty thousand men, of whom forty thousand fell, and above five thousand were taken, with two hundred and thirty military standards? Of the Romans were slain in the action itself a hundred and fifty; and of the party that defended themselves against the assault of the Aetolians, not more than fifty.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the consul was leading his army through Phocis and B&oelig;otia, the revolted states, conscious of their defection, and dreading lest they should be exposed as enemies to the ravages of the soldiers, presented themselves at the gates of their cities, with the badges of suppliants;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but the army proceeded, during the whole time, just as if they were in the country of friends, without offering violence of any sort, until they reached the territory of Coronea.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here a statue of king Antiochus, standing in the temple of Minerva Itonia, kindled their indignation, and permission was given to the soldiers to plunder the lands adjacent to the edifice. But the reflection quickly occurred, that, as the statue had been erected by a general vote of all the B&oelig;otian states, it was unreasonable to resent it on the single district of Coronea.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The soldiers were therefore immediately recalled, and the depredations stopped. The B&oelig;otians were only reprimanded for their ungrateful behaviour to the Romans in return for such great obligations, so recently conferred.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the very time of the battle, ten ships belonging to the king, with their commander Isidorus, lay at anchor near Thronium, in the Malian bay. To them Alexander of Acarnania, being grievously wounded, made his escape, and gave an account of the unfortunate issue of the battle; on which the fleet, alarmed at the immediate danger, sailed away in haste to Cenaeus in Eub&oelig;a.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There Alexander died, and was buried. Three other ships, which came from Asia to the same port, on hearing the disaster which had befallen the army, returned to Ephesus. Isidorus sailed over from Cenaeus to Demetrias, supposing that the king might perhaps have directed his flight thither.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> About this time Aulus Atilius, commander of the Roman fleet, intercepted a large convoy of provisions going to the king, just as they had passed the strait at the island of Andros: some of the ships <pb id="p.1631" n="1631"/>he sunk, and took many others.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those who were in the rear turned their course to Asia. Atilius, with the captured vessels in his train, sailed back to Piraeus, from whence he had set out, and distributed a vast quantity of corn among the Athenians and the other allies in that quarter.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Antiochus, quitting Chalcis before the arrival of the consul, sailed first to Tenus, and thence passed over to Ephesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consul came to Chalcis, the gates were open to receive him: for Aristoteles, who commanded for the king, on hearing of his approach, had withdrawn from the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The rest of the cities of Eub&oelig;a also submitted without opposition; and peace being restored all over the island within the space of a few days, without inflicting punishment on any city, the army, which had acquired much higher praise for moderation after victory, than even for the victory itself, was led back to Thermopylae.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From this place, the consul despatched Marcus Cato to Rome, that through him the senate and people might learn what had been achieved from unquestionable authority.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He set sail from Creusa, a sea-port belonging to the Thespians, seated at the bottom of the Corinthian Gulf, and steered to Patrae, in Achaia. From Patrae, he coasted along the shores of Aetolia and Acarnania, as far as Corcyra, and thence he passed over to Hydruntum, in Italy.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Proceeding hence, with rapid expedition, by land, he arrived on the fifth day at Rome. Having come into the city before day, he went on directly from the gate to Marcus Junius, the praetor, who, at the first dawn, assembled the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Here, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, who had been despatched by the consul several days before Cato, and on his arrival had heard that the latter had outstripped him, and was then in the senate, came in, just as he was giving a recital of the transactions.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The two lieutenant-generals were then, by order of the senate, conducted to the assembly of the people, where they gave the same account, as in the senate, of the services performed in Aetolia.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hereupon a supplication of three days' continuance was decreed, and that the praetor should offer sacrifice to such of the gods as his judgment should direct, with forty victims of the larger kinds.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> About the same time, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who, two years before, had gone into Farther Spain, in the office of praetor, entered the city in ovation.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He carried in the procession a hundred and thirty <pb id="p.1632" n="1632"/>thousand silver denarii,<note>4097<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 16<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> and besides the coin, twelve thousand pounds' weight of silver, and a hundred and twenty-seven pounds' weight of gold.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul Manius Acilius sent on, from Thermopylae, a message to the Aetolians in Heraclea, admonishing them, <quote>then at least, after the experience which they had of the emptiness of the king's professions, to return to their senses;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and, by surrendering Heraclea, to endeavour to procure from the senate a pardon for their past madness, or error: that other Grecian states also had, during the present war, revolted from the Romans, to whom they were under the highest obligations;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but that, inasmuch as, after the flight of the king, in reliance upon whom they had departed from their duty, they had not added obstinacy to their misbehaviour, they were re-admitted into friendship.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In like manner, although the Aetolians had not followed in the steps of the king, but had invited him, and had been principals in the war, not auxiliaries; nevertheless, if they could bring themselves to repentance they might still insure their safety.</quote> As their answer to these suggestions showed nothing like a pacific disposition, and it was evident that the business must be determined by force of arms, and that, notwithstanding the defeat of the king, the war of Aetolia was as far from a conclusion as ever, Acilius removed his camp from Thermopylae to Heraclea;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and on the same day rode on horseback entirely round the walls, in order to acquaint himself with the localities of the city.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Heraclea is situated at the foot of Mount &OElig;ta; the town itself is in the plain, but has a citadel overlooking it, which stands on an eminence of considerable height, terminated on all sides by precipices.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having examined every part which he wished to see, the consul determined to make the attack in four places at once. On the side next the river Asopus, where is also the Gymnasium, he gave the direction of the works and the assault to Lucius Valerius.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He assigned to Tiberius Sempronius Longus the attack of a part of the suburbs, which was as thickly inhabited as the city itself.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He appointed Marcus Baebius to act on the side opposite the Malian bay, a part where the access was far from easy; and Appius Claudius on the side next to another rivulet, called Melas, opposite to the temple of' Diana.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By the vigorous <pb id="p.1633" n="1633"/>emulation of these the towers, rams, and other machines used in the besieging of towns, were all completed within a few days.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The lands round Heraclea, naturally marshy, and abounding with tall trees, furnished timber in abundance for every kind of work; and then, as the Aetolians had fled into the city, the deserted suburbs supplied not only beams and boards, but also bricks and mortar, and stones of every size for all their various occasions.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Romans carried on the assault upon this city by means of works more than by their arms; the Aetolians, on the contrary, maintained their defence by dint of arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For when the walls were shaken by the ram they did not, as is usual, intercept and turn aside the strokes by the help of nooses formed on ropes, but sallied out in large armed bodies, with parties carrying fire, which they threw into the works.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had likewise arched passages through the parapet, for the purpose of making sallies;

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and when they built up the wall anew, in the room of any part that was demolished, they left a great number of these, that they might rush out upon the enemy from many places at once.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In several days at the beginning, while their strength was unimpaired, they carried on this practice in numerous parties, and with much spirit, but afterwards in smaller numbers and more languidly. For though they had a multiplicity of difficulties to struggle with, what above all things utterly consumed their vigour was the want of sleep, as the Romans, having plenty of men, relieved each other regularly in their posts;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> while among the Aetolians, their numbers being small, the same persons had their strength consumed by unremitting labour night and day. During a space of twenty-four days, without any time being unemployed in the conflict, their toil was kept up against the attacks carried on by the enemy in four different quarters at once.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the consul, from computing the time, and from the reports of deserters, judged that the Aetolians were thoroughly fatigued, he adopted the following plan:

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;At midnight he gave the signal of retreat, and drawing off all his men at once from the assault, kept them quiet in the camp until the third hour of the next day.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The attacks were then renewed, and continued until midnight, when they ceased, until the third hour of the day following. The Aetolians imagined that the Romans suspended the attack from the same cause <pb id="p.1634" n="1634"/>by which they felt themselves distressed, &mdash;excessive fatigue.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As soon, therefore, as the signal of retreat was given to the Romans, as if themselves were thereby recalled from duty, every one gladly retired from his post, nor did they again appear in arms on the walls before the third hour of the day.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul having put a stop to the assault at midnight, renewed it on three of the sides, at the fourth watch, with the utmost vigour;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> ordering Tiberius Sempronius, on the fourth, to keep his party alert, and ready to obey his signal; for he concluded assuredly, that in the tumult by night the enemy would all run to those quarters whence the shouting was heard.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of the Aetolians, such as had gone to rest, with difficulty roused their bodies from sleep, exhausted as they were with fatigue and watching; and such as were still awake, ran in the dark to the places where they heard the noise of fighting.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Meanwhile the Romans endeavoured some to climb over the ruins of the walls, through the breaches; others, to scale the walls with ladders; while the Aetolians hastened in all directions to defend the parts attacked.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In one quarter, where the buildings stood outside the city, there was neither attack nor defence. A party stood ready, waiting for the signal to make an attack, but there was none within to oppose them.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The day now began to dawn, and the consul gave the signal; on which the party, without any opposition, made their way into the town; some through parts that had been battered, others scaling the walls where they were entire. As soon as the Aetolians heard them raise the shout, which denoted the place being taken, they every where forsook their posts, and fled into the citadel.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The victors sacked the city; the consul having given permission, not for the sake of gratifying resentment or animosity, but that the soldiers, after having been restrained from plunder in so many cities captured from the enemy, might at last, in some one place, enjoy the fruits of victory.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> About mid-day he recalled the troops, and dividing them into two parts, ordered one to be led round by the foot of the mountain to a rock, which was of equal height with the citadel, and seemed as if it had been broken off from it, leaving a hollow between; but the summits of these eminences are so nearly contiguous that weapons may be thrown into the citadel from the top of the other.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With the other half of the troops the consul intended to march up from the city to the <pb id="p.1635" n="1635"/>citadel, and waited to receive a signal from those who were to mount the rock on the farther side.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Aetolians in the citadel could not support the shout of the party which had seized the rock, and the consequent attack of the Romans from the city; for their courage was now broken, and the place was by no means in a condition to hold out a siege of any continuance; the women, children, and great numbers of other helpless people, being crowded together in a fort, which was scarce capable of containing, much less of affording protection to such a multitude.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the first assault, therefore, they laid down their arms and submitted.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Among the rest was delivered up Damocritus, chief magistrate of the Aetolians, who at the beginning of the war, when Titus Quinctius asked for a copy of the decree passed by the Aetolians for inviting Antiochus, told him, that, <quote>in Italy, when the Aetolians were encamped there, it should be delivered to him.</quote> On account of this presumptuous insolence of his, his surrender was a matter of greater satisfaction to the victors.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, while the Romans were employed in the reduction of Heraclea, Philip, by concert, besieged Lamia. He had an interview with the consul, as he was returning from B&oelig;otia, at Thermopylae, whither he came to congratulate him and the Roman people on their successes, and to apologize for his

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> not having taken an active part in the war, being prevented by sickness; and then they went from thence, by different routes, to lay siege to the two cities at once.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The distance between these places is about seven miles; and as Lamia stands on high ground, and has an open prospect, particularly towards the region of Mount &OElig;ta, the distance seems very short, and every thing that passes can be seen from thence.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans and Macedonians, with all the emulation of competitors for a prize, employed the utmost exertions, both night and day, either in the works or in fighting; but the Macedonians encountered greater difficulty on this account, that the Romans made their approaches by mounds, covered galleries, and other works, which were all above ground; whereas the Macedonians worked under ground by mines, and, in that stony soil, often met a flinty rock, which iron could not penetrate.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The king, seeing that his undertaking succeeded but ill, endeavoured, by conversations with the principal inhabitants, to prevail on the townspeople to sur- <pb id="p.1636" n="1636"/>render the place;

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for he was fully persuaded, that if Heraclea should be taken first, the Lamians would then choose to surrender to the Romans rather than to him; and that the consul would take to himself the merit of relieving them from a siege.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor was he mistaken in that opinion; for no sooner was Heraclea reduced, than a message came to him to desist from the assault; because <quote>it was more reasonable that the Roman soldiers, who had fought the Aetolians in the field, should reap the fruits of the victory.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus was Lamia relieved, and the misfortune of a neighbouring city proved the means of its escaping a like disaster.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days before the capture of Heraclea, the Aetolians, having assembled a council at Hypata, sent ambassadors to Antiochus, among whom was Thoas, the same who had been sent on the former occasion.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their instructions were, in the first place, to request the king again to assemble his land and marine forces and cross over into Greece; and, in the next place, if any circumstance should detain him, then to send them supplies of men and money.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were to remind him, that <quote>it concerned his dignity and his honour, not to abandon his allies; and it likewise concerned the safety of his kingdom, not to leave the Romans at full leisure, after ruining the nation of the Aetolians, to carry their whole force into Asia.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What they said was true, and therefore made the deeper impression on the king;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> in consequence of which, he immediately supplied the ambassadors with the money requisite for the exigencies of the war, and assured them, that he would send them succours both of troops and ships.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> One of the ambassadors, namely, Thoas, he kept with him, by no means against his will, as he hoped that, being present, he might induce the performance of the king's promises.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the loss of Heraclea entirely broke the spirits of the Aetolians;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> insomuch that, within a few days after they had sent ambassadors into Asia for the purpose of renewing the war, and inviting the king, they threw aside all warlike designs, and despatched deputies to the consul to sue for peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When these began to speak, the consul, interrupting them, said, that he had other business to attend to at present; and, ordering them to return to Hypata, granted them a truce for ten days, sending with them Lucius Valerius Flaccus, to whom, he desired, whatever business they intended to have proposed <pb id="p.1637" n="1637"/>to himself might be communicated, with any other that they thought proper.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On their arrival at Hypata, the chiefs of the Aetolians held a consultation, at which Flaccus was present, on the method to be used in treating with the consul.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They showed an inclination to begin with addressing themselves wholly to the ancient treaties, and the services which they had performed to the Roman people; on which Flaccus desired them to <quote>speak no more of treaties, which they themselves had violated and annulled.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He told them, that <quote>they might expect more advantage from an acknowledgment of their fault, and entreaty. For their hopes of safety rested not on the merits of their cause, but on the clemency of the Roman people.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That, if they acted in a suppliant manner, he would himself be a solicitor in their favour, both with the consul and with the senate at Rome; for thither also they must send ambassadors.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This appeared to all the only way to safety: <quote>to submit themselves entirely to the faith of the Romans. For, in that case, the latter would be ashamed to do injury to suppliants; while themselves would, nevertheless, retain the power of consulting their own interest, should fortune offer any thing more advantageous.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they came into the consul's presence, Phaeneas, who was at the head of the embassy, made a long speech, designed to mitigate the wrath of the conqueror by various considerations; and he concluded with saying, that <quote>the Aetolians surrendered themselves, and all belonging to them, to the faith of the Roman people.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul, on hearing this, said, <quote>Aetolians, consider well whether you will yield on these terms:</quote> and then Phaeneas produced the decree, in which the conditions were expressly mentioned.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>Since then,</quote> said the consul, <quote>you submit in this manner, I demand that, without delay, you deliver up to me Dicaearchus your countryman, Menetas the Epirot,</quote> who had, with an armed force, entered Naupactum, and compelled the inhabitants to defection; <quote>and also Amynander, with the Athamanian chiefs, by whose advice you revolted from us.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Phaeneas, almost interrupting the Roman while he was speaking, answered, &mdash;<quote>We surrendered ourselves, not into slavery, but to your faith; and I take it for granted, that, from not being sufficiently acquainted with us, you fall into the mistake of commanding what is inconsistent with the practice of the Greeks.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>Nor in truth,</quote> <pb id="p.1638" n="1638"/>replied the consul, <quote>do I much concern myself, at present, what the Aetolians may think conformable to the practice of the Greeks; while I, conformably to the practice of the Romans, exercise authority over men, who just now surrendered themselves by a decree of their own, and were, before that, conquered by my arms. Wherefore, unless my commands are quickly complied with, I order that you be put in chains.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the same time he ordered chains to be brought forth, and the lictors to surround the ambassadors. This effectually subdued the arrogance of Phaeneas and the other Aetolians; and, at length, they became sensible of their situation.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Phaeneas then said, that <quote>as to himself and his countrymen there present, they knew that his commands must be obeyed: but it was necessary that a council of the Aetolians should meet, to pass decrees accordingly; and that, for that purpose, he requested a suspension of arms for ten days.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the intercession of Flaccus on behalf of the Aetolians, this was granted, and they returned to Hypata. When Phaeneas related here, in the select council, called Apocleti, the orders which they had received, and the treatment which they had narrowly escaped;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> although the chiefs bemoaned their condition, nevertheless they were of opinion, that the conqueror must be obeyed, and that the Aetolians should be summoned, from all their towns, to a general assembly.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But when the assembled multitude heard the same account, their minds were so highly exasperated, both by the harshness of the order and the indignity offered, that, even if they had been in a pacific temper before, the violent impulse of anger which they then felt would have been sufficient to rouse them to war.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their rage was increased also by the difficulty of executing what was enjoined on them; for, <quote>how was it possible for them, for instance, to deliver up king Amynander?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It happened, also, that a favourable prospect seemed to open to them; for Nicander, returning from king Antiochus at that juncture, filled the minds of the people with unfounded assurances, that immense preparations for war were going on both by land and sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This man, after finishing the business of his embassy, set out on his return to Aetolia; and on the twelfth day after he embarked, reached Phalara, on the Malian bay.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having conveyed thence to Lamia the money that he had brought, he, with a few light troops, directed, in the <pb id="p.1639" n="1639"/>evening, his course toward Hypata, by known paths, through the country which lay between the Roman and Macedonian camps. Here he fell in with an advanced guard of the Macedonians, and was conducted to the king, whose dinner guests had not yet separated.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip, being told of his coming, received him as a guest, not an enemy; desired him to take a seat, and join the entertainment;

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and afterwards, when he dismissed the rest, detained him alone, and told him, that he had nothing to fear for himself. He censured severely the conduct of the Aetolians, in bringing, first the Romans, and afterwards Antiochus, into Greece;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> designs which originated in a want of judgment, and always recoiled on their own heads.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But <quote>he would forget,</quote> he said, <quote>all past transactions, which it was easier to blame than to amend; nor would he act in such a manner as to appear to insult their misfortunes.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the other hand, it would become the Aetolians to lay aside, at length, their animosity towards him; and it would become Nicander himself, in his private capacity, to remember that day, on which he had been preserved by him.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Having then appointed persons to escort him to a place of safety, Nicander arrived at Hypata, while his countrymen were consulting about the peace with Rome.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Manius Acilius having sold, or given to the soldiers, the booty found near Heraclea, and having learned that the counsels adopted at Hypata were not of a pacific nature, but that the Aetolians had hastily assembled at Naupactum, with intention to make

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> a stand there against the whole brunt of the war, sent forward Appius Claudius, with four thousand men, to seize the heights of the mountains, where the passes were difficult;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and he himself, ascending Mount &OElig;ta, offered sacrifices to Hercules, in the spot called Pyra,<note>The funeral pile.</note> because there the mortal part of the demi-god was burned. He then set out with the main body of the army, and marched all the rest of the way with tolerable ease and expedition.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when they came to Corax, a very high mountain between Callipolis and Naupactum, great numbers of the beasts of burden, together with their loads, tumbled down the precipices, and many of the men were hurt.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This clearly showed with how negligent an enemy they had to do, who had not secured so difficult a pass by a guard, and so blocked up the passage; for, even as <pb id="p.1640" n="1640"/>the case was, the army suffered considerably.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hence he marched down to Naupactum; and having erected a fort against the citadel, he invested the other parts of the city, dividing his forces according to the situation of the walls. Nor was the siege likely to prove less difficult and laborious than that of Heraclea.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>













<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, the Achaeans laid siege to Messene, in Peloponnesus, because it refused to become a member of their body:

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for the two states of Messene and Elis were unconnected with the Achaean confederacy, and sympathized with the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> However, the Eleans, after Antiochus had been driven out of Greece, answered the deputies, sent by the Achaeans, with more moderation:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that <quote>when the king's troops were removed, they would consider what part they should take.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the Messenians had dismissed the deputies without an answer, and prepared for war. Alarmed, afterwards, at their own situation, when they saw the enemy ravaging their country without control, and pitching their camp close to their city, they sent deputies to

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> Chalcis, to Titus Quinctius, the author of their liberty, to acquaint him, that <quote>the Messenians were willing, both to open their gates, and surrender their city, to the Romans, but not to the Achaeans.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On hearing this Quinctius immediately set out, and despatched from Megalopolis a messenger to Diophanes, praetor of the Achaeans, requiring him to draw off his army instantly from Messene, and to come to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Diophanes obeyed the order; raising the siege, he hastened forward himself before the army, and met Quinctius near Andania, a small town between Megalopolis and Messene.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he began to explain the reasons for commencing the siege, Quinctius, gently reproving him for undertaking a business of that importance without consulting him, ordered him to disband his

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> forces, and not to disturb a peace which had been established advantageously to all.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He commanded the Messenians to recall the exiles, and to unite themselves to the confederacy of the Achaeans; and if there were any particulars to which they chose to object, or any precautions which they judged requisite for the future, they might apply to him at Corinth.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then gave directions to Diophanes, to convene immediately a general council of the Achaeans, that he might settle some business with them.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this assembly he complained of their having ac- <pb id="p.1641" n="1641"/>quired possession of the island of Zacynthus by unfair means, and demanded that it should be restored to the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Zacynthus had formerly belonged to Philip, king of Macedonia, and he had made it over to Amynander, on condition of his giving him leave to march an army through Athamania, into the upper part of Aetolia, on that expedition wherein he compelled the Aetolians with dejected spirits to sue for peace. Amynander gave the government of the island to Philip, the Megalopolitan;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and afterwards, during the war in which he united himself with Antiochus against the Romans, having called out Philip to the duties of the campaign, he sent, as his successor, Hierocles, of Agrigentum.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This man, after the flight of Antiochus from Thermopylae, and the expulsion of Amynander from Athamania by Philip, sent emissaries of his own accord to Diophanes, praetor of the Achaeans; and having bargained for a sum of money, delivered over the island to the Achaeans.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This acquisition, made during the war, the Romans claimed as their own; for they said, that <quote>it was not for Diophanes and the Achaeans that the consul Manius Acilius, and the Roman legions, fought at Thermopylae.</quote> Diophanes, in answer, sometimes apologized for himself and his nation; sometimes insisted on the justice of the proceeding. But several of the Achaeans testified that they had, from the beginning, disapproved of that business, and they now blamed the obstinacy of the praetor. Pursuant to their advice, a decree was made, that the affair should be left entirely to the disposal of Titus Quinctius.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As Quinctius was severe to such as made opposition, so, when complied with, he was easily appeased. Laying aside, therefore, every thing stern in his voice and looks, he said, &mdash;<quote>If, Achaeans, I thought the possession of that island advantageous to you, I would be the first to advise the senate and people of Rome to permit you to hold it.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But as I see that a tortoise, when collected within its natural covering, is safe against blows of any kind, and whenever it thrusts out any of its limbs, it feels whatever it has thus uncovered, weak and liable to every injury: so you, in like manner, Achaeans, being enclosed on all sides by the sea, can easily unite among yourselves, and maintain by that union all that is comprehended within the limits of Peloponnesus;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but whenever, through ambition of en- larging your possessions, you overstep these limits, then all <pb id="p.1642" n="1642"/>that you hold beyond them is naked, and exposed to every attack.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The whole assembly declaring their assent, and Diophanes not daring to give further opposition, Zacynthus was ceded to the Romans.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul was on his march to Naupactum, king Philip proposed, that, if it was agreeable to him, he would, in the mean time, retake those cities that had revolted from their alliance with Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having obtained permission so to do, he, about this time, marched his army to Demetrias, being well aware that great distraction prevailed there;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for the garrison, being destitute of all hope of succour since they were abandoned by Antiochus, and having no reliance on the Aetolians, daily and nightly expected the arrival of Philip or the Romans, whom they had most reason to dread, as these were most justly incensed against them.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was, in the place, an irregular multitude of the king's soldiers, a few of whom had been at first left there as a garrison, but the greater part had fled thither after the defeat of his army, most of them without arms,

<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> and without either strength or courage sufficient to sustain a siege. Wherefore on Philip's sending on messengers, to offer them hopes of pardon being obtainable, they answered, that their gates were open for the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On his first entrance, several of the chiefs left the city; Eurylochus killed himself. The soldiers of Antiochus, in conformity to a stipulation, were escorted, through Macedonia and Thrace, by a body of Macedonians, and conducted to Lysimachia.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were, also, a few ships at Demetrias, under the command of Isidorus, which, together with their commander, were dismissed. Philip then reduced Dolopia, Aperantia, and several cities of Perrhaebia.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Philip was thus employed, Titus Quinctius, after receiving from the Achaean council the cession of Zacynthus, crossed over to Naupactum, which had stood a siege of near two months, but was now reduced to a desperate condition;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and it was supposed, that if it should be taken by storm, the whole nation of the Aetolians would be sunk thereby in utter destruction.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But, although he was deservedly incensed against the Aetolians, from the recollection that they alone had attempted to depreciate his merits, when he was giving liberty to Greece; and had been in no degree influenced by his advice, when he endeavoured, by forewarn- <pb id="p.1643" n="1643"/>ing them of the events, which had since occurred, to deter them from their mad undertaking:

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> nevertheless, thinking it particularly his business to take care that none of the states of Greece which had been liberated by himself should be entirely subverted, he first walked about near the walls, that he might be easily known by the Aetolians.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was quickly distinguished by the first advanced guards, and the news spread from rank to rank that Quinctius was there. On this, the people from all sides ran to the walls, and eagerly stretch- ing out their hands, all in one joint cry besought Quinctius by name, to assist and save them.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although he was much affected by these entreaties, yet for that time he made signs with his hands, that they were to expect no assistance from him.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> However, when he met the consul he accosted him thus: &mdash;<quote>Manius Acilius, are you unapprized of what is passing; or do you know it, and think it immaterial to the interest of the commonwealth?</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This inflamed the consul with curiosity, and he replied, <quote>But explain what is your meaning.</quote> Quinctius then said, &mdash;<quote>Do you not see that, since the defeat of Antiochus, you have been wasting time in besieging two cities, though the year of your command is near expiring;

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but that Philip, who never faced the enemy, or even saw their standards, has annexed to his dominions such a number, not only of cities, but of nations, &mdash;Athamania, Perrhaebia, Aperantia, Dolopia?

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But, surely, we are not so deeply interested in diminishing the strength and resources of the Aetolians, as in hindering those of Philip from being augmented beyond measure; and in you, and your soldiers, not having yet gained, to reward your victory, as many towns as Philip has gained Grecian states.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul assented to these remarks, but a feeling of shame suggested itself to him &mdash;if he should abandon the siege with his purpose unaccomplished.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length the matter was left entirely to the management of Quinctius. He went again to that part of the wall whence the Aetolians had called to him a little before; and on their entreating him now, with still greater earnestness, to take compassion on the nation of the Aetolians, he desired that some of them might come out to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, Phaeneas himself, with some others of the principal men, instantly came and threw themselves at his feet. He then said, &mdash;<quote>Your condition causes me to restrain my resentment and my reproofs.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The events which I fore- <pb id="p.1644" n="1644"/>told have come to pass, and you have not even this reflection left you, that they have fallen upon you undeservedly. Nevertheless, since fate has, in some manner, destined me to the office of cherishing the interests of Greece, I will not cease to show kindness even to the unthankful.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Send intercessors to the consul, and let them petition him for a suspension of hostilities, for so long a time as will allow you to send ambassadors to Rome, to surrender yourselves to the will of the senate.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I will intercede, and plead in your favour with the consul.</quote> They did as Quinctius directed; nor did the consul reject their application. He granted them a truce for a certain time, until the embassy might bring a reply from Rome; and then, raising the siege, he sent his army into Phocis.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul, with Titus Quinctius, crossed over thence to Aegium, to confer with the council of the Achaeans about the Eleans, and also the restoration of the Lacedaemonian exiles. But neither was carried into execution, because the Achaeans chose to reserve to themselves the merit of effecting the latter; and the Eleans preferred being united to the Achaean confederacy by a voluntary act of their own, rather than through the mediation of the Romans.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Ambassadors came hither to the consul from the Epirots, who, it was well known, had not with honest fidelity maintained the alliance. Although they had not furnished Antiochus with any soldiers, yet they were charged with having assisted him with money; and they themselves did not disavow having sent ambassadors to him.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They requested that they might be permitted to continue on the former footing of friendship. To which the consul answered, that <quote>he did not yet know whether he was to consider them as friends or foes.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The senate must be the judge of that matter. He would therefore take no step in the business, but leave it to be determined at Rome; and for that purpose he granted them a truce of ninety days.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the Epirots, who were sent to Rome, addressed the senate, they rather enumerated hostile acts which they had not committed, than cleared themselves of those laid to their charge; and they received such an answer that they seemed rather to have obtained pardon than proved their innocence.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> About the same time ambassadors from king Philip were introduced to the senate, and presented his congratulations on their late successes. They asked leave to sacrifice in the Capitol, and <pb id="p.1645" n="1645"/>to deposit an offering of gold in the temple of Jupiter supremely good and great.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This was granted by the senate, and they presented a golden crown of a hundred pounds' weight. The senate not only answered the ambassadors with kindness, but gave them Demetrius, Philip's son, who was at Rome as an hostage, to be conducted home to his father.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> &mdash; Such was the conclusion of the war waged in Greece by the consul Manius Acilius against Antiochus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The other consul, Publius Cornelius Scipio, who had obtained by lot the province of Gaul, before he set out to the war which was to be waged against the Boians, demanded of the senate, by a decree, to order him money for the exhibition of games, which, when acting as proprietor in Spain, he had vowed at a critical time of a battle.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His demand was deemed unprecedented and unreasonable, and they therefore voted, that <quote>whatever games he had vowed, on his own single judgment, without consulting the senate, he should celebrate out of the spoils, if he had reserved any for the purpose; otherwise, at his own expense.</quote> Accordingly, Publius Cornelius exhibited those games through the space of ten days.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About this time the temple of the great Idaean Mother was dedicated; which deity, on her being brought from Asia, in the consulate of Publius Cornelius Scipio, afterwards surnamed Africanus, and Publius Lucinius, the above-mentioned Publius Cornelius had conducted from the sea-side to the Palatine.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In pursuance of a decree of the senate, Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius, censors, in the consulate of Marcus Cornelius and Publius Sempronius, had contracted for the erection of the goddess's temple; and thirteen years after it had been so contracted for, it was dedicated by Marcus Junius Brutus, and games were celebrated on occasion of its dedication: in which, according to the account of Valerius Antias, dramatic entertainments were, for the first time, introduced into the Megalesian games.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Likewise, Caius Licinius Lucullus, being appointed duumvir, dedicated the temple of Youth in the great circus.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This temple had been vowed sixteen years before by Marcus Livius, consul, on the day wherein he cut off Hasdrubal and his army; and the same person, when censor, in the consulate of Marcus Cornelius and Publius Sempronius, had contracted for the building of it.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Games were also exhibited on occasion of this consecration, and every thing was per- <pb id="p.1646" n="1646"/>formed with the greater degree of religious zeal, on account of the impending war with Antiochus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>







<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the year in which those transactions passed, after Manius Acilius had gone to open the campaign, and while the other consul, Publius

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Cornelius, yet remained in Rome, two tame oxen, it is said, climbed up by ladders on the tiles of a house in the Carinae. The aruspices ordered them to be burned alive, and their ashes to be thrown into the Tiber.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was reported, that several showers of stones had fallen at Tarracina and Amiternum; that, at Minturnae, the temple of Jupiter, and the shops round the forum, were struck by lightning; that, at Vulturnum, in the mouth of the river, two ships were struck by lightning, and burnt to ashes.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On occasion of these prodigies, the decemvirs, being ordered by a decree of the senate to consult the Sibylline books, declared, that <quote>a fast ought to be instituted in honour of Ceres, and the same observed every fifth year; that the nine days' worship ought to be solemnized, and a supplication for one day;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and that they should observe the supplication, with garlands on their heads; also that the consul Publius Cornelius should sacrifice to such deities, and with such victims, as the decemvirs should direct.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he had used every means to avert the wrath of the gods, by duly fulfilling vows and expiating prodigies, the consul went to his province; and, ordering the proconsul Cneius Domitius to disband his army, and go home to Rome, he marched his own legions into the territory of the Boians.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nearly at the same time, the Ligurians, having collected an army under the sanction of their devoting law, made an unexpected attack, in the night, on the camp of the proconsul Quintus Minucius.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Minucius kept his troops, until daylight, drawn up within the rampart, and watchful to prevent the enemy from scaling any part of the fortifications.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the first light, he made a sally by two gates at once: but the Ligurians did not, as he had expected, give way to his first onset; on the contrary, they maintained a dubious contest for more than two hours.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At last, as other and still other troops came out from the camp, and fresh men took the places of those who were wearied in the fight, the Ligurians, who, besides other hardships, felt a great loss of strength from the want of sleep, betook themselves to flight. Above four thou- <pb id="p.1647" n="1647"/>sand of the enemy were killed; the Romans and allies lost not quite three hundred. About two months after this, the consul Publius Cornelius fought a pitched battle with the army of the Boians with extraordinary success.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Valerius Antias affirms, that twenty-eight thousand of the enemy were slain, and three thousand four hundred taken, with a hundred and twenty-four military standards, one thousand two hundred and thirty horses, and two hundred and forty-seven waggons; and that of the conquerors there fell one thousand four hundred and eighty-four.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Though we may not entirely credit this writer with respect to the numbers, as in such exaggeration no writer is more extravagant, yet it is certain that the victory on this occasion was very complete; because the enemy's camp was taken, while, immediately after the battle, the Boians surrendered themselves; and because a supplication was decreed by the senate on account of it, and victims of the greater kinds were sacrificed.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> About the same time Marcus Fulvius Nobilior entered the city in ovation, returning from Farther Spain. He carried with him twelve thousand pounds of silver, one hundred and thirty thousand silver denarii, and one hundred and twenty-seven pounds of gold.<note>This statement has been made before at the close of chapter 21, and is probably repeated here through inadvertence.</note></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>











<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, Publius Cornelius, having received hostages from the Boians, punished them so far as to appropriate almost

<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> one-half of their lands for the use of the Roman people, and into which they might afterwards, if they chose, send colonies.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then returning home in full confidence of a triumph, he dismissed his troops, and ordered them to attend on the day of his triumph at Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The next day after his arrival, he held a meeting of the senate, in the temple of Bellona, when he detailed to them the services he had performed, and demanded to ride through the city in triumph.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Publius Sempronius Blaesus, tribune of the people, advised, that <quote>the honour of a triumph should not be refused to Scipio, but postponed. Wars of the Ligurians,</quote> he said, <quote>were always united with wars of the Gauls; for these nations, lying so near, sent mutual assistance to each other.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If Publius Scipio, after subduing the Boians in battle, had either gone himself, with his victorious army, into the country of the Ligurians, or sent a part of his forces to Quintus Minucius, who was detained <pb id="p.1648" n="1648"/>there, now the third year, by a war which was still undecided, that with the Ligurians might have been brought to an end:

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> instead of which, he had, in order to procure a full attendance on his triumph, brought home the troops, who might have performed most material services to the state;

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and might do so still, if the senate thought proper, by deferring this token of victory, to redeem that which had been omitted through eager haste for a triumph. If they would order the consul to return with his legions into his province, and to give his assistance towards subduing the

<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> Ligurians, (for, unless these were reduced under the dominion and jurisdiction of the Roman people, neither would the Boians ever remain quiet,) there must be either peace or war with both.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the Ligurians should be subdued, Publius Cornelius, in quality of proconsul, might triumph, a few months later, after the precedent of many, who did not attain that honour until the expiration of their office.</quote></p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>















<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this the consul answered, that <quote>neither had the province of Liguria fallen to his lot, nor had he waged war with the Ligurians, nor did he demand a triumph over them.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He confidently hoped, that in a short time Quintus Minucius, after completing their reduction, would demand and obtain a well-deserved triumph.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For his part, he demanded a triumph over the Boian Gauls, whom he had conquered in battle and had driven out of their camp; of whose whole nation he had received an absolute submission within two days after the fight; and from whom he had brought home hostages to secure peace in future.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But there was another circumstance, of much greater magnitude: he had slain in battle so great a number of Gauls, that no commander, before him, ever met in the field so many thousands, at least of the Boians.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Out of fifty thousand men, more than one-half were killed, and many thousands made prisoners; so that the Boians had now remaining only old men and boys.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Could it, then, be a matter of surprise to any one, that a victorious army, which had not left one enemy in the province, should come to Rome to attend the triumph of their consul?

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And if the senate should choose to employ the services of these troops in another province also, which of the two kinds of treatment could it be supposed would make them enter on a new course of danger and another laborious enterprise with the greater alacrity; <pb id="p.1649" n="1649"/>the paying them the reward of their former toils and dangers without defalcation; or, the sending them away, with the prospect, instead of the reality, when they had once been disappointed in their first expectation?

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As to what concerned himself personally, he had acquired a stock of glory sufficient for his whole life, on that day, when the senate adjudged him to be the best man (in the state), and commissioned him to give a reception to the Idaean Mother.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With this inscription (though neither consulship nor triumph were added) the statue of Publius Scipio Nasica would be sufficiently honoured and dignified.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The unanimous senate not only gave their vote for the triumph, but by their influence prevailed on the tribune to desist from his protest. Publius Cornelius, the consul, triumphed over the Boians.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In this procession he carried, on Gallic waggons, arms, standards, and spoils of all sorts; the brazen utensils of the Gauls; and, together with the prisoners of distinction, he led a train of captured horses.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He deposited in the treasury a thousand four hundred and seventy golden chains; and besides these, two hundred and forty-five pounds' weight of gold; two thousand three hundred and forty pounds' weight of silver, some unwrought, and some formed in vessels of the Gallic fashion, not without beauty; and two hundred and thirty-four thousand denarii.<note>7,523<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 16<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> To the soldiers, who followed his chariot, he distributed three hundred and twenty-five <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>1<hi rend="italics">l.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 2 1/2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></note> each, double to a centurion, triple to a horseman.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Next day, he summoned an assembly, and after expatiating on his own services, and the ill-treatment shown him by the tribune who wanted to

<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> entangle him in a war which did not belong to him, in order to defraud him of the fruits of his success, he absolved the soldiers of their oath, and discharged them.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>








<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this passed in Italy, Antiochus was at Ephesus, divested of all concern respecting the war with Rome, as supposing that the Romans had no intention of coming into Asia; which state of security was occasioned by the erroneous opinions or the flattering representations of the greater part of his friends.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hannibal alone, whose judgment was, at that time, the most highly respected by the king, declared, that <quote>he rather wondered the Romans were not already in Asia, than entertained a doubt of their coming.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The passage was <pb id="p.1650" n="1650"/>easier from Greece to Asia, than from Italy to Greece, and Antiochus constituted a much more important object than the Aetolians. For the Roman arms were not less powerful on sea than on land. Their fleet had long been at Malea, and he had heard that a reinforcement of ships and a new commander had lately come from Italy, with intent to enter on action.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore advised Antiochus not to form to himself vain hopes of peace.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He must necessarily in a short time maintain a contest with the Romans both by sea and land, in Asia, and for Asia itself; and must either wrest the power from those who grasped at the empire of the world, or lose his own dominions.</quote> He seemed to be the only person who could foresee, and honestly foretell, what was to happen.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king, therefore, with the ships which were equipped and in readiness, sailed to the Chersonesus, in order to strengthen the places there with garrisons, lest the Romans should happen to come by land.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He left orders with Polyxenidas to fit out the rest of the fleet, and put to sea; and sent out advice-boats among the islands to procure intelligence of every thing that was passing.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>









<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Caius Livius, commander of the Roman fleet, sailed with fifty decked ships from Rome, he went to Neapolis, where he had appointed the rendezvous of the undecked ships, which were due by treaty from the allies on that coast;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and thence he proceeded to Sicily, where, as he sailed through the strait beyond Messana, he was joined by six Carthaginian ships, sent to his assistance; and then, having collected the vessels due from the Rhegians, Locrians, and other allies, who were bound by the same conditions, he purified the fleet at Lacinium, and put forth into the open sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On his arrival at Corcyra, which was the first Grecian country where he touched, inquiring about the state of the war, (for all matters in Greece were not yet entirely

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> settled,) and about the Roman fleet, he was told, that the consul and the king were posted at the pass of Thermopylae, and that the fleet lay at Piraeus: on which, judging expedition necessary on every account, he sailed directly forward to Peloponnesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having on his passage ravaged Samos and Zacynthus, because they favoured the party of the Aetolians, he bent his course to Malea; and, meeting very favourable weather, arrived in a few days at Piraeus, where he joined the old fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At Scyllaeum he was <pb id="p.1651" n="1651"/>met by king Eumenes, with three ships, who had long hesitated at Aegina whether he should go home to defend his own kingdom, on hearing that Antiochus was preparing both marine and land forces at Ephesus; or whether he should unite himself inseparably to the Romans, on whose destiny his own depended.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Aulus Atilius, having delivered to his successor twenty-five decked ships, sailed from Piraeus for Rome.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Livius, with eighty-one beaked ships, besides many others of inferior rates, some of which were open and furnished with beaks, others without beaks, fit for advice-boats, crossed over to Delos.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>














<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time, the consul Acilius was engaged in the siege of Naupactum. Livius was detained several days at Delos by contrary winds, for that tract among the Cyclades, which are separated in some places by larger straits, in others by smaller, is extremely subject to storms.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Polyxenidas, receiving intelligence from his scout-ships, which were stationed in various places, that the Roman fleet lay at Delos, sent off an express to

<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the king, who, quitting the business in which he was employed in Hellespontus, and taking with him all the ships of war, returned to Ephesus with all possible speed, and instantly called a council to determine whether he should risk an engagement at sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Polyxenidas affirmed, that no delay should be incurred; <quote>it was particularly requisite so to do, before the fleet of Eumenes and the Rhodian ships should join the Romans;

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> in which case, even, they would scarcely be inferior in number, and in every other particular would have a great superiority, by reason of the agility of their vessels, and a variety of auxiliary circumstances.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the Roman ships, being unskilfully constructed, were slow in their motions; and, besides that, as they were coming to an enemy's coast, they would be heavily laden with provisions; whereas their own, leaving none but friends in all the countries round, would have nothing on board but men and arms.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Moreover that their knowledge of the sea, of the adjacent lands, and of the winds, would be greatly in their favour; of all which the Romans being ignorant, would find themselves much distressed.</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In advising this plan he influenced all, especially as the same person who gave the advice was also to carry it into execution. Two days only were passed in making preparations; and on the third, setting sail with a <pb id="p.1652" n="1652"/>hundred ships, of which seventy had decks, and the rest were open, but all of the smaller rates, they steered their course to Phocaea.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king, as he did not intend to be present in the naval combat, on hearing that the Roman fleet was approaching, withdrew to Magnesia, near Sipylus, to collect his land forces, while his

<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> ships proceeded to Cyssus, a port of Erythraea, where it was supposed they might with more convenience wait for the enemy.

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Romans, as soon as the north wind, which had held for several days, ceased, sailed from Delos to Phanae, a port in Chios, opposite the Aegaean sea.

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They afterwards brought round the fleet to the city of Chios, and having taken in provisions there, sailed over to Phocaea. Eumenes, who had gone to join his fleet at Elaea, returned a few days after, with twenty-four decked ships, and a greater number of open ones, to Phocaea, where were the Romans, who were fitting and preparing themselves for a sea-fight.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then setting sail with a hundred and five decked ships, and about fifty open ones, they were for some time driven forcibly towards the land, by a north wind blowing across its course. The ships were thereby obliged to go, for the most part, singly, one after another, in a thin line; afterwards, when the violence of the wind abated, they endeavoured to stretch over to the harbour of Corycus, beyond Cyssus.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>












<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When intelligence was brought to Polyxenidas that the enemy were approaching, he rejoiced at an opportunity of engaging them, and drew out the left squadron towards the open sea, at the same time ordering the commanders of the ships to extend the right division towards the land.;

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and then advanced to the fight, with his fleet in a regular line of battle. The Roman commander, on seeing this, furled his sails, lowered his masts, and, at the same time adjusting his rigging, waited for the ships which were coming up.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were now about thirty in the line; and in order that his left squadron might form a front in like direction, he hoisted his top-sails, and stretched out into the deep, ordering the others

<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> to push forward, between him and the land, against the right squadron of the enemy. Eumenes brought up the rear; who, as soon as he saw the bustle of taking down the rigging begin, likewise brought up his ships with all possible speed.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All their ships were by this time in sight; two Carthaginian vessels, however, which advanced before the Romans, came across three be- <pb id="p.1653" n="1653"/>longing to the king.

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As the numbers were unequal, two of the king's ships fell upon one, and, in the first place, swept away the oars from both its sides; the armed mariners then boarded, and killing some of its defenders and throwing others into the sea, took the ship.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The one which had engaged in an equal contest, on seeing her companion taken, before she could be surrounded by the three, fled back to the fleet.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Livius, fired with indignation, bore down with the praetorian ship against the enemy. The two which had overpowered the Carthaginian ship, in hopes of the same success against this one, advanced to the attack, on which he ordered the rowers on both sides to plunge their oars in the water, in order to hold the ship steady, and to throw grappling-irons into the enemy's vessels as they came up.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having, by these means, rendered the business something like a fight on land, he desired his men to bear in mind the courage of Romans, and not to regard the slaves of a king as men. Accordingly, this single ship now defeated and captured the two, with more ease than the two had before taken one.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By this time the entire fleets were engaged and intermixed with each other. Eumenes, who had come up last, and after the battle was begun, when he

<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> saw the left squadron of the enemy thrown into disorder by Livius, directed his own attack against their right, where the contest was yet equal.</p> 

<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>










<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In a short time a flight commenced, in the first instance, with the left squadron: for Polyxenidas, perceiving that he was evidently overmatched with respect to the bravery of the men, hoisted his top-sails, and betook himself to flight; and, quickly after, those who had engaged with Eumenes near the land did the same.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans and Eumenes pursued with much perseverance, as long as the rowers were able to hold out, and they had any prospect of annoying the rear of the enemy;

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but finding that the latter, by reason of the lightness and fleetness of their ships, baffled every effort that could be made by theirs, loaded as they were with provisions, they at length desisted, having taken thirteen ships together with the soldiers and rowers, and sunk ten.

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of the Roman fleet, only the one Carthaginian ship, which, at the beginning of the action, had been attacked by two, was lost. Polyxenidas continued his flight, until he got into the harbour of Ephesus.

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans staid, during the remainder of that day, in the <pb id="p.1654" n="1654"/>port from which the king's fleet had sailed out, and on the day following proceeded in the pursuit. In the midst of their course they were met by twenty-five Rhodian decked ships, under Pausistratus, the commander of the fleet, and in conjunction with these followed the runaways

<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> to Ephesus, where they stood for some time, in order of battle, before the mouth of the harbour. Having thus extorted from the enemy a full confession of their being defeated, and having sent home the Rhodians and Eumenes, the Romans steered their course to Chios.

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they had passed Phaenicus, a port of Erythraea, they cast anchor for the night; and proceeding next day to the island, came up to the city itself. After halting here a few days for the purpose chiefly of refreshing the rowers, they sailed over to Phocaea.

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here they left four quinqueremes for the defence of the city, and proceeded to Cannae, where, as the winter now approached, the ships were hauled on shore, and surrounded with a trench and rampart.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At the close of the year, the elections were held at Rome, in which were chosen consuls, Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Caius Laelius, from whom all men expected the conclusion of the war with Antiochus. Next day were elected praetors, Marcus Tuccius, Lucius Aurunculeius, Cneius Fulvius, Lucius Aemilius, Publius Junius, and Caius Atinius Labeo.</p></div1></body> <back><div1 type="closer"><p>End of vol.
