				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
					<p>VOLUME VII, containing Books XXVI and XXVII,
						covers the years 211 to <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>, thus including as its
						principal moments Hannibal at the gates of Rome,
						the fall of Capua, the successes of Scipio in Spain,
						Fabius 'recovery of Tarentum, Marcellus' inglorious
						end in an ambuscade, Hasdrubal's descent into Italy,
						his defeat and death at the Metaurus.</p>
					<p>Again, as in Vol. VI, the editor is under unlimited
						obligations to the Oxford text of Conway and Johnson, Vol. IV, 1934, but indebted in varying degrees
						to many earlier editors&mdash;a goodly company. All
						citations of the Puteanus in the critical notes have
						been verified in the well-known facsimile. Beginning
						with Book XXVI our textual resources are largely
						increased by the store of recorded readings of
						another famous MS. which no longer survives, and
						these are often to be preferred to those of the
						Puteanus. Particular care has been taken to
						indicate passages where a gap in <hi rend="italics">P</hi>&mdash;whose scribe
						yawned all too frequently&mdash;is filled from the lost
						Spirensis; also where it was the latter who nodded,
						while P shows no omission. The capital importance
						of this double tradition for books XXVI-XXX has
						led the editor, with Conway and Johnson, to stress
						the readings of Aldus and Froben, as having had
						access to MS. material no longer directly available.
						In view of our limited space citation of recent editors
						has been necessarily restricted.</p>
					<pb id="viii"/>
					<p>To the publishers of the <hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi>
						we are grateful for permission to use with alterations
						five maps from its Vols. VIII and IX. The map of
						Latium and Campania follows in the main that of
						Heinrich Kiepert in Vol. X, part 2, of the <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi>
						That of New Carthage is drawn in part from an
						Admiralty chart, in part from H. H. Scullard's <hi rend="italics">Scipio</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Africanus in the Second Punic War,</hi> p. 290, Cambridge,
						1930. The latter's map was based chiefly on that
						of Canovas in <hi rend="italics">Estudios geograficos-historicos de Cartagena,</hi> 1905, a local work which could not be found in
						this country. Used by Scullard, and to be consulted
						by the reader, is also the map of J. L. Strachan-
						Davidson in his <hi rend="italics">Selections from Polybius,</hi> Oxford, 1888.
						The map of Tarentum in Vol. VI has been revised
						to show the Appian Way in its latest extension, also
						the large area occupied by tombs, but inside the
						walls. Adding to space covered by the necropolis the
						area occupied by villas and gardens, we find hardly
						one-third left for the city proper. Thus Tarentum
						resembled Syracuse in having fortified a much larger
						area than that required by the city itself (cf. Vol. VI,
						p. 505).</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>The Manuscripts</head>
					<p><hi rend="italics">P</hi> = codex Puteanus, Paris, Biblioth&eacute;que Nationale 5730, 5th century.</p>
					<p>From this are descended the following:</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">C</hi> = Colbertinus, Paris, Biblioth&eacute;que Nationale 5731,
						10th century.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">R</hi> = Romanus, Vatican Library, 9th century.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">M</hi> = Mediceus, Florence, Laurentian Library, 10th
						century.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">B</hi> = Bambergensis, Bamberg, 11th century.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">D</hi> = Cantabrigiensis, Trinity College, Cambridge,
						12th century.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">A</hi> = Agennensis, British Museum, 13th century.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">N</hi> = Laurentianus Notatus, Florence, 13th century.</p>
					<p>Arabic numbers in parentheses indicate the agreement of MSS. derived from P. Thus (1) =
						<hi rend="italics">CRMBDA,</hi> and (3) = three or more of the same list.</p>
					<p>A different text tradition was represented by a
						codex Spirensis, 11th century, now lost with the
						exception of one leaf. This codex was copied from
						a MS. of which some leaves were loose and separated
						from their context. It is known to us from the
						single extant leaf and from many citations of its
						readings. Thus, beginning with book XXVI, we have
						in addition to deal with another tradition of the text:</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">S</hi> = Spirensis, 11th century; now only a single
						folium at Munich, covering XXVIII. xxxix.
						16 to xli. 12.</p>
					<pb id="x"/>
					<p><hi rend="italics">Sp</hi> = readings of S cited by Rhenanus in Froben's
						2nd edition, 1535 (<hi rend="italics">Sp?</hi> if not expressly cited).</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">Ta</hi>= fragments no longer extant of a Turin palimpsest, 5th century; a copy of a MS. from
						which S was descended. The fragments were
						from XXVII and XXIX only.</p>
					<p>Some of the MSS. derived from <hi rend="italics">P</hi> were altered or
						supplemented by scribes who had compared another
						MS. descended from S. Hence <hi rend="italics">A</hi>.s and <hi rend="italics">N</hi>.s will
						indicate changes thus made (14th and 13th century
						respectively).</p>
					<p>Corrections thought to be by the original scribe
						are marked e.g.: <hi rend="italics">P</hi>1, those by later hands <hi rend="italics">P</hi>2, <hi rend="italics">P</hi>3, etc.;
						corrections which cannot be thus distinguished: <hi rend="italics">P</hi>x
						(chiefly deletions); and so for other MSS.</p>
					<p>Of MSS. partly derived from <hi rend="italics">P</hi> and partly from <hi rend="italics">S</hi>
						two are cited, both of the 15th century and in the
						British Museum:</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">J</hi> = Burneianus 198, and <hi rend="italics">K</hi> = Harleianus 2781.</p>
					<p>Further to be noted:</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">x</hi> = an inferior MS., or inferior MSS., 15th century,
						or rarely 14th. But for the meaning of <hi rend="italics">P</hi>x,
						<hi rend="italics">A</hi>x, etc., see above.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">y</hi> = late correction or addition in a MS., <hi rend="italics">e.g. A.</hi>.y.</p>
					<p><hi rend="italics">z</hi> = early editor or commentator. Aldus and
						Froben are usually cited expressly, Froben
						(<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>) standing for the agreement of his two
						editions.</p>
					<p>For details see the Oxford text of Conway and
						Johnson, Vol. IV.</p>

					GNAEUS FULVIUS CENTUMALUS and Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> Sulpicius Galba, the consuls, having entered upon office on the Ides of March, summoned the senate to the Capitol<note>The first session of the senate was then regularly held on the Capitol in the Temple of Jupiter; XXIII. xxxi. 1; XXIV. x. 1; and the new year began on the Ides of March; xxvi. 5; XXVII. vii. 7.</note> and consulted the fathers in regard to the state, the conduct of the war, and the provinces and armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>the</reg> military authority of Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius, consuls of the previous year, was continued, and the armies which they had were assigned to them, with orders in addition that they were not to withdraw from Capua, which
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> they were besieging, until they had taken the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>that</reg> affair claimed the closest attention of the Romans at the time, not so much because of anger, which has never been more justified against any state, as because a city so important and powerful, which by its revolt had drawn with it a number of communities, in like manner, if recovered, might tum the scale to respect, so it seemed, for the old authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>and</reg> for the praetors of the previous year, Marcus <pb id="p.5"/>Iunius in Etruria, Publius Sempronius in Gaul, their<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> command was continued, with the two legions which each had held;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the command of Marcus Marcellus also was continued, that as proconsul in Sicily he might finish the remainder of the war with the army which he had.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>if</reg> he should need reinforcements, he should provide them from the legions which Publius Cornelius, the propraetor,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> commanded in Sicily, provided he did not enlist any soldier from the number of those to whom the senate had refused a discharge and a return to their home towns before the end of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>to</reg> Gaius Sulpicius, to whom Sicily had fallen, were assigned the two legions which Publius Cornelius had held, and reinforcements from Gnaeus Fulvius' army, which in the previous year had been dishonourably cut to pieces and put to flight in Apulia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>for</reg> this class of soldier the senate had established the same term of service as for the men who were at Cannae.<note>Cf. XXIV. xviii. 9; XXV. vii. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>An</name> additional mark of disgrace for both alike was that they were not to winter in towns, nor to construct their winter quarters within ten miles of any city. <reg>to</reg> Lucius Cornelius in Sardinia were given the two legions which Quintus Mucius had commanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>reinforcements</reg>, if necessary, the consuls were bidden to enrol. <reg>to</reg> Titus Otacilius and Marcus Valerius were assigned the coasts of Sicily and Greece, together with the legions and fleets which they commanded.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Greece</name> had fifty ships and one legion, Sicily a hundred ships and two legions. <reg>twenty</reg>-three Roman legions<note>Not including the army in Spain; cf. XXIV. xi. 2.</note> carried on the war that year on land and sea.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<reg>at</reg> the beginning of that year, when the letter of Lucius Marcius<note>Cf. XXV. xxxvii. ff.</note> was brought before the senate, <pb id="p.7"/>his achievement was thought magnificent; but many<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> were offended by the official title used, since he had written <quote><reg>the</reg> Propraetor to the Senate,</quote> although his command had not been given him by order of the people, nor by authority of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>it</reg> was a bad precedent, they said, for generals to be chosen by armies, and for the sanctity of elections with the required auspices to be removed instead to camps and the provinces, far from laws and magistrates, at the bidding of reckless soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>and</reg> when some moved that the matter be laid before the senate, it seemed better to postpone deliberation on that point until the knights who had brought the letter from Marcius should depart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>in</reg> regard to grain and clothing for the army, it was voted to reply that both matters would receive the attention of the senate, but not to address it <quote><reg>to</reg> the Propraetor Lucius Marcius,</quote> for fear he should get, as though already decided, the very thing which they had left to be considered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>when</reg> the knights had been sent away, the consuls brought up that matter first of all, and there was complete unanimity that the tribunes of the plebs should be persuaded to bring before the plebs at the earliest possible moment the question as to whom they preferred to send with full authority to Spain and the army of which Gnaeus Scipio had been the commander &mdash;in &mdash;chief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>the</reg> matter was arranged with the tribunes and due notice given; but a different dispute had claimed men's attention.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><name>Gaius</name> Sempronius Blaesus,<note>A tribune of the plebs; cf. iii. 8. For the defeat in question cf. note on XXVII. i. 15.</note> having named a day for the trial, was inveighing against Gnaeus Fulvius in harangues, because of the loss of his army in Apulia, insisting that many generals out of recklessness and lack of experience had led their <pb id="p.9"/>armies into a dangerous place; but that no one<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> except Gnaeus Fulvius had ruined his legions with every vice before he betrayed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>and</reg> so it could be truly said that they were lost before they saw the enemy, and that they were defeated, not by Hannibal, but by their own commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>no</reg> one, in casting his vote, he said, clearly saw to what sort of man he was entrusting a command and an army. <reg>what</reg> had been the difference between Tiberius Sempronius and Gnaeus Fulvius?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>Tiberius</name> Sempronius, though he had been given an army of slaves, by his training and authority had soon brought it about that no one of them in battle remembered his class and origin, and that they were a defence to allies, a terror to enemies. <reg>they</reg> had rescued Cumae, Beneventum<note>For the battle at Beneventum see XXIV. xv. f.</note> and other cities out of the jaws of Hannibal, as it were, and restored them to the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>but</reg> Gnaeus Fulvius, having an army of Roman citizens,<note>Here called Quirites (rare of soldiers) to heighten the contrast with slaves.</note> men well born and brought up as free men, had steeped them in the vices of slaves. <reg>consequently</reg> this was what he had accomplished: that they were overbearing and turbulent in their dealings with allies, cowardly and unwarlike towards the enemy, and unable to withstand even the battle &mdash;cry of the Carthaginians, to say nothing of their attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>and</reg> surely it was no wonder that the soldiers had given way in battle, when their commander was the first of all to flee.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>he</reg> wondered more, he said, that some had fallen where they stood, and that not all had shared the consternation and flight of Gnaeus Fulvius. <name>Gaius</name> Flaminius, Lucius Paulus, Lucius Postumius, Gnaeus and Publius Scipio had preferred to fall in battle &mdash;line rather than to desert their entrapped armies. <reg>but</reg> Gnaeus Fulvius, almost <pb id="p.11"/>the only man to report the destruction of his army,<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> had returned to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>it</reg> was a shameful thing that the army of Cannae, for having escaped from the battle &mdash;line, had been deported to Sicily, not to be relieved of service there until the enemy withdrew from Italy, and that the same action had been taken recently in the case of Gnaeus Fulvius' legions;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> that the flight of Gnaeus Fulvius from a battle begun by his own recklessness should have gone unpunished, and he should be expecting to spend his old age in cook &mdash;shops and brothels in which he passed his youth, whereas the soldiers, whose only fault was that they were like their commander, had been all but exiled and were enduring military service in disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>so</reg> different was freedom at Rome for the rich and the poor, for the man who had held and the man who had not held public office!</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<reg>the</reg> defendant shifted the blame from himself to the soldiers. <reg>they</reg> had been fiercely clamouring for battle, he said, when they were led out into line, not on the day they wished, since it was too late, but on the following day, and although drawn up at a favourable time and place, they failed to withstand the reputed or the real strength of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>when</reg> they were all fleeing in disorder, he too was carried away by the crowd, as Varro in the battle of Cannae, as many other generals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>how</reg>, he said, could he have been of service to the state by resisting all alone, unless his death was to be a remedy for national disasters?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>it</reg> was not that for lack of supplies he had been imprudently led into an unfavourable position; it was not that while advancing in column without reconnoitring he had been surprised and surrounded; it was by an open attack, by arms, by a <pb id="p.13"/>battle &mdash;line that he had been defeated. <reg>neither</reg> the<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> spirit of his own men nor that of the enemy had been under his control: every man's own temperament, he said, produces boldness or consternation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>twice</reg> he was accused and a fine required;<note>At the first and again at the second hearing the accuser (Blaesus)stated the charge and the penalty demanded in case of conviction.</note> at the third hearing witnesses were furnished, and he was not only loaded with every kind of reproach, but also many swore that the beginning of flight and panic was made by the praetor;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that the soldiers, deserted by him, in the belief that the general's fear was not unfounded, had retreated. <reg>thereupon</reg> such anger was kindled that the assembly shouted that the magistrate must demand a capital penalty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>on</reg> that point<note>Namely, the right to demand a severer punishment, after having twice announced that it would be a fine.</note> also a fresh dispute began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>for</reg> when the accuser, having twice demanded a fine, said at the third hearing that he demanded capital punishment, the tribunes were appealed to.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> by Fulvius.</note> <reg>and</reg> they said that they would not stand in their colleague's way, to prevent him from doing what was permitted him by ancestral custom, that is, from making his demand either according to the laws or according to custom, as he preferred, until he should condemn the defendant either to capital punishment or to pay a fine.<note>For a similar procedure cf. XXV. iii. 13 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>upon</reg> that Sempronius said he judged Gnaeus Fulvius guilty of treason and asked of Gaius Calpur-. nius, the city praetor, a day for the assembly.<note>The <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata,</hi> for the fourth hearing and a final verdict by popular vote. <name>Cicero</name> enumerates the formalities required, including the <hi rend="italics">quart accusatio; de Domo</hi> 45.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>then</reg> the defendant had recourse to another hope, in case his brother Quintus Fulvius might be able to attend at the trial, as he was then influential both from the fame of his successes and from the hope, now almost fulfilled, of taking Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>after</reg> Fulvius had written a pitiful letter in that sense on behalf of his brother's life, and the senators had declared that leaving Capua was not to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> interest of the state, <pb id="p.15"/>when the day for the assembly was at hand Gnaeus<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> Fulvius went into exile at Tarquinii. <reg>the</reg> plebs voted that his exile was legal.<note>Cf. the similar plebiscite XXV. iv. 9.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<reg>meanwhile</reg> the whole effort of the war had been directed against Capua. <reg>but</reg> it was rather an intensive blockade than a series of assaults, and the slaves and commoners were unable either to endure hunger or to send messengers to Hannibal through guards so near to each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>a</reg> Numidian was discovered who took a letter, declared that he would make his way out, and kept his promise. <reg>going</reg> out right through the Roman camp at night he inspired in the Capuans the hope that, while they still had some strength left, they might attempt a sally in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> in the many engagements they were as a rule successful in cavalry battles, while in infantry they were worsted. <reg>to</reg> be victorious, however, was by no means so cheering<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> to the Romans.</note> as it was depressing to be vanquished at any point by a beleaguered and almost captured enemy. <reg>at</reg> length a method was devised, so that what was lacking to their strength might be compensated by skilful tactics.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>out</reg> of all the legions were picked young men who by reason of strength and lightness of build were the swiftest. <reg>these</reg> were furnished with round shields of smaller size than those used by cavalry, and seven javelins apiece four feet long and having iron heads such as are on the spears of the light &mdash;armed troops.<note>Such had been mentioned in XXI. Iv. 11, at the Trebia. <reg>but</reg> they were not combined with the cavalry.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>the</reg> horsemen would each of them take one of these men on to their own horses, and they trained them both to ride behind and to leap down nimbly when the signal was given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>when</reg> thanks to daily practice they seemed to do this with sufficient daring, they advanced into the plain which was situated between the camp and <pb id="p.17"/>the city wall in the face of the Capuan cavalry in<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> battle &mdash;line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>and</reg> when they had come within range, at a given signal the light &mdash;armed leaped to the ground. <reg>thereupon</reg> an infantry line suddenly dashes out from the cavalry at the enemy's horsemen, and while attacking they hurl one javelin after another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>by</reg> throwing a great number of these against horses and men in all directions, they wounded very many. <reg>but</reg> more consternation was created by the strange and the unexpected, and the cavalry charging into the frightened enemy caused them to flee with slaughter all the way to the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>thereafter</reg> the Roman side was superior in cavalry also; it was made the practice to have light &mdash;armed in the legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>the</reg> originator of combining infantry with cavalry they say was Quintus Navius, a centurion, and that for so doing honour was paid him by the general.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<reg>while</reg> matters stood thus at Capua, Hannibal was drawn in opposite directions by the desire to take the citadel of Tarentum and to hold Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>however</reg>, regard for Capua prevailed, a city on which he saw that the attention of all his allies and enemies was concentrated, and one destined to be a striking example, whatever might be the result of its revolt from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, leaving in the land of the Bruttii a large part of his baggage and all the heavy &mdash;armed, with picked infantry and cavalry he hastened into Campania in the best possible condition for a rapid march. <reg>in</reg> spite of his swift movement thirty &mdash;three elephants managed to follow him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>he</reg> encamped in a closed valley behind Tifata, a <pb id="p.19"/>mountain commanding Capua. <reg>as</reg> he approached, he<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> first captured the stronghold of Galatia,<note>Unknown; not to be confused with Calatia, a city which had revolted in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date> (XXII. lxi. 11), and was not recovered by the Romans until later in this year, <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date> (xvi. 5).</note> overpowering its garrison, and then directed his march against the besiegers of Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>and</reg> sending word in advance to Capua, stating at what time he proposed to attack the Roman camp, so that they also, making ready for a sally, might at the same time burst out of all the gates, he inspired great alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>for</reg> on one side he himself attacked, on the other all the Capuans, cavalry and infantry, sallied out, and with them the Carthaginian garrison, commanded by Bostar and Hanno.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><reg>the</reg> Romans in their alarm, so as not to leave one point undefended by rushing in the same direction, divided their forces among them as follows: Appius Claudius was placed facing the Capuans, Fulvius facing Hannibal:
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Gaius Nero, the propraetor, with the cavalry of six legions took his place along the road leading to Suessula, Gaius Fulvius Flaccus, the lieutenant, with the cavalry of the allies in the direction of the river Volturnus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>the</reg> battle began not only with the usual shouting and uproar, but, in addition to the noise of men and horses and arms, the non &mdash;combatant populace of Capua disposed along the walls produced so much shouting, together with the clashing of bronze,<note>Cf. Tacitus <hi rend="italics"><reg>annals</reg> I.</hi> xxviii: Plutarch <hi rend="italics"><name>Aemilius</name></hi> xvii. 4; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> II. 54.</note> such as is usually kept up in the still night of a lunar eclipse, as to divert the attention even of the combatants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>Appius</name> was easily keeping the Capuans away from the earthwork of the camp; on the other side a larger force, Hannibal and the Carthaginians, were pressing Fulvius. <reg>there</reg> the sixth legion gave way, and after it had been forced back, a
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> cohort of Spaniards with three elephants managed even to reach the <pb id="p.21"/>earthwork, and had broken through the Roman centre,<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> and wavered between the hope of breaking through into the camp and the danger of being cut off from their own troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>Fulvius</name>, on seeing the alarm of the legion and the danger to the camp, bade Quintus Navius and other first centurions to attack the cohort of the enemy fighting beneath the earthwork. <reg>he</reg> said that it was a very critical moment; that either they must be allowed to pass &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> it would be less of an effort for them to burst into the camp than it had been to break through the solid line &mdash;or else they must be disposed of beneath the earthwork.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>also</reg> that it would not involve much fighting; they were few and cut off from their own men; and if the battle &mdash;line, which in the panic of the Romans seemed to have been broken through, should face against the enemy from both sides, it would enclose them between two fronts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <name>Navius</name>, on hearing these words of the commander, snatched a standard of the second maniple of the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi> from the standard &mdash;bearer and carried it towards the enemy, threatening that he would throw it into their midst if the soldiers did not quickly follow him and take a hand in the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>a</reg> huge frame he had, and his arms added distinction; and the standard held aloft had attracted citizens and enemies to the sight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>but</reg> when he had pushed through to the standards of the Spaniards, spears were then hurled at him from every side, and almost the entire line turned against him alone. <reg>but</reg> neither the numbers of the enemy nor the mass of weapons could beat off the attack of such a man.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>when</reg> the trench was filled with their bodies, it furnished the enemy with a passage, just as if an embankment or a bridge had been thrown over it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>there</reg>, all over the heap of fallen elephants, a terrible slaughter ensued. <reg>on</reg> the other side of the camp the Capuans and the Carthaginian garrison had already been repulsed, and fighting was going on just outside the gate of Capua leading toward Volturnum.<note>A stronghold recently fortified at the mouth of the river Volturnus, later a city; cf. XXV. xx. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>and</reg> it was not so much the armed men that were resisting the Romans trying to burst in, as that the gate, armed with larger and smaller artillery, kept the enemy back by missiles hurled from a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>the</reg> attack of the Romans was further checked by the wounding of Appius Claudius, the general encouraging his men at the front, when the upper part of his chest was struck by a javelin below the left shoulder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>nevertheless</reg> a great number of the enemy were slain before the gate, and the rest driven in disorder into the city. <name>Hannibal</name> likewise, seeing the slaughter of the Spanish cohort, and that the enemy's camp was being defended with the utmost vigour, gave up the attack upon it and began to recall his standards and to make his advancing infantry retreat, while interposing his cavalry in the rear, to prevent the enemy from pursuing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>the</reg> legions showed great eagerness to pursue the enemy; but Flaccus ordered the recall to be sounded thinking that enough had been <pb id="p.25"/>accomplished for both purposes &mdash;that the Campanians<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> should appreciate how little defence they had in Hannibal, and that Hannibal himself should be aware of it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>some</reg> of the authorities<note>No doubt chiefly Valerius Antias; Vol. VI., p. 492, n. 2; below, xlix. 3, 5.</note> on this battle relate that eight thousand men were slain in Hannibal's army, three thousand in the Campanian, and that fifteen standards were taken from the Carthaginians and eighteen from the Campanians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>in</reg> other writers I have found that the battle was by no means on such a scale, but that there was more panic than fighting, when Numidians and
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Spaniards with elephants had burst into the Roman camp unexpectedly, and while the elephants, on their way straight through the camp, were causing wreckage of tents in the midst of a terrible din, and making the beasts of burden break their halters and flee;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that, in addition to the uproar, there was also a ruse;

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<reg>but</reg> Hannibal, seeing that it was impossible either to tempt the enemy into battle again, or to break a way through their camp to Capua, for fear the new
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> consuls should cut off his supplies also, resolved to retire without accomplishing his undertaking and to move his camp away from Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>while</reg> carefully considering whither he should remove, the impulse came to him to proceed to Rome, the very centre of the war. <reg>it</reg> was something which he had always desired to do, but after the battle of Cannae he had let the opportunity pass, as others commonly complained, and as he himself frequently admitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>in</reg> unexpected alarm and confusion it need not be beyond his hopes that some part of the city could be seized. <reg>and</reg> if Rome should be in danger, he thought that either both of the Roman commanders or one of them would at once abandon Capua; and that if they should divide their forces, each being weakened would give either himself or the Capuans the chance of success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>only</reg> one concern tormented him, the fear that as soon as he had withdrawn, the Capuans might at once be surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>a</reg> Numidian who was ready to dare and do anything was induced <pb id="p.29"/>by Hannibal's gifts to take a letter, enter the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> camp under the guise of a deserter, and then from the other side of the camp make his way in secret to Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>and</reg> the letter was filled with encouragements. <reg>his</reg> departure, Hannibal said, which would be of advantage to them, would draw off the Roman generals and armies from the siege of Capua to the defence of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>they</reg> should not be downcast; by holding out for a few days they would cause the entire blockade to be raised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>he</reg> then ordered that boats on the Volturnus should be seized and rowed up to the fort which he had previously built for a defence.<note>To protect his passage; not the same <hi rend="italics">castellum</hi> as in vi. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>and</reg> when word came that the number of these was such that his army could be ferried across in a single night, he had food prepared for ten days, led his legions down to the river by night, and transported them across before daylight.</p>

					<reg>before</reg> this happened Fulvius Flaccus had learned from deserters that it was to be done, and had so written to the senate at Rome; whereupon men's feelings were differently stirred according to their several natures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>as</reg> was natural in so alarming a situation, the senate was at once summoned, and Publius Cornelius, surnamed Asina,<note>He had been consul before this war, in <date value="-221">221 B.C.</date>; cf. XXII. xxxiv. 1.</note> with no thought of Capua or of anything else, was for recalling all the generals and armies from the whole of Italy for the defence of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> Fabius Maximus thought it a shameful thing to withdraw from Capua, to be frightened and led about at the beck of Hannibal and in response to his threats.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>to</reg> think, he said, that the man who, though victor at Cannae, had not ventured to go to the city, on being beaten back from Capua should have conceived the hope of capturing the city of <pb id="p.31"/>Rome!
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>it</reg> was not to besiege Rome that he was on<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> the march, but to raise the siege of Capua. <reg>as</reg> for Rome, Jupiter, witness of the treaties broken by Hannibal, and the other gods would defend her with the aid of the army stationed at the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>these</reg> conflicting motions were defeated by the compromise of Publius Valerius Flaccus,<note>Consul <date value="-227">227 B.C.</date>; ambassador to Hannibal at Saguntum, and to Carthage <date value="-218">218 B.C.</date>; XXI. vi. 8.</note> who, mindful of both situations, proposed that they write to the generals at Capua, informing them what forces there were to defend the city; on the other hand, what forces Hannibal was taking with him or how large an army was needed for the siege of Capua they themselves knew.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>if</reg> one of the two generals and a part of the army could be sent to Rome, provided Capua should be duly besieged by the general and army remaining, then let Claudius and Fulvius
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> arrange between them which of the two must besiege Capua, and which must come to Rome to prevent a siege of their native city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>when</reg> this decree of the senate was brought to Capua, Quintus Fulvius, the proconsul, who, since his colleague was disabled by a wound, was obliged to return to Rome, after picking soldiers from three armies, led about fifteen thousand infantry and a thousand horsemen across the Volturnus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>thence</reg>, on learning definitely that Hannibal would march along the Latin Way, he himself sent word in advance to the towns along the Appian Way and such as are near that
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> road, Setia, Cora, Lavinium, that they should have supplies on hand in the cities and also bring them down from farms at a distance to the road, and draw in garrisons for the cities, so that each might have the defence of its public interests in hand.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<name>Hannibal</name> on the day that he crossed the <pb id="p.33"/>Volturnus pitched camp not far from the river; on the<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> next day he made his way past Cales into the region of the Sidicini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg> he lingered one day devastating the country, and then led along the Latin Way through the territory of Suessa, Allifae and Casinum. <reg>before</reg> Casinum he remained encamped two days, and ravaged the country in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>then</reg> passing Interamna and Aquinum he came into the region of Fregellae as far as the river Liris,<note>Near Fregellae the Via Latina crossed the Liris, after steadily approaching it through Casinum and Aquinum.</note> where he found the bridge broken down by the men of Fregellae, to delay his march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Fulvius</name> too had been detained by the river Volturnus, as the boats had been burned by Hannibal, and he had difficulty in getting together rafts for the transporting of his army, owing to the great scarcity of timber.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>after</reg> the army had been carried across on rafts, the rest of Fulvius' march was unhampered, as supplies had been generously set out for them not only in the cities, but also by the roadside. <reg>and</reg> the eager soldiers kept encouraging one another to quicken their pace, remembering that they were marching to defend their native city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>to</reg> Rome a messenger from Fregellae, riding on for a day and a night, brought great alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>still</reg> greater confusion than at its first reception was occasioned by news of the danger spread by men who ran about, adding unfounded reports to what they had heard, and it stirred the entire city. <reg>the</reg> wailings of women were heard not only from private houses, but from every direction matrons pouring into the streets
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> ran about among the shrines of the gods, sweeping the altars with their dishevelled hair, kneeling, holding up their palms to heaven and the gods, and praying them to rescue the city of Rome from the hands of the enemy and to <pb id="p.35"/>keep Roman mothers and little children unharmed.<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>the</reg> senate awaited the magistrates in the Forum, in case they wished its advice about anything. <reg>some</reg> received commands and departed each to the duty assigned him; others volunteered, in case of any need of their services. <reg>garrisons</reg> were posted on the Citadel, on the Capitol, on the walls, around the city, even on the Alban Mount and on the citadel of Aefula.<note>Aefula, not far from Tibur, disappeared early, but gave its name to the Mons Aeflanus, which in Domitian's time (A.D. 88) was pierced by a long tunnel for the Aqua Claudia.</note> <reg>in</reg> the midst of this turmoil word came that Quintus Fulvius, the proconsul, had set out from Capua with an army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>and</reg> that his military power might not be annulled if he came into the city, the senate decreed that Quintus Fulvius should have equal authority with the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>Hannibal</name>, after laying waste the territory of Fregellae more ruthlessly on account of the breaking down of the bridges, came through the districts of Frusino and Ferentinum and Anagnia into that of Labici.<note>According to Livy it had been a colony since <date value="-418">418 B.C.</date>; IV. xlvii. 6; xlix 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>then</reg> over Mount Algidus he went to Tusculum, and not being admitted to the city, he descended toward the right below Tusculum to Gabii. <reg>thence</reg> he led his army down into the Pupinian district<note>Between Rome and Tusculum. <reg>from</reg> it came the name of the tribus Pupinia; Festus p. 264 L.</note> and pitched camp eight miles distant from Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>the</reg> nearer the enemy approached the greater was the slaughter of fugitives, as the Numidians were in the lead, and the greater was the number of the captured of every class and age.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<reg>in</reg> this confusion Fulvius Flaccus entered Rome with his army by the Porta Capena,<note>Cf. XXV. xl. 3.</note> and hastened through the centre of the city by way of the Carinae<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the western end of the Oppius, sloping down to the Subura.</note> to the Esquiline. <reg>then</reg> going out he pitched his camp between Porta Esquilina and Porta Collina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>the</reg> plebeian aediles brought supplies thither; the <pb id="p.37"/>consuls and the senate came to the camp; there they<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> deliberated on the most important matters of state. <reg>it</reg> was decided that the consuls should pitch their camps near the gates, Collina and Esquilina;<note>Thus there would be three camps eastward of the Agger of Servius Tullius so &mdash;called, where Hannibal's attack might be anticipated.</note> that Gaius Calpurnius, the city praetor, should be in command of the Capitol and the Citadel, and that the senate in full numbers should be kept in the Forum, in case there might be need of deliberation in such an
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> emergency. <reg>meanwhile</reg> Hannibal moved his camp to the river Anio, three miles from the city. <reg>there</reg> he established a permanent camp and himself with two thousand horsemen advanced toward Porta Collina as far as the Temple of Hercules,<note>Site unknown.</note> and riding up surveyed the walls and situation of the city from the nearest possible
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> point. <reg>that</reg> he should do so with such freedom and so at his leisure seemed to Flaccus a shame. <reg>accordingly</reg> he sent his horsemen against him and ordered that the cavalry of the enemy be driven away and back into their own
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> camp. <reg>after</reg> the engagement had begun, the consuls ordered the Numidian deserters, of whom there were at that time on the Aventine about twelve hundred, to pass through the centre of the city across
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the Esquiline, thinking that none were better suited to do battle in the valleys and around buildings in gardens, among tombs and along roads hemmed in on every side. <reg>when</reg> some men on the Citadel and the Capitol saw them riding down the Clivus Publicius,<note>This street led from the northwest end of the Circus Maximus up on to the Aventine, and southward across that hill; cf. XXVII. xxxvii. 15; XXX. xxvi. 5.</note> they shouted that the Aventine had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> captured. <reg>that</reg> caused so much confusion and flight that, if there had not been a Carthaginian camp outside the city, the whole panic &mdash;stricken multitude would have poured out. <reg>as</reg> it was they fled to their homes and into buildings, and as their own people <pb id="p.39"/>roamed the streets, they would hurl stones and<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> javelins at them, as though they were
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> enemies. <reg>nor</reg> could the uproar be checked and their mistake revealed, since the roads were clogged by the crowd of rustics and the cattle that sudden alarm had driven into the city. <reg>the</reg> cavalry battle was successful and the enemy driven
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> away. <reg>and</reg> because in many places disturbances which arose without reason had to be checked, it was decreed that all who had been dictators, consuls or censors should have full military power until the enemy should have retired from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> walls. <reg>and</reg> in fact during the rest of the day and the following night many disturbances were provoked without reason and were checked.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<reg>on</reg> the next day Hannibal crossed the Anio and led all his forces out into line, and Flaccus and the consuls did not refuse battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>after</reg> the armies had been drawn up on both sides for the issue of a battle in which the city of Rome was to be the prize for the victor, a great downpour mingled with hail so confused both battle &mdash;lines that, holding on to their arms with difficulty, they returned to camp, fearing everything more than the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>and</reg> the following day, when the lines were drawn up on the same spot, the same bad weather parted them. <reg>on</reg> both days, when they had retired to their camps, to their astonishment there came a clear sky with a calm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>for</reg> the Carthaginians it became a solemn warning, and it is reported that Hannibal was heard to say that at one time the purpose to take Rome, at another the chance, was denied him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>two</reg> other things, small and great, further diminished his hope. <reg>the</reg> important thing was that he heard that, although he was sitting armed before the walls of the city of Rome, <pb id="p.41"/>detachments had set out under their colours<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> small banners hanging from a cross &mdash;bar. <reg>the</reg> <hi rend="italics">vexillum</hi> was used by detachments, here of recruits, as also by cavalry; cf. XXV. xiv. 4.</note> to reinforce<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Spain; and the unimportant circumstance was that he learned from a prisoner that about this time the land on which he had his camp chanced to have been sold, with no reduction in price on that
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> account. <reg>but</reg> it seemed to him so arrogant and such an indignity that a purchaser should have been found at Rome for the ground which he had seized in war and was himself its occupier and owner, that he forthwith summoned a herald and ordered the bankers' shops which were round the Roman Forum to be sold.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><reg>influenced</reg> by these circumstances he moved his camp back to the river Tutia, six miles from the city. <reg>thence</reg> he proceeded to the grove of Feronia,<note>In southern Etruria, at the foot of Mt. Soracte; XXVII. iv. 14 f.; XXXIII. xxvi. 8.</note> a shrine which at that time was noted for its
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> wealth. <reg>the</reg> people of Capena and others who lived near it used to carry thither first &mdash;fruits and gifts in addition according to their means, and had kept it richly adorned with gold and silver. <reg>of</reg> all those gifts the temple was at that time despoiled. <name>Great</name> heaps of bronze were found after the departure of Hannibal, since the soldiers inspired by religious fear deposited crude
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> lumps. <reg>as</reg> to the spoiling of this temple there is no uncertainty among the historians. <reg>coelius</reg> relates that on his way to Rome Hannibal turned aside to it from Eretum, and traces his march from Reate and Cutiliae and
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Amiternum. <reg>he</reg> says that from Campania he came into Samnium, thence into the land of the Paelignians, and passing the town of Sulmo, over into the country of the Marrucini; thence through the territory of Alba<note>Alba Fucens, northwest of the Lacus Fucinus; XXX. xvii. 2.</note> into that of the Marsians, and then to Amiternum and the village of
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <pb id="p.43"/>Foruli. <reg>and</reg> the uncertainty is not because the<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> traces of so great a commander and so large an army could within the memory of so short a period have become confused, for it is agreed that he passed that
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> way. <reg>the</reg> only difference is whether he came to the city by that route, or returned by it from the city into Campania.<note>Actually avoiding Campania he went on to the southernmost part of Italy. <name>Cf</name>.

					<reg>but</reg> the Romans' persistence in pressing the siege of Capua was not matched by that of Hannibal in defending it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> through Samnium and Apulia and Lucania he hastened into the Bruttian region, to the strait and Regium, at such a pace as almost to overwhelm them unawares by arriving suddenly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>Capua</name>, although during that time it had been besieged with no less spirit, nevertheless was aware of the coming of Flaccus, and began to wonder that Hannibal had not returned at the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>then</reg> by conversing with the enemy they learned that they had been deserted and abandoned, and that the hope of retaining Capua had been given up by the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>there</reg> was also an edict of the proconsuls, posted and published among the enemy in accordance with a decree of the senate, that any Capuan citizen who changed sides before a certain date should suffer no penalty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>and</reg> yet there was no changing of sides, for fear restrained them more than honour, because in their revolt they had committed offences too serious to be pardoned. <reg>but</reg> just as no one of his own motion went over to the enemy, so they made no promising plans for the common interest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>the</reg> nobility had deserted the state and could not be brought together in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>in</reg> the office of magistrate was a man who had not gained additional honour for himself, but by his own unworthiness had <pb id="p.45"/>taken away power and authority from the office which<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> he was holding.<note>Cf. vi. 13 ff.</note> <reg>no</reg> longer did any one of the foremost citizens show himself even in the forum or any public place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>shut</reg> up in their houses they were awaiting from day to day the fall of their native city and their own destruction.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>the</reg> chief responsibility had fallen wholly to Bostar and Hanno, commanders of the Carthaginian garrison, and they were concerned only for their own danger, not that of their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>they</reg> wrote a letter to Hannibal in terms not only outspoken, but also bitter, in which they charged that it was not Capua alone that had been delivered into the hands of the enemy, but that they themselves also and the garrison had been abandoned to every kind of torture; that he had gone away to the land of the Bruttii, as though turning his back so that Capua should not be captured before his eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>but</reg> assuredly, they said, the Romans could not be drawn away from besieging Capua even by an assault upon the city of Rome; so much more steadfast was the Roman as an enemy than the Carthaginian as a friend.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>if</reg> he should return to Capua and there concentrate the whole war, they and the Capuans likewise would be ready for a sally.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>it</reg> was not to wage war with the people of Regium and Tarentum that they had crossed the Alps. <reg>where</reg> the Roman legions were, there ought the Carthaginian armies also to be. <name>Thus</name> at Cannae, thus at Trasumennus, by coming to grips and pitching camp near the enemy, by trying their luck they had met with success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>a</reg> letter to this effect was given to Numidians who with a reward set before them promised to perform that service. <reg>posing</reg> as deserters they had come before Flaccus in his camp, with the <pb id="p.47"/>intention of choosing the right moment and then<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> departing &mdash;and the famine which had lasted so long at Capua gave every man a plausible reason for deserting &mdash;when
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> suddenly a Campanian woman, mistress of one of the deserters, came into the camp and informed the Roman general that the Numidians by agreement had pretended to change sides and were bearing a letter to Hannibal: that she was prepared to prove that charge against one of their number who had revealed the matter to her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>on</reg> being produced, he at first quite firmly pretended that he did not know the woman. <reg>then</reg> by degrees he was overpowered by the facts, and seeing that they were demanding and preparing torture, he admitted that it was true, and the letter was produced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>she</reg> added to her information what they were trying to conceal, namely, that other Numidians also were abroad in the Roman camp playing the part of deserters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <reg>over</reg> seventy of them were arrested, and together with the new deserters they were scourged with rods, and after their hands had been cut off<note>The usual punishment for spies; XXII. xxxiii. 1.</note> they were sent back to Capua.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<reg>the</reg> sight of so merciless a punishment broke the spirit of the Capuans. <reg>a</reg> gathering of the people before the Senate House compelled Loesius to summon the senate. <reg>and</reg> they openly threatened the leading citizens, who for a long time had been absent from public deliberations, that if they did not come into the senate, they would make the rounds of their homes and forcibly bring them all out into the streets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>the</reg> fear of that gave the magistrate a full session of the senate. <reg>there</reg>, while all the rest were speaking of sending legates to the Roman generals, Vibius Virrius,<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> on being asked for his opinion, said that the<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> men who were speaking of embassies and of peace and surrender did not recall either what they would have done, if they had had the Romans in their power, or what they themselves must suffer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote><reg>tell</reg> me,</quote> he said, <quote>do you suppose it will be the same kind of surrender as that under which we once gave up ourselves and all our possessions to the Romans, that we might obtain their aid against the Samnites?<note>Cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>have</reg> you already forgotten in what a critical moment and in what a situation for the Roman people we have revolted from them? <reg>have</reg> you already forgotten how at the time of our revolt we with torture and as an insult put to death a garrison which we might have let go?<note>Somewhat differently told in XXIII. vii. 3.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> or how often and with what bitterness we have made a sally against the besiegers, have beset their camps, have called in Hannibal to overpower them?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> or how &mdash;this the most recent occurrence &mdash;we have sent him away to lay siege to Rome? <reg>and</reg> now for the other side, recall what have been their acts of hostility towards us, that by so doing you may know what you have to expect. <reg>when</reg> a foreign enemy &mdash;was in Italy, and that enemy Hannibal, and when everywhere were the flames of war, neglecting everything, neglecting even Hannibal, they sent both consuls and two consular armies to besiege Capua.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>now</reg> for the second year they are wasting us away by starvation, shut up inside their contravallation, while they too like ourselves have endured the utmost dangers and most serious hardships, have been slain, many of them, about their earthworks and trenches, and have at last had their camp almost taken.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>but</reg> I pass over these things; to suffer hardships and dangers in besieging a city of <pb id="p.51"/>the enemy is an old and familiar story. <reg>i</reg> proceed to<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> proof of anger and hatred that are unspeakable.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>Hannibal</name> with immense forces of infantry and cavalry besieged and partly captured their camp: by such danger they were not moved at all to give up the siege.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>setting</reg> out across the Volturnus he ravaged the territory of Cales with fire: by such a disaster to allies they were in no wise called away. <reg>he</reg> ordered his hostile standards to be carried to the city of Rome itself: that impending storm also they scorned. <reg>crossing</reg> the Anio<note>His first camp had been on the right bank of the Anio; x. 3; xi. 1; Polybius IX. v. 9.</note> he pitched camp three miles from the city, finally came close to the very walls and gates, showed that unless they should leave Capua he would take Rome away from them: they did not leave Capua. <reg>wild</reg> beasts, though excited by blind impulse and fury, can be diverted to bring help to their young, if one goes towards their lairs and their whelps.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>as</reg> for the Romans, the siege of Rome, their wives and children, whose wailing could almost be heard from here, their altars and hearths, the shrines of their gods, the desecrated and profaned tombs of their ancestors did not divert them from Capua.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>such</reg> is their ardour in demanding punishment, such their thirst to drink our blood.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>and</reg> perhaps not without reason; we too should have done the same, had the chance been given us. <reg>therefore</reg> since the immortal gods have made a contrary decision, inasmuch as I ought under no circumstances to refuse death, I, while free and my own master, can escape tortures and insults which the enemy is preparing, by a death which is not only honourable, but also gentle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>i</reg> shall not see Appius Claudius and Quintus Fulvius, emboldened by their insolent victory, nor shall I be dragged in chains <pb id="p.53"/>through the city of Rome as a spectacle in a triumph,<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> so that I may then breathe my last in the prison, or else, bound to a stake, with my back mangled by rods, may submit my neck to the Roman axe. <reg>nor</reg> shall I see my native city destroyed and burned, nor Capuan matrons and maidens and free &mdash;born boys carried off to be dishonoured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <name>Alba</name>, from which they had themselves sprung, they levelled with its foundations,<note>Cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, as many of you as are minded to yield to fate before they see all these sights that are so bitter, for such in my house a feast is spread and in readiness today.

					<reg>this</reg> speech of Virrius more men heard with approval than had the courage to carry out what they commended.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>the</reg> majority of the senate, not doubting that the clemency of the Roman people, <pb id="p.55"/>known to them frequently in many wars, would be<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> forgiving to them also, voted and sent legates to surrender Capua to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>about</reg> twenty &mdash;seven senators followed Vibius Virrius home; and after they had feasted with him, and so far as possible had deadened their minds with wine to the sense of impending misfortune, they all took the poison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>then</reg> at the end of the feast they gave each other the right hand and a last embrace, and weeping for their own fate and that of their native city, some remained, that they might be cremated on the same pyre, the rest left for their several homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>filled</reg> with food and wine, their veins made the poison less effectual in hastening death. <reg>and</reg> so, although most of them were in the throes through the whole of the night and part of the following day, all of them, however, died before the gates were opened to the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>on</reg> the next day the Jupiter Gate,<note>Towards Tifata and its temple of Jupiter. <reg>by</reg> this gate the Via Appia seems to have left the city on its way to Beneventum.</note> which faced the Roman camp, was opened by order of the proconsuls. <reg>by</reg> that gate one legion was admitted and two <hi rend="italics">alae</hi><note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> cavalry units of the allies, say 500 men each.</note> with Gaius Fulvius, the lieutenant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>he</reg> first of all saw to it that the arms and weapons that were in Capua should be brought to him; then posting sentinels at all the gates, that no one might be able to go out or be sent out, he seized the Carthaginian garrison, and ordered the Capuan senate to go to the Roman generals in the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>arrived</reg> there, they were all put in chains and bidden to bring to the quaestors what gold and silver they had. <reg>the</reg> amount of gold was two thousand and seventy pounds, of silver thirty &mdash;one thousand two hundred <pb id="p.57"/>pounds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>of</reg> the senators known to have especially<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> promoted revolt from the Romans twenty &mdash;five were sent to Cales to be imprisoned, twenty &mdash;eight to Teanum.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<reg>on</reg> the punishment of the Capuan senators there was no kind of agreement between Fulvius and Claudius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>ready</reg> to hear a plea for pardon was Claudius; more inflexible was Fulvius' opinion. <reg>accordingly</reg> Appius was inclined to refer the entire decision of the case to the senate at Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>furthermore</reg> he thought it right that the fathers should be given authority to enquire of these men whether they had shared their plans with some of the Latin allies, and whether they had been helped by them in the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>but</reg> Fulvius said that they must on no account run the risk of troubling the feelings of faithful allies by unsubstantiated charges and of exposing them to informers, who never had had any scruple as to what they were saying or what they were doing; hence he would quash and suppress that investigation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>when</reg> they had separated directly after this speech, Appius had no doubt that his colleague, in spite of his fierce words, would wait, however, for a letter from Rome on a matter of such importance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>but</reg> Fulvius for fear that very thing might hinder his project, dismissed the council, and ordered the tribunes of the soldiers and the prefects of allies to instruct two thousand picked cavalry &mdash;to be ready at the bugle &mdash;call of the third watch.</p> 
				<p><reg>setting</reg> out by night for Teanum with this cavalry, he entered the gate at dawn and proceeded to the forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>at</reg> the first entry of the horsemen a crowd <pb id="p.59"/>gathered, and he bade that the Sidicinian<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> magistrate<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> no doubt the <hi rend="italics">medix tuticus</hi> of the region in which Teanum lay.</note> be summoned, and ordered him to bring out the Capuans whom he had under arrest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>all</reg> were brought out, scourged with rods and beheaded.<note>Not as prisoners of war, but as Roman citizens whose lives were forfeited because of dealing with the enemy; so ordained in the XII Tables; cf. <hi rend="italics"><reg>digest</reg></hi> XLVIII. iv. 3.</note> <reg>thence</reg> he hastened at full speed to Cales. <reg>there</reg>, after he had taken his seat on the tribunal and the Capuans were brought out and were being bound to stakes, came a horseman post haste from Rome and handed to Fulvius a letter from Gaius Calpurnius, the praetor, and a decree of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>beginning</reg> at the tribunal a rumour spread through the whole assembly that the case of the Capuans was reserved for decision by the senators. <name>Fulvius</name> also thought that was the case, took the letter, but without breaking the seal, and having placed it in his bosom, commanded a herald to order the lictor to carry out the legal punishment. <name>Thus</name> was punishment visited upon those also who were at Cales.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>then</reg> the letter was read and the decree of the senate, too late to prevent an action which had been hastened by every means, that prevention might be impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>just</reg> as Fulvius was rising from his seat, Taurea Vibellius the Capuan, striding through the middle of the crowd, called him by name, and when Flaccus, wondering what he wished of him, had sat down again, Vibellius said
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> <quote><reg>order</reg> me also to be slain, that you may be able to boast that a much braver man than you are yourself has been slain by you.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>when</reg> Flaccus said that the man was doubtless of unsound mind, and then added that, if he wished to do so, he was forbidden by the decree of the senate, thereupon Vibellius said <quote><reg>since</reg> indeed, although my native city has been taken, my relatives and friends lost, and
						<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> with my own hand I have killed my wife and <pb id="p.61"/>children, that they might suffer no indignity, for<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> myself there is not the same possibility even to die that these my fellow &mdash;citizens have had, let courage give me a release from this odious life.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>and</reg> so with a sword which he had concealed under his clothing he ran himself directly through the breast and fell dying at the feet of the general.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<reg>because</reg> all that had to do with the punishment of the Capuans and many other things were done by the decision of Flaccus alone, some relate that Appius Claudius died just before the surrender of Capua.<note>So Zonaras IX. vi. <name>Livy</name> at xxxiii. 4 says <hi rend="italics">post captam</hi> (<hi rend="italics"><name>Capuam</name></hi>), following another authority. <name>Appius</name> died of his wound.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>further</reg>, they say that Taurea himself did not voluntarily come to Cales, and was not slain by his own hand, but that while he was being bound along with the rest to a stake, because what he was shouting could not be heard clearly for the noise, Flaccus ordered silence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that then Taurea, as has been stated above, said that he, the bravest of men, was being killed by one who was in no way his equal in courage; that after these words the herald by order of the proconsul proclaimed <quote><reg>lictor</reg>, give the brave man a beating; on him first the legal penalty!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>some</reg> authorities say that the decree of the senate also was read before he beheaded them; but that, because in the decree of the senateit was added that, if he saw fit,<note>The regular formula when the senate instructed a magistrate; cf. XXII. xxxiii. 9; XXV. xli. 9.</note> he should refer the decision to the verdict of the senate, he interpreted it that they allowed him to decide which course he thought more to the interest of the state.</p> 
				<p><reg>from</reg> Cales they returned to Capua, and the surrender of Atella and Calatia was received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>there</reg> also punishment was inflicted on the responsible <pb id="p.63"/>leaders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>Thus</name> about seventy prominent senators<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> were put to death;<note>Including the fifty &mdash;three executed at Teanum and Cales. <reg>for</reg> a more detailed statement of the terms meted out to Capua see below, xxxiv. 2 ff.</note> some three hundred noble Campanians who were put in prison, and others who were distributed among cities of Latin allies to be guarded, met death in different ways. <reg>the</reg> remaining mass of Campanian citizens were
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> sold. <reg>in</reg> regard to the city and its territory discussion continued,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> at Rome, in the senate.</note> inasmuch as some thought a city very powerful, near, and unfriendly should be destroyed. <reg>but</reg> immediate advantage prevailed. <reg>for</reg> on account of the territory, which was well known to be foremost in Italy in all that the fertile soil produced, the city was preserved, that the tillers of the land might have some
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> abode. <reg>to</reg> people the city the multitude of resident aliens and freedmen and petty tradesmen and artisans was retained. <reg>the</reg> whole territory and the buildings became public property of the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> people. <reg>but</reg> it was decided that Capua, as a nominal city, should merely be a dwelling &mdash;place and a centre of population, but should have no political body nor senate nor council of the plebs nor
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> magistrates. <reg>they</reg> thought that the multitude, without a public council, without military authority, having nothing in common amongst them, would be incapable of agreement; the Romans would send out every year a prefect to administer

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> demolition. <reg>and</reg> <pb id="p.65"/>along with profit they sought a reputation among<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> the allies as well for clemency, by saving a very important and very rich city, over whose ruins all Campania, all the neighbouring peoples on every side of Campania, would have
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> mourned. <reg>the</reg> enemy were forced to acknowledge what power the Romans possessed to exact punishment from faithless allies, and how helpless Hannibal was to defend those whom he had taken under his protection.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<reg>at</reg> Rome the senate, having discharged its responsibilities so far as concerned Capua, voted to assign to Gaius Nero six thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry of his own choosing, from the two legions which he had had before Capua, and from the Latin allies the same number of infantry and eight hundred cavalry. <reg>this</reg> army Nero embarked at Puteoli and transported to Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>arrived</reg> at Tarraco by sea, he there disembarked his troops, beached the ships, and armed even the crews, to increase his numbers. <reg>then</reg> setting out for the river Ebro, he took over the army from Tiberius Fonteius and Lucius Marcius.<note>Cf. Vol. VI. 476-8; above, pp. 4-6; also 76, 140.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>he</reg> thereupon proceeded against the enemy. <name>Hasdrubal</name>, the son of Hamilcar, was encamped at the Black Rocks. <reg>the</reg> place is in the country of the Ausetani,<note>Close to the eastern Pyrenees; Vol. VIII. p. 212, n. 1.</note> between the towns of Iliturgis<note>Here confused with a town in distant Baetica; Vol. VI. 166; De Sanctis, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 451, n. 15.</note> and Mentissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Nero</name> occupied the entrance to this pass. <name>Hasdrubal</name>, to avoid being entrapped, sent a herald to promise that if he should be allowed to get away, he would transport his entire army out of Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>the</reg> Roman accepted the proposal with joy, and Hasdrubal asked for the next day for a conference, that in person
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> they might draw up <pb id="p.67"/>the terms for the surrender of the citadels of cities<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> and fix a date before which the garrisons were to be evacuated, and the Carthaginians might remove all their property without molestation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>having</reg> gained that request, Hasdrubal at once gave orders that at dusk and then all through the night the heaviest troops should escape from the pass by any possible way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Great</name> pains were taken not to have many leave that night, that even their small numbers might be better suited both to escaping the enemy's notice by silence and to making their way out by narrow and difficult paths.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>next</reg> day they came to the conference;<note>Frontinus gives a brief account of Hasdrubal's ruse; <hi rend="italics"><reg>strait</reg>.</hi> I. vi 19.</note> but by speaking at unnecessary length and by purposely writing what was not to the point the day was spent, and postponement taken to the next day. <reg>the</reg> addition of the following night gave them time to send out others as well;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and on the following day the business did not reach an end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>Thus</name> several days were spent in arguing openly about terms, and several nights in secretly sending Carthaginians away from the camp. <reg>and</reg> after the larger part of the army had been sent away, they ceased any longer to stand by even what they had been the first to propose. <reg>and</reg> there was less and less agreement, as honesty declined along with fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>by</reg> this time nearly all the infantry forces had escaped from the pass when at daybreak a dense fog covered the whole pass and the adjacent plain. <name>Hasdrubal</name> on noticing that, sent a messenger to Nero, to postpone the conference until the next day: that day was banned among the Carthaginians, he said, for the doing of anything serious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>as</reg> even then fraud was <pb id="p.69"/>not suspected, excuse for that day was granted, and<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> forthwith Hasdrubal with his cavalry and elephants left camp, and without any noise escaped to a place of safety. <reg>at</reg> about the fourth hour the burning away of the fog by the sun cleared the air, and the Romans caught sight of the empty camp of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>when</reg> Claudius, who until then did not recognize the Punic deception, perceived that he had been tricked, he pressed the pursuit of a departing enemy,
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> he being all ready to engage in pitched battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>but</reg> the enemy refused to fight. <reg>and</reg> yet there were slight engagements between the rear of the Carthaginian column and the advance guard of the Romans.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>and</reg> at Rome, after the recovery of Capua, senate and people were no longer more concerned about Italy than about Spain.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>while</reg> some were naming one man, others another, finally they had recourse to the holding of an election to name a proconsul<note>To be so styled there was no requirement that a man should have been consul or even praetor; cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>at</reg> first people had waited for those who<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> thought themselves deserving of so important a command to hand in their names. <reg>when</reg> that hope was disappointed, grief for the disaster they had suffered was renewed, and regret for the lost generals.</p> 
				<p><reg>and</reg> so the citizens mourned, being almost devoid of any plan; nevertheless on the election day they went down into the Campus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>and</reg> turning towards the magistrates they scanned the faces of the leading men, who were looking at one and another of their number, and there were complaints that the situation was so desperate and hope for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> state so given up that no man ventured to accept the command for Spain, when suddenly Publius Cornelius, son of that Publius Cornelius who had fallen in Spain, being about twenty &mdash;four years of age,<note>He had distinguished himself at seventeen in the battle of the Ticinus; XXI. xlvi. 7 ff.; Polybius X. iii, 4 ff., who with a later date for his command in Spain makes him twenty &mdash;seven at this time (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> vi. 10).

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> seen. <reg>all</reg> faces were turned towards him, and then by their shouts of approval they at once predicted a fortunate and auspicious
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> command. <reg>thereupon</reg>, bidden to cast their votes, not only all the centuries, but also every single man voted that Publius Scipio should have the command in
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Spain. <reg>but</reg> after the thing was done, now that impulsiveness and enthusiasm had subsided, there came a sudden silence and they thought to themselves, What had they done? <reg>had</reg> not partiality outweighed reasoning? <reg>it</reg> was his youth that they especially
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> regretted. <reg>some</reg> also shrank from the destiny of the house, and from the name of one who was setting out from two afflicted families<note>But at least a year has elapsed.</note> for <pb id="p.73"/>provinces where his campaign must be about the tombs<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> of his father and his uncle.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<reg>when</reg> he noticed this anxiety and concern, following an action taken with such impulsiveness, Scipio called an assembly, and discoursed with such elevation of spirit on his age and the command entrusted to him and the war to be waged, that he again
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> awakened and revived the ardour which had cooled, and filled men with a more assured hope than belief in a man's promise or reasoning based upon confidence of his success usually inspires.

					<reg>at</reg> the end of the same summer, upon the arrival of Marcus Marcellus at the city from his province of Sicily, a session of the senate in the Temple of Bellona was granted him by Gaius Calpurnius, the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg> after speaking of his achievements he complained gently, not more on his own account than that of the soldiers, because even after completing his task in the province, he had not been permitted to bring home his army, and he demanded that he be permitted to enter the city in triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>that</reg> request was not granted. <reg>there</reg> was first a wordy discussion whether it was more illogical <pb id="p.81"/>that he in whose name, though absent, a<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> thanksgiving for successes gained under his command had been decreed and honour rendered to the gods, should be denied a triumph when present, or on the other hand that he whom they had ordered to tum over his army to a successor &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> vote which was not taken except when a war still remained in the province &mdash;should triumph just as though the war were finished, and in spite of the absence of the army to witness his triumph as deserved or undeserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>thereupon</reg> they adopted a compromise, that he should enter the city in an ovation.<note>On horseback, or even on foot, not in the triumphal chariot. <reg>for</reg> the ovation cf. <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XXXIX. xxix. 5; Plutarch <hi rend="italics"><name>Marcellus</name></hi> xxii. 2; Cassius Dio LIV. viii.; Dionysius V. xlvii.; Gellius V. vi. 27.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>the</reg> tribune of the plebs on the authority of the senate brought before the people the proposal that Marcus Marcellus should have full military power on the day on which he entered the city in an ovation.

					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>in</reg> the midst of these difficulties Marcus Cornelius, the praetor, quieted the soldiers' excitement, now by consoling, now by censuring them; <pb id="p.85"/>likewise he reduced to subjection all the city &mdash;states<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> which had revolted. <reg>and</reg> of these he assigned Murgentia to the Spaniards to whom a city with its territory was due in conformity with a decree of the senate.</p>

					<reg>since</reg> both consuls had Apulia as their province, and there was now less alarm from the Carthaginians and Hannibal, they were ordered to cast lots for Apulia and Macedonia as their provinces. <name>Macedonia</name> fell to Sulpicius, and he succeeded Laevinus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>when</reg> a crowd gathered before Manlius, who was present, in order to congratulate him, and the approval of the people was unquestioned, surrounded by a great crowd he came to

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>while</reg> all were in suspense, waiting to know what he was going to demand, he gave the condition of his eyes as an excuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>shameless</reg>, he said, was a pilot and a general too, who, though he must use other men's eyes for everything he did, demanded that the lives and fortunes of others be entrusted to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>therefore</reg>, if Fulvius approved, let him order the Voturia century of the younger men to vote again, and in electing consuls to remember the war that was in Italy and the critical times for the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>their</reg> ears had hardly yet had a respite from the noise and uproar of the enemy when <pb id="p.87"/>the city of Rome had been all but ablaze a few<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> months before. <reg>after</reg> these words the whole century cried out that they refused to make any change in opinion, and would vote for the same men as consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>thereupon</reg> Torquatus said: <quote><reg>neither</reg> shall I as consul be able to put up with your manners, nor will you with my authority. <reg>vote</reg> again, and reflect that a Punic war is in Italy and the commander of the enemy Hannibal.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>then</reg> the century, moved by the prestige of the man and the expressions of admiration on all sides, begged the consul to summon the Voturia century of the older men.<note>The corresponding century of the same first class.</note> <reg>they</reg> wished, they said, to confer with their elders and on their authority to name consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>when</reg> the older men of the Voturia had been summoned, time for a secret conference with them was granted in the Sheepfold.<note>A large enclosed area in the Campus Martius for election purposes. <reg>ovile</reg>, its older name, gave way in general use to that of Saepta. <reg>agrippa</reg> erected there a huge building, the Saepta Iulia, completed in <date value="-26">26 B.C.</date>; Cassius Dio LIII. xxiii.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>the</reg> elders said that they must deliberate in regard to three men, two of them already full of honours, Quintus Fabius and Marcus Marcellus, and if they were quite decided to elect some new man as consul to face the Carthaginians, Marcus Valerius Laevinus; that he had carried on the war brilliantly against King Philip on land and sea. <reg>so</reg> after deliberation in regard to the three men had been allowed, the elders were sent away, and the younger men cast their vote.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>they</reg> voted for Marcus Claudius, at that time resplendent in the light of his conquest of Sicily, and Marcus Valerius as consuls, both being absent. <reg>the</reg> authority of the leading century was followed by all the rest. <reg>let</reg> men now make sport of those who admire what is old.<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>for</reg> my part, if there should be a city &mdash;state of sages, such as philosophers imagine rather than <pb id="p.89"/>actually know, I am inclined to think that neither<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> could leading men possibly be of more solid worth and more self &mdash;controlled as regards the lust for power, nor could the populace show a higher character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>but</reg> that a century of the younger men wished to confer with their elders on the question to which persons they should, by their vote, entrust a high command, should seem to us scarcely credible &mdash;this is due to the cheapened and diminished authority even of parents over their children in our day.</p>

					<reg>about</reg> the same time Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had previously sounded the leading men in secret conferences, came on a swift sailing fleet to a council of the Aetolians already appointed for that very purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg> he first set before them the capture of Syracuse and Capua, to convince them of success in Italy and Sicily, and in addition referred to the customary good treatment of allies as handed down to the Romans by their ancestors. <reg>some</reg> of the allies, he said, they had admitted to citizenship and to the same rights as themselves, others they kept in so favoured a situation that they preferred to be allies rather than citizens;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the Aetolians would be held in

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Philip and the Macedonians were their oppressive neighbours, whose might and over &mdash;confidence he had already <pb id="p.93"/>broken and would further reduce to such a pass that<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> they would not only retire from the cities which they had forcibly taken from the Aetolians, but also would find Macedonia itself continually endangered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>and</reg> as for the Acarnanians, whose forcible separation from their federation the Aetolians resented, he said he would restore them to the old written basis, establishing both the rights and the supremacy of the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>these</reg> statements and promises by the Roman general were confirmed by the authority of Scopas, then magistrate<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi><foreign lang="greek">strathgo/s.</foreign></note> of the tribe, and of Dorimachus, a leading man of the Aetolians; while extolling the might and majesty of the Roman people they used less restraint and brought more conviction. <reg>but</reg> most effective was the hope of - getting possession of Acarnania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>accordingly</reg> the terms were written down under which they should enter friendship and alliance with the Roman people; furthermore that, if so disposed and willing, the Eleans and Lacedaemonians and Attalus

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>if</reg> the Aetolians should make peace with Philip they were to append to the treaty that the peace would be <pb id="p.95"/>valid only in case Philip should refrain from war<note type="margin">B.C. 211</note> with the Romans and their allies and those who were subject to the latter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>in</reg> like manner, if the Roman people should make a treaty with the king, they should take care that he have no right to invade the land of the Aetolians and their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>these</reg> terms were agreed upon, and not until two years later were the texts set up, at Olympia by the Aetolians, on the Capitol by the Romans, that they might be attested by consecrated records.<note>Set up in temples, as was usual among Greeks and Romans.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>the</reg> reason for the delay had been the retention of the Aetolian envoys for a long time at Rome. <reg>and</reg> yet that did not hinder active measures. <reg>on</reg> the one hand the Aetolians at once began the war against Philip, on the other Laevinus captured Zacynthus. <reg>this</reg> is a small island, near Aetolia, and has one city of the same name as the island itself; that city he took by storm, except for its citadel. <reg>and</reg> after capturing Oeniadae and Nasus, belonging to the Acarnanians, he annexed them to Aetolia.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that. <reg>accordingly</reg> the consul on the authority of the senate declared before an assembly that any man who made known through whose action the fire had been kindled should have, if a freeman, money as his reward, if a slave, his
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> freedom. <reg>led</reg> by that reward a slave of the Capuan Calavii &mdash;his name was Manus &mdash;declared that his masters, and in addition five young men, Capuan nobles, whose fathers had been beheaded by Quintus Fulvius, had set that fire, and would set others everywhere if they were not arrested. <reg>they</reg> were arrested, themselves and their slaves. <reg>and</reg> at first they tried to discredit the informer and the

				<p><reg>as</reg> the consul Laevinus was passing Capua, a multitude of Capuans flocked about him, begging him with tears to be permitted to go to the senate at Rome, to plead with them, if they could at last be touched by any sense of pity, not to proceed utterly to destroy <pb id="p.107"/>them, and not to allow Quintus Flaccus to wipe out<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> the Capuan

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> people. <reg>he</reg> was keeping them shut up inside the walls for the reason that, if any escaped in some way, they roamed like wild beasts over the country and mangled and slew all that met them. <reg>some</reg> had deserted, he said, to Hannibal, others had gone to set Rome on
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> fire. <reg>in</reg> the half &mdash;burned Forum the consul would find traces of the crime of the Capuans. <name>Vesta</name>'s temple had been the object of attack, and the eternal fires, and, hidden away in its holy place, the fateful pledge<note>The Palladium, the sacred image of Athena, said to have been brought from Troy.</note> of Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> rule. <reg>he</reg> did not think it at all safe to give the Capuans permission to enter the walls of
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Rome. <reg>after</reg> Flaccus had required the Capuans to take an oath that they would return to Capua on the fifth day after they should receive the senate's answer, Laevinus bade them follow him to
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Rome. <reg>surrounded</reg> by this multitude, while at the same time the Sicilians came out to meet him and followed him into Rome, he bore the appearance of a man grieving for the destruction of two very famous cities, and bringing into the city the vanquished in war to be the accusers of men of the greatest
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> eminence. <reg>nevertheless</reg> it was in regard to the state and the provinces that the two consuls first introduced business into the senate.</p> <pb id="p.109"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<reg>there</reg> Laevinus explained how matters<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> stood with Macedonia and Greece, the Aetolians, Acarnanians and Locrians,<note>The Locrians are added on account of the capture of their Anticyra; xxvi. 1-3.</note> and what had been his own achievements there by land and sea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that when Philip was on the point of invading Aetolia, he had driven him back into Macedonia, retiring into the very heart of his kingdom; and that the legion could be withdrawn from that country; that the fleet was enough to keep the king away from Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>so</reg> much did the consul report in regard to himself and the province, his late command. <reg>then</reg> they both brought up the question of the provinces. <reg>the</reg> senate decreed that Italy and the war with Hannibal should be the province of one consul, that the other should have the fleet which Titus Otacilius had commanded and Sicily as his province, with Lucius Cincius, the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>to</reg> the consuls were assigned the two armies which were in Etruria and Gaul; these were four legions. <reg>the</reg> two city legions of the previous year were to be sent into Etruria; the two which Sulpicius had commanded as consul, into Gaul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>Gaul</name> and its legions were to be under the command of the man appointed by the consul whose province was Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>Gaius</name> Calpurnius was sent into Etruria after his praetorship, with his command extended for a year. <reg>and</reg> Capua was assigned as his province to Quintus Fulvius, his command also being extended for a year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>a</reg> reduction in the army of citizens and allies was ordered, so that out of two legions should be formed one, five thousand infantry and three hundred horsemen, while those who had the largest number of campaigns were discharged;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and of the allies there should remain only seven thousand infantry and three hundred horsemen, <pb id="p.111"/>with the same reckoning of campaigns in<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> discharging old soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>for</reg> Gnaeus Fulvius, consul in the previous year, no change was made either in regard to his province of Apulia, or as to the army he had held; his command was merely extended for a year. <name>Publius</name> Sulpicius, his colleague, was bidden to discharge his entire army,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the army which Laevinus had had the year before in Greece. <reg>but</reg> in the next year Sulpicius still kept one legion; XXVII. vii. 15.</note> except the marines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>from</reg> Sicily in the same way the army which Marcus Cornelius commanded was ordered to be discharged as soon as the consul should reach the province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>in</reg> order to hold Sicily the soldiers from Cannae, amounting to about two legions, were given to Lucius Cincius, the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>the</reg> same number were assigned for Sardinia to Publius Manlius Volso, the praetor &mdash;legions which Lucius Cornelius had commanded in the same province the preceding year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>as</reg> for the city legions, the consuls were ordered to enrol them, with the restriction that they should not enlist any man who had been in the army of Marcus Claudius, Marcus Valerius, or Quintus Fulvius,<note>I.e. there were to be no veterans who had been discharged from the armies mentioned above in &sect;&sect; 6-10, partly under the names of later commanders.</note> and that there should not be in that year more than twenty &mdash;one Roman legions.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<reg>after</reg> these decrees of the senate were completed, the consuls cast lots for their provinces. <name>Sicily</name> and the fleet fell to Marcellus, Italy with the war against Hannibal to Laevinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>that</reg> allotment, just as if Syracuse had again been captured, so badly frightened the Sicilians, who were standing before the eyes of the consuls while awaiting the result, that their lamentation and tearful voices at once attracted the eyes of men and later occasioned remark.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>for</reg> <pb id="p.113"/>they went the rounds of the senators' houses in<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> mourning garb, asserting that they would not only leave, each group of them, their native city, but all Sicily, if Marcellus should return again in command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>for</reg> no fault of theirs he had before been merciless to them; what would he do when angry, knowing that Sicilians had come to Rome to complain about himself? <reg>it</reg> was better for that island to be overwhelmed by the fires of Aetna or sunk in the strait than to be handed over as it were to a personal foe for punishment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>these</reg> complaints of the Sicilians, at first circulated in the homes of the nobles, and repeated in conversations inspired partly by pity for the Sicilians, partly by antagonism to Marcellus, even reached the senate. <reg>it</reg> was demanded of the consuls that they raise in the senate the question of an exchange of provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>Marcellus</name> said that, if the Sicilians had already been heard by the senate, his opinion would perhaps have been different.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>as</reg> it was, to prevent any one from saying that they were restrained by fear from freely complaining about the man in whose power they would presently be, he was ready, if it was of no consequence to his colleague, to exchange his province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>he</reg> deprecated, he said, a verdict from the senate in advance;<note>Since a vote of the senate that an exchange of provinces be made would prejudice any subsequent action concerning Marcellus' administration in Sicily.</note> for, granted that it would have been unfair for the choice of a province to be given to his colleague without casting lots, how much greater was the injustice, or rather the insult, if his own allotment should be transferred to that colleague?</p> 
				<p><reg>accordingly</reg> the senate adjourned, after showing what it favoured, but making no such decree.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>between</reg> themselves the consuls made an exchange of provinces, for Fate was sweeping Marcellus in the <pb id="p.115"/>direction of Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>the</reg> result was that he who,<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> after the greatest reverses, had been the first to win from Hannibal the glory of a battle that was not a reverse,<note>At Nola; XXIII. xvi.</note> added to his opponent's fame, being the last of the Roman commanders to fall,<note>As Flaminius and Aemilius Paulus had fallen. <reg>the</reg> death of Marcellus actually occurred two years later, in his 5th consulship; XXVII. xxvii.</note> at the very moment of success in the war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<reg>after</reg> the exchange of provinces the Sicilians were introduced into the senate, and spoke at length on the invariable loyalty of King Hiero towards the Roman people, laying that to the credit of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>as</reg> for Hieronymus, and later, Hippocrates and Epicydes, the tyrants, they said they had themselves hated them for other reasons and especially because of their desertion from the Romans to Hannibal. <reg>on</reg> that account Hieronymus had been slain by the foremost of the young men, almost as if by a verdict of the people. <reg>and</reg> also to bring about the death of Epicydes and Hippocrates a conspiracy of seventy young men of the highest rank had been formed.<note>About eighty in number in XXV. xxiii. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>these</reg> men, they said, had been left in the lurch by the delay of Marcellus, in that he had not brought up his army to Syracuse at the time named in advance, and when
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> an informer appeared, they had all been slain by the tyrants.<note>Cf. <hi rend="italics">l.c.&sect;</hi> 7.</note> <reg>that</reg> tyranny also of Hippocrates and Epicydes had been provoked by Marcellus' cruel plundering of Leontini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>after</reg> that, they said, leading men among the Syracusans had never ceased going over to Marcellus and promising that, whenever he wished it, they would tum the city over to him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but that at first he had preferred to take it by force; then, when after all his efforts he had proved unable to do so either by land or by sea, he had preferred to have the coppersmith Sosis and the Spaniard Moericus advocating <pb id="p.117"/>the surrender of Syracuse, rather than the leading<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> Syracusans, although these volunteered again and again to do so, but to no purpose. <reg>his</reg> motive, of course, was to have the more reasonable excuse for slaughtering and plundering the oldest allies of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>if</reg> it had been not Hieronymus that went over to Hannibal, but the Syracusan people and senate, if it had been the Syracusans that by an act of the state closed the gates to Marcellus, and not rather their tyrants, Hippocrates and Epicydes, after overpowering the Syracusans, if with the animus of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Carthaginians they had waged war against the Roman people, what hostile deed could Marcellus have done beyond what he did do, unless it be to destroy Syracuse?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>certainly</reg> apart from the city &mdash;walls and the emptied houses and the sanctuaries of the gods, broken open and despoiled by removal of the statues of the gods themselves and their adornments, nothing had been left at Syracuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>their</reg> landed property also had been taken away from many,<note>It was now <hi rend="italics">ager publicus</hi> (of. xvi. 8), to be leased normally from the censors, by exception from a general; XXVII. iii. 1.</note> so that they could not support themselves and their families, even on the bare soil, with the help of what was left of their plundered possessions. <reg>they</reg> implored the conscript fathers, they said, if it was impossible for them to restore everything, to order that at least what was visible and could be identified be returned to the owners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>after</reg> they had uttered such complaints and Laevinus had ordered them to leave the temple,<note>The Curia had been duly inaugurated as a <hi rend="italics">templum.</hi></note> that the fathers might
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> be able to deliberate in regard to their demands, <quote><reg>no</reg>, no,</quote> said Marcellus, <quote>let them wait, that I may answer them to their faces, since such are the terms on which we wage war in your behalf, conscript fathers, that we have men vanquished by <pb id="p.119"/>our arms as accusers, and of the two cities captured<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> this year Capua has Fulvius as its defendant, Syracuse has Marcellus.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<reg>when</reg> the legates had been led back into the Senate House, the consul said: <quote><reg>not</reg> so forgetful have I been of the majesty of the Roman people and of this authority of mine, conscript fathers, that if it were a question of a charge brought against me, I as consul would have pleaded my case with Greeks as my accusers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>but</reg> it is not what I have done that is to be inquired into &mdash;for whatever I did in the case of enemies is defended by the law of war &mdash;but what they deserved to suffer. <reg>if</reg> they have not been enemies, it makes no difference whether it was recently or in the time of Hiero that I desolated Syracuse.<note>An indirect way of saying, Why did they bring in Hiero? <name>Cf</name>. xxx. 1.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> if they rebelled against the Roman people, if they attacked our ambassadors with sword and arms,<note>They escaped, though their ship was captured: XXIV. xxxiii. 2.</note> closed their city and walls, defended them against us with an army of Carthaginians, who is indignant because they suffered hostile acts, when they have committed them?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>when</reg> leading men among the Syracusans tried to surrender the city, I rejected them; I preferred Sosis and Moericus the Spaniard as the men to whom I should entrust so important a matter.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>you</reg> are not Syracusans of the lowest rank, inasmuch as you reproach others with their humble station. <reg>who</reg> is there among you who promised that he would open the gates to me, that he would admit my soldiers under arms into the city? <reg>you</reg> hate and curse those who did so, and even here <pb id="p.121"/>you do not refrain from uttering insults against them.<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> <reg>so</reg> far is it from the truth that you also would have done anything of the sort.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>their</reg> humble rank, conscript fathers, of which those men make a reproach, is itself the strongest proof that I did not tum my back upon any man who wished to serve our state.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>before</reg> I laid siege to Syracuse, I endeavoured, now by sending embassies, now by going to a conference, to secure peace; again, it was not until after they showed no shame in injuring ambassadors, and no answer was given even to myself, when I met with their leading men at the gates,<note>Legates at the gates are mentioned in XXIV. xxxiii. 4 and XXV. xxiii. 10, but Marcellus is not named. <name>Cf</name>.

						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>of</reg> what befell the captured it is more reasonable for them to complain in the presence of Hannibal and the defeated Carthaginians than in the senate of a victorious nation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>for</reg> myself, conscript fathers, if I had been intending to deny the despoiling of Syracuse, I should never be using its spoils to adorn the city of Rome. <reg>but</reg> in what I as victor either took from individuals or gave to them, I am quite sure that I acted both according to the law of war and in accordance with each man's desert.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>whether</reg> you confirm those acts, conscript fathers, or not, concerns the state more than myself. <reg>for</reg> my duty has been fully discharged; it is to the interest of the state that you do not make other commanders less energetic for the future by annulling my acts.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>and</reg> seeing that you have heard face to face the words of the Sicilians, and mine as well, conscript fathers, we shall leave the temple at the same time, so that in my <pb id="p.123"/>absence the senate can deliberate with greater<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> freedom.</quote> <reg>so</reg> the Sicilians were dismissed, and he himself withdrew to the Capitol to conduct the levy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<reg>the</reg> other consul laid the matter of the Sicilians' demands before the fathers. <reg>among</reg> them for a long time there was a conflict of opinions, and many senators, with Titus Manlius Torquatus as
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> spokesman for that opinion, thought that they should have gone to war with the tyrants, enemies both of the Syracusans and of the Roman people, and that the city ought to have been taken over,<note>As an ally, after its surrender.</note> not captured, and once taken over, should have been confirmed in the possession of its former laws and its freedom, not crushed by war when already exhausted by a pitiful slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>they</reg> said that in the conflicts between the tyrants and the Roman commander the most beautiful and famous of cities, set up in the midst as a prize for the victor, had been destroyed, the granary and treasury formerly of the Roman people, for by its generous gifts on many occasions, and last of all in this very Punic war,<note>For Hiero's ample gifts see XXII. xxxvii; XXIII. xxi. 5 and xxxviii, 13.</note> the republic had been aided and enriched.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>if</reg> King Hiero, most faithful in his devotion to the Roman empire, should rise from the lower world, with what face could they show him either Syracuse or Rome, when after a backward look at his native city, half &mdash;ruined and despoiled, upon entering Rome he was to see in the forecourt of the city, almost at the gate, the spoils of his own city?<note>The reference is to the two temples built by Marcellus outside the Porta Capena and adorned by him with spoils of Syracuse; XXVII. xxv. 7 ff. <name>Cf</name>.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>although</reg> these words and others to the same effect were spoken in order to arouse hatred against the consul and pity for the Sicilians, the senate nevertheless adopted a milder decree:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that the acts of Marcus Marcellus, during his conduct of the war and as victor, were to be ratified; for the <pb id="p.125"/>future the Syracusan state would be cared for by the<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> senate, and they would instruct the consul Laevinus to take measures for the property of its citizens, so far as could be done without loss to the republic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>two</reg> senators were sent to the consul on the Capitol, that he should return to the Senate House; and after the Sicilians had been brought in, the decree of the senate was read.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>and</reg> the legates, dismissed with kind words, threw themselves down before the knees of Marcellus, the consul, imploring him to pardon what they had said in lamenting and seeking to mitigate their misfortune, and that he would take them and the city of Syracuse under his protection and patronage. <reg>making</reg> this promise the consul spoke to them gently and dismissed them.</p>

					<reg>the</reg> Campanians then had their hearing in the senate, and their speech was more pitiful, their case more difficult.

					<reg>the</reg> Sicilians and Campanians having been sent away, a levy was held.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>then</reg>, once an army had been enrolled, they began to take up the question of recruiting more oarsmen. <reg>for</reg> this purpose, inasmuch as there was neither a sufficient supply of men, nor any money at that time in the treasury out of which
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> they might be procured and receive their pay, the consuls in an edict ordered that private citizens according to their census and classes, as before,<note>In <date value="-214">214 B.C.</date>; XXIV. xi. 7 f.</note> should furnish oarsmen, with pay and rations for thirty days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>in</reg> response to that edict there was such protest among the people, such indignation, that what was lacking for an uprising was a leader rather than fuel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>next</reg> after the Sicilians and Campanians the consuls, they said, had taken upon themselves the task of ruining and destroying the Roman populace. <reg>exhausted</reg> by tribute for so many years, they had nothing left <pb id="p.135"/>but the land, bare and desolate. <reg>their</reg> houses had<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> been burned by the enemy, the slaves who tilled the soil had been taken away by the state, now by purchase at a low price for military service, now by impressing them as oarsmen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>if</reg> a man had any money in silver or bronze, it had been taken away for the pay of oarsmen and the yearly taxes.<note>For the emergency tax (direct) cf. XXIII. xxxi. 1 and xlviii. 8. Normally citizens were exempt from this <hi rend="italics">tributum.</hi> <reg>it</reg> was regarded as a forced loan, to be repaid later, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> after a triumph in <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date>; XXXIX. vii. 5.</note> <reg>as</reg> for themselves, they could not be compelled by any force, by any authority, to give what they did not have. <reg>let</reg> their property be sold, let their bodies &mdash;all that remained &mdash;be harshly treated; not even for the purposes of a ransom was anything left to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>such</reg> were the complaints of a great multitude, not in secret, but openly in the Forum and even before the eyes of the consuls, as they flocked about them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>and</reg> the consuls, now upbraiding, now consoling, were unable to quiet them. <reg>thereupon</reg> they said that they gave the people three days for reflection, a time which they themselves employed in looking into the matter and seeking a solution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>the</reg> following day they held a session of the senate on the recruiting of more oarsmen. <reg>there</reg>, after setting forth many reasons why refusal on the part of the populace was fair, they so far altered their language as to say that the burden, whether fair or unfair, must be laid upon private citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>for</reg> from what source were they to get crews, when there was no money in the treasury? <reg>and</reg> without fleets how could either Sicily be held, or Philip kept away from Italy, or the coasts of Italy be safe?</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<reg>when</reg> in this difficult situation wisdom faltered, and a kind of lethargy had almost taken possession of men's minds, Laevinus, the consul, said that, as magistrates are superior to

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote><reg>if</reg> there is a duty which you wish to lay upon an inferior, and you first set up the same obligation as against yourself and your family, you more readily find everyone submitting. <reg>and</reg> the outlay is not burdensome, when they see every prominent man taking upon himself more than his share in it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, if we wish the Roman people to have fleets and equip them, and private citizens to furnish oarsmen without protest, let us first impose that upon ourselves.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>gold</reg>, silver, coined bronze, let us senators bring it all into the treasury tomorrow, with the reservation that each is to leave a ring for himself and for his wife and his children, and a <hi rend="italics">bulla</hi> for a son, and those who have a wife or daughters may leave for each an ounce of gold by weight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>of</reg> silver those who have occupied curule chairs may leave horse &mdash;trappings<note><hi rend="italics">I.e. phalerae,</hi> disks or medallions, a distinction here reserved for a small number of the senators; cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>the</reg> rest of the senators may leave only a pound of silver. <reg>of</reg> coined bronze let us leave five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> to each paterfamilias.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>all</reg> the rest of the gold, silver, coined bronze let us forthwith deposit with the bank commissioners,<note>Cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>this</reg> is the one way we consuls <pb id="p.139"/>have found, after conferring together at length;<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> enter upon it with the kind aid of the gods! <reg>the</reg> commonwealth, if preserved, easily assures the preservation of private wealth also. <reg>in</reg> betraying what belongs to the commonwealth one tries in vain to save one's own possessions.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>to</reg> these words agreement was so spirited that they actually thanked the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>the</reg> senate then adjourned, and each man brought his own gold and silver and bronze into the treasury, while such rivalry was aroused to have their names the first or among the first men on the public records, that neither were the commissioners equal to the task of receiving nor the clerks to that of making the entries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>the</reg> knightly order followed this unanimity of the senate, the populace that of the knights.<note>For the ultimate repayment of all these voluntary loans cf. XXIX. xvi. 1-3; XXXI. xiii. 2 ff.</note> <name>Thus</name> without an edict, without constraint on the part of any magistrate, the state lacked neither oarsmen to fill the complement nor their pay; also every preparation for war being complete, the consuls set out for their provinces.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<reg>and</reg> there was no other time in the war when Carthaginians and Romans, equally involved in changing fortunes, were in a more uncertain state of hope and fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>that</reg> is, for the Romans, in the provinces, defeat in Spain on the one hand, success in Sicily on the other, had mingled sorrow and rejoicing;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> so also in Italy the capture of Tarentum brought loss and grief, while the retention of the citadel and garrison contrary to expectation brought joy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>and</reg> the sudden alarm and panic when the city of Rome was beset and attacked was turned into gladness by the taking of Capua a few days later.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>overseas</reg> also were events balanced with a certain alternation: <pb id="p.141"/>Philip's turning enemy at an inopportune moment,<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> the addition of the Aetolians and Attalus, King of Asia, as new allies, just as if fortune were now pledging to the Romans rule over the East.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>the</reg> Carthaginians likewise balanced the capture of Tarentum against the loss of Capua;<note>But this rhetorical balance does not do justice to Hannibal's sense of what he had lost in the fall of Capua. <name>Cf</name>. xxxviii. 1.</note> and although they made it their boast that they had reached the walls of the city of Rome with no one preventing, yet they were annoyed at the failure of their undertaking and ashamed to find
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> themselves so scorned that, while they were sitting before the walls of Rome, out of another gate marched a Roman army bound for Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>as</reg> for their Spanish provinces, the nearer they had come to the hope that, after the slaughter of two great commanders and armies, the war there was over and the Romans driven out, the more indignation did those very provinces arouse that the victory had been rendered null and void by Lucius Marcius, an emergency commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Thus</name> with Fortune maintaining the balance, there was general suspense for both sides, hope remaining unchanged, fear unchanged, as though they were then for the first time beginning the war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<name>Hannibal</name> was above all else distressed that Capua, besieged with more persistence by the Romans than it was defended by himself, had estranged from him many peoples in
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Italy, not all of whom could he hold by garrisons, unless he were willing to parcel out his army in many small detachments, which was not at all to his advantage at that time. <reg>nor</reg> on the other hand could he by withdrawing his garrisons leave the loyalty of allies free to hope<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> that they might gain the favour of the winning side.</note> or exposed to fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>naturally</reg> inclined to greed and cruelty, his temperament favoured despoiling what <pb id="p.143"/>he was unable to protect, in order to leave desolated<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> lands to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>that</reg> policy was shameful in the beginning, and especially so in the outcome. <reg>for</reg> not only were those who suffered undeserved treatment alienated, but all the rest as well; for the lesson reached larger numbers than did the suffering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>nor</reg> did the Roman consul fail to work upon the feelings of cities, if any hope had showed itself from any quarter.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>Dasius</name> was friendly to Hannibal, Blattius promoted the Roman cause so far as he safely could, and through secret messengers had roused in Marcellus a hope of betrayal. <reg>but</reg> without the aid of Dasius the matter could not be carried out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>after</reg> much hesitation for a long time, and even then rather owing to the lack of a better plan than with the hope of success, he addressed himself to Dasius. <reg>but</reg> Dasius, being not only averse to the project, but also unfriendly to one who was his rival for the highest position, disclosed the matter to Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>when</reg> both had been summoned, and Hannibal on the tribune was occupied with certain business, intending presently to hear the case of Blattius, and accuser and defendant were standing there, while the crowd had been cleared away, Blattius addressed himself to Dasius on the treason.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Dasius</name>, to be sure, as though the evidence was clear, cried out that before Hannibal's eyes he was being urged to tum traitor. <reg>to</reg> Hannibal and his assessors the matter seemed less credible as being so bold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>it</reg> was only their rivalry and hatred surely, they said, and the charge <pb id="p.145"/>brought was of a sort in which the fabricator had the<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> more freedom because it could not have a witness. <reg>so</reg> they were discharged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>and</reg> Blattius did not desist from so bold an undertaking until by dinning the same story into his ears, and by showing how advantageous for themselves and their native city it was, he prevailed upon Dasius to have the Carthaginian garrison &mdash;now it consisted of five hundred Numidians &mdash;and Salapia surrendered to Marcellus; and it was not without much bloodshed that it could be surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>they</reg> were far the bravest horsemen in the entire Carthaginian army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, although the attack was unexpected, and they had no use of their horses in the city, nevertheless catching up their arms in the midst of the uproar, they attempted a sally, and being unable to escape, they fell fighting to the last, and not more than fifty of them came alive into the hands of the enemy. <reg>the</reg> loss of this regiment of cavalry was considerably more serious for Hannibal than that of Salapia.<note>It had been his for six years.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>and</reg> at no later time was the Carthaginian superior in cavalry, in which had been easily his greatest strength.</p>

					<reg>about</reg> the same time, when in the citadel of Tarentum scarcity was barely endurable, the Roman garrison posted there and Marcus Livius, the commander of the garrison and citadel, had all their hopes in supplies sent from Sicily;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that these might safely pass along the coast of Italy, a fleet of about twenty ships lay at anchor at Regium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>commanding</reg> the fleet and in charge of supplies was Decimus Quinctius, a man of unknown family, but made famous as a soldier by many brave deeds. <reg>at</reg> first only five ships, of which the largest were two <pb id="p.147"/>triremes, had been assigned to him by Marcellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>later</reg>, as he repeatedly showed energy, three quinqueremes were added. <reg>finally</reg> by personally demanding from the allies and from Regium and Velia and

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>at</reg> that time the Roman, as it happened, was approaching under sail, not foreseeing an impending battle.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> sight, with the result that time enough was left to take down the rigging<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>the</reg> Tarentines, having regained their city from the Romans after almost a hundred years,<note>In reality only 62 years since its capture by the Romans, <date value="-272">272 B.C.</date></note> fought to free the citadel as well, in the hope that they would cut off the enemy's supplies also, if by a naval battle they should deprive them of their command of the sea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the Romans, in order to show by keeping their hold upon the citadel that Tarentum had been lost, not by force and courage, but by treachery and a surprise.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> oarsmen. <reg>so</reg> closely massed together were the ships that hardly a missile fell without effect between them into the sea. <reg>forming</reg> each a front, like a battle &mdash;line on land, they tried to push each other back, and the ships were a highway for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> combatants. <reg>conspicuous</reg>, however, among all the rest was the battle between the two ships which had encountered each other at the head of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> columns. <reg>on</reg> the Roman ship was Quinctius himself, on the Tarentine was Nico, surnamed Perco, who hated the Romans and was hated by them with a hatred that was not only national but also personal, because he was of the party which had betrayed Tarentum to Hannibal. <reg>as</reg> Quinctius was fighting and at the same time encouraging his men, Nico ran him through with a spear while off his
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> guard. <reg>when</reg> Quinctius with his weapons fell forward over the bow, the victorious Tarentine boldly crossed over on to the ship thrown into confusion by the loss of its
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> commander; and when he had driven the enemy back, and the bow was now in the hands of the Tarentines, while the Romans, massed together, were vainly defending the stern, suddenly another trireme of the enemy also appeared

					<reg>about</reg> the same time, when a large part of the year had already gone by, Laevinus, the consul, arrived in Sicily awaited by the old and the new allies. <reg>accordingly</reg> he thought it of the very first importance to settle affairs that were in disorder at Syracuse owing to the short time since the peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.153"/><reg>then</reg> he led his legions to Agrigentum, being the last<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> remnant of the war and held by a strong garrison of Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>and</reg> in fact fortune favoured the undertaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Hanno</name> was the general of the Carthaginians, but all their hope continued to rest upon Muttines and the Numidians. <reg>roaming</reg> all over Sicily, Muttines was carrying off booty from allies of the Romans, and he could neither be shut off from Agrigentum by force or by any ruse, nor be prevented from sallying out whenever he pleased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> distinction of the man, as already eclipsing the reputation even of the general, finally developed into hatred, so that not even successes any longer brought much joy to Hanno on account of the man who was responsible for them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>finally</reg> he gave Muttines' command of the cavalry to his own son, thinking that with the command he would take away his prestige also among the Numidians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>but</reg> it turned out quite differently. <reg>for</reg> by his own unpopularity he even increased the old &mdash;time partiality for Muttines. <reg>and</reg> the latter did not put up with a shameful wrong, but at once sent secret messengers to Laevinus in regard to the betrayal of Agrigentum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>these</reg> men having reassured the consul and arranged a plan of action, the Numidians seized the gate leading toward the sea,<note>Below the colossal unfinished Temple of Zeus, about two miles from the sea at the mouth of the Hypsas (no real harbour); Polybius IX. xxvii. 2.</note> driving away or slaying the guards; whereupon they admitted Romans sent for that very purpose into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>and</reg> when now they were marching in column into the centre of the city and to the market &mdash;place with a great uproar, Hanno, thinking it was nothing more than an outbreak and mutiny of the Numidians, as had happened before also, went forth to quell the uprising.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>but</reg> when he caught sight of a crowd in the distance larger than the number of the <pb id="p.155"/>Numidians, and the shouts of the Romans, by no<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> means unfamiliar, had reached his ears, he took to flight before coming within range of a missile.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>while</reg> the rest of the Carthaginians and Sicilians in a body, without even attempting to fight, were blindly fleeing, and ways of escape had been closed, they were slain near the gates.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>these</reg> men Laevinus did not think it quite safe to leave on the island, then for the first time attaining unity under the recent peace, as they furnished fuel for a revolution, and at the same time would prove useful to the men of Regium, who were looking for a band accustomed to brigandage, in order to devastate the Bruttian territory. <reg>and</reg> so far as concerned Sicily the war was finished that year.</p>

					<reg>in</reg> Spain at the beginning of spring Publius Scipio launched his ships, and after summoning the allied auxiliaries to Tarraco by an edict, he ordered the fleet and the transports to sail thence to the mouth of the river Ebro.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>having</reg> ordered the legions to leave their winter quarters and meet at the same point, he himself with five thousand allies set out from Tarraco to join the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>arrived</reg> there, and thinking he must address particularly the old soldiers, survivors of defeats so serious, he summoned the men to an assembly and spoke as follows:<note>Livy has expanded the speech found in his sources, such as that which Polybius puts in the mouth of Scipio (X. vi. 2 ff.)</note> "No new general in command before me has been able with reason and deservedly to thank his soldiers before he had made use of their services.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>consequently</reg> I am afraid that that design may seem to some of you too great and too bold to be in keeping either with the memory of disasters recently incurred or with my years. <reg>as</reg> for the reverses in Spain, there is no man from whose mind it is less possible for them to be effaced than from mine, for my father and uncle fell within the space of thirty days, that for our family one fatality might be piled upon another.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg>, although some tried to persuade him that, since the Carthaginian armies had withdrawn into three regions so widely scattered, he should attack the nearest of them, he thought there was danger that by doing so he might cause them all to concentrate and one army might not be a match for so many armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>consequently</reg> he decided meanwhile to lay siege to New Carthage, a city both itself rich in its own resources and filled with the enemy's warlike equipment of every kind. <reg>there</reg> were his arms, there his money, there hostages from all Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>furthermore</reg> the city was not only situated favourably for the passage to Africa, but also on a harbour ample enough for the greatest fleet, and perhaps the only port on the coast of Spain where it faces our sea. <reg>not</reg> a man except Gaius Laelius knew whither they were going.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>he</reg> was sent with the fleet round the headlands, under previous orders so to regulate the speed of his ships that Scipio might display his army on the landward side at the same time that the fleet was entering the harbour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>on</reg> the seventh day from the Ebro they reached (New) Carthage by sea and land at the same time.<note>Six days for the march is incredible, since the distance is 2600 stadia (325 miles) according to Polybius III. xxxix. 6, or 298 miles in the Antonine Itinerary.</note> <reg>camp</reg> was pitched opposite the city where it faces the north.<note>Rather the eastern side.</note> <reg>at</reg> the rear of the camp &mdash;for the front was protected by nature &mdash;an earthwork was thrown up.

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>with</reg> the mainland a ridge about two hundred and fifty paces wide connects the city. <reg>although</reg> fortification on this side would have involved so little labour, the Roman commander did not throw up an earthwork, whether as proudly

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<reg>having</reg> completed such other works of fortification as were necessary, he drew up the ships also in the harbour, as though to display a blockade from the sea as well. <reg>and</reg> making the round of the fleet he reminded the commanders of the vessels to keep a close watch at night, saying that a blockaded enemy at first makes every attempt wherever <pb id="p.169"/>possible.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>then</reg> opening the gate he sent out the men he had drawn up on a street leading towards the camp of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>the</reg> Romans, instructed by the general himself, drew back for a short time, that they might be nearer the reinforcements to be sent in the midst of the engagement. <reg>and</reg> at first the battle &mdash;lines stood fairly matched; then reinforcements sent again and again from the camp not only put the enemy to flight, but so pressed upon them in their disorder that, if Scipio had not sounded the recall, they would, it seemed, have mingled with the fugitives, and burst into the city.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>but</reg> the alarm in the battle was no greater than that throughout the city. <reg>many</reg> positions were deserted in panic and flight, and the walls were abandoned, when the men had leaped down, each taking the shortest way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>when</reg> this was noticed by Scipio, who had climbed the hill which they call Mercury's Hill,<note>On this hill, east of the isthmus, the Roman camp had been pitched.</note> <pb id="p.173"/>namely, that at many points the walls were stripped<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> of defenders, he gave orders to call all the men out of camp, to advance to the attack upon the city and to bring ladders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>he</reg> himself, while three strong young men held their shields in front of him &mdash;for a great number of missiles of every kind were flying from the walls &mdash;came
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> up to the city, gave encouragement and pertinent orders, and, what was of most importance in firing the soldiers' spirits, he was there as witness and spectator of every man's courage or cowardice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>and</reg> so men dashed on in the face of wounds and missiles, and neither walls nor armed men standing on them could restrain them from vying with each other in the attempt to climb.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>and</reg> at the same time from the ships an attack began upon that part of the city which is washed by the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>but</reg> from that side they were able to create an uproar rather than to launch an attack. <reg>in</reg> making fast, in hastily landing ladders and men, in their impatience to get ashore, each the shortest way, they hindered one another by their very haste and rivalry.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<reg>meanwhile</reg> the Carthaginian had now fully manned the walls with armed men, and he had a great number of missiles ready at hand out of his immense reserves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>but</reg> neither men nor missiles nor anything else defended the walls so much as the walls were their own defence. <reg>for</reg> few ladders could reach to their height, and the higher these were the weaker.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>and</reg> so since the highest man could not climb over, but nevertheless others kept coming up, the ladders were breaking by the mere weight. <reg>some</reg> men, although the ladders stood, owing to the dizziness produced by the height fell to the ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>and</reg> while everywhere men and ladders were dropping, <pb id="p.175"/>and the enemies' boldness and zest were increasing<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> just because of their success, the signal for the recall was given.<note>It was now late in the day; so Polybius X. xiii. 11.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> gave the besieged not only the hope of present respite from such conflict and effort, but also confidence for the future that the city could not be taken by ladders and encirclement; that siege &mdash;works were difficult and would also give time for their generals to bring aid.</p> 
				<p><reg>hardly</reg> had the first uproar been stilled when Scipio orders the ladders to be taken from men now weary and wounded, by others who were fresh and uninjured, and that an attack in greater force should be made upon the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>as</reg> for himself, having been informed by fishermen of Tarraco<note>In the previous winter; Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> viii. 7.</note> who had crossed the lagoon everywhere, now in light vessels, now, when
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> these would go aground, through shallow water, that an easy crossing on foot up to the wall was possible, Scipio, when word was brought to him that the tide was ebbing,<note>See above, p. 167, n. 5.</note> led five hundred armed men with him to the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>it</reg> was about the middle of the day,<note>For Polybius' conflicting statement cf. note 1.</note> and in addition to the draining away of the water of itself as the tide ebbed seaward, a fierce north wind also had sprung up and was carrying the receding lagoon in the same direction as the tide, and had so laid bare the shoals that in one place the water was up to the navel only, in another scarcely reached beyond the knees.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>what</reg> he had ascertained by painstaking and calculation, Scipio represented as a miracle and an act of the gods, who for the passage of the Romans were diverting the sea, he said, and draining lakes and opening up ways never before trodden by man's foot. <reg>and</reg> he bade them to follow Neptune as their guide on the march, and to make their way straight across the lagoon to the walls.</p> <pb id="p.177"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<reg>on</reg> the landward side it was a very serious<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> task for men approaching the walls; and they were hindered not only by the height of these, but also because the defenders had the attacking Romans doubly exposed to wounds on the right and on the left, so that as they approached their sides were in greater danger than the front of their bodies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>but</reg> on the other side of the city the five hundred found both an easy passage across the lagoon and then an easy climb to the top of the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>for</reg> it had not been built up to the full height, since they had sufficient confidence in the protection offered by the position itself and by the lagoon, and there was no post of armed men nor a guard to confront them, since all were intent upon bringing aid to any quarter from which danger was indicated.</p> 
				<p><reg>having</reg> entered the city without a struggle, they then proceeded with all possible speed to the gate round which the whole battle had been brought on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> that fighting so intent were not only the minds, but also
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the eyes and ears of all the fighters and spectators and of those who were encouraging the fighters, that no one was aware that the city had been captured in their rear until missiles fell upon their backs and they had the enemy on both front and rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>then</reg> as the defenders were panic &mdash;stricken, the walls were captured and men began to batter down the gate at the same time from within and from without. <reg>and</reg> presently, when the gates had been chopped to pieces and dragged off, so as not to block the passage, the armed men charged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>a</reg> great multitude climbed over the wall also, but they scattered in all directions to slay the townspeople. <reg>the</reg> regular formation which had entered the gate made its way with its <pb id="p.179"/>officers and its ranks through the centre of the city<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> even into the market &mdash;place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>from</reg> that point Scipio saw the enemy fleeing down two streets, one party towards the hill facing the east<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> south; cf. p. 167, n. 3.</note> and held by a garrison of five hundred soldiers, the rest into the citadel, into which Mago also with nearly all the armed men who had been beaten back from the walls had fled for refuge. <reg>accordingly</reg> he sent part of his forces to storm the hill, and himself led a part to the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>the</reg> hill was taken at the first assault, and Mago, who attempted to defend the citadel, seeing the whole city filled with the enemy and that there was no hope, surrendered himself and the citadel with its garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>until</reg> the surrender of the citadel there was slaughter everywhere throughout the city, and they did not spare any adult who met them. <reg>then</reg> the signal was given and an end was made of slaughter. <reg>the</reg> victors turned to the spoils, which were immense and of every kind.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<reg>of</reg> male free men about ten thousand were captured. <reg>from</reg> that number Scipio released those who were citizens of New Carthage and restored to them their city and also all the property which the war had spared to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>the</reg> artisans numbered about two thousand men. <reg>these</reg> he announced would be public slaves of the Roman people, with the not distant hope of freedom if they should actively exert themselves in providing the equipment for war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>the</reg> rest of the multitude, made up of young non &mdash;citizens and strong slaves, he turned over to the fleet to recruit the oarsmen; and he had enlarged the fleet by eight<note>Eighteen in Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> xvii. 13; cf. below, xlix. 6.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>apart</reg> <pb id="p.181"/>from this multitude were the Spanish hostages, who<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> were cared for just as if they were the children of allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>captured</reg> also was a vast amount of war material: a hundred and twenty catapults of the largest model, two hundred and eighty &mdash;one
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> of the smaller; twenty &mdash;three larger <hi rend="italics">ballistae,</hi> fifty &mdash;two smaller; larger and smaller scorpions and arms and missile weapons, a vast number; seventy &mdash;four military standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>of</reg> gold also and silver a large quantity was brought to the general. <reg>there</reg> were two hundred and seventy &mdash;six gold <hi rend="italics">paterae,</hi><note>Deep saucers used as drinking cups, but usually mentioned when a libation was poured.</note> nearly all of them weighing a pound; of silver, the unwrought and coined, there were eighteen thousand three hundred pounds, of silver vessels a large number.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>all</reg> of these, after weighing and counting, were delivered to Gaius Flaminius, the quaestor. <reg>of</reg> wheat there were four hundred thousand pecks; of barley two hundred and seventy thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>sixty</reg>-three merchantmen were attacked and captured in the harbour, some with their cargoes, grain, arms, also bronze and iron and linen and Spanish broom<note>Esparto, of which much was grown near New Carthage for use in making ropes, etc., cf. XXII. xx. 6.</note> and ship timber also for the building of a fleet, so that in the midst of these
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> great resources for the war that were captured (New) Carthage itself was the smallest part of it all.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<reg>on</reg> that day Scipio, after ordering Gaius Laelius with the marines to guard the city, himself led the legions back into camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>and</reg> as the soldiers were exhausted by all the warlike operations combined in a single day &mdash;since they had fought in line of battle, <pb id="p.183"/>and in taking the city had been involved in such<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> exertion and danger, and after the capture had contended, on unfavourable ground at that, with those who had sought refuge in the citadel &mdash;he ordered them to rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>on</reg> the following day he called together the soldiers and marines, and first praised and thanked the immortal gods, who had made him master in a single day, not only of the richest of all the cities in Spain, but had previously accumulated there all the resources of Africa and Spain, so that nothing was left to the enemy, while for himself and his men there was abundance of everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>he</reg> went on to praise warmly the courage of the soldiers because neither a sally of the enemy, nor the height of walls, nor the unsounded waters of the lagoon, nor the fortress on a lofty hill, nor the very strongly fortified citadel had deterred them from climbing over or bursting through every obstacle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, although he owed everything to everybody, the special distinction of a mural crown belonged to the man who had been the first to climb the wall; let him who thought himself deserving of that gift declare himself.<note>A rare example of an open competition for a military distinction to be awarded.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>two</reg> came forward as claimants, Quintus Trebellius, a centurion of the fourth legion, and Sextus Digitius, a marine. <reg>and</reg> these men themselves were not so much hotly competing with one another, as already fanning the partisanship of the men of their respective arms of the service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>the</reg> marines were supported by Gaius Laelius, admiral of the fleet, the legionaries by Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>when</reg> the strife was verging on mutiny, Scipio announced that he would name three arbiters to hear the claims, and after taking testimony, to decide which of the two had been the first to climb <pb id="p.185"/>over the wall into the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>then</reg> in addition to<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> Gaius Laelius and Marcus Sempronius, who represented this faction and that, he named Publius Cornelius Caudinus, a neutral, and ordered the three arbiters to sit down and hear the case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>this</reg> was argued with all the more heat because the persons withdrawn, men of such high character, were restraining party feelings rather than representing their factions. <reg>whereupon</reg> Gaius Laelius left the council, went up to Scipio on his tribune, and informed him that the matter was being debated without limit or self &mdash;restraint, and that the soldiers were on the point of laying hands on each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>but</reg> he said that, even if there should be no violence, they were nevertheless setting an abominable precedent in seeking by deception and perjury to win a reward for courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>on</reg> one side the legionaries were standing, he said, on the other the marines, ready to swear by all the gods rather what they wished to have true than what they knew to be true, and ready to involve not only themselves and their own persons in the perjury, but also the military standards and eagles and the sanctity of the oath of allegiance; that he was making this report to him on the advice of Publius Cornelius and Marcus Sempronius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Scipio</name> warmly praised Laelius, summoned the soldiers to an assembly and declared that he was reliably informed that Quintus Trebellius and Sextus Digitius had climbed to the top of the wall at the same moment, and that for their courage he bestowed mural crowns upon them both.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>then</reg> he rewarded the rest, each according to his desert and his courage. <reg>above</reg> all the others he placed Gaius Laelius, admiral of the fleet, on a level with himself in every kind <pb id="p.187"/>of commendation, and also presented him with a<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> golden wreath and thirty oxen.</p>

					<reg>then</reg> he ordered the hostages of the states of Spain to be summoned. <reg>how</reg> great was their number I dislike to state, since in one source I find that they were about three hundred,<note>Over 300, says Polybius X. xviii. 3.</note> in another three thousand seven hundred and twenty &mdash;four.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg> is no less disagreement on other matters also between the authorities. <reg>one</reg> writes that the Carthaginian garrison consisted of ten thousand men, another of seven thousand, another of not more than two thousand.<note>In Polybius 1000 only for the regular garrison, but an emergency force of 2000 was recruited; xii. 2 f.</note> <reg>as</reg> for the captives, in one writer<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> <name>Polybius</name> xvii. 6.</note> <reg>i</reg> find ten thousand persons, in another above twenty &mdash;five thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>i</reg> should set down about sixty larger and smaller scorpions as captured, if I were to follow a Greek authority, Silenus,<note>Who was with Hannibal and wrote in Greek on his war with Rome; Nepos <hi rend="italics"><reg>hann</reg>.</hi> xiii. 3. Coelius used him (Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> I. 49). Known to Polybius, but not mentioned by him; only here in Livy. <reg>for</reg> Valerius cf. note on vi. 8.</note> if Valerius Antias, then six thousand of the larger scorpions, thirteen thousand of the smaller; so lacking is any limit to his mendacity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>even</reg> as to the generals there is no agreement. <reg>most</reg> say that Laelius commanded the fleet, there are some who say it was Marcus Iunius Silanus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>Valerius</name> Antias relates that Arines was in command of the Carthaginian garrison and surrendered to the Romans, other writers that it was Mago.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>there</reg> is no agreement as to the number of ships captured, none as to the weight of gold and silver and of money brought in. <reg>if</reg> one must agree <pb id="p.189"/>with some authorities, moderate figures are the most<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> probable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>to</reg> resume, calling the hostages, Scipio first bade them all to be of good cheer;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for they had come into the power of the Roman people, which prefers to bind men by favour rather than by fear, and to keep foreign nations linked by loyalty and alliance, rather than reduced to a harsh slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>then</reg> on learning the names of the states, he made a list of the captives, showing how many belonged to each people, and sent messengers to their homes, bidding that each man come to recover his own children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>if</reg> ambassadors of any states happened to be there, he restored their hostages to them directly.<note>In Polybius he takes the hostages with him on his way to Tarraco; <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> xx. 8.</note> <reg>the</reg> task of kindly protecting the rest he assigned to Gaius Flaminius, the quaestor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><reg>meanwhile</reg> out of the midst of the crowd of hostages came an elderly woman, the wife of Mandonius, who was the brother of Indibilis, prince of the Ilergetes, and weeping she fell at the feet of the general and began to implore him to charge the guards more strictly with the care and comfort of the women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>when</reg> Scipio said that they would surely lack nothing, the woman then replied: <quote><reg>we</reg> do not greatly care,</quote> she said, <quote>for such things; for in our condition what is not sufficient? <reg>it</reg> is another concern which impels me as I look at these maidens; for as for myself, I am beyond the danger of violence done to woman.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>and</reg> in the bloom of youth and beauty the daughters of Indibilis were standing about her, and others of no less rank, all of whom paid her the honour due a parent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>then</reg> Scipio said: <quote><reg>thanks</reg> to my own training and that of the Roman <pb id="p.191"/>people I would see to it that nothing which is<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> anywhere sacred should suffer violence among us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>but</reg> as it is, I am moved to an even stricter care in that respect by the courage and dignity of you women also, who even in misfortune have not forgotten what is seemly for a matron.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>he</reg> then handed them over to a man of proved uprightness, and ordered him to protect them with no less respect and modesty than the wives and mothers of guest &mdash;friends.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<reg>then</reg> there was brought to him as a captive by the soldiers a grown maiden of a beauty so extraordinary that, wherever she went, she drew the eyes of everyone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>Scipio</name>, upon enquiring about her native city and her parents, learned among other things that she had been betrothed to a leading man of the Celtiberians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>the</reg> young man's name was Allucius. <reg>accordingly</reg> he at once summoned parents and fiance from home, and as soon as he had arrived, Scipio, having heard meantime that he was desperately in love with his betrothed, addressed him in more studied language than he had used towards the parents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote><reg>as</reg> a young man,</quote> he said, <quote><reg>i</reg> speak to you as a young man &mdash; lessen embarrassment between us in this conversation. <reg>it</reg> was to me that your betrothed was brought as a captive by our soldiers, and I learned of your love for her &mdash;d her beauty made that easy to believe.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>therefore</reg>, since in my own case, if it were only permitted me to enjoy the pleasures of youth, especially in a proper and legitimate love, and had not the state preoccupied my attention, I should wish to be pardoned for an ardent love of a bride, I favour what is in my power &mdash;<hi rend="italics">your</hi> love.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>your</reg> betrothed has been <pb id="p.193"/>in my camp with the same regard for modesty as<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> in the house of your parents &mdash;in &mdash;law, her own parents.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>she</reg> has been kept for you, so that she could be given you as a gift, unharmed and worthy of you and of me. <reg>this</reg> is the only price that I stipulate in return for that gift: be a friend to the Roman people, and if you believe me to be a good man, such as these tribes formerly came to know in my father and uncle, be assured that in the
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Roman state there are many like us, and that no people in the world can be named to &mdash;day which you would be less desirous of having as an enemy to you and yours, or more desirous of having as a friend.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>the</reg> young man, overcome by embarrassment and at the same time by joy, holding Scipio's right hand, called upon all the gods to compensate him on his own behalf, since he was far from having sufficient means to do so in accordance with his own feeling and with what the general had done for him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>whereupon</reg> the parents and blood &mdash;relations of the maiden were summoned. <reg>they</reg> began to entreat Scipio, because the maiden, for whose ransom they had brought,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> as they said, a considerable weight of gold, was being restored to them without price, to accept that gift from them, assuring him that they would feel no less gratitude for his acceptance than for the restoration of the maiden unharmed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>Scipio</name>, since they so earnestly besought, promised that he would accept it, ordered the gift to be laid before his feet, and calling Allucius to him, said: <quote><reg>in</reg> addition to the dowry which you are about to receive from your father &mdash;in &mdash;law, this will be added by me as a nuptial gift to you.</quote> <reg>and</reg> he ordered him to take up the gold and keep it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>delighting</reg> in this gift and courteous treatment he was <pb id="p.195"/>sent away to his home, and he filled his countrymen<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> with the well &mdash;earned praises of Scipio, saying that there had come a most godlike youth, conquering everything by arms and especially by generosity and favours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>and</reg> so, after conducting a levy among his clients, he returned within a few days to Scipio with fourteen hundred picked horsemen.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<name>Scipio</name> kept Laelius by him until with his advice he should dispose of captives and hostages and the booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>then</reg> when everything had been properly arranged, he furnished him with a quinquereme,<note>Polybius also mentions the quinquereme only (xix. 8). But a small convoy is to be presumed; cf. XXVII. vii. 4.</note> put on shipboard the captives with Mago and about fifteen senators who had been captured with him, and sent Laelius to Rome to report the victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>he</reg> himself spent the few days during which he had decided to remain at (New) Carthage in drilling his naval and land forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> the first day the legions would run under arms for four miles; on the second they were ordered to take care of their arms and clean them in front of their tents; on the third day with wooden foils they encountered each other after the manner of a regular battle and hurled missile weapons provided with a button at the end; on the fourth day they were given a rest; on the fifth they again ran quickly under arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> disposition of work and rest they maintained so long as they remained at (New) Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>the</reg> oarsmen and marines, when the sea was calm, would sail out into open water and test the mobility of their ships in sham naval battles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>such</reg> training outside the city by land and sea steeled both bodies and minds for war. <reg>the</reg> city itself rang with preparations for war, since artisans <pb id="p.197"/>of all kinds were shut up in public workshops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>the</reg><note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> general inspected everything with the same care; now he was on the fleet and the docks, now he was with the legions as they ran; now he was giving his time to viewing the work that was done from day to day in shops and arsenal and on the docks, with the utmost rivalry, by the great multitude of artisans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>having</reg> made such a beginning, and having repaired battered parts of the wall, and leaving forces posted to defend the city, he set out for Tarraco, being approached by many embassies in the course of his march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>some</reg> of these he answered and dismissed without stopping, some he postponed till he reached Tarraco, at which he had announced an assembly for all the allies new and old.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>and</reg> nearly all the peoples dwelling on this side of the Ebro came together, and many also from the farther province.</p> 
				<p><reg>the</reg> Carthaginian commanders at first purposely suppressed the news of the capture of (New) Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>then</reg>, when the matter was too well known to be concealed or masked, their language would minimize it, saying that by a sudden arrival and almost by stealth on a single day a single city of Spain had been seized; and carried away by success on so small a scale, an arrogant youth in an excess of joy had given it the appearance of a great victory;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> but when he heard that three generals, three victorious armies of the enemy were approaching, there would at once come to him the memory of the losses in his family.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>such</reg> were their remarks in public, but in themselves they were by no means unaware what a mass of resources for every purpose had gone with the loss of (New) Carthage.</p>

				<p>Hannibal pitched his camp on the bank of the Anio at
					the third milestone from the city of Rome. In person
					with two thousand horsemen he rode up even to the Porta
					Capena,<note>An error for Collina; cf. x. 3.</note> to examine the lie of the city. And when for three days the entire army on each side had gone out into
					battle-line, a storm broke off the combat; for when they
					had returned to camp, at once there was a clear sky.
					Capua was taken by Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius,
					the consuls. The leading men of the Capuans took their
					own lives by poison. When the senators of Capua had
					been bound to stakes, to be beheaded, Quintus Fulvius,
					the consul, on receiving a letter from the senate in which
					he was bidden to spare them, put the letter in his bosom
					before reading it and ordered that the law be complied
					with, and carried out the penalty. When at the comitia
					in the presence of the people the question was raised, to
					whom should the command of the Spanish provinces be
					entrusted, and no one was willing to undertake it,
					Publius Scipio, son of that Publius who had fallen in
					Spain, declared that he would go; and having been sent
					by vote of the people and by general agreement, he
					stormed New Carthage, being twenty-four years old and

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SUCH was the state of affairs in Spain. In<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> Italy the consul Marcellus, having regained possession of Salapia by betrayal, took Marmoreae and Meles<note>Two unknown towns where Hannibal had important supply bases. For Salapia, in Apulia, northwest of Cannae, cf. XXVI. xxxviii. 6 ff. and note. Its garrison consisted of 500 Numidians; <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> &sect; 11.</note> from the Samnites by force. About three thousand of Hannibal's soldiers, who had been left as a garrison, were overpowered there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The booty &mdash;and there was much of it &mdash;was turned over to the soldiers. In addition two hundred and forty thousand pecks of wheat and a hundred and ten thousand pecks of barley were found.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the rejoicing in consequence by no means balanced the great loss suffered within a few days not far from the city of Herdonea.<note>In Apulia, 30 miles west of Cannae; XXV. xxi. 1; xxii. 14.</note> There Gnaeus Fulvius, the proconsul, was encamped, in the hope of regaining Herdonea, which had deserted the Romans after the disaster at Cannae;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but his camp was pitched in a position neither quite safe nor strongly held.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Carelessness, ingrained in the character of the general, was increased by that hope, inasmuch as he had learned that their loyalty was weakening and turning against the Carthaginian, ever since they had heard that, after the loss of Salapia, Hannibal had withdrawn from that region into the land of the Bruttii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The report of all this to Hannibal from Herdonea by secret messengers made him concerned to retain an allied city and at the same time gave him the hope of attacking the enemy unawares. With an army unencumbered <pb id="p.205"/>by baggage he hastened by forced marches to<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> Herdonea, so that he almost outstripped reports of his coming; and to strike more alarm into the enemy, he approached the city in battle-array.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Roman, who was his equal in boldness but not in strategy and in forces, hastily led out his troops and engaged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fifth legion and the left <hi rend="italics">ala</hi><note>For this formation (legion and auxiliaries in the same line) see Vol. VI. p. 422, note; cf. ii. 6; xii. 14; xiv. 3; xlii. 2.</note> went into battle with spirit. But Hannibal gave the order to his cavalry, that when the infantry lines should have concentrated the eyes and attention of the enemy upon the immediate conflict, they should turn the flanks and attack, some of them the enemy's camp, some the rear of the wavering troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And he himself, scornfully alluding to the similarity in the name of Gnaeus Fulvius, since he had defeated a praetor Gnaeus Fulvius two years before in the same region, asserted that the outcome of the battle would be similar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor was that hope groundless. For when many of the Romans had fallen in the close contact of the lines during
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the infantry battle, while the ranks and standards nevertheless held their ground, the wild charge of the cavalry was heard in the rear, and at the same time the shouts of the enemy from the camp. This routed first the sixth legion, which was posted in the second line and was the first to be thrown into disorder by the Numidians; and then it routed the fifth legion and the men who were with the front-line standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some scattered in flight, some were slain in the centre of the battle, where Gnaeus Fulvius also fell together with eleven tribunes of the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> How many thousand Romans and allies were slain in that battle who could state with certainty, inasmuch as in one source I find thirteen thousand, in another not more <pb id="p.207"/>than seven?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The camp and booty fell to the victor.<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> As for Herdonea, in view of his information that it would have revolted to the Romans and would not remain loyal to him if he should withdraw, he removed the whole population to Metapontum and Thurii and set fire to the city. He put to death the leading men who, he was informed, had had secret conversations with Fulvius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Romans who had made their escape from so disastrous a battle, by different roads and half-armed sought refuge with the consul Marcellus in Samnium.<note>There is reason to believe that Livy's authorities had duplicated the defeat of a Fulvius (with identity of place and suspiciously similar circumstances), and that this is the real event, while that in XXV. xxi. is the doublet, due to confusion between Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus, consul in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>, and Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, praetor in <date value="-212">212 B.C.</date> But the praetor must have suffered a shameful defeat somewhere; for the detailed account of his trial in XXVI. ii. 7 ff. and iii. for cowardice and neglect of duty could hardly be invented. Cf. De Sanctis, <hi rend="italics">Storia dei Romani</hi> III. 2. 300, 459 f.; <hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi> VIII. 81; Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">Staatsrecht</hi> II3. 320 f.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, who was not particularly alarmed by so serious a defeat, wrote a letter to the senate at Rome in regard to the loss of general and army at Herdonea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He said that nevertheless, being the same man who, after the battle of Cannae, had frustrated Hannibal, elated by that victory, he was marching against him to cut short his joy and exultation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Rome, to be sure, there was not only great sorrow owing to what had happened, but also great fear for the future.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul, however, crossing over from Samnium into Lucania, pitched camp near Numistro,<note>In the extreme north of Lucania, southwest of Venusia, at a distance of <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 25 miles.</note> on level ground in sight of Hannibal, while the Carthaginian held a hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He added the further appearance of confidence in being the first to lead out into battle-line. And Hannibal did not refuse, when he saw the standards borne out of the gates. Nevertheless they drew up their lines so that the Carthaginian made his right wing reach up the hill, while the Romans rested their left wing on the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.209"/>On the Roman side the first legion and right <hi rend="italics">ala,</hi> on<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> Hannibal's side the Spanish soldiers and Balearic slingers were engaged; and the elephants also were driven into battle after the conflict had begun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For a long time the battle hung in the balance, not inclining in either direction. After they had prolonged the battle from the third hour to nightfall and the front lines were exhausted by fighting, the third legion relieved the first, the left <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> relieved the right, and among the enemy fresh troops took over the battle from the weary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A new battle and fierce suddenly flamed out of a conflict now grown spiritless, for the combatants were now fresh in spirit and in body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But night parted them with victory undecided. On the next day the Romans stood in line from sunrise until late in the day. When none of the enemy came out against them, they gathered spoils at their leisure, carried corpses of their men into one place and burned them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the following night Hannibal broke camp silently and marched away into Apulia. Marcellus, when day disclosed the flight of the enemy, left the wounded at Numistro with a small garrison, placed Lucius Furius Purpurio, a tribune of the soldiers, in command of them, and made haste to follow on Hannibal's heels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Near Venusia<note>In Apulia, near the borders of Samnium, to which it is sometimes assigned; cf. XXII. xlix. 14; liv. 1 ff.</note> he overtook him. There for a number of days, while charges were made by outposts, there were mixed cavalry and infantry engagements, rather skirmishes than important battles, and nearly all of them favourable to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thence the armies were led through Apulia without any notable conflict, since Hannibal <pb id="p.211"/>would set his standards in motion by night, seeking<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> positions for ambuscades, while Marcellus did not follow except in broad daylight and after reconnoitring.</p>

His duties were later taken over by the censors, who normally had that task; cf. xi. 8.</note> &mdash; and he leased them all in return for grain &mdash;a fresh crime fomented in secret was brought to light by informers, that he might not lack occasion for harsh treatment of the Capuans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The soldiers had been removed from dwellings, in order that houses in the city might be leased together with the land, and because Flaccus at the same time feared that the great charms of the city might weaken his army also, as they had Hannibal's. Accordingly he had compelled them to build their own shelters soldier-fashion at the gates and along the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Furthermore most of these were made of wickerwork and planks, others of reeds interwoven, all of them thatched with straw, as though these materials were deliberately intended to feed the flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A hundred and seventy Capuans,<note>Evidently the rigorous measures against the Capuans (XXVI. xxxiv. 7) had not yet been carried out, for the Blossii were still in possession of their slaves; &sect; 5.</note> under the lead of the brothers Blossii, had conspired to set fire to all of these huts at the same hour of the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Information in regard to this was given by slaves of the Blossii, and the gates were suddenly closed by order of the proconsul. The soldiers having rushed to arms at a given signal, all who were involved in the crime were arrested, and after a rigorous inquiry were condemned and put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The informers received <pb id="p.213"/>their freedom and ten thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Acerrans were permitted to restore what had been burned; the Nucerians, having so elected, were conducted to Atella, while the Atellans were ordered to migrate to Calatia.<note>Atella and Calatia, nearest towns (south and southeast) to Capua, had revolted from the Romans after Cannae; XXII. lxi. 11.

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Ogulnius and Publius Aquilius set out for Etruria as commissioners to buy up grain to be shipped to Tarentum. And a thousand soldiers, equally divided between Romans and allies from the army at the city, were sent with the grain to the same place on garrison duty.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Already the summer was at an end and the time for the consular election at hand. But a letter from Marcellus, stating that it was against the public interest for him to move a step away from Hannibal, since he was himself pressing him hard
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> as he retired and refused an engagement, had inspired concern, for fear they must call the consul away from the war at the moment when he was actively
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> engaged, or else should be without consuls for the next year. It seemed best instead to recall the consul Valerius from Sicily, even though he was outside of Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To Valerius under orders from the senate Lucius <pb id="p.215"/>Manlius, the city praetor, sent a letter, together with<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> the letter of Marcus Marcellus, the consul, that from these letters Valerius might learn what reason the senators had for recalling him rather than his colleague from his province.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>About the same time legates from King Syphax came to Rome, reporting what successes he had had in battle with the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They stated that the king was not more hostile to any people than to the Carthaginian, nor more friendly to any than to the Roman people; that previously he had sent legates to Spain to Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius,<note>Cf. XXIV. xlviii. 9.</note> the Roman generals; that now he was minded to seek Roman friendship, as it were at the very source.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate not only replied graciously to the legates, but also sent its legates, Lucius Genucius, Publius Poetelius, Publius Popillius, to the king with gifts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They took with them as gifts a purple toga and tunic, an ivory chair,<note>Like the <hi rend="italics">sella curulis,</hi> with tusks for legs.

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For these also they took with them bordered togas and golden <hi rend="italics">paterae,</hi> each of them three pounds in weight, to be presented to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Also to Alexandria as ambassadors to the monarchs, Ptolemy and Cleopatra,<note>Arsino&euml; was her real name, daughter of Ptolemy III, sister and wife of Ptolemy IV.</note> were sent Marcus Atilius and Manius Acilius, to call to mind and revive friendship with them. As gifts they carried for the king a purple toga and tunic, with an ivory chair, for the queen an embroidered palla and a purple cloak.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>During the summer in which these events occurred <pb id="p.217"/>many portents were reported from neighbouring<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> cities and from the country: that at Tusculum a lamb was born with an udder full of milk, and that the ridge of Jupiter's temple was struck by lightning and stripped of almost all its roofing;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that at Anagnia about the same time ground struck by lightning outside the gate burned for a day and a night without any fuel; and that at the crossroads<note>At the junction of the Via Latina and the Via Labicana, 40 miles from Rome by the latter.</note> near Anagnia, in the grove of Diana, birds deserted their nests in the trees;

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcus Valerius, the consul, on being summoned by the letter, assigned his province and army to Lucius Cincius,<note>The annalist Cincius Alimentus; XXVI. xxiii. 1; repeatedly mentioned in XXVII.</note> a praetor, and sent Marcus Valerius Messalla, admiral of the fleet, with a part of his ships to Africa, to plunder and at the same time to find out what the Carthaginian state was doing and preparing to do.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul himself set out for Rome with ten ships, and on his safe arrival he at once held a session of the senate, in which he set forth his own achievements:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that for almost sixty years war had been carried on in Sicily by land and sea, often with great losses, but now he had completed <pb id="p.219"/>the conquest of that province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He said that there<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> was not a Carthaginian in Sicily; that not a Sicilian was absent;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that those who had been absent, banished by their fears, had all been brought back to their cities, to their lands, and were ploughing and sowing;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that a deserted land was again under cultivation, productive at last for the farmers themselves, and for the Roman people in peace and in war a most dependable source of the grain supply.<note>As in XXVI. xl. 16.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then Muttines and any others who had done services to the Roman people were brought into the senate, and honours were bestowed upon them all, in fulfilment of the consul's promise.<note>Muttines' service was the betrayal of Agrigentum; XXVI. xl. 7 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Muttines was even made a Roman citizen, when in accordance with a decree of the senate a bill had been proposed to the plebs by its tribunes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>While these events were occurring at Rome, Marcus Valerius, having approached the coast of Africa with fifty ships before daybreak, made an unexpected landing on the territory of Utica. And this he ravaged far and wide, captured many persons together with other booty of every description, returned to his ships and crossed over to Sicily, sailing back to Lilybaeum on the 13th day after he had left that port.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Upon inquiry made from the captives the following facts were ascertained and written down fully and in order for the consul Laevinus, that he might know what the condition of affairs in Africa was:
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that five thousand Numidians were at Carthage under Masinissa,<note>Cf. XXIV. xlix. 1 ff.; XXV. xxxiv. 1 ff.</note> son of Gala <pb id="p.221"/>and a most impetuous young man; and that other<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> soldiers were being hired everywhere in Africa, to be sent over to Hasdrubal in Spain, so that he should cross over into Italy with the largest possible army as soon as he could and join Hannibal;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that upon this the Carthaginians believed that victory depended;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> furthermore that a very large fleet was being made ready, for the purpose of recovering Sicily; and he believed that fleet would soon make the passage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> These statements as read by the consul so swayed the senators that they decided that he must not wait for the elections, but that after appointing a dictator to conduct the elections, the consul must at once return to his province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Debate continued on one point &mdash;namely, the consul kept promising to appoint in Sicily Marcus Valerius Messalla, then in command of the fleet, as dictator, while the fathers maintained that a dictator could not be appointed outside of Roman territory, and that this was confined to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> When Marcus Lucretius, tribune of the plebs, sought to know its pleasure<note>For a tribune presiding in the senate cf. XXII. lxi. 7.</note> in the matter, the senate decreed that, before leaving the city, the consul should ask the people<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata.</hi></note> whom they preferred to have named dictator, and should name as dictator the man ordered by the people; that if the consul should refuse, the praetor should ask the people; in case of his refusal also, the tribunes should bring the matter before the commons.<note>Probably meaning the <hi rend="italics">comitia tributa</hi> here, as directly contrasted with the <hi rend="italics">centuriata.</hi> Livy uses the term <hi rend="italics">plebis concilium</hi> in &sect; 18 just below, but in such technicalities he is very often vague, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> in XXV. iii. 13-iv. 9. In <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date>, after Trasumennus, the <hi rend="italics">populous</hi> had made Fabius Maximus dictator; XXII. viii. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> When the consul refused to submit to the people a question that belonged to his own authority, and forbade the praetor to do so, the tribunes asked the commons <pb id="p.223"/>and the commons ordained that Quintus Fulvius,<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> who was then at Capua, should be named dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But on the day on which that plebeian assembly was to be held the consul left for Sicily secretly by night. And the fathers, being deserted, voted to send a letter to Marcus Claudius, that he should come to the aid of the state abandoned by his colleague, and should name as dictator whomsoever the people might command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Thus Quintus Fulvius was named dictator by Marcus Claudius,<note>Marcellus, still in Apulia, did not come to Rome; ii. 12; iv. 1.</note> the consul, and in accordance with the same decree of the commons Publius Licinius Crassus, pontifex maximus, was named master of the horse by Quintus Fulvius as dictator.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On coming to Rome the dictator sent Gaius Sempronius Blaesus, his lieutenant, whom he had had at Capua, into Etruria as his province, to be with
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the army, taking the place of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> praetor Gaius Calpurnius, whom he had summoned by letter to take command of Capua and his own army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for himself, he proclaimed the elections for the earliest possible date.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But owing to the conflict which arose between the tribunes and the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> dictator the election could not be completed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Galeria century of the younger men, which obtained by lot the right to vote first,<note>For the <hi rend="italics">sors praerogativae</hi> and <hi rend="italics">centuria praerogativa</hi> cf. XXIV. vii. 12; ix. 3; XXVI. xxii. 13.</note> had voted for Quintus Fulvius and Quintus Fabius as consuls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and the centuries called in the legal order would have inclined in the same direction, if the tribunes of the plebs, Gaius and Lucius Arrenius, had not intervened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They repeated that to prolong a magistracy was not consistent with the common
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> interest, and also that it was a much more dangerous precedent for the man who was
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> conducting the election to be himself elected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <pb id="p.225"/>Accordingly, they said, if the dictator admitted his own<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> name, they would veto the election;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> if other men than himself were considered, they would not delay the election.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The dictator defended the procedure in the election by the authority of the senate, by the decree of the commons, by precedents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For, he said, in the consulship of Gnaeus Servilius, when Gaius Flaminius, the other
					<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> consul, had fallen at Trasumennus, by authority of the fathers it was proposed to the commons, and the commons had ordained that, so long as the
					<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> war remained in Italy, the people should have the right to re-elect as consuls the men they pleased and as often as they
					<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> pleased from the number of those who had been consuls.<note>This
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> important act was overlooked by Livy in Book XXII. A plebiscite of <date value="-330">330 B.C.</date>, requiring an interval of ten years, was repeatedly disregarded in this period. Cf. 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xlii; X. xiii. 8.</note> He added that he had precedents for so doing: an old instance, that of Lucius Postumius Megellus, who as <hi rend="italics">interrex</hi> had been elected consul<note>For the third time, <date value="-291">291 B.C.</date></note> with Gaius Iunius Bubulcus at an election which he had himself conducted; and a recent case, that of Quintus Fabius,<note><date value="-215">215 B.C.</date>; XXIV. ix. 3 and 9 ff.</note> who surely would never have permitted his consulship to be prolonged unless it were done for the public welfare.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After a contest long continued by such speeches, final agreement between the dictator and the tribunes was reached: that they would stand by whatever the senate should decide. To the fathers it seemed a time for the state to have its affairs in the hands of generals mature and experienced and skilled in war; and so they said they did not favour any delaying of the election.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since the tribunes gave way, the election was held. Quintus Fabius Maximus was declared consul for the fifth time, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth. Then as praetors the following were elected: Lucius Veturius Philo, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Gaius Hostilius <pb id="p.227"/>Tubulus, Gaius Aurunculeius. The magistrates<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> having been elected for the year, Quintus Fulvius abdicated his dictatorship.</p> 
				<p>At the end of this summer a Carthaginian fleet of forty ships under command of the prefect Hamilcar crossed over to Sardinia and first laid waste the region of Olbia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then after Publius Manlius Volso, the praetor, showed himself there with an army, the fleet coasted around from Olbia to the other side of the island, ravaged the territory of Carales<note>Cagliari, at the south end of the island, originally settled by Phoenicians, as had been Olbia on the northeast coast. Sardinia and Corsica had been taken by the Romans shortly after the First Punic War; XXI. i. 5; <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> 20.</note> and returned with booty of every kind to Africa.</p> 
				<p>Of the Roman priests a number died that year and successors were appointed. Gaius Servilius was made pontifex in place of Titus Otacilius Crassus; Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Tiberius, was made augur in place of Titus Otacilius Crassus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In like manner Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Tiberius, was appointed decemvir for the performance of rites in place of Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Gaius. Marcus Marcius, <hi rend="italics">rex sacrorum,</hi> and Marcus Aemilius Papus, the chief <hi rend="italics">curio,</hi><note>Each of the 30 <hi rend="italics">curiae</hi> was headed by a <hi rend="italics">curio,</hi> and at the head of the <hi rend="italics">curiones</hi> was the <hi rend="italics">maximus curio,</hi> whose duties were religious; cf. viii. 1-3; III. vii. 6.</note> died; and no priests were appointed that year in their places.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And this year had as censors Lucius Veturius Philo and Publius Licinius Crassus, pontifex maximus. Crassus Licinius had been neither consul nor praetor before he became censor; he made but one step from aedileship to censorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But these censors neither revised the senate list nor did any public business. The death of Veturius dissolved their censorship,<note>The only office that was terminated by the death of a colleague. Cf. XXIV. xliii. 4.</note> consequently Licinius abdicated <pb id="p.229"/>his office. The curule aediles, Lucius Veturius<note>He was consul in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>; XXVIII. x. 8.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> and Publius Licinius Varus, renewed the Roman Games for one day. The plebeian aediles, Quintus Catius and Lucius Porcius Licinus, out of money paid in fines set up bronze statues at the Temple of Ceres,<note>This was the temple of the Roman plebeians and headquarters of the plebeian aediles, who conducted these <hi rend="italics">ludi plebeii</hi> in November. It was founded <date value="-493">493 B.C.</date></note> and they celebrated the games with splendid appointments, considering the resources of the time.</p> 
				<p>VII. At the end of this year<note>This late season may be drawn from a different authority, since the capture of New Carthage has been described as taking place in the spring, and 40 days would have been sufficient for the entire voyage. But see De Sanctis <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> pp. 468 f.; cf. XXVI. li. 2.</note> Gaius Laelius, Scipio's lieutenant, came to Rome on the thirty-fourth day after leaving
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Tarraco. And on entering the city with a train of captives<note>About 15 senators of New Carthage, according to XXVI. <hi rend="italics">l.c.,</hi> in addition to Mago, the commandant; cf. Polybius X. xviii. 1; xix. 8.</note> he occasioned a great concourse of people. Introduced into the senate the next day, he set forth the capture of (New) Carthage, chief city of Spain, in a single day, and the recovery of a number of cities that had revolted, and the admission of new cities into alliance. From the captives they ascertained facts which in general agreed with statements previously made in the letter of Marcus Valerius
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Messalla.<note>Cf. v. 8 and 10-13.</note> What especially stirred the fathers was Hasdrubal's proposed crossing into Italy, which was with difficulty withstanding Hannibal and his arms. On being brought before an assembly also, Laelius discoursed on the same subject. The senate decreed a thanksgiving for <pb id="p.231"/>one day on account of Publius Scipio's
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> successes. It<note type="margin">B.C. 210</note> ordered Gaius Laelius to return as soon as possible to Spain on the ships<note>A single quinquereme was mentioned XXVI. li. 2 (see note there). Smaller vessels, not deserving of mention in comparison with the quinquereme, probably escorted her.</note> with which he had come. &mdash;The storming of (New) Carthage I have set in this year on the authority of many writers, though not unaware that there are some who have related its capture in the following year.<note>The chronology now accepted is based on Polybius, from whose Book X. it is shown that New Carthage was taken in <date value="-209">209 B.C.</date> Cf. XXVI. xviii. 2, note; De Sanctis <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> By Livy's reckoning <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date> is the year in which Scipio did nothing, since the historian has anticipated the battle of Baecula also by one year.</note> I have done so because it has seemed to me less probable that Scipio spent a whole year in Spain doing
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> nothing.</p> 
				<p>Quintus Fabius Maximus being now consul for the<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> fifth and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth time, on the Ides of March, the day of their entry upon office, Italy was assigned to the two as their province; their military authority, however, was geographically divided. Fabius was to command around Tarentum, Fulvius in Lucania and the land of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Bruttii. For Marcus Claudius his command was prolonged for one year. The praetors received their assignments by lot, Gaius Hostilius Tubulus the city praetorship, Lucius Veturius Philo the jurisdiction over foreigners, together with Gaul;<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> his duties as a judge are to be taken over by the praetor urbanus, in order to leave the praetor peregrinus free to take the field as a commander; cf. xxii. 3; xxxvi. 11; XXV. iii. 2 and note.</note> Titus Quinctius Crispinus received Capua, Gaius Aurunculeius
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Sardinia. The armies were distributed among the assignments as follows: to Fulvius the two legions which Marcus Valerius Laevinus had in Sicily, to Quintus Fabius those which Gaius Calpurnius had commanded in Etruria; the army at the city was to take the place of that in Etruria; Gaius Calpurnius was to be in command of that province and its army; <pb id="p.233"/>Titus Quinctius was to be in charge of Capua and the<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> army which Quintus Fulvius had held. Gaius Hostilius<note>An error for Lucius Veturius Philo, who was assigned to Cisalpine Gaul, while Hostilius as city-praetor must remain at Rome.</note> was to take over from Gaius Laetorius, the propraetor, his province and the army which was then at
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Ariminum. To Marcus Marcellus were assigned the legions with which he had carried on operations as consul. To Marcus Valerius and Lucius Cincius &mdash;for their command in Sicily was also prolonged &mdash;was assigned the army from Cannae, and they were ordered to recruit it from the soldiers who survived from the legions of Gnaeus
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Fulvius.<note>Cf. i. 7-12.</note> These were sought out and sent by the consuls into Sicily. And there was added the same humiliation in the service as that under which the men from Cannae were serving, and those from the army of the praetor Gnaeus Fulvius,<note>For the defeat of this Fulvius (doubted by recent historians) cf. note on i. 15.</note> who had been sent thither by the senate out of anger on account of their similar
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> flight. To Gaius Aurunculeius in Sardinia were assigned the same legions with which Publius Manlius Volso had held that province.<note>Cf. XXVI. xxviii. 11.</note> Publius Sulpicius was ordered to hold Macedonia with the same legion<note>In spite of XXVI. xxviii. 9 he seems to retain one legion, not mentioned, however, below at xxii. 10.</note> and the same fleet, and his command was prolonged for one year. Thirty quinqueremes were ordered to be sent from Sicily to Quintus Fabius, the consul, at
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Tarentum. With the rest of his fleet it was the will of the senate, he was informed, that Marcus Valerius Laevinus should either cross over into Africa himself to plunder the country, or should send at his discretion Lucius Cincius or Marcus Valerius <pb id="p.235"/>Messalla. And in regard to Spain no change was<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> made, except that the commands of Scipio and Silanus were prolonged, not for one year, but until they should be recalled by the senate.<note>On this Livy's authorities must have differed, for a year later we read that their commands were prolonged for one year; xxii. 7.</note> Thus were the assignments and army commands apportioned for that year.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the midst of their attention to more important matters the election of a <hi rend="italics">maximus curio,</hi><note>Cf. vi. 16 and note.</note> when they were choosing a priest to succeed Marcus Aemilius, stirred up an old contest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The patricians declared that no regard should be paid to C. Mamilius Atellus, the one plebeian who was a candidate, since no one not a patrician had previously held that priesthood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes were appealed to, and referred the case back to the senate; the senate gave the people power to decide. Thus as the first plebeian Gaius Mamilius Atellus was elected <hi rend="italics">maximus curio.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And Publius Licinius, the pontifex maximus, compelled Gaius Valerius Flaccus to be installed as flamen of Jupiter, although unwilling. Gaius Laetorius was named one of the decemviri for the performance of rites in place of Quintus Mucius Scaevola deceased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The reason for installing a flamen perforce I should gladly have passed over in silence, had not his reputation changed from bad to good. Because of his irresponsible and dissipated youth Gaius Flaccus, who was odious to his own brother, Lucius Flaccus, and other relatives on account of the same vices, had been seized upon as flamen by Publius Licinius, pontifex maximus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As soon as the charge of rites and ceremonies took possession of his mind, Gaius so suddenly put off his old character that no one among all the young men stood higher in the estimation and approval of the leading <pb id="p.237"/>senators, both of his own family and of strangers alike.<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By the unanimity of this good report he was raised to a well-founded self-confidence, and claimed what had been in abeyance for many years owing to the unworthiness of former flamens, namely, that he should be admitted to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When he had entered the Senate House, and the praetor, Publius Licinius, had escorted him out of it, he appealed to the tribunes of the plebs. The flamen insistently claimed an ancient right of his priesthood, saying it had been granted to that office of flamen along with the <hi rend="italics">toga praetexta</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">sella curulis.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The praetor maintained that a right was based, not upon outmoded instances from the annals, but in each case upon very recent practice; and that within the memory neither of their fathers nor grandfathers had any flamen of Jupiter exercised that right.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The tribunes expressed the opinion that obsolescence due to the indolence of flamens was justly accounted their own loss, not a loss to the priestly office. Whereupon, without opposition even from the praetor himself, and with the general approval of the senators and of the commons, the tribunes led the flamen into the senate,<note>As now a member of the senate.</note> for it was the opinion of everyone that the flamen
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> had carried his point rather by the uprightness of his life than by virtue of priestly privilege.</p> 
				<p>The consuls, before leaving for their provinces, enrolled two city legions to supplement the other armies so far as was necessary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The duty of leading the former city army into Etruria the consul Fulvius assigned to Gaius Fulvius Flaccus, his lieutenant &mdash;this was the consul's brother &mdash;also that of bringing the legions that were in Etruria away to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And Fabius, the consul, ordered his son Quintus <pb id="p.239"/>Maximus to search out the remains of the Fulvian.<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> army<note>Cf. vii.</note> &mdash;and they amounted to four thousand three hundred and forty-four &mdash;and to conduct them to Sicily to Marcus Valerius, the proconsul; also to receive from him two legions and thirty quinqueremes.<note>Cf vii. 15.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The withdrawal of these legions from the islands did not reduce the garrison of that province at all either in actual strength or in appearance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For Valerius, in addition to the two old legions remarkably well recruited, had a large number of Numidian deserters also, cavalry and infantry; and he enrolled Sicilians likewise who had been in the army of Epicydes<note>A prominent figure in XXIV. and XXV. He fled to Africa in <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date>; XXVI. xl. 11.</note> or of the Carthaginians, being men trained in warfare.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Having attached these foreign auxiliary forces to each of the Roman legions, he preserved the appearance of two armies. With the one he ordered Lucius Cincius to defend that part of the island where had been the kingdom of Hiero; with the other he himself defended the rest of the island, formerly divided by the boundaries between the Roman and the Punic empires.<note>A statement for which no explanation has been found, since we do not know of a time when that part of Sicily west of the Syracusan kingdom was so divided. An intrusion in the text? Or did Livy write <hi rend="italics">Romani</hi> for <hi rend="italics">Graeci?</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The fleet also of seventy ships was divided, so that they might protect the seacoast around its entire circuit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Valerius himself with Muttines' cavalry roamed about his province, in order to visit the farms and to distinguish between cultivated and uncultivated lands, and to praise or upbraid the owners accordingly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> So, owing to this diligence, such a crop of grain was produced that he sent grain to Rome and also transported it to Catina, <pb id="p.241"/>whence it could be supplied to the army which was to<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> have its summer camp near Tarentum.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the transfer of soldiers to Sicily &mdash;and the most of them were of Latin status or allies &mdash;was the cause of an outbreak which might have been serious; so true is it that on small things often depends the course of great events.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For complaints began to be heard among Latins and allies in their gatherings:<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> local meetings.</note> that for now the tenth year they had been exhausted by levies of troops and their pay; that almost every year they fought in a disastrous defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some, they said, were slain in battle, others carried off by disease. The townsman who was enlisted by the Roman was lost to them more completely than a man taken captive by the Carthaginian. For with no demand for a ransom the enemy sent him back to his native town; the Romans transported him out of Italy, really into exile rather than into military service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the eighth year now the soldiers from Cannae were growing old there, certain to die before the enemy, who at the very moment was in the flower of his strength, departed out of Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If the old soldiers should not return to their native places, and fresh soldiers continued to be levied, soon no one would be left.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly, what the situation itself would soon refuse must be refused the Roman people without waiting to reach the extreme of desolation and poverty. If the Romans should see the allies unanimous to this effect, surely they would think of making peace with the Carthaginians. Otherwise never, so long as Hannibal lived, would Italy be rid of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such were the matters debated in their meetings.</p> <pb id="p.243"/>
				<p>There were at that time thirty colonies of the<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> Roman state.<note><hi rend="italics">Latin</hi> colonies sent out by Rome. Their inhabitants did not have the full Roman citizenship but only the Latin. There were at this time but ten colonies of <hi rend="italics">Roman</hi> citizens, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Ostia, Minturnae, Sena Gallica and other seaports.</note> Of these, while delegations from them all were at Rome, twelve informed the consuls that they had no means of furnishing soldiers and money. These were Ardea, Nepete, Sutrium, Alba, Carsioli, Sora, Suessa, Circeii, Setia, Cales, Narnia, Interamna.<note>In a somewhat different order these twelve reappear in XXIX. xv. 5, where Sora is better attested than in our passage. They were established at various dates between 442 and <date value="-298">298 B.C.</date> Cf. Salmon, <hi rend="italics">J.R.S.</hi> XXVI. 55 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls, deeply impressed by what was unheard-of, wishing to deter them from so abominable a move, and thinking they should accomplish more by upbraiding and rebuking them than by soft words, told them that they had dared to say to the consuls what the consuls could not bring themselves to utter in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For it was not a refusal of burdens and of military service, but an open revolt from the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly they should return to their colonies promptly, and, as though nothing had been settled, since they had spoken of so great a crime but had not yet ventured to commit it, they should deliberate with their people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Let them remind them that they were not Capuans nor Tarentines, but Romans, sprung from Rome and sent thence into colonies and on land captured in war, to increase their race. All that children owed to their parents they owed, it was said, to the Romans, if there was any filial affection, any memory of their former city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Let them therefore deliberate again; for their present reckless proposal tended to betray the Roman empire, to give over the victory to Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consuls by turns kept on for a long time in this strain; but the deputies, still unmoved, said <pb id="p.245"/>that they had nothing to report back home, nor did<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> their senates have anything new to decide upon, in towns where there were neither soldiers to be enlisted nor money to be furnished for pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consuls, finding them unyielding, brought the matter before the senate; and there such terror was inspired in the minds of the members that a great many of them said the empire was at an end; that the same thing would be done by the other colonies, the same by the allies; that they all had conspired to betray the city of Rome to Hannibal.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls exhorted and comforted the senate, and said that the rest of the colonies would be loyal and dutiful as formerly; that even the colonies which had abandoned their duty would have respect for the empire, if legates should be sent about among them to upbraid, not to entreat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Permission having been given the consuls by the senate to act and do as they thought to be for the interest of the state, after first sounding the temper of the other colonies, they summoned their legates, and asked them whether they had any soldiers in readiness according to the compact.<note>To each of the allies and to every colony a <hi rend="italics">formula</hi> was given, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a formal agreement or covenant in which mutual obligations were stated, including what military assistance was to be furnished; cf. XXII. lvii. 10; XXIX. xv. 12.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On behalf of the eighteen colonies Marcus Sextilius, of Fregellae, replied that they had soldiers in readiness according to the compact, and would give more if more were needed, and would exert themselves to do whatever else the Roman people might command and desire. To that end, he said, they did not lack means and had even a surplus of <pb id="p.247"/>spirit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls began by saying that to do the<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> men justice it did
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> not seem enough that they should receive praise from the lips of the consuls only, without having the entire senate first return thanks to them in the Senate House; and then they bade them to follow into the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After addressing them in a decree as complimentary as possible, the senate instructed the consuls to bring them before the people also, and along with the many other conspicuous services they had rendered to the senators themselves and their ancestors, to recount their recent service also to the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even now, after so many generations, they shall not be passed over in silence or defrauded of their praise. It was the men of Signia and Norba and Saticula and Fregellae, and of Luceria and Venusia, and of Brundisium and Hadria and Firmum and Ariminum, and on the other sea, the men of Pontiae and Paestum and Cosa,<note>On the coast of Etruria, but a Roman, not an Etruscan town, which still preserves its imposing polygonal walls.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and in the interior, the men of Beneventum and Aesernia and Spoletium, and of Placentia and Cremona.<note>The names show a studied arrangement in pairs or larger groups: Latium and Samnium near the coast, a group of four; Apulia; Adriatic coast; coast and islands of the Tuscan Sea; Samnium and Umbria; Cisalpine Gaul.</note> With the aid of these colonies at that time the empire of the Roman people stood fast,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> and thanks were rendered to them in the senate and before the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Of the other twelve colonies, which refused to obey orders, the senators forbade any mention to be made; their legates should neither be dismissed nor detained nor spoken to by the consuls. That silent rebuke seemed most in keeping with the majesty of the Roman people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>While the consuls were endeavouring to provide everything else needed for the war, it was voted that the gold yielded by the five per cent tax on manumissions, and kept in the more sacred treasury to <pb id="p.249"/>meet extreme emergencies, should be brought out.<note>In the <hi rend="italics">aerarium sanctius</hi> was kept a reserve of gold bars (at this period), stored separately from other funds and to be drawn upon only in some great emergency. This is the first instance of its use. The five per cent tax imposed upon the master who manumitted slaves was the chief source of supply.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> About four thousand pounds of gold were brought
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> out. Of this five hundred pounds each were given to the consuls and to Marcus Marcellus and Publius Sulpicius, the proconsuls, and to Lucius Veturius, the praetor who had by lot received Gaul as his province. And for Fabius, the consul, there were added a hundred pounds of gold above the rest, to be conveyed to the citadel of
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Tarentum. The remainder of the gold they employed in letting contracts<note>The quaestors would have the duty of letting the contracts, in this case for cash, with no resort to credit and a moratorium, as in XXIII. xlvii. 11.</note> in terms of ready money for clothing for the army which was carrying on the war in Spain, with distinction to itself and to its commander.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was further voted that for prodigies the atonement be made before the consuls should set out from the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the Alban Mount a statue of Jupiter and a tree near the temple had been struck by lightning; and at Ostia a basin,<note>Probably of a public fountain, such as may be seen at street corners in Pompeii; cf. XXXIX. xliv. 5.</note> and at Capua the city wall and the temple of Fortune, and at Sinuessa the wall and a gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These were struck by lightning. Also some persons testified that the current of the outlet<note>The famous <hi rend="italics">emissarium,</hi> made in accordance with a response of the Delphic oracle in <date value="-396">396 B.C.</date>; V. xvi. 9.</note> of the Alban Lake was blood-red, and that at Rome inside the cella of the Temple of Fors Fortuna<note>Outside the city and by the Tiber, probably that at the first milestone of the road later known as Via Portuensis.</note> a small image on a garland fell of itself from the head of the statue into the hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And at Privernum it was established that an ox spoke, and that in the crowded market-place a vulture flew down upon a shop, and that at Sinuessa <pb id="p.251"/>a child was born of uncertain sex, as between male<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> and female &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> populace call them hermaphrodites, as it uses many similar terms, since the Greek language is more apt in compounding words &mdash;; also that it rained milk there, and that a child was born with the head of an elephant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These prodigies were atoned for with full-grown victims, and prayers were ordered at all the <hi rend="italics">pulvinaria,</hi><note>Cf. iv. 15 and note.</note> and entreaties for one day. And it was decreed that Gaius Hostilius, the praetor, should vow and conduct games in honour of Apollo, as they had been vowed and conducted in those years.<note>Cf. XXV. xii. 11 f.; XXVI. xxiii. 3; and below, xxiii. 5 f.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>About that time Quintus Fulvius, the consul, also held an election for the naming of censors.<note>For the censors chosen in the previous year and the reason for this election cf. vi. 17 f.</note> Marcus Cornelius Cethegus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, both of whom had not yet been consuls, were named censors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That these censors should lease lands in the Campanian region was proposed to the commons on the authority of the senate, and the commons so ordered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The revision of the list of the senate was delayed by a dispute between the censors in regard to the choice of a <hi rend="italics">princeps senatus.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The choice belonged to Sempronius; but Cornelius said that they must follow the traditional custom of the senate, namely, to choose as <hi rend="italics">princeps</hi> the man who, among the living, had been censor first. That was Titus Manlius Torquatus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Sempronius claimed that if the gods had given a man the choice by lot, they also gave him an unrestricted right; he would make the choice according to his own judgment, and would choose Quintus Fabius Maximus, whom he could prove, even with Hannibal as judge, to be at that time the first citizen of the Roman state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After the war of words had <pb id="p.253"/>lasted long, his colleague was giving way, and<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> Sempronius chose Quintus Fabius Maximus, the consul, as <hi rend="italics">princeps senatus.</hi> Then the rest of the list of the senate was made up, with eight men ignored, among whom was Marcus Caecilius Metellus, notorious as having advised the desertion of Italy after the disaster at Cannae.<note>XXII. liii. 5; XXIV. xliii. 2 f. and note.</note> In attaching their <hi rend="italics">nota</hi> to knights also the same principle was maintained, but very few were the men to whom that notoriety applied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> From all of those who, as horsemen belonging to the legions from Cannae, were in Sicily &mdash;and there were many of them &mdash;their horses were taken away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> To this severity the censors added also prolonged service &mdash;that the years previously served with horses furnished by the state should not be reckoned, but that they must serve ten years, furnishing their own mounts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Furthermore they sought out a great number of the men who were bound to serve in the cavalry, and reduced to the grade of <hi rend="italics">aerarii</hi><note>XXII. liii. 5; XXIV. xliii. 2 f. and note.</note> all those who at the beginning of the war had been seventeen years old and had not served.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They then contracted for the rebuilding of what had been destroyed by fire around the Forum, namely, seven shops, the market, the Atrium Regium.<note>See XXVI. xxvii. 2 f. and notes. Of the shops there mentioned as destroyed the so-called <hi rend="italics">novae</hi> (north side of the Forum) were apparently not rebuilt until <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date>; XXXV.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having completed everything that was to be done at Rome, the consuls set out for the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fulvius went first and led the way to Capua. After a few days he was overtaken by Fabius, who implored his colleague in person and Marcellus also by letter to keep Hannibal occupied by the most spirited fighting possible while he himself was besieging Tarentum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With that city taken from him, he said, the enemy, beaten back on every side, and having no <pb id="p.255"/>place where he might make a stand nor any loyal<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> support to look to, would also find no reason for lingering in Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He sent a messenger to Regium also, to the commander of the garrison which had been posted there against the Bruttii by Laevinus, the consul, eight thousand men, for the most part from Agathyrna, as has been said above, who had been brought over from Sicily, being men accustomed to live by plundering.<note>Cf. XXVI. xl. 16 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To their number had been added from the same region Bruttian deserters, a match for them in daring and in the urgent needs that compelled them to take any risk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This force Fabius ordered to be led out first for the purpose of ravaging the country of the Bruttians, and then of besieging the city of Caulonia.<note>On the coast 23 miles northeast of Locri.</note> After carrying out their orders not only with energy but also with zest, robbing and putting to flight the tillers of the soil, they proceeded to assail the city with great violence.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Marcellus, spurred by the consul's letter, and also because he had come to believe that no Roman general was so good a match for Hannibal as himself, set out from winter quarters as soon as there was abundance of pasture in the fields, and encountered Hannibal near Canusium. The Carthaginian was tempting the men of Canusium to revolt; but on hearing of the approach of Marcellus, he moved his camp away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was an open country, with no concealment for ambuscades; accordingly he began to retire from it into wooded regions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcellus kept at his heels and would place camp close to camp, and after completing his fortifications, he would at once lead his legions out into battle-line. Hannibal by his cavalry in single troops and by spearmen on foot kept bringing on slight engagements, but <pb id="p.257"/>thought the risk of a general conflict unnecessary.<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless he was drawn into the conflict which he was trying to avoid. When the enemy had gone ahead by night, Marcellus overtook him in level and open country. Then as Hannibal was pitching camp, the Roman by fighting on all sides against the men engaged in fortifying prevented them from doing so. Thus standards faced standards and it was a battle with all their forces, and when night was now at hand, they separated on even terms. The camps, separated by a very short distance, were hastily fortified before night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day Marcellus led out his forces into line at daybreak. And Hannibal did not refuse battle, after he had exhorted his soldiers at length, that, remembering Trasumennus and Cannae, they should crush the over-confidence of the enemy, who was pressing them, Hannibal said, and threatening them, not allowing them to march undisturbed, nor to pitch their camp, nor to take breath and look around them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> every day they must at the same moment see the sun rising and the Roman battle-line in the plain; if he should come out of a single battle not without some losses, the enemy would thereafter carry on the war more calmly and quietly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Inflamed by these exhortations and also weary of the high spirit of a foe who daily pressed upon them and challenged them, they went into battle fiercely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They fought for more than two hours. Then on the side of the Romans the right <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> and the &eacute;lite troops<note>Of the allies, while the <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> filled the rest of the front line; cf. note on i. 8.</note> began to give way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Seeing this Marcellus led up the eighteenth legion into the front rank.<note>Marcellus had still another legion and another <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> as a reserve probably.</note> While the one part in disorder was yielding ground, and the other was slow in coming up, the whole line was confused, then thoroughly routed, and as fear <pb id="p.259"/>overpowered the sense of shame, they fled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In battle<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> and flight some two thousand seven hundred citizens and allies fell, among them four Roman centurions, two tribunes of the soldiers, Marcus Licinius and Marcus Helvius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Four military standards were lost from the <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> which was the first to flee, and two from the legion which had relieved the allies as they gave way.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, after they had returned to camp, made a speech to the soldiers which was so savage and bitter that, although they had borne the battle all day long without success, the angry general's speech was more ferocious to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>The immortal gods,</quote> he said, <quote>have my praises and thanks, so far as one can be grateful now, because the victorious enemy, when you were throwing yourselves in such fright upon the earthwork and the gates, did not attack the camp itself. You would surely have deserted the camp in terror, just as in terror you abandoned the battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What fright is this, what terror, that have taken possession of your minds, what sudden forgetting who you are and in battle with whom? Of course these are the same enemies in defeating whom, and in pursuing them when defeated, you have spent last summer, the same men whom you have pressed hard
						<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> in these days, as they were fleeing day and night, whom you have wearied by slight engagements, whom yesterday you did not allow either to march or to pitch camp. I pass over the things of which you can boast.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I shall mention something for which you ought also to feel shame <pb id="p.261"/>and regret; namely, you broke off the battle<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> yesterday while it was undecided.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the drawn battle of yesterday is something of which you should be ashamed, as well as of your rout to-day, though not to the same degree.</note> What has this night, what has this day brought?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Have your troops been reduced, or their forces increased in that time? For my part I do not seem to be speaking with my army nor with Roman soldiers. It is merely your bodies and weapons that are the same. Can it be that, if you had had the same spirit, the enemy would have seen your backs?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And would he have taken standards from any maniple or cohort?<note>Cohorts of allies had their <hi rend="italics">signa;</hi> XXV. xiv. 4. In the legions it was the maniple, not the cohort, which had a standard until Marius' time.</note> Till now his boasting was in the slaughter of Roman legions: you have this day given him for the first time the distinction of putting an army to flight.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then they began to shout that he should pardon them for that day, and afterwards, whenever he wished, he should test the spirit of his soldiers. <quote>I will indeed test them, soldiers,</quote> said he, <quote>and to-morrow I will lead you out into battle-line, that as victors, rather than as vanquished, you may gain the pardon for which you ask.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To the cohorts which had lost their standards he ordered barley to be issued, and as for the centurions of the maniples whose standards had been lost, he made them stand aside with drawn swords and no belts; and he ordered that on the morrow they should all, infantry and cavalry, present themselves under arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So the assembly was dismissed, as the men confessed that they had been upbraided with good reason and deservedly, and that on that day in the Roman line no one had been a man except the general alone, whom they must satisfy either by dying or by a glorious victory.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The next day they presented themselves according to orders armed and equipped. The general <pb id="p.263"/>praised them warmly and declared that he would.<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> lead out into the first line the men with whom the flight had begun the day before, and the cohorts which had lost their standards; that now he proclaimed that they must all fight and win, and strive singly and collectively to prevent news of yesterday's flight from reaching Rome before that of to-day's victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They were then bidden to strengthen themselves by eating, so that, if the battle should be prolonged, they might have sufficient endurance. When everything had been said and done that could arouse the soldiers' spirits, they advanced into line. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this was reported to Hannibal, <quote>Of a truth,</quote> he said, <quote>we have to deal with an enemy who can bear neither good fortune nor bad. If he has won, he furiously presses the defeated; if on the other hand he has been defeated, he renews the conflict with the victors.</quote><note>Cf. the words put into Scipio's mouth in XXVI. xli. 12 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> and into Hannibal's by Horace in <hi rend="italics">Carm.</hi> IV. iv. 53-68.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he ordered the trumpets to sound and led out his forces. On both sides the battle was much fiercer than the day before, the Carthaginians striving to maintain the distinction of yesterday, while the Romans strove to rid themselves of their disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The left <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> on the Roman side and the cohorts which had lost their standards were fighting in the first line, and the eighteenth legion was drawn up on the right wing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Gaius Claudius Nero, the lieutenants, commanded the wings. Marcellus in person upheld the centre, to exhort them and as a witness. On Hannibals' side Spanish troops held the front line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And they were the best troops in the entire army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the battle had long been indecisive Hannibal ordered the elephants to be driven up to the front, in the hope that that move might <pb id="p.265"/>bring about confusion and panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And at first they<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> did cause disorder among the standards and ranks, and by trampling down some of those who were near, and scattering others in alarm, they had stripped the line of battle at one point, and the flight would
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> have spread further, had not Gaius Decimius Flavus, a tribune of the soldiers, seized a standard from the first maniple of the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi><note>Cf. XXVI. v. 15.</note> and ordered the maniple to which it belonged to follow him. He led them to the spot where the brutes massed together were causing confusion and bade them hurl their javelins against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> All the weapons stuck fast, for it was not difficult to hit bodies of such size from a short distance and now packed in a dense mass. But although not all were wounded, still those in whose backs the javelins remained well fixed &mdash;so undependable is the species &mdash;took to flight and even made the uninjured wheel about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then no longer did a single maniple hurl its javelins, but every soldier for himself, provided he was able to catch up with the column of the fleeing elephants. All the more did the brutes dash among their own men and cause a greater slaughter than they had done among the enemy, in proportion as the frightened beast is urged on more fiercely by terror than when under the control of a driver on its back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Into the line thrown into confusion by the brutes dashing through it the Roman infantry carried their standards and with no great struggle they made the scattered and wavering enemy retreat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then, as they fled, Marcellus sent his cavalry against them, and pursuit did not end until in alarm they were driven into their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For in addition to the other causes of terror and consternation, two elephants had fallen in the very gate, <pb id="p.267"/>and the soldiers were forced to dash into the camp<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> over fosse and earthwork. It was there that the greatest slaughter of the enemy occurred, that is to say, about eight thousand men and five elephants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And for the Romans also it was not a bloodless victory. About one thousand seven hundred from the two legions, and of the allies more than one thousand three hundred, were killed; wounded were a large number of citizens and allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Hannibal moved his camp that night; Marcellus was eager to pursue, but the numbers of the wounded prevented him. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scouts sent to pursue the column reported next day that Hannibal was on his way to the land of the Bruttii.<note>According to Plutarch he went to Campania; <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> xxvi. 4.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>About the same time the Hirpini and Lucanians and the men of Volceii<note>An unimportant city in northern Lucania is unaccountably added, as if its citizens were not Lucanians. Some of their people still sided with Hannibal two years later; li. 13.</note> surrendered to Quintus Fulvius, the consul, handing over Hannibal's garrisons which they had in their cities, and were kindly received by him with nothing more than an oral reprimand for their previous mistake.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Bruttii<note>For Bruttian towns that had returned to Roman allegiance four years before cf. XXV. i. 2.</note> 3 also were given to expect a like pardon, upon the arrival from that region of the brothers Vibius and Paccius, easily the noblest of that tribe, to ask for the same terms of surrender as had been given to the Lucanians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Quintus Fabius, the consul, took the town of Manduria,<note>About 20 miles southeast of Tarentum.</note> in the land of the Sallentini, by storm. There about three thousand persons were captured, and other booty in quantity. Then removing to <pb id="p.269"/>Tarentum he pitched camp at the very entrance to<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> the harbour.<note>And opposite the citadel; XXV. xi. 1.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Of the ships which Laevinus had had to protect his supplies, the consul loaded some with devices and equipment for attacking city walls, while some of them he fitted out with artillery and stones and every kind of missile weapon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so also with the merchantmen, not merely those propelled by oars,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the smaller and swifter vessels, contrasted with heavier ships probably anchored at a distance.</note> in order that some crews should carry engines and ladders up to the walls, and others from ships at long range should wound the defenders on the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These ships were equipped and made ready to attack the city from the open sea. And the sea was unmolested by the Punic fleet, which had been sent over to Corcyra, since Philip was preparing to attack the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the country of the Bruttii meanwhile the besiegers of Caulonia,<note>Cf. xii. 6; xvi. 9.</note> to avoid being surprised, just before Hannibal's arrival withdrew to a hill that was safe from immediate attack, but otherwise offered nothing.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>While Fabius was besieging Tarentum,<note>Of Polybius' narrative of the recovery of Tarentum only an introductory page has survived (X. i.).</note> a circumstance hardly worth mentioning aided him in attaining his great objective. The Tarentines had a guard of Bruttians, furnished by Hannibal. The commander of that guard<note>Not of the entire garrison, which was commanded by a Carthaginian, Carthalo; xvi. 5.</note> was desperately in love with a young woman whose brother was in the army of Fabius, the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This brother, informed by a letter from his sister of her new acquaintance with a stranger who was rich and held in such honour by his people, conceived the hope that through his sister her <pb id="p.271"/>lover could be swayed in any desired direction, and<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> informed the consul what he hoped for.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Since that seemed no empty idea, he was bidden to go over to Tarentum, as if he were a deserter. And having won the friendship of the commander through his sister, he first guardedly sounded him, then, his lack of character being demonstrated, he used a woman's blandishments to lead him on to betray the defence of a place of which he had been put in command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the method of carrying out the plan and the time also had been settled, a soldier, sent out of the city secretly by night through intervals between outposts, reported to the consul the steps which had been taken and those which it had been agreed should be taken.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Fabius at the first watch gave the signal to the men in the citadel and to those who were guarding the harbour<note>On leaving his camp near the bridge-head Fabius must have left troops to guard the camp and harbour entrance.</note> ; and thereupon, making the circuit of the harbour, he established himself in hiding on the eastern side of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then trumpets sounded at the same time from the citadel and from the harbour, and from the ships which had approached from the open sea, and from all sides shouting and great uproar were purposely raised where there was the least danger. The consul meantime kept his men quiet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Accordingly Democrates, who had previously been admiral of the fleet,<note>Cf. XXVI. xxxix. 6.</note> and chanced to be in command at that point, on seeing everything near him quiet, while other quarters resounded with such an uproar that from time to time shouts arose as in a captured city, feared that, while he himself delayed, the consul might make an assault and bring in his troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He thereupon led his forces over to <pb id="p.273"/>the citadel, from which came the most terrifying<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> noise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Fabius, both from the time elapsed and from the mere silence &mdash;since no voice came from the direction where a little while before there was shouting to waken men and call them to arms &mdash;was aware that the guards had been removed. Accordingly he ordered ladders to be carried to that part of the wall where the go-between in the betrayal had reported that the cohort of Bruttians was on guard duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> There first the wall was taken, the men being aided and welcomed by the Bruttians, and they climbed over the wall into the city. Then also the nearest gate<note>Probably the Temenitis Gate of XXV. ix. 9 f.</note> was broken open, so that a dense column might march in.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Thereupon raising a shout they made their way into the market-place at about daybreak, while no armed men encountered them, and they drew against themselves an attack on every side from all the men who were fighting at the citadel and by the harbour.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They joined battle at the entrance to the market-place with more spirit than persistence. The Tarentine was no match for the Roman in courage, in arms, in the art of war, in bodily energy and strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore, after merely throwing their javelins, they retreated almost before they came to blows, and slipped away along the familiar streets of the city to their homes and those of friends. Two of their commanders, Nico and Democrates, fell fighting bravely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philemenus,<note>For Nico and Philemenus cf. XXV. viii. 3 ff.; ix. 8 ff.; XXVI. xxxix. 15.</note> who was the originator of the betrayal to Hannibal, had ridden away at full speed from the battle; and a little later his riderless horse was recognized wandering about <pb id="p.275"/>the city, but his body was nowhere found. It was<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> generally believed that he had thrown himself from his horse into an open well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover Carthalo, commander of the Punic garrison, mentioning his father's guest-friendship,<note>Presumably with Fabius, and the tie was inherited. But his protest was in vain.</note> had laid down his arms
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> and was on his way to the consul, when he was slain by a soldier who met him. Other soldiers slew other men everywhere, whether armed or unarmed, Carthaginians and Tarentines alike.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Everywhere Bruttians also were slain, many of them, either by mistake or out of old, inbred hatred of them, or to blot out the report of treachery, that Tarentum might be thought to have been captured rather by force of arms. Then from the slaughter they dispersed to plunder the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thirty thousand slaves are said to have been captured, an immense quantity of silver, wrought and coined, of gold three thousand and eighty pounds,<note>If the MS. tradition (83,000) could be accepted as conceivable, we should be obliged to explain how Capua, so much more prosperous than Tarentum, could have yielded only 2,070 pounds of gold to the captors; XXVI. xiv. 8.</note> statues and paintings, so that they almost rivalled the adornments of Syracuse.<note>For statues and paintings removed by Marcellus from Syracuse to Rome cf. XXV. xl. 1 ff.</note> But Fabius showed more magnanimity in refraining from plunder of that kind than did Marcellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When a clerk asked what he wished to have done with statues of colossal size &mdash;they are gods in the form of warriors, but each in his own attitude &mdash;Fabius ordered that their angry gods be left to the Tarentines.<note>One colossal statue of Jupiter, attributed to Lysippus, Fabius was unable to remove; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> XXXIV. 40. Another of Hercules he brought to Rome and set up on the Capitol; cf.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>While these things were going on, Hannibal received the surrender of the force besieging Caulonia and, on hearing of the attack upon Tarentum, urged his column rapidly forward day and night. When informed, while hastening to bring aid, that the city had been taken, <quote>The Romans also,</quote> he said, <quote>have their Hannibal; by the same art by which we had captured Tarentum we have lost it.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless, in order not to appear to have reversed his column as if in retreat, he pitched camp just where he had halted, about five miles from the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After lingering there a few days he withdrew to Metapontum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> From there he sent to Fabius at Tarentum two men of Metapontum carrying a letter from the leading men of that city and expecting to receive the consul's promise that their previous acts would go unpunished, if they should betray Metapontum and its Punic garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Fabius, assuming their message to be true, appointed a day on which he would come to Metapontum, and gave them a letter addressed to the leading citizens &mdash;a letter which was delivered to Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Pleased indeed at the success of the ruse, if even Fabius was to prove not unconquerable by trickery, Hannibal laid an ambush not far from Metapontum. When Fabius endeavoured to take the auspices before leaving Tarentum, the fowls were again and again unfavourable.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the sacred fowls refused to eat.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And when with the slaughter of a victim also he consulted the gods, the soothsayer declared that he must be on his guard against a ruse of the enemy and against an <pb id="p.279"/>ambuscade.<note>On the art of the haruspices and the widespread practice of finding omens in the <hi rend="italics">exta,</hi> particularly the liver, cf. Pease's notes on Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> I. 16. Cf. below xxvi. 13.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The men of Metapontum, when the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> had not come on the appointed day, were sent back to urge him if he hesitated; and being suddenly seized, in fear of a more relentless inquiry<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> by torture; cf. iii. 5; XXIII. xxxiv. 7.</note> they revealed the plot.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the summer in which these events were taking place, after Publius Scipio in Spain had spent the entire winter in winning over the support of the barbarians, partly by gifts and partly by restoring their hostages and captives, Edesco, who was eminent among the Spanish chieftains, came to him.<note>More of Ede(s)co in Polybius X. xxxiv. f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His wife and children were in the hands of the Romans; but in addition to this reason he was drawn by that more or less fortuitous trend of feeling which had turned all Spain away from Punic rule to Roman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Indibilis and Mandonius,<note>For these leaders of the Ilergetes cf. XXII. xxi. 2 f.; XXV. xxxiv. 6 f.; XXVI. xlix. 11; Polybius X. xxxv. 6 ff.</note> unquestionably the leading men of all Spain, had the same reason for leaving Hasdrubal, taking with them the whole force of their countrymen and withdrawing to heights which overlooked his camp, and from which there was a safe retreat along continuous ridges to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hasdrubal, seeing that the resources of the enemy were increasing by such large accessions, while his own were diminishing and, unless he ventured to do something, they would melt away to the Roman side, as they had begun to do, decided to fight as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Scipio was even more eager for battle, both because of confidence which was increasing with his success, and because he preferred to fight with one general and army before the armies of the enemy should unite, rather than with them all at <pb id="p.281"/>once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But even supposing he should have to fight<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> with several at the same time, he had enlarged his forces by a certain artifice. For, seeing that he was making no use of ships, since the whole coast of Spain was rid of Punic fleets, he beached his vessels at Tarraco and added their crews to the land forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And arms he had in abundance, both those captured at (New) Carthage and those which after the capture of that city he had caused to be made by impounding a large number of artisans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>With these troops Scipio set out at the beginning of spring from Tarraco and proceeded to lead against the enemy; for by this time Laelius also, without whom he did not wish any important action to be taken, had returned from Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As Scipio was passing through an entirely peaceful region, while allies escorted and welcomed him whenever he crossed the boundary of a tribe, Indibilis and Mandonius with their forces met him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Indibilis spoke for them both, not at all boorishly or carelessly, as one might expect of a barbarian, but rather with modesty and dignity, and more like a man who excused their change of sides as necessary than one who bragged that they had, as it were, seized that as the first opportunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For he was aware, he said, that the word deserter was detested by old allies, suspected by new ones; and he did not blame men for that habit, if only it was the motive, not the word, which produced hatred in both parties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then recounted their services to the Carthaginian <pb id="p.283"/>generals,<note>Not mentioning their attack upon the Romans in XXII. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> For their later disloyalties see XXVIII. xxiv. 3; xxxi. 5 ff.; XXIX. i. 19 ff.; Polybius XI. xxix. 3; xxxi. ff.</note> and on the other hand the greed and<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> haughtiness of the generals and the wrongs of every sort they had done to them and their countrymen. Consequently it was till then merely their body that had been with them; their mind had long since been where they believed justice and right were held in honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Even to the gods, he said, do those who cannot endure the violence and the wrongs of men flee as suppliants; as for themselves, their prayer to Scipio was that he should not reckon the change of sides either to their detriment or to their credit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> According as he should henceforward come to know their worth by testing them, let him in that light estimate the value of their service.<note>Polybius gives only an outline; X. xxxvii. <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi></note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>The Roman replied that he would do precisely that, and not regard as deserters men who did not consider an alliance valid in which nothing either divine or human was sacred. Thereupon their wives and children were brought before their eyes and given over to them as they wept for joy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And on that day they were escorted to guest-quarters, while the next day their promise of loyalty was accepted on the basis of a treaty, and they were sent away to bring up their forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Thereafter they were quartered in the same camp, until with these men as guides the enemy was reached.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The nearest army of the Carthaginians, that of Hasdrubal, was close to the city of Baecula.<note>A short distance north of the river Baetis, not far from Castulo, and in the silver mining region; XXVIII. xiii. 5; Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> xxxviii. 7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before the camp they had cavalry outposts. Upon these the light-armed, the vanguard and men at the head of the column, just as they came up after the <pb id="p.285"/>march and before choosing a site for a camp, made an<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> attack with such disdain that it was easy to see what was the spirit of each side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The horsemen were forced into the camp in alarm and flight, and the Roman standards were all but carried inside the very gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And on that day, indeed, after they had merely provoked each other to battle, the Romans pitched camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but by night Hasdrubal withdrew his troops to a hill the top of which formed an open, level plain.<note>In Polybius' account Hasdrubal had occupied this stronger position before the first attack of the Romans, two days after their arrival (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> xxxviii. 8 f.).</note> The river was behind it, while in front and at the sides a steep bank, as it were, encircled its entire margin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Beneath was also a lower level area, gently sloping down. This also was surrounded by another ledge no easier to climb.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Down to this lower plain Hasdrubal next day, on seeing the enemy's line standing before his camp, sent down his Numidian cavalry and the light-armed Balearic and African troops.</p> 
				<p>Scipio, while riding about his ranks and standards, pointed out that the enemy, having given up in advance the hope of fighting on level ground, were hugging the hills and were standing before them in reliance upon position, not upon courage and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But (New) Carthage, he said, had possessed higher walls, which the Roman soldier had scaled; and neither hills nor citadel, not even the sea, had withstood his arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The heights which the enemy had taken would only serve them for purposes of flight, as they leaped over precipices and crags. He would cut them off from such a flight too.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And he ordered one of two cohorts to hold the entrance <pb id="p.287"/>into the valley through which the river flowed, the<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> other to block the road leading from the city down the slope of the hill into the country. He himself led the unencumbered men, who the day before had routed the outposts of the enemy, to meet the light-armed standing on the lowest brow of the hill. At first they advanced over rugged ground, hampered only by the footing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then when they came within range, at first an immense number of missile weapons of every kind was showered upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In return they hurled stones which the place affords, strewn broadcast and almost all of them of a size to be thrown, and not only did the soldiers do so, but also the mass of camp-servants mingling with the armed men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>But although the ascent was difficult and they were almost overwhelmed by missile weapons and stones, still, thanks to their practice in scaling walls and to their persistence, they were the first to reach the top. As soon as they had taken some level ground where they could get a firm footing, they dislodged the light-armed enemy &mdash;troops
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> that are accustomed to skirmishing and, while avoiding the real battle by hurling long-range missiles, are protected by distance, but prove unsteady in the face of hand-to-hand conflict. Thus with great slaughter they drove them against the battle-line standing on the higher level of the hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then Scipio ordered his victorious troops to go up facing the centre of the line, divided the rest of his forces with Laelius, and bade him circle round the right side of the hill, until he found a way less difficult of ascent. He himself on the left, after a moderate circuit, charged into the flank of the enemy. In consequence the line was at first <pb id="p.289"/>thrown into disorder, while the men tried to wheel<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> and made their ranks face the shouts resounding on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In the midst of this disorder Laelius also reached the top;
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and the front line of the enemy, as the men gave way and were afraid of being wounded from the rear, lost its solidity, and room was given even for the Romans in the centre to mount to the top.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> These men would never have done so over such unfavourable ground if the ranks had stood unbroken with the elephants placed in front of the standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> While on all sides the slaughter was in progress, Scipio, who with the left wing had charged into the enemy's right wing, was fighting especially against the exposed flank of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> And no longer was space left open even for flight; for both on the right and on the left Roman outposts had blocked the roads, and the gate of the camp was obstructed by the flight of the general and chief officers, while in addition there was the panic of the elephants, of which, when terrified, they were as much afraid as of the enemy. Accordingly about eight thousand men were slain.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal, who even before the battle had hastily gathered up his money and had sent elephants in advance,<note>His original intention was to cross the Pyrenees about this time on his way to Italy; Polybius X. xxxix. 7 f.; cf. above, v. 12.</note> picking up as many men as possible in the course of their flight, directed his march along the river Tagus towards the Pyrenees.<note>By this route (vaguely indicated, as in Polybins <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> &sect; 8) Hasdrubal avoided any possibility of Roman opposition while following the upper valleys of the Tagus and the Ebro. The only indication which we have of his passage over into Gaul is in Appian <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 28, who says Hasdrubal crossed near the northern ocean, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Atlantic. The time was really the autumn of <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date>, and the following spring he crossed the Alps; cf. note onp. 296.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio took possession of the enemy's camp, and after giving up to the soldiers all the booty except free persons, in listing the captives found ten thousand foot-soldiers <pb id="p.291"/>and two thousand horsemen. Of these he sent all<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> the Spaniards to their homes without ransom; the Africans he ordered the quaestor to sell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the crowd of Spaniards, both those previously surrendered and those captured the day before, flocked round him and with great unanimity hailed him as king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon Scipio, after silence had been secured by a herald, said that his highest title was that of general-in-command; with that his soldiers had addressed him;<note>This (though not mentioned by Livy as such) is the earliest known instance of a commander being saluted as <hi rend="italics">imperator</hi> by his troops.</note> the title of a king, elsewhere in high honour, was not to be endured at Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As for his having the spirit of a king, if they thought <hi rend="italics">that</hi> was the noblest thing in the nature of man, let it be their silent verdict; from the use of the word let them refrain.<note>Cf. Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> xl. 5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even the barbarians appreciated the magnanimity of a man who from so lofty a height scorned a title by whose fascination the rest of mortals were dazed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Then gifts were apportioned to the princes and chieftains of the Spaniards, and out of the large number of captured horses he ordered Indibilis to select three hundred of his own choosing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While the quaestor at the general's command was selling the Africans, and had heard that a well-grown boy of conspicuous beauty among them was of royal race, he sent him to Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Scipio asked him who he was and from what region, and why at that age he was in the camp, he said he was a Numidian; that his people called him Massiva; that, left an orphan by his father, he had been brought up in the house of <pb id="p.293"/>his maternal grandfather Gala, king of the<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> Numidians; that with his uncle Masinissa, who had recently come with his cavalry to the assistance of the Carthaginians, he had crossed over into Spain; forbidden by Masinissa on account of his age, he had never before gone into battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the day they had fought with the Romans, without his uncle's knowledge, he said, he had secretly taken arms and a horse and gone out into the battle-line; there, thrown headforemost by a fall of his horse, he had been captured by the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Scipio, after ordering that the Numidian should be guarded, completed such duties as he had to perform from the platform; and then, having returned to headquarters, summoned him and asked whether he would like to return to Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When he shed tears of joy and said that he was indeed eager to do so, Scipio thereupon presented the boy with a gold ring, a tunic with a broad stripe, and a Spanish cloak, a golden brooch and a horse with his equipment; and ordering horsemen to escort him as far as he desired, Scipio sent him away.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then a council was held on the conduct of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And when some advised him to overtake Hasdrubal at once, Scipio thought that a dangerous course, for fear lest Mago and the other Hasdrubal<note>For the two Hasdrubals and Mago cf. also XXVI. xx. 6; XXV. xxxii. 3-8.</note> should join forces with him. He therefore merely sent a force to occupy the Pyrenees,<note>Meaning obviously the road near the Mediterranean. At the pass (Le Perthus, <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 940 feet) it was about 12 miles back from a rugged coast. Scipio was criticized for allowing Hasdrubal to escape from Spain. But only a much larger army could have closed the other passes, few as they are.</note> and himself spent the remainder of the summer in receiving the submission of the peoples of Spain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>A few days after the battle at Baecula, when Scipio, now on his way back to Tarraco, had emerged <pb id="p.295"/>from the forest of Castulo, the generals, Hasdrubal<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> the son of Gisgo and Mago, came from farther Spain to Hasdrubal, bringing belated aid after the defeat, but not inopportunely for a council on the prosecution of the rest of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There, as they were exchanging information concerning the spirit of the Spaniards in the territory assigned to each of them, Hasdrubal, the son of Gisgo, was alone of the opinion that the most remote part of Spain, which extends toward the Ocean and Gades, was still unacquainted with the Romans and in consequence sufficiently loyal to the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The other Hasdrubal<note>The brother of Mago.</note> and Mago agreed that, both as states and as individuals, all men were prepossessed owing to the favours of Scipio; and there would be no end to desertions until all the Spanish soldiers had been either segregated in the farthest part of Spain, or led over into Gaul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so, they said, even if the Carthaginian senate had not decreed it,<note>Cf. v. 12.</note> Hasdrubal would still have been obliged to proceed into Italy, where was the focus of the war and the main issue, with this purpose also, in order that he might lead all the Spanish troops out of Spain, far removed from the fame of Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They proposed that his army, depleted both by desertions and by defeat, should be recruited with Spanish soldiers; and further, that Mago, after turning over his army to Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, should himself cross to the Balearic Isles with a large sum of money, to hire mercenary auxiliaries;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, should retire with his army into the interior of Lusitania and not engage in battle with the Roman; that for Masinissa there should be a full complement of three thousand horsemen, the pick of all the cavalry, and <pb id="p.297"/>that, roaming about over hither Spain, he should lend<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> aid to allies and devastate towns and farms of the enemy. Having thus ordered, the generals separated, to carry out the measures decided upon. Such were the events in Spain that year.<note>Here again we correct Livy's chronology by Polybius Book X, in which the battle of Baecula falls in <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date>, leaving the winter and early spring only for Hasdrubal's stay in Gaul; cf. vii. 5 note. Livy has him remain a whole year among the Gauls, and makes no attempt to explain a delay so incredible.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>At Rome Scipio's fame was growing from day to day; Fabius, although Tarentum had been taken by ruse rather than by courage, nevertheless gained glory thereby; Fulvius' celebrity was declining;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcellus was even in bad repute, not only because he had at first been defeated, but also because, while Hannibal was wandering about Italy, he had drawn off his troops to their billets at Venusia in midsummer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He had a personal enemy, Gaius Publicius Bibulus, tribune of the plebs. This man, beginning with the first battle, which had been unsuccessful, by continually haranguing had defamed Claudius to the common people and made them hate
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> him, and by this time he was arguing for the abrogation of his command when the relatives of Claudius nevertheless carried their point that Marcellus should leave a lieutenant at Venusia and come to Rome, to clear himself of the charges which his enemies were making, and that the abrogation of his command should not be discussed while he himself was absent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By chance Marcellus came to Rome to avert disgrace, about the same time that Quintus Fulvius, the consul, arrived to conduct the elections.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The argument in regard to Marcellus' command was staged in the Flaminian Circus,<note>For the use of the Flaminian Circus at times for assemblies see Cicero <hi rend="italics">pro Sestio</hi> 33; <hi rend="italics">ad Att.</hi> I. xiv. 1. Plutarch in <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> xxvii. is following Livy, as often.</note> before a great assemblage of the commons and of all classes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.299"/>And the tribune of the plebs accused not Marcellus<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> merely, but the entire nobility. It was due to their dishonesty and delaying, he said, that Hannibal had Italy as his province for now the tenth year, and had lived longer there than at Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman people had this fruit from the continuation of Marcellus' command, namely, that his army, twice cut to pieces, had its summer quarters at Venusia in billets!
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This speech of the tribune was so completely refuted by Marcellus' statement of his achievements that not only was the bill to abrogate his command rejected, but on the following day all the centuries with great unanimity elected him consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Joined with him as colleague was Titus Quinctius Crispinus, who at the time was praetor. On the following day Publius Licinius Crassus Dives, pontifex maximus, Publius Licinius Varus, Sextus Iulius Caesar and Quintus Claudius were elected praetors.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Precisely on these election days the state was concerned in regard to a revolt in Etruria. First steps in that direction were reported in a letter of Gaius Calpurnius, propraetor in charge of the assignment, as being taken by the men of Arretium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly Marcellus, the consul-elect, was at once sent thither to look into the matter and, if he thought it important enough, to send for an army and shift the war from Apulia to Etruria. The Etruscans, restrained by the fear of that move, kept quiet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When legates of the Tarentines sued for peace with freedom and their own laws, the senate answered that they should return when Fabius, the consul, came to Rome.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The Roman Games and the Plebeian Games were repeated that year for one day in each case. The <pb id="p.301"/>curule aediles were Lucius Cornelius Caudinus and<note type="margin">B.C. 209</note> Servius Sulpicius Galba, the plebeian aediles being Gaius Servilius and Quintus Caecilius Metellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was said that legally Servilius had not been tribune of the plebs, nor was he now legally aedile, because his father, of whom it had been believed for nine years that he was slain as one of the three land-commissioners by the Boii near Mutina, was alive, it was now established, and in the hands of the enemy.<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The decree ordered that of the three they should choose two of their own selection, and that the third be given to the general whose assignment should be Tarentum and the Sallentini. The rest of the assignments were distributed as follows: for the praetors, jurisdiction in the city to Publius Licinius Varus, that involving strangers to Publius Licinius Crassus, pontifex maximus, with a command wherever the senate should decide; Sicily to Sextus Iulius Caesar and Tarentum to Quintus Claudius. Continued for one year was the command of Quintus Fulvius Flaccus; <pb id="p.303"/>who with one legion was to be in charge of Capua as<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> his assignment, formerly held by Titus Quinctius as praetor. Continued also was the command of Gaius Hostilius Tubulus, who was to succeed Gaius Calpurnius as propraetor for Etruria, at the head of two legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The command of Lucius Veturius Philo was likewise continued, he to hold Gaul as propraetor &mdash;the same assignment with the same two legions with which he had held it as praetor. The measure adopted in the case of Lucius Veturius was likewise decreed by the senate in that of Gaius Aurunculeius, and the bill to continue his command was brought before the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As praetor he had had Sardinia for his province with two legions. In addition he was given for the defence of the province the fifty warships which Publius Scipio had sent from Spain. And to Publius Scipio and Marcus Silanus were decreed for one year their own provinces in Spain and their own armies. Scipio was ordered to send over to Sardinia fifty of the eighty<note>Polybius makes his entire fleet number 53 ships (18 captured); X. xvii. 13.</note> ships which he had either brought with him from Italy or captured at (New) Carthage. This was owing to the report that at Carthage there were great naval preparations that year, and that with two hundred ships the Carthaginians would cover the whole coast of Italy, also of Sicily and Sardina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In Sicily, moreover, the apportionment was as follows: the army from Cannae was given to Sextus Caesar; Marcus Valerius Laevinus &mdash;for his command also was continued &mdash;to have the fleet of seventy vessels then in Sicilian waters. To that he should add thirty ships which had been at Tarentum the previous year. With that fleet of a hundred ships, he was, if he saw fit, to cross over to Africa, to ravage the country. Likewise Publius <pb id="p.305"/>Sulpicius' command was continued for one year,<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> and he was to have Macedonia and Greece as his province with the same fleet as before.<note>He must have had troops as well; but the legion of vii. 15 is not expressly mentioned.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In regard to the two legions that had been at the city of Rome no change was made. Permission was given to the consuls to recruit additional numbers, to be assigned to meet any need. It was with twenty-one legions that the Roman empire was defended that year. In addition, Publius Licinius Varus, the city praetor, was given the task of repairing the thirty old warships which were at Ostia and of manning twenty new ships with crews, so that with a fleet of fifty ships he might defend the seacoast near the city of Rome.<note>Thus even the city praetor has an emergency command.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Gaius Calpurnius was forbidden to move his army away from Arretium before the arrival of his successor. The same order was given to Tubulus also, to be particularly on his guard there against the outbreak of any sedition.</p> 
				<p>XXIII. The praetors set out for their assignments, but the consuls were detained by religious scruples, because, when a number of portents were reported, they did not easily obtain favourable sacrifices. From Campania had come reports that at Capua two temples, those of Fortune and of Mars, and a number of tombs were struck by lightning; that at Cumae mice had gnawed the gold in the temple of Jupiter &mdash;so true is it that superstition brings the gods into the smallest circumstances. At Casinum it was said that a great swarm of bees had settled in the forum.<note>Cf. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>x. 11 (Rome, Forum); XXI. xlvi. 2 (in camp, over the headquarters). Casinum was not in Campania, but on the way thither (Via Latina).</note> It was also reported that at Ostia the wall and a gate <pb id="p.307"/>of the city had been struck by lightning, that at Caere<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> a vulture had flown into the temple of Jupiter, that at Volsinii the lake<note>The Lake of Bolsena.</note> was stained with blood. On account of these prodigies prayers were offered for one day. For several days full-grown victims were slain without a favourable result, and for a long time the peace of the gods was not secured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was upon the heads of the consuls that dire consequences of the portents descended, while the state remained unharmed.</p> 
				<p>The Games of Apollo had been observed for the first time in the consulship of Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> <date value="-212">212 B.C.</date></note> under the direction of Publius Cornelius Sulla, the city praetor. From that time all the successive city praetors had conducted them. But they vowed them for a single year and did not conduct them on a fixed date.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That year a serious epidemic fell upon the city and the countryside, occasioning maladies, however, that were rather lingering than fatal. On account of that epidemic prayers were offered at the street corners throughout the city; and in addition Publius Licinius Varus, the city praetor, was ordered to propose to the people a bill that those games should be vowed in perpetuity for a fixed date.<note>A decree of the senate in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date> (XXVI. xxiii. 3) seems not to have been carried out.</note> He himself was the first to vow them in those terms, and he conducted them on the fifth<note>A slip, as Livy himself in giving the time of the festival in XXXVII. iv. 4 reckons from the Ides, not from the Nones. Thus the corrected date is the 13th of the month by our reckoning.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>XXIV. As regards the Arretines, reports grew more serious every day, and the anxiety of the senators was increased. Accordingly Gaius Hostilius <pb id="p.309"/>received written orders not to postpone taking<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> hostages from the Arretines, and Gaius Terentius Varro was sent with military authority, that Hostilius might turn them over to him to be escorted to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Upon Varro's arrival Hostilius at once ordered the one legion which was encamped before the city to advance into the city, and he posted his forces in suitable positions. Then, summoning the senate to the forum, he demanded hostages of them. When the senate asked for two days to consider, he ordered that they themselves furnish them forthwith, or else on the next day, he declared, he would take all the children of the senators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon the tribunes of the soldiers and prefects of allies and centurions were bidden to guard the gates, that no one might leave the city in the night. This was done slowly and with carelessness. Seven leading members of the senate, before guards could be posted at the gates, escaped before nightfall with their children. Next day at dawn they were missed when the senators began to be summoned to the forum, and their property was sold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From the rest of the senators a hundred and twenty hostages, their own children, were taken and handed over to Gaius Terentius Varro to be escorted to Rome. Varro in the senate represented everything as causing more apprehension than before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so, just as if an outbreak in Etruria were imminent, Gaius Terentius himself was ordered to lead a single legion, one or the other of the city legions, to Arretium and to keep that legion as the garrison of the town. As for Gaius Hostilius, it was decided that with the rest of the army he should scour the whole province and see to it that no opportunity was given to those eager <pb id="p.311"/>for a revolution. Upon the arrival of Gaius<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> Terentius at Arretium with his legion, when he demanded of the magistrates the keys of the gates, and they said they were not to be found, thinking they were removed by stealth and not really missing through carelessness, he himself provided other keys for all the gates, and took great pains to have everything under his own control.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He very earnestly warned Hostilius to rest his hope that the Etruscans would not make any move upon one thing &mdash;that he had first made it impossible for them to do so.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then in regard to the Tarentines there
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> was very heated discussion in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> senate in the presence of Fabius,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> who himself defended the men
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> whom he had captured by force, whereas others were hostile
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> and many put them
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> upon the same level of guilt and punishment as the Capuans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A decree of the senate was
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> adopted on motion of Manius
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Acilius, that the town should be guarded by a
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> garrison and all
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> the Tarentines confined within the walls;<note>As
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> at Capua, the citizens
						<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> were to be treated as political prisoners; 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxvii. 12.</note> that, with no action now, the case should be brought up later, when the condition of Italy was more peaceful. Also in regard to Marcus Livius, commandant of the citadel of Tarentum, there was no less heated discussion. For some were proposing to brand the commandant by a decree of the senate, because by his lack of spirit Tarentum had been betrayed to the enemy,<note>Livius had been drinking, according to Polybius VIII. xxvii.</note> and others proposed to vote him rewards, because he had defended the citadel for five years, and it was thanks to him more than to anyone else that Tarentum had been recovered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Those who preferred a middle course claimed that a hearing of his case belonged to the censors, not to the senate. Of this mind was Fabius also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He added, however, <pb id="p.313"/>his admission that the recovery of Tarentum was due<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> to Livius, as his friends had repeatedly declared in the senate; for it would not have had to be recovered unless it had been lost.<note>Cicero <hi rend="italics">Cato Maior</hi> 11, Certe, nam nisi tu amisisses, numquam recepissem; <hi rend="italics">de Oratore,</hi> II. 273; Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Fabius</hi> xxiii. 3.</note></p> 
				<p>Of the consuls one, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, set out for Lucania with additional recruits to join the army which Quintus Fulvius Flaccus had held. Marcellus was detained by religious scruples one after another, as they were impressed upon his mind. One of them was that, although he had vowed at Clastidium, in the Gallic War,<note><date value="-222">222 B.C.</date>, in his first consulship.</note> a temple to Honour and Valour, the dedication of the temple was being blocked by the pontiffs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These said that one cella was not properly dedicated to more than a single divinity, since, if it should be struck by lightning, or some portent should occur in it, expiation would be difficult, because it could not be known to which god sacrifice should be offered; for, with the exception of certain deities,<note>Doubtless those specified in the books of the pontiffs as divinities who might be so paired together. Cf. Valerius Maximus I. i. 8.</note> sacrifice of a single victim to two gods was not proper.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly a temple of Valour was added, its construction being hastened. Even so the temples were not dedicated by Marcellus in person.<note>For these temples outside the Porta Capena and their dedication by his son, see Vol. VI. p. 494, note; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Nat. Deor.</hi> II. 61; <hi rend="italics">in Verr.</hi> IV. 121; Val. Max. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi></note> Then at last he set out with additional recruits to join the army which he had left at Venusia the previous year.</p> 
				<p>Crispinus attempted to besiege Locri<note>Cf. XXIV. i.-iii.</note> in the land of the Bruttii, because he thought that Tarentum had brought great repute to Fabius; and he had requisitioned artillery and machines of every kind from Sicily. And from the same quarter ships also <pb id="p.315"/>had been sent for, to attack the part of the city<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> facing the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That siege was given up, because Hannibal had brought up his forces to Lacinium,<note>For promontory and temple cf. Vol. VI. p. 182, note; XXXVI. xlii. 2.</note> and the consul wished to unite with his colleague, who, it was reported, had already led his army away from Venusia. And so he returned from the land of the Bruttii into Apulia, and the consuls established themselves between Venusia and Bantia in two camps less than three miles apart. Hannibal also, now that the war had been diverted from Locri, returned into the same region.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There both consuls, who were by nature high-spirited, went out into battle-line almost daily, with no uncertain hope that, if the enemy should risk a battle with two united consular armies, the war could be finished.</p> 
				<p>XXVI. Hannibal, since in his two encounters with Marcellus in the previous year he had been both victor and vanquished, believed indeed that, if he should have to fight with the same general, he would find neither hope nor fear unfounded; nevertheless he believed that he would be by no means a match for the two consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly, devoting himself exclusively to his own arts, he was in search of a place for an ambush. Slight engagements, however, were taking place in the space between the two camps with varying results. The consuls, believing that the whole summer could be spent in that way, and yet thinking it possible to besiege Locri, wrote to Lucius Cincius to cross over from Sicily with his fleet to Locri. And, to make an attack upon the walls possible from the landward side also, they ordered that a part of the force which was serving as a garrison <pb id="p.317"/>should be brought from Tarentum to Locri.<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hannibal, being informed by some men of Thurii that this was about to be done, sent men to lie in wait along the road from Tarentum. There, beneath the hill of Petelia,<note>The town crowned a hill 1,100 feet high, and could be reduced only by starvation in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date>; cf. XXIII. xx. 4 ff.; xxx. 1 ff.</note> three thousand horsemen and two thousand foot were posted in hiding. When the Romans, as they advanced without reconnoitring, encountered this force, about two thousand of their armed men were slain, about fifteen hundred taken alive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The rest, scattering in flight over the farms and through the woods, returned to Tarentum.</p> 
				<p>Between the Carthaginian and the Roman camps<note>For the scene we revert to the region of Venusia; cf. xxv. 13; xxviii. 5; Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> xxix. 1.</note> there was a wooded hill, at first not occupied by either army, because the Romans did not know what was the character of that side of it which faced the enemy's camp, and Hannibal had believed it better suited to an ambuscade than to a camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so, sending by night a number of squadrons of the Numidians for that purpose, he had concealed them in the middle of the wood. And during the day none of them would stir from his post, for fear lest either their arms or the men themselves should be seen from a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In the Roman camp<note>Evidently that of Marcellus.</note> there was a general outcry that the hill must be occupied and defended by a fort, in order that they might not have the enemy, as it were, upon their necks, if the hill should be occupied by Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> That roused Marcellus, and he said to his colleague, <quote>Why not go ourselves with a few horsemen to reconnoitre? Seeing the situation before our eyes will give us a surer judgment.</quote> As Crispinus assented, they set out with two <pb id="p.319"/>hundred and twenty horsemen, of whom forty were<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> from Fregellae, the rest Etruscans.<note>Polybius' briefer account makes their escort two troops of cavalry, about 30 light-armed infantry and the lictors (who would be 24 in number); X. xxxii. 2.</note> The tribunes of the soldiers, Marcus Marcellus, son of the consul, and Aulus Manlius, followed them, along with two prefects of the allies, Lucius Arrenius and Manius Aulius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Some have related that the consul Marcellus offered a sacrifice that day, and that when the first victim was slain, the liver was found headless; that in the second everything usually found was present; that the head seemed even enlarged; also that the soothsayer had not been at all pleased that, after organs defective and deformed, others had appeared which were more than promising.<note>So Plutarch also, at greater length; <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> xxix. 5.</note> 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But such eagerness to fight with Hannibal possessed the consul Marcellus that he said the camps were never close enough together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At this time also, as he came out from the earthwork, he gave the command that the soldiers should be ready and in place, so that, in case the hill which they were on their way to reconnoitre proved satisfactory, they might gather up their baggage and follow.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was only a small level space before the camps; then a road open and visible from every side led up the hill. As for the Numidians, a scout who had been posted not at all in the hope of so important a result, but in case they might be able to capture any men who, in wandering about in search of fodder or firewood, had gone too far from camp, gave the signal to spring up, all of them at the same time, from their different hiding-places.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Those who, facing the enemy, had to rise up from the hillside itself, did not show themselves before those who were to cut off the road in the rear turned the enemy's flanks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then they all sprang up from every side and, raising a <pb id="p.321"/>shout, they attacked. Although the consuls were in<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> such a depression that they neither could make their way up on to the ridge occupied by the enemy, nor had any retreat open, being enclosed in the rear, still the combat might possibly have been prolonged, had not flight begun by the Etruscans inspired alarm in the others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless the men of Fregellae, deserted by the Etruscans, did not give up the battle, so long as the unwounded consuls withstood the attack, encouraging their men and themselves taking part in the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But after they saw both consuls wounded, Marcellus even pierced by a lance and slipping from his horse, a dying man, then they likewise &mdash;now only a very few were left &mdash;fled with Crispinus, the consul, who had been struck by two javelins, and Marcellus the younger, also wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Aulus Manlius, tribune of the soldiers, was slain, and of the two prefects of the allies Manius Aulius was killed, Lucius Arrenius captured. And five of the consuls' lictors came alive into the hands of the enemy; the rest were either slain or they escaped with the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Of the horse forty-three fell either in battle or in flight, eighteen were captured alive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the camps there had been an uproar, a clamour that they should go to the relief of the consuls, when now they saw the consul and the son of the other consul both wounded, and the little remnant of the unlucky enterprise coming towards the camps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Marcellus' death was pitiable both for other reasons and also because it was neither consistent with his age &mdash;for he was now more than sixty years old &mdash;nor with his foresight as a veteran commander, that with such imprudence he had carried himself and his colleague and almost the entire state over the brink.<note>Polybius enlarges upon Marcellus' indefensible temerity and contrasts Hannibal's prudent care of his personal safety; X. xxxii. f.; cf. Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Pelopidas and Marcellus</hi> iii. 3 f.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><pb id="p.323"/>
				<p>I should be very discursive in regard to a single<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> event, if I should aim to rehearse all the statements in which authorities differ concerning the death of Marcellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Not to mention others, Coelius furnishes successively a threefold relation of what happened: one the traditional account, a second set down in the eulogy pronounced by the son, who was present, Coelius says, when it happened, a third which he himself contributes as investigated and established by him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But the divergent reports fall within this range, that most authorities relate that he left the camp to reconnoitre a position, while all say that he was overwhelmed by an ambush.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, thinking that great terror had been inspired in the enemy by the death of one consul and the wounding of the other, not to miss any opportunity, at once removed his camp to the hill on which they had fought.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Marcellus' body was found and buried.<note>Cf. Cicero <hi rend="italics">Cato Maior</hi> 75; Val. Max. V. i. Ext. 6. For different accounts see Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> xxx. 2 ff., with incorrect citation of his authorities.</note> Crispinus, alarmed both by the death of his colleague and by his own wound, set out in the silence of the following night and in the first mountains which he reached pitched camp on a high place that was also safe on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There the two generals set their wits to work, the one to employ, the other to guard against, a ruse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcellus' ring<note>Livy's probably unique use of the plural where only a single seal ring can be meant has never been satisfactorily explained.</note> had come into the hands of Hannibal along with the body. Fearing some trickery might be contrived by the Carthaginian through a fraudulent use of that seal, Crispinus had sent word around to the nearest city-states that his colleague had been slain and the enemy was in possession of his ring; <pb id="p.325"/>that they should not trust any letters written in the<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> name of Marcellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This message of the consul had come to Salapia<note>Cf. XXVI. xxxviii. 6, note; and for the betrayal of its garrison of Numidian cavalry, <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> &sect;&sect; 11-13.</note> a little before a letter from Hannibal written in Marcellus' name arrived, saying that he would come to Salapia in the night following that day; that the soldiers on garrison duty should be ready, in case he should have any need of their services.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The men of Salapia were aware of the deception, and thinking that Hannibal, out of anger not only because of their revolt, but also for the slaughter of his cavalry, was seeking an excuse for punishing them, they sent back the messenger &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> was, in fact, a Roman deserter &mdash;that the soldiers might do what they wished unobserved. And they posted men of the town along the walls and at favourable positions in the city in detachments on guard duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For that night they established guard-lines and sentries with more than usual care. Around the gate by which they thought the enemy would come they drew up the best men in the garrison. Hannibal approached the city about the fourth watch.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At the head of the column were the Roman deserters, and they had Roman arms. When they came up to the gate, all of them, speaking Latin, called out to the sentinels and bade them open the gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul, they said, was coming. The sentries, pretending to have been awakened by their outcry, were in a turmoil, excited and labouring to open the gate. The portcullis<note>Constructed of stout timbers strengthened with iron, as described in Aeneas Tacticus xxxix. 3 f. (about 150 years earlier); cf. Vegetius IV. iv.; Appian <hi rend="italics">B.C.</hi> IV. 78. The vertical grooves are often found in remains of city gates.</note> had been closed. Some raised it with levers, some hoisted it with ropes, just high enough for men to pass <pb id="p.327"/>under it upright.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hardly had the way been quite<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> cleared, when the deserters vied with each other in dashing through the gate. And when about six hundred had entered and the rope by which it was held up had been let go, the portcullis fell with a great crash.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some of the Salapians attacked the deserters, who fresh from their march were carrying arms carelessly slung from their shoulders, as if among peaceable people; others from towers of the gate and from the walls frightened off the enemy with stones, poles and javelins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thus Hannibal, having been ensnared by his own ruse, went away; and he set out to raise the siege of Locri, a city which Lucius Cincius was besieging with great violence by means of siege-works and with every sort of artillery brought from Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For Mago,<note>This is the Mago responsible for the death of Gracchus in <date value="-212">212 B.C.</date>; cf. XXV. xvi.</note> who no longer was confident that he would hold and defend the city, the first ray of hope came with the news of Marcellus' death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then followed the news that Hannibal had sent the Numidian cavalry in advance and was himself following with the infantry column, making all possible speed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Accordingly, as soon as Mago knew from signals given from watch-towers that the Numidians were approaching, he also suddenly opens a gate and sallies out confidently against the enemy. And at first it was a doubtful conflict, rather because his action had been unexpected than because he was a match in forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Then when the Numidians came up, such terror was inspired among the Romans that they fled pell-mell to the sea and the ships, leaving siege-works and engines with which they were battering the walls. Thus by Hannibal's coming the siege of Locri was raised.</p> <pb id="p.329"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Crispinus, on learning that Hannibal had<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> set out for the country of the Bruttii, ordered Marcus Marcellus, tribune of the soldiers, to lead away to Venusia the army which his colleague had commanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He himself set out with his legions for Capua, although on account of his serious wounds he was barely able to endure the motion of his litter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But he sent a letter to Rome in regard to the death of his colleague, stating also in what danger he was himself; that he was unable to come to Rome for the elections, because it seemed that he would not be able to endure the strain of the journey, also because he was concerned about Tarentum, lest Hannibal, leaving the land of the Bruttii, should head his column in that direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was necessary, he wrote, that envoys be sent to him, men of foresight with whom he might say what he wished to say about the state. The reading of this letter caused at the same time great grief for the death of one consul and great fear in regard to the other. Accordingly they sent Quintus Fabius the son to the army at Venusia, and also three legates were sent to the consul, namely, Sextus Iulius Caesar, Lucius Licinius Pollio and Lucius Cincius Alimentus, the last named having returned from Sicily a few days before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These men were bidden to report to the consul that, if he could not come himself to Rome for the elections, he should on Roman territory name a dictator for the purpose of the elections;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that if the consul should go to Tarentum, it was the will of the senate that Quintus Claudius, the praetor, should lead his legions away to a region in which he could defend the greatest number of cities of the allies.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The same summer Marcus Valerius<note>Valerius Laevinus (xxii. 9), not Valerius Messalla (vii. 16).</note> crossed over <pb id="p.331"/>from Sicily to Africa with a fleet of a hundred ships,<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> and making a landing at the city of Clupea,<note>So named (= <foreign lang="greek">)Aspi/s,</foreign> shield) from the shape of the hill; south of Cape Bon (Promuntorium Mercurii) and east of Carthage (85 miles); Strabo XVII. iii. 16.</note> he ravaged the country far and wide, meeting hardly any armed men. Then the foragers were hurriedly brought back to the ships, because suddenly came the report that a Carthaginian fleet was approaching.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There were eighty-three ships. With these the Roman fought with success not far from Clupea. After capturing eighteen ships and putting the rest to flight, he returned to Lilybaeum with a great quantity of booty from the land and from the ships.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The same summer<note>In this passage Livy departs from strict chronology by summarizing under <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date> events also in Macedonia and Greece which belong to the previous year, but had been passed over. Thus the Nemean Games (xxx. f.) occurred in <date value="-209">209 B.C.</date></note> Philip, in response to their appeal, lent aid to the Achaeans, whom Machanidas, tyrant of Lacedaemon, was harassing with a war on their border, while the Aetolians also, sending their army on ships across the strait &mdash;the inhabitants call it Rhion &mdash;which flows between Naupactus and Patrae, had devastated their country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Furthermore Attalus, King of Asia, it was reported, was about to cross over into Europe, since the Aetolians had at their last council conferred upon him the highest magistracy of their nation. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Consequently, as Philip was coming down into Greece, the Aetolians encountered him at the city of Lamia, their general being Pyrrhias, who along with the absent Attalus had been elected praetor<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">strathgo/s.</foreign> Attalus I (241-<date value="-197">197 B.C.</date>) had the same title as an honour merely.</note> for that year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had with them auxiliary troops from Attalus and also about a thousand men sent by Publius Sulpicius from the Roman fleet. Against this general and these forces <pb id="p.333"/>Philip fought twice with success. In each battle he<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> slew fully a thousand of the enemy. Then, while the Aetolians, constrained by fear, remained inside the walls of the city of Lamia, Philip led his army back to Phalara. The place is on the Maliac Gulf,<note>On the north shore of the Gulf. Phalara was the port of Lamia.</note> and was formerly populous on account of its remarkable harbour and safe roadsteads on this side and that and other advantages from the sea and the land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To that place came ambassadors from Ptolemy, King of Egypt, and from the Rhodians and Athenians and Chians, in order to bring to an end the war between Philip and the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A peacemaker from their neighbours also was brought in by the Aetolians, Amynander, King of the Athamanians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For all of them, however, it was not so much solicitude for the Aetolians, a race more warlike than comports with the character of Greeks, as it was the fear lest Philip and his kingdom might become involved in the affairs of Greece and become a menace to freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As for the peace, consideration was postponed until the council of the Achaeans, and for that council a place and also a fixed date were appointed. Meantime a truce for thirty days was obtained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Setting out from thence<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> from Phalara.</note> King Philip came by way of Thessaly and Boeotia to Chalcis in Euboea, in order that he might prevent Attalus, who, he had heard, was about to make for Euboea with a fleet, from using the harbours and from landing on the shore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And then, leaving a garrison against Attalus, in case he should cross over in the meantime, he set out himself with a few horsemen and light-armed and came to Argos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There the direction of the games in honour of Hera and of the Nemean Games<note>Celebrated in the 2nd and 4th year of each Olympiad; cf. pp. 330-331, note 2.</note> was conferred upon him by vote of <pb id="p.335"/>the people, because the kings of the Macedonians<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> claim that they sprang from that city. When the Heraea were over, immediately after the games he left for Aegium and the long since appointed council of his allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There they discussed the termination of the Aetolian war, that neither the Romans nor Attalus might have reason to enter Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But all such plans, though the time of the truce had scarcely elapsed, were thrown into confusion by the Aetolians, when they heard that Attalus had reached Aegina<note>Attalus purchased the island three years before this from the Aetolians; these had acquired it under a treaty made with the Romans, who had taken forcible possession; Polybius XXII. viii. 10.</note> and also that a Roman fleet was lying at Naupactus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For on being called into the council of the Achaeans, in which were also present the embassies which at Phalara had spoken on behalf of peace, they at first complained of certain small breaches of the agreement committed during the truce.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Finally they asserted that the war could not be brought to an end unless the Achaeans should restore Pylus to the Messenians, and Atintania should be returned to the Romans, and the Ardiaei to Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus.<note>Cf. XXVI. xxiv. 9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Philip, who thought it a perfect outrage for the vanquished actually to offer terms to him, the victor, said that on the former occasion also it was not with any hope that the Aetolians would keep quiet that he had either listened to pleas for peace or agreed to a truce, but in order to have all the allies witnesses that he had sought a ground for peace, the Aetolians a ground for war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> So, with peace unachieved, he dismissed the council, leaving four thousand armed men to protect the Achaeans and receiving five warships from them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He had decided that, if he should add these to the Carthaginian fleet lately sent to him, and to the ships that were coming from Bithynia from King Prusias, he would attack the <pb id="p.337"/>Romans, who had long commanded the sea in that<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> region, in a naval battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> As for himself, he returned from that council to Argos; for the time of the Nemean Games was at hand, and he wished them to be more festive because of his presence.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the king was engaged in preparing for the games and relaxing during the festal days with more freedom than in war-times, Publius Sulpicius sailing from Naupactus put in with his fleet between Sicyon and Corinth and ravaged a region of the most noted fertility far and wide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The report of this called Philip away from the games; and setting out in haste with the cavalry, after ordering the infantry to follow, he attacked the Romans, who, fearing nothing of the kind, were widely scattered over the country and loaded down with their plunder, and he drove them to their ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman fleet, not at all happy over its plunder, returned to Naupactus. For Philip the remainder of the games also had gained in festivity from the news of a victory, unimportant as it might be, but still over the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And the festival was observed with immense rejoicing, all the more because, to be popular, he had removed his diadem and purple and other regal attire, and in appearance had put himself on the same plane as the others, than which nothing is more acceptable to free states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Also by doing so he would have offered them no uncertain hope of freedom, had he not degraded and debased everything by his insufferable lust. For with one or two companions he would roam day and night round the homes of married couples, and lowering himself to the level of a private citizen, the less he was observed the more unrestrained was he;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and liberty, of which <pb id="p.339"/>he had made but an empty show to others, for his<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> purpose he had turned wholly to licence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For he did not obtain everything by purchase or cajoling, but even employed force to gain his shameful ends. And it was dangerous for both husbands and parents if they had delayed the royal lust by disobliging strictness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Even from Aratus, one of the leading men of the Achaeans, his wife, named Polycratia, had been taken away and carried off into Macedonia with the prospect of a royal marriage.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>After the festival of the Nemea had been completed in the midst of such shameful conduct, and he had added a few more days, he set out for Dymae, in order to expel the Aetolian garrison which had been summoned by the Eleans and admitted to their city.<note>The city of Elis, not Dymae, which was in Achaia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Cycliadas, who held the chief command, and the Achaeans met the king near Dymae, being not only inflamed with hatred of the Eleans because they were at odds with the rest of the Achaeans, but also hostile to the Aetolians, who, they believed, had stirred the Romans likewise to a war against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Setting forth from Dymae and uniting their armies, they crossed the river Larisus, which separates the Elean territory from that of Dymae. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first day on which they entered the territory of the enemy they spent in devastation. On the next day, drawing up a battle-line, they approached the city, after sending the cavalry in advance; it was to ride up to the gates and provoke the Aetolians, a race of men alert for sallies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They did not know that Sulpicius with fifteen ships had crossed over from Naupactus to Cyllene, and landing four thousand armed men had entered Elis in the dead of night, so that the column <pb id="p.341"/>should not be seen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Consequently the surprise<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> inspired great alarm, when they had recognized Roman standards and arms among the Aetolians and Eleans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And at first the king had wished to recall his men; then, on seeing his own men hard pressed by the battle already begun between the Aetolians and the Tralles, an Illyrian race, the king also with his cavalry charged a Roman cohort.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There his horse was run through by a javelin and threw the king sprawling over his head, whereupon a fierce battle was kindled on both sides, as the Romans made an attack upon the king and at the same time the king's guards tried to protect him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Conspicuous was his own fighting also, although he had been forced to go into battle on foot among horsemen. Then, when the combat was now one-sided and many were falling and being wounded around him, he was seized by his men, was lifted upon another horse, and fled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On that day he pitched camp five miles from the city of Elis. The next day he led out all his troops to a neighbouring fortress of the Eleans &mdash;they call it Pyrgus &mdash;into which he had heard that a great number of rustics, together with their flocks, had been driven by the fear of being robbed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That unorganized and unarmed multitude he at once captured in the first panic as he came up. And by that booty he had made good the disgrace he had suffered at Elis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As he was dividing the booty and the captives &mdash;there were in fact four thousand persons and about twenty thousand cattle of every <pb id="p.343"/>kind &mdash;came the news from Macedonia that one<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> A&euml;ropus by bribing the commander of the citadel and garrison had captured Lychnidus,<note>Now Ochrida, at the north-east end of the lake of the same name (between Albania and Jugoslavia), on the main road from the Adriatic to Thessalonica (later the Via Egnatia). South of the lake and bordering on Macedonia were the Dassaretii, an important Illyrian tribe in a mountain country. North-east of the lake were the Illyrian Dardani.</note> was holding some villages of the Dassaretii and also stirring up the Dardani.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Consequently the king, dropping the Achaean and Aetolian war, but still leaving twenty-five hundred armed men of every sort with Menippus and Polyphantas as commanders to defend his allies,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> setting out from Dymae, made his way through Achaia and Boeotia and Euboea in ten day's marches to Demetrias<note>The commercial centre of Thessaly, in Magnesia, at the north end of the Gulf of Pagasae, and strongly fortified.</note> in Thessaly.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There other messengers met him, bringing news of a greater inroad: that the Dardanians pouring into Macedonia were already holding Orestis<note>The commercial centre of Thessaly, in Magnesia, at the north end of the Gulf of Pagasae, and strongly fortified.</note> and had come down into the Argestaean Plain; and that it was currently reported among the barbarians that Philip had been slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On that raid in which he fought near Sicyon<note>Cf. xxxi. 1f.</note> with men who were ravaging the country, he was dashed against a tree by his charging horse, and broke off one of the two horns of his helmet against a projecting branch.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was found by a certain Aetolian and carried into Aetolia to Scerdilaedus, who was acquainted with the ornament of the helmet,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and this spread abroad the report that the king had been slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After the departure of the king from Achaia, Sulpicius went with his fleet to Aegina<note>Cf. xxx. 11 and note.</note> and joined Attalus. The Achaeans fought a successful engagement with the Aetolians and Eleans not far from Messene.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> King Attalus and Publius Sulpicius spent the winter at Aegina.</p> <pb id="p.345"/>
				<p>At the end of this year Titus Quinctius, the consul,<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> after naming Titus Manlius Torquatus dictator for the purpose of holding elections and games, died of his wound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some relate that he died at Tarentum, others in Campania. So two consuls &mdash;and this had happened in no previous war &mdash;losing their lives without a notable battle, had left the state as it were bereft. The dictator Manlius named Gaius Servilius, then a curule aedile, as master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate on the first day on which it sat ordered the dictator to conduct the great games<note>Votive games, vowed in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date>; XXII. ix. 10; x. 7.</note> which Marcus Aemilius, the city praetor, had conducted in the consulship of Gaius Flaminius and Gnaeus Servilius and had vowed for the fifth year thereafter.<note>But the vow had not been fulfilled.</note> At this time the dictator conducted the games and also vowed them for the succeeding lustrum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But inasmuch as two consular armies were so near the enemy without their commanders, the senate and the people, neglecting everything else, were possessed by one particular concern &mdash;to elect consuls at the first possible moment, and to elect especially men whose courage was quite safe against the Carthaginian wiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Not only throughout that war, they said, had the over-hasty, fiery temperament of the generals proved ruinous, but in that very year the consuls in their excessive eagerness to engage with the enemy had fallen unawares into a trap.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But, they added, the immortal gods, taking pity upon the Roman people, had spared the innocent armies, and had punished the rashness of the consuls by the loss of their own lives.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the fathers were casting about to see whom they should make consuls, pre-eminent <pb id="p.347"/>above all the rest was Gaius Claudius Nero; their<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> quest was for his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And they considered Nero a remarkable man, to be sure, but more hasty and violent than the war situation and Hannibal as enemy demanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They thought his violent nature must be tempered by giving him as his colleague a man of moderation and foresight. There was Marcus Livius,<note>Following his consulship, for the year <date value="-219">219 B.C.</date> with Aemilius Paulus, he was charged with taking too large a share in the spoils of a war against the Illyrians, for which they were granted triumphs; Frontinus IV. i. 45; <hi rend="italics">ex invidia</hi><hi rend="italics">peculatus reus,</hi> Aurelius Victor (?) I. i; cf. XXIX. xxxvii. Livius was fined according to Suetonius <hi rend="italics">Tiberius</hi> iii.</note> who many years before, after his consulship, had been condemned by verdict of the people,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and had been so indignant at that disgrace that he removed to the country and for many years absented himself from the city and also from every gathering of men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> About seven years after his condemnation Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Marcus Valerius Laevinus, the consuls, had brought him back into the city. But he wore old clothing and long hair and beard, revealing outwardly in countenance and garb a notable memory of the disgrace he had incurred, Lucius Veturius and Publius Licinius, the censors, compelled him to shave and lay aside his neglected appearance and to come into the senate and perform other public duties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even then, however, he would either assent in a word or go over to the side of the mover, until the case of his relative, Marcus Livius Macatus,<note>Cf. xxv. 3 ff.</note> whose reputation was involved, obliged him to stand up and deliver his opinion in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he was heard at that time after so long an interval, he attracted men's attention to himself and gave occasion for their saying that the people
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> had wronged a man who did not deserve it, and that it had been a great loss that <pb id="p.349"/>in so serious a war the state had not availed itself of<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> the services and the advice of such a man; that neither Quintus Fabius nor Marcus Valerius Laevinus could be given to Gaius Nero as his colleague, because it was not lawful to elect two patricians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that the same reason applied to Titus Manlius, in addition to the fact that he had refused and would refuse the offer of a consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> An extraordinary pair of consuls it would be, if they should link Marcus Livius with Gaius Claudius as his colleague. And mention of the matter, beginning with the fathers, was not frowned upon by the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The only one in the state who rejected it, accusing the citizens of inconsistency, was the man to whom the office was tendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He said that, having shown no pity toward a defendant in mourning, they were offering the whitened toga to a reluctant man; honours and penalties were being heaped upon the same person.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If they thought him a good man, why then had they condemned him as a bad man and a criminal? If they had found him a criminal, why then, after unfortunately entrusting a former consulship, were they now entrusting a second to him?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When he made use of these and similar arguments and complaints, the fathers would rebuke him, and by reminding him that Marcus Furius,<note>On Camillus and his restoration of Rome see V. li. 1 f.; VII. i. 9 Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Camillus</hi> xxx. 1.</note> on being recalled from exile, had restored his native city when driven from her place &mdash;that, as in the case of parents, so the harshness of one's native city must be appeased by suffering and bearing it &mdash;through
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> the united efforts of them all, they elected Marcus Livius consul with Gaius Claudius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the third day after that the election of praetors took place. Lucius Porcius Licinus, <pb id="p.351"/>Gaius Mamilius, Gaius Hostilius Cato and Aulus<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> Hostilius Cato were elected praetors. After completing the elections and holding the games, the dictator and master of the horse abdicated office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gaius Terentius Varro was sent into Etruria as propraetor, with the understanding that Gaius Hostilius should go from that province to Tarentum, to the army which Titus Quinctius, the consul, had had.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was decreed also that Lucius Manlius<note>Cf. iv. 4; 1.8; XXVI. xxiii. 1.</note> should cross the sea as an emissary and ascertain what was going on there; at the same time, inasmuch as the Olympic Festival was to be held that summer &mdash;and, as they said, it was observed by a great multitude of Greeks &mdash;if
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he could be safe from the enemy, he should go to that gathering, so that such Sicilians as were there as refugees on account of the war, or citizens of Tarentum banished by Hannibal, might return and know that the Roman people was restoring to them all the possessions which they had held before the war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Inasmuch as a very dangerous year seemed impending, and the state had no consuls, everyone turned to the consuls-elect and wished that as soon as possible they should cast lots for their provinces and settle in advance what province and what enemy each of them was to have. Also a reconciliation between them was discussed in the senate, Quintus Fabius Maximus taking the initiative.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Now between them was a well-known enmity, and for Livius his own downfall had embittered that enmity and made it more intolerable, because he believed that in that misfortune he had been treated with contempt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so he was the more deaf to entreaty, and kept saying they had no need to be reconciled; that in <pb id="p.353"/>every act each would show more spirit and alertness<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> for fear an unfriendly colleague might have the opportunity to gain at his expense.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless by the authority of the senate they were prevailed upon to lay aside their quarrels and to carry on the government with a common spirit and policy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The provinces assigned to them were not locally indistinguishable, as in the preceding years, but separated by the whole length of Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the one was assigned the land of the Bruttii and Lucania facing Hannibal, to the other Gaul facing Hasdrubal, who was reported to be already nearing the Alps. Whichever of them should receive Gaul in the allotment was to choose the army he preferred out of the two that were in Gaul and in Etruria and the one at the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consul to whom the land of the Bruttii should fall as his province was to enrol new legions for the city and take, at his own discretion, the army of one or the other of the consuls of the previous year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As for the army which was not taken by a consul, Quintus Fulvius, the proconsul, was to
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> take it, and his command was to be for one year. And for Gaius Hostilius, for whom they had made a change
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> of provinces, Tarentum in place of Etruria, they made a change of Capua instead of Tarentum. One legion was assigned to him, that which in the previous year Fulvius had commanded.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In regard to Hasdrubal's coming to Italy anxiety was daily increasing. First, ambassadors from Massilia<note>Livy, whose chronology gives Hasdrubal a whole year in Gaul, does not speak of Scipio's couriers sent to Rome; Zonaras IX. viii. 7.</note> had announced that he had passed over into Gaul, and that the Gauls
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> were aroused by <pb id="p.355"/>his coming,<note>His route from the western Pyrenees across Gaul is thought by some to have been a northerly one, as possibly indicated by mention of the Arverni at xxxix. 6; see p. 288, n. 2, but also p: 366, n. 2. Highly improbable is Jullian's theory (based upon a questionable interpretation of Silius Italicus XV. 494) that Hasdrubal wintered at Iliberris (Elne), hardly 15 miles from the eastern pass guarded by Scipio's detachment. More can be said for the historic low-level route Tolosa-Carcaso-Narbo, and then on the trail of Hannibal at least until the Rhone was reached. Cf. Jullian, <hi rend="italics">Histoire</hi> <hi rend="italics">de la Gaule</hi> I. 496; De Sanctis <hi rend="italics">I. c.</hi> 483.</note> because he was said to have brought a<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> great amount of gold in order to hire mercenaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After that, Sextus Antistius and Marcus Raecius, who were sent with them from Rome as ambassadors to look into the matter, had reported that with Massilians as guides they had sent men to ascertain all the facts through leading Gauls who were guestfriends of their guides, and to report;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that they had established that Hasdrubal with a huge army already concentrated would cross the Alps the next spring, and that at that time nothing else was detaining him than that the Alps were closed by the winter.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In place of Marcus Marcellus as augur Publius Aelius Paetus was elected and installed; and Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella was installed as <hi rend="italics">rex sacrorum</hi> in place of Marcus Marcius, who had died two years before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Also in the same year the lustration was completed<note>The usual phrase in describing the formal rite of purification with which the work of the censors came to an end; cf. I. xliv. 2, etc.</note> by the censors, Publius Sempronius Tuditanus and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Enrolled in the census were 137,108 citizens, a considerably smaller number than it had been before the war.<note>Ten years before, in the censorship of Flaminius and Aemilius Papus, the number of citizens had been over 270,000, almost twice as many; <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> XX.</note> In that year for the first time since Hannibal had invaded Italy it is recorded that
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the Comitium was covered,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> with awnings to protect the spectators at gladiatorial shows. For the same purpose Caesar covered the entire Forum; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N. H.</hi> XIX. 23.</note> and that the Roman Games were repeated for one day by the curule aediles, Quintus Metellus and Gaius Servilius. And at the <pb id="p.357"/>Plebeian Games there was a repetition for two days<note type="margin">B.C. 208</note> by order of Gaius Mamilius and Marcus Caecilius Metellus, plebeian aediles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And they likewise gave three statues at the Temple of Ceres. There was also a banquet for Jupiter on account of the festival.<note>As in XXV. ii. 10; XXIX. xxxviii. 8; XXX. xxxix. 8.</note></p> 
				<p>Later on Gaius Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> entered upon their consulship, the latter for the second time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Because as consuls-elect they had already cast lots for their provinces, they ordered the praetors to cast lots.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To Gaius Hostilius fell the city praetorship; the foreign praetorship also was assigned to him, to enable three praetors to go out to provinces.<note>Cf. Vol. VI. p. 346, n. 3, and 501, note.</note> Sardinia fell to Aulus Hostilius, Sicily to Gaius Mamilius, Gaul to Lucius Porcius. The total of the legions was twenty-three, divided as follows among the provinces:
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the consuls were each to have two legions, Spain four, each of three praetors was to have two, in Sicily and Sardinia and Gaul, Gaius Terentius to
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> have two in Etruria, Quintus Fulvius two in the land of the Bruttii, Quintus Claudius two in the vicinity of Tarentum and the Sallentini, Gaius Hostilius Tubulus one at Capua. Two city legions were to be enrolled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For the first four legions<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the legions to be assigned to the consuls,</note> the people elected the tribunes, to the rest of the legions tribunes were sent by the consuls.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the consuls set out there were nine days of rites,<note>Cf. note on XXVI. xxiii. 6.</note> because stones had rained from the sky at Veii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Following mention of one prodigy, as usual, others also were reported: that at Minturnae the Temple of Jupiter and the grove of Marica,<note>A goddess especially honoured here at the mouth of the Liris. There was a temple as well; Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Marius</hi> xxxix.</note> also at Atella the city wall and a gate had been struck by <pb id="p.359"/>lightning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To make it more terrible, the men of<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Minturnae added that there had been a river of blood in the gate. And at Capua a wolf had entered a gate at night and mangled a sentry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These prodigies were atoned for with full-grown victims, and a single day of prayer was observed by decree of the pontiffs. Then again the nine days of rites were repeated, because in the Armilustrum<note>An open space on the Aventine (near S.Sabina) where the purification of arms took place at an annual festival in October.</note> men saw a rain of stones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Relieved of their religious scruples, men were troubled again by the report that at Frusino there had been born a child as large as a four-year-old, and not so much a wonder for size as because, just as at Sinuessa two years before,<note>Cf. xi. 4 f.</note> it was uncertain whether male or female.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In fact the soothsayers summoned from Etruria said it was a terrible and loathsome portent; it must be removed from Roman territory, far from contact with earth, and drowned in the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They put it alive into a chest, carried it out to sea and threw it overboard. The pontiffs likewise decreed that thrice nine maidens should sing a hymn as they marched through the city.<note>In expiation of a similar portent seven years later a chorus of 27 maidens rendered a hymn. Livius Andronicus being dead, the poet was one Licinius Tegula; XXXI. xii. 9 f. Two other cases of this choral expiation of an <hi rend="italics">androgynus</hi> are reported from lost books of Livy by Julius Obsequens 34 and 36.</note> While they were in the Temple of Jupiter Stator, learning that hymn, composed by Livius the poet, the Temple of Juno the Queen on the Aventine was struck by lightning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That this portent concerned the matrons was the opinion given by the soothsayers, and that the goddess must be appeased by a gift;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> whereupon the matrons domiciled in the city of Rome or within ten miles of it were summoned by an edict of the curule aediles to the Capitol. And from their own number they themselves chose twenty-five, to whom they <pb id="p.361"/>should bring a contribution from their dowries.<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Out of that a golden basin was made as a gift and carried to the Aventine, and the matrons after due purification offered sacrifice.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>At once a day was appointed by the decemvirs for another sacrifice to the same goddess; and the order of procedure was as follows: from the Temple of Apollo<note>In the Campus Martius, between the gate and the Flaminian Circus; the only Apollo temple at Rome until the time of Augustus.</note> two white cows were led through the Porta Carmentalis into the city; behind them were carried two statues of Juno the Queen in cypress wood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then the seven and twenty maidens in long robes marched, singing their hymn in honour of Juno the Queen, a song which to the untrained minds of that time may have deserved praise, but now, if repeated, would be repellent and uncouth.<note>As the first known lyric by the very first poet writing at Rome the historian might have told his readers more about it. For the honour paid to Andronicus at the time v. Festus 446 L.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Behind the company of maidens followed the decemvirs wearing laurel garlands and purple-bordered togas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From the gate they proceeded along the Vicus Iugarius into the Forum. In the Forum the procession halted, and passing a rope from hand to hand the maidens advanced, accompanying the sound of the voice by beating time with their feet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then by way of the Vicus Tuscus and the Velabrum, through the Forum Boarium they made their way to the Clivus Publicius<note>Cf. XXVI. x. 6 and note.</note> and the Temple of Juno the Queen. There the two victims were sacrificed by the decemvirs and the cypress statues borne into the temple.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After due appeasement of the gods the consuls conducted the levy more vigorously and more strictly than anyone remembered its conduct in previous years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the terror of the war was doubled by the coming of a new enemy into Italy, <pb id="p.363"/>and also there were fewer young men from whom to<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> enlist soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly they compelled even the men of the seaboard colonies, who, it was said, had an exemption that could not be touched, to furnish soldiers. When they refused, the consuls named a date for them to report to the senate on what basis each state had exemption.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On that day these came before the senate: Ostia, Alsium, Antium, Anxur, Minturnae, Sinuessa, and from the Upper<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Adriatic; cf. Vol. VI., p. 131 and note.</note> Sea, Sena. Although each state<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> as represented by its legates. Each delegation probably produced its formula (cf. p. 245, n. 1).</note> read the evidence of its exemption, in no case except Antium and Ostia was exemption respected so long as the enemy was in Italy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and in the case of these colonies the younger men were made to swear that they would not pass the night outside the walls of their colony for more than thirty days, so long as the enemy was in Italy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>All the senators were indeed of the opinion that the consuls must take the field at the earliest possible moment. For they felt that Hasdrubal must be met as he came down from the Alps, to prevent his stirring up the Cisalpine Gauls or Etruria, which was already aroused to the hope of rebellion, and likewise that
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> Hannibal must be kept busy with a war of his own, that he might not be able to leave the country of the Bruttii and go to meet his brother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless Livius was hesitating, having small confidence in the armies of his provinces, while his colleague, he thought, had his choice between two excellent consular armies and a third army<note>No mention of this possibility is made at xxxv. 12 nor at xl. 14. This Claudius had two legions; xxxvi. 13.</note> which Quintus Claudius commanded at Tarentum. Livius had also mentioned a proposal to recall the slave volunteers<note>Cf. Vol. VI. p. 108, note; XXV. xx. 4; xxii. 3.</note> to their standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senate gave the <pb id="p.365"/>consuls unlimited power both to supplement from<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> any source they pleased, and to choose out of all the armies men whom they preferred, and to exchange them, and to transfer them from their provinces whithersoever they thought to the advantage of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All of this was done with the greatest harmony on the part of the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The slave volunteers were enrolled in the nineteenth and twentieth legions. Auxiliary forces of great strength, according to some of the authorities for this war, were sent from Spain as well to Marcus Livius by Publius Scipio, namely, eight thousand Spaniards and Gauls and two thousand legionary soldiers, one thousand eight' hundred cavalry, partly Numidians, partly Spanish.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They report that Marcus Lucretius brought these troops by sea; and that about three thousand archers and slingers were sent from Sicily by Gaius Mamilius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome the confusion was increased by the receipt of a letter from Gaul written by Lucius Porcius, the praetor, reporting that Hasdrubal had left his winter quarters and was already crossing the Alps;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that eight thousand Ligurians, enrolled and armed, would join him after he had crossed into Italy, unless some one should be sent into Liguria to forestall them by a war; that he would himself advance, so far as he thought safe, with an army that was not strong.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This letter constrained the consuls to complete the levy in haste and to leave for their provinces earlier than they had planned, with this intention, that each of them should keep an enemy in his province, and not allow them to come together and combine their armies in one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of the greatest assistance in that direction was Hannibal's <pb id="p.367"/>miscalculation. He had believed, indeed, that his brother<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> would come over into Italy that summer; but when he recalled what he had himself endured during five months, in crossing first the Rhone, and then the Alps, in conflicts with men and the nature of the country, he looked forward to a crossing by no means
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> so easy and so soon accomplished. This accounted for his slowness in leaving winter quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But for Hasdrubal everything moved more quickly and more easily than had been expected by himself and others.<note>So a fragment of Polybius, XI. i. 1; in two months (<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> from the time he left winter quarters) according to Appian <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 52.</note> For not only did the Arverni,<note>As to Hasdrubal's route across Gaul, we may not safely argue from the mention of this powerful tribe (really a widespreading confederacy) that he passed north of the Cevennes, through the home-country of the Arverni. Cf. Jullian, <hi rend="italics">Histoire</hi> <hi rend="italics">de la Gaule,</hi> I, 496, note 4..</note> and then in turn other Gallic and Alpine tribes, receive him, but they even followed him to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And not merely was he leading an army through country for the most part made passable by his brother's crossing,<note>Appian accepted, with Livy, the same route as had been followed by Hannibal. That route brought Hannibal down into the land of the Turin, according to Livy, XXI. xxxviii. 5 ff. Hence the inference that the pass was either Mont-Gen&eacute;vre or Mont-Cenis. Varro had placed Hasdrubal's pass farther north than that of Hannibal; cf. Servius on <hi rend="italics">Aeneid X.</hi> 13; De Sanctis <hi rend="italics">l. c.</hi> pp. 65 f., 561.</note> although previously trackless, but, thanks to the opening up of the Alps by twelve years of habitual use,<note>By whom Livy omits to state; certainly not by armies comparable to Hasdrubal's.</note> they were also crossing through tribes now less savagely disposed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For previously, being never seen by strange peoples and unaccustomed themselves to see a stranger in their own land, they were unfriendly to the human race in general. And at first, not knowing whither the Carthaginian was bound, they had believed that their own rocks and fastnesses and booty in cattle and men were the objects of attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then reports of the Punic war, with which Italy had been aflame for eleven years, had made it quite plain to them that the Alps were <pb id="p.369"/>merely a route; that two very powerful cities,<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> separated from each other by a wide expanse of sea and land, were contending for empire and supremacy.</p> 
				<p>These were the reasons which had opened the Alps for Hasdrubal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But what had been gained by the rapidity
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> of his march he lost by delaying before Placentia, in a futile blockade rather than a siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had believed that the storming of a town in the plain was easy, and the reputation of the colony had led him on, thinking that by the destruction of that city he would inspire great alarm in the others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Not only did he hinder himself by that siege, but he had kept back Hannibal, who was just preparing to leave winter quarters, on hearing so much sooner than he had expected news of his brother's crossing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For Hannibal recalled not only how slow was the besieging of cities, but also how vainly he had himself attempted to take that same colony, upon returning as a victor from the Trebia.<note>No such siege of Placentia was mentioned in XXI. lvii., lix., but only an unsuccessful attack upon its port.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The setting out of the consuls from the city in opposite directions, as though for two wars at the same time, had drawn men's anxious thoughts both ways, while they not only remembered what disasters the first coming of Hannibal had brought into Italy, but also were tormented by this anxiety: what gods were to be so kindly disposed to the city and the empire that the state should meet with success at the same time in both quarters?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was with a balancing of defeats so far by victories, they thought, that matters had dragged on up to that time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When in Italy at Trasumennus and Cannae the Roman state had gone down to defeat, victorious campaigns in Spain had saved her from falling.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Later, when in Spain one disaster after another had <pb id="p.371"/>partially destroyed two armies with the loss of two<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> extraordinary generals, many successes in Italy and Sicily had supported the tottering state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And the very distance, they said, in that one of the wars was fought in the remotest part of the world, had given time to recover breath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But now two wars had been admitted into Italy, two generals of the greatest celebrity were encircling the city of Rome, and upon one spot the whole mass, the entire weight of the danger had settled. Whichever of them was the first to win a victory would within a few days unite his camp with the other's. Alarm was caused also by the preceding year, saddened by the death of two consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Troubled by such anxieties men escorted the consuls as they parted, leaving for their provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is related that when Marcus Livius, still filled with resentment toward his fellow-citizens, was setting out for the war, and Quintus Fabius warned him not to engage the enemy rashly, before he had come to know their character, he replied that he would fight when he first caught sight of the enemy's column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the question was asked what reason he had for haste, he said, <quote>I shall win either great fame from the enemy, or from my defeated fellow-citizens a joy that surely is earned, even if not to my credit.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Before Claudius, the consul, reached his province, as Hannibal was leading his army along the very border of the territory of ...<note>Some town not far from Tarentum; cf. &sect; 12. Uria (chief town of the Sallentini), suggested by Madvig, was on the Via Appia, halfway between Tarentum and Brundisium. Cf. Strabo VI. iii. 6 f.</note> into the country of the Sallentini, Gaius Hostilius Tubulus with cohorts unencumbered by baggage attacked him and caused <pb id="p.373"/>terrible confusion in the straggling column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> slew about four thousand men and captured nine military standards. On hearing of the approach of the enemy, Quintus Claudius, who had his camps<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the winter stations among which his two legions were dispersed; xxxvi. 13. Note that Quintus Claudius is different from the consul Gaius Claudius Nero of section 13.</note> established near the various cities of the Sallentine territory, had left his winter quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Accordingly, not to engage two armies at the same time, Hannibal moved his camp out of the region of Tarentum by night and retired into the country of the Bruttii.<note>But in xl. 10 Hannibal had already taken the field. This statement is evidently from a different source.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Claudius turned his column into the territory of the Sallentini, while Hostilius on his way to Capua met the consul Claudius near Venusia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There forty thousand infantry and twenty-five hundred horsemen were selected from both their armies, that with them the consul might campaign against Hannibal, As for the rest of the forces, Hostilius was ordered to lead them to Capua, to be handed over to Quintus Fulvius, the proconsul.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, after concentrating the army which he had kept in winter quarters or garrisons in the land of the Bruttii, came to Grumentum<note>An important town in the interior, with a large territory; cf. XXIII. xxxvii. 10.</note> in Lucania, in the hope of recovering the towns which out of fear had gone over to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Roman consul hastened from Venusia to the same place, reconnoitring as he advanced, and pitched camp about fifteen hundred paces from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Carthaginians' earthwork seemed almost in contact with the walls of Grumentum; the distance was only five hundred paces. Between the Punic camp and the Roman lay a plain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Bare hills overhung the left flank of the Carthaginians and the right flank of the Romans, without arousing <pb id="p.375"/>suspicions for either army, because they had no woods nor<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> any hiding-places for an ambush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the plain between them charges starting from outposts brought on engagements not important enough to be mentioned. It was evident that the Roman general's only object was not to allow the enemy to get away. But Hannibal in his eagerness to make his way out of the place would go down into battle-line with all his forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the consul, using the enemy's talent, all the more readily that on such exposed hills ambuscades could not be feared, commanded five cohorts, with five maniples in addition, to cross over the ridge in the night, and to post themselves on the farther side of the hills.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As to the time for them to rise from ambush and attack the enemy he instructed Tiberius Claudius Asellus, tribune of the soldiers, and Publius Claudius, prefect of the allies, officers whom he was sending with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At daybreak he himself led out all his forces, infantry and cavalry, into battle-line. A little later the signal for battle was set up by Hannibal also, and a shout was raised in the camp as the men rushed in all directions to get their arms. Then cavalry and infantry in rivalry dashed out of the gates and, scattering over the plain, made haste to reach the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On seeing their disorder, the consul ordered Gaius Aurunculeius, tribune of the soldiers of the third legion, to send out the cavalry of the legion with all possible momentum against the enemy, saying that they had scattered so
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> widely, like sheep, in disorder over the whole plain that they could be routed and crushed before they were drawn up in line.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not yet had Hannibal left the camp when he heard the shouting of the combatants. <pb id="p.377"/>Accordingly, being summoned by the uproar, he rapidly<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> moved his troops up to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Already the foremost had been seized with the panic caused by the cavalry. Of the Roman infantry also the first legion and the right <hi rend="italics">ala</hi><note>Cf. i. 7 and note.</note> were coming into battle. In disorder the enemy engaged, just as chance brought a man face to face with either a foot-soldier or a horseman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The battle was enlarged by the reserves and increased by the numbers of men rushing into the fray.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And while his men were actually fighting, in spite of the uproar and the panic, Hannibal would have drawn them up &mdash;a thing not easy except in a veteran army and for a veteran commander &mdash;if
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> from the rear the sound of the shouting cohorts and maniples, as they dashed down the hillsides, had not inspired the fear of being cut off from the camp. Thereupon they were panic-stricken and flight began on all sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And the slaughter was less only because the nearness of the camp shortened flight for the routed. For the cavalry clung close to their rear; on the flank the cohorts, charging down the slope of the hills by an open, easy road, had attacked them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> However, more than eight thousand men were slain, more than seven hundred captured; nine military standards were taken. Of the elephants also, of which no use had been made in a battle sudden and disorderly, four were slain, two captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> About five hundred Romans and allies fell although victorious.</p> 
				<p>On the next day the Carthaginian remained inactive. The Roman led his forces out into line, and on seeing that no standard-bearer was advancing against him, ordered the spoils of the fallen enemies to be gathered and the bodies of his own men to be <pb id="p.379"/>brought together and buried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then for several<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> days in succession he came up so close to the gates
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> that he almost seemed to be advancing into the camp, until at the third watch Hannibal set out, leaving numerous fires and tents in that part of the camp which faced the enemy, also a few Numidians to show themselves on the earthwork and at the gates; and he pushed on toward Apulia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When day dawned, the Roman line came up to the earthwork, and the Numidians showed themselves a while, as arranged, at the gates and on the wall; then after deceiving the enemy for sometime, riding at full speed they overtook their own column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consul, perceiving the stillness in the camp and not seeing anywhere even the few men who at daybreak had been strolling about, sent two horsemen in advance into the camp to reconnoitre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then, once it had been ascertained that everything was quite safe, he ordered an advance into the camp. And after lingering there only long enough for the soldiers to scatter for plunder, he then sounded the recall, and long before nightfall led his troops back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Setting out at dawn on the next day, in forced marches he followed reports of the enemy's column and its tracks and overtook them not far from Venusia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There also there was a disorderly battle; over two thousand Carthaginians were slain. Then, marching by night and in the mountains, to give no opportunity for battle, the Carthaginian made for Metapontum.<note>His only object apparently was to reinforce his army.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Thereupon Hanno, who had commanded the garrison of that place, was sent with a few men into the land of the Bruttii to muster a fresh army. Hannibal added Hanno's troops to his own, returned to Venusia by the same route by which he <pb id="p.381"/>had come, and proceeded thence to Canusium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Nero<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> had never left the enemy's heels and, when setting out himself for Metapontum, he had summoned Quintus Fulvius into Lucania,<note>Later evidently to the camp near Canusium to face Hannibal, though Livy does not mention it; cf. p. 384, n. 1.</note> in order that that region should not be without troops.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Hasdrubal, after abandoning the siege of Placentia, sent four Gallic horsemen and two Numidians with a letter to Hannibal. When they had already traversed nearly the whole length of Italy through the midst of the enemy, in following Hannibal as he withdrew to Metapontum they came by
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> roads of which they were uncertain to Tarentum and were brought by Roman foragers who roamed about the country to Quintus Claudius, the propraetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first they tried to confuse him by vague answers, but when the fear of torture was brought to bear and compelled them to admit the truth, they informed him that they were carrying a letter from Hasdrubal to Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Together with the letter, still sealed as it was, they were turned over to Lucius Verginius, tribune of the soldiers, to be conducted to Claudius, the consul.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Gaius Claudius Nero.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time two troops of Samnites were sent as an escort. When they had reached the consul, and the letter had been read by an interpreter and the captives questioned, Claudius thereupon judged that the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> situation of the state was not such that they should carry on the war by routine methods, each consul within the bounds of his own province, operating with his own armies against an enemy prescribed by the senate.<note>For the present emergency, however, traditional methods had been set aside and the senate had given the consuls <hi rend="italics">carte</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Rather must he venture to improvise something unforeseen, unexpected, something which in the beginning would cause no less alarm among citizens than among enemies, but if accomplished would convert <pb id="p.383"/>great fear into great rejoicing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sending<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Hasdrubal's letter to the senate at Rome, he likewise informed the conscript fathers what he was himself intending to do. In view of Hasdrubal's writing to his brother that he would meet him in Umbria,<note>Meaning that part of Umbria which lies east of the Apennines along the Adriatic between the Rubico and the Aesis rivers, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Ager Gallicus. He expected Hannibal to follow the coast until they met.</note> the consul advised the senate to summon a legion from Capua to Rome, to conduct a levy at Rome, to confront the enemy at Narnia<note>Here were two legions, from which no doubt various detachments had been sent up to the Via Flaminia, even as far as the pass, we must presume (cf. p. 407, n. 1), about 25 miles from the Adriatic.</note> with the city troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In such terms he wrote to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He sent also messengers in advance through the regions of Larinum, of the Marrucini, the Frentani, the Praetutii, along the line of his proposed march, that they should all carry from the farms and the cities provisions, ready for the soldiers to eat, down to the road, and should bring out horses and mules as well, that the weary might have no lack of vehicles. As for himself, out of the whole army he chose the best soldiers, citizens and allies, six thousand infantry, a thousand cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He announced that he intended to seize the nearest city in Lucania and its Carthaginian garrison; that they must all be ready for the march. Setting out at night, he changed his direction to that of Picenum.<note>The distance to be traversed (Canusium to Sena Gallica) was nearly 250 miles.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The consul in reality was leading his army to his colleague by the longest of forced marches, having left Quintus Catius, his lieutenant, to command the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome there was no less panic and confusion than there had been four years before,<note>Cf. XXVI. ix. 6 ff., x.</note> when <pb id="p.385"/>a Carthaginian camp had been pitched before the<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Roman walls and gates. Nor was it quite clear to men's minds whether they should praise or blame so bold a march on the part of the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was plain that it would be praised or blamed according to the outcome, than which nothing is more unjust. They said that the camp had been left near an enemy who was Hannibal, without a general, with an army from which had been detached all its strength, all its flower.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And the consul had indicated a march into Lucania, whereas he was heading for Picenum and Gaul, leaving a camp that was defended by nothing more than the deception of the enemy, who was unaware that the general and a part of his army were not there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What was to happen, if that became known and Hannibal should wish either with his whole army to pursue Nero, who had set out with only six thousand armed men, or else to attack the camp, abandoned to plunder, without proper forces, without its high command, without the auspices?<note>As a matter of fact the Roman forces left behind near Canusium probably numbered 30,000, including the legions commanded by one of the most capable generals, Q. Fulvius Flaccus, a proconsul. And as a reserve there were two more legions near Tarentum.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The earlier disasters in that war, the death of two consuls in the preceding year, were still terrifying. And they said that all those misfortunes had befallen them when the enemy had but a single general, a single army, in Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At present it had become two Punic wars, two mighty armies, two Hannibals, so to speak, in Italy. For Hasdrubal also was a son of the same father, Hamilcar, and an equally strenuous commander, trained for so many years in Spain by a war with Romans, famous too for a double victory, the destruction of two armies and generals of great distinction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Certainly of the swiftness of his march from Spain, and of having aroused the Gallic tribes to war he could boast far more than Hannibal <pb id="p.387"/>himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For he had gathered an army in the very<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> region in which Hannibal had lost the larger part of his forces by hunger and cold, the most pitiable forms of death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Furthermore, men acquainted with events in Spain repeatedly added that he would encounter in Gaius Nero no unknown general, but one whom he, when himself surprised, as it happened, in a difficult pass, had baulked and baffled like a child by the pretence of drawing up terms of peace.<note>Cf. XXVI. xvii. 5 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They reckoned all the enemy's forces even larger, their own less, than they were, since fear is an interpreter always inclined to the worse side.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nero, now that he had already made his distance from the enemy such that it was quite safe to reveal his plan, briefly addressed his soldiers. He said that no plan of any general had been in appearance more reckless, but in fact safer, than his. He was leading them to certain victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For inasmuch as his colleague had set out for the war only when infantry and cavalry forces had been furnished by the senate to his own satisfaction &mdash;larger
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> forces and better equipped than if he were marching even against Hannibal &mdash;if they should themselves with their troops add ever so small a makeweight, they would change the whole situation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The mere report along the battle-line &mdash;for he would see to it that they did not hear sooner &mdash;that a second consul and a second army had arrived would put their victory beyond a doubt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hearsay,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> reports, even unfounded, crystallized into prevailing impressions or popular opinion, and so determining morale. So <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Seneca <hi rend="italics">Epist.</hi> xiii. 8; cf. XXXIV. xii. 4.</note> he said, decides a war and slight influences move men in the direction of hope and fear. Of the glory at least to be derived from success they <pb id="p.389"/>would themselves reap almost the whole benefit.<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Always what was the last to be added is felt to have brought with it the whole issue. They themselves could see by what throngs of people, by what admiration, by what approval, their march was acclaimed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And in fact they were marching everywhere between lines of men and women who had poured out from the farms on every side, and amidst their vows and prayers and words of praise. Defenders of the state men called them, champions of the city of Rome and of the empire. In their weapons and their right hands, they said, were placed their own safety and freedom, and those of their children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They kept imploring all the gods and goddesses that the soldiers might have a successful march, a favourable battle, a prompt victory over the enemy, and that they might themselves be obliged to pay the vows they had made on their behalf;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that, just as they were now anxiously escorting them, so after a few days they might with rejoicing go to meet them in the exultation of victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then they vied with each other in invitations and offers and in importuning them to take from them in preference to others whatever would serve the men themselves and their beasts; they heaped everything upon them generously.<note>The scene recalls one more briefly pictured in XXVI. ix. 5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The soldiers competed in self-restraint, not to take more than they needed. There was no loitering, no straggling, no halt except while taking food; they marched day and night; they gave to rest hardly enough time for the needs of their bodies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And men had been sent in advance by Nero to his colleague, to announce their coming and to inquire whether he wished them to come secretly or openly, <pb id="p.391"/>by day or by night, to establish themselves in the same<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> camp or in another. It was thought best<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> by Livius.</note> that they should enter by night in secret.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Orders<note>With the countersign (on a wooden tablet) were sent out orders for the night; VII. xxxv. 1; IX. xxxii. 4; XXVIII. xiv. 7. Cf. Polybius VI. xxxiv. 7 ff.</note> had been sent by Livius, the consul, throughout the camp that tribune should receive tribune, centurion centurion, horseman horseman, foot-soldier foot-soldier;<note>Livius' army was very much larger than Nero's 7,000 plus the volunteers who had joined them on the march.</note> for to enlarge the camp was not to the purpose, he said, lest the enemy should know of the arrival of the other consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And to crowd in larger numbers of men in cramped quarters was to prove easier, because Claudius' army had brought with it on its expedition hardly anything besides its arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But in the very course of the march the column had been enlarged by volunteers; for not only did old soldiers who had already completed their service offer themselves of their own motion, but also young men who had vied with each other in giving in their names and whom Claudius had enrolled whenever their physical appearance and sound condition seemed suitable for military service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul's camp was near Sena,<note>Modern Senigallia (or Sinigaglia), directly on the sea, but with no harbour. 15 miles beyond (north-west) was the mouth of the river Metaurus, and at Fanum, less than two miles farther on, the Via Flaminia, coming from Ariminum, turned inland up the valley of the river and went on its way over the Apennines. No sufficient reason has been given for disputing Livy's statement that the camps were near Sena, as do some of the critics. See pp. 396 f., note.</note> and about five hundred paces away was Hasdrubal. Accordingly, as he was now approaching, Nero came to a halt under cover of the hills, in order not to enter the camp before night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Silently they entered, each man being led to his tent by one of the same rank, and they were hospitably welcomed with great <pb id="p.393"/>general rejoicing. On the next day a council of war<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> was held, at which Lucius Porcius Licinus, the praetor, was present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His camp adjoined that of the consuls, and before their arrival he had baffled the enemy by all the arts of war, leading his army on high ground, while at one time he would occupy a narrow pass, to block their way, at another would make sudden attacks upon the column from the flank or the rear.<note>But he had been unable appreciably to retard Hasdrubal's southward march.</note> And now he was present at the council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The opinions of many inclined in the direction of postponing the time for battle, until Nero should refresh his troops, worn by the march and lack of sleep, and at the same time should take a few days to acquaint himself with the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But Nero began not merely to urge, but by all means also to implore them not to make his plan, which rapid movement had made safe, a reckless plan by delaying.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was by a deception which would not last long, he said, that Hannibal, as though dazed, was not attacking his camp, left without its commander, and had not set his army in motion to pursue him; that before Hannibal should bestir himself, they could destroy Hasdrubal's army and return to Apulia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Whoever by delaying gave the enemy time, was betraying the distant camp to Hannibal, at the same time opening the way into Gaul, so that unmolested he might join Hasdrubal whenever he pleased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At once, he said, the signal must be given and they must go out into battle-line and take advantage of the deception of their enemies, both the distant and those near at hand, while the one army was unaware that it had to do with smaller numbers, and the other that it had to deal with larger and stronger forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Dismissing the council they raised <pb id="p.395"/>the signal for battle and forthwith went out into<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> battle-line.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Already the enemy were standing in line before the camp. Delay in beginning the battle was due to Hasdrubal, in that, riding out in front of the standards with a few horsemen, he observed among the enemy old shields which he had not seen before and very lean horses; and he thought the numbers also larger than was usual.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For, suspecting what had happened, he promptly sounded the recall and sent men to the river from which the Romans were drawing water, that some Romans might be captured there and scanned to see whether any chanced to be more sunburned, as though from a recent march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the same time he ordered men to ride round the camps at a distance, and to notice whether the earthworks had been somewhere enlarged, and to mark whether the trumpet sounded once in the camp or twice.<note>Cf. Zonaras IX. ix. 8. At supper-time the trumpets regularly sounded outside the general's tent as a signal to post the guards for the night; so Polybius XIV. iii. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All this having been duly reported, the fact that the camps had not been enlarged deceived him. There were two of them, as there had been before the coming of the second consul, one that of Marcus Livius, the other that of Lucius Porcius. In neither case had anything been added to the fortifications to give ampler space for the tents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The one thing that impressed an experienced general and one accustomed to a Roman enemy was their report that the trumpet had sounded once in the praetor's camp, twice in the consul's. There surely were two consuls, he thought, and sadly concerned he was how the one had got away from Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Least of all could he suspect the fact-that Hannibal had been baffled and baulked to such an extent that he did not know where was the <pb id="p.397"/>general, where was the army with which his camp<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> was formerly in contact.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Surely he had been deterred by no common disaster, and had not dared to pursue. Hasdrubal greatly feared that after all was lost he had himself come too late to assist, and that the Romans would have the same good fortune in Italy as in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At times he believed his own letter had not reached Hannibal, and that the consul, upon intercepting it, had made haste, in order to overpower him. Troubled by these anxieties, he had the fires put out and orders given at the first watch that they should pack up their baggage in silence, and then he commanded the standards to advance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the excitement and confusion of the night the guides were not closely watched, and one of them settled himself in a hiding-place he had previously determined upon, while the other swam across the river Metaurus, using a shallow place known to him. So the column, deserted by its guides, wandered at first about the country, and a considerable number, overcome by drowsiness and lack of sleep, threw themselves down anywhere and left few men with the standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hasdrubal ordered the standard-bearers to move along the bank of the river,<note>The right (south) bank must be meant. Had Hasdrubal been on the left bank the treachery of his guides would have been of no consequence. For he would simply have followed the Flaminian Way. Livy represents them as vainly seeking for a road; therefore they were on the south side of the Metaurus. Polybius' narrative at this point has not been preserved. It resumes with the battle formation (XI. i. 2). Cf. Frontinus I. i. 9; Zonaras IX. ix. 7-12; Appian <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 52; Valerius Max. VII. iv. 4; Kromayer and Veith, <hi rend="italics">Antike</hi> <hi rend="italics">Schlachtfelder</hi> III. 1. esp. 456 ff. and maps; De Sanctis, <hi rend="italics">Storia dei Romani</hi> III. 2. 491 ff. and 562 ff., but he places the battle on the <hi rend="italics">left</hi> bank and the camps at the mouth of the river, instead of near Sena. The left bank is preferred by the <hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi> also (VIII. 94 f.).</note> until daylight should disclose a road. And having made little progress, while describing blind circles along the bends and curves of the twisting stream he halted, intending to cross the river as <pb id="p.399"/>soon as daylight should show a favourable crossing.<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But inasmuch as the farther he marched away from the sea the higher were the banks that confined the stream, and hence he could not find a ford, by wasting the day he gave the enemy time to overtake him.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>First Nero with all the cavalry arrived, then Porcius with the light-armed caught up with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And while they made skirmishing attacks from every side and charged the weary column, and the Carthaginian, now abandoning a march which resembled a flight, was aiming to lay out a camp on the hill above the bank of the river, came Livius with
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> all the infantry forces, not in marching order, but formed and armed to begin the battle at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But after they had combined all their troops and the line had been drawn up, Claudius on the right wing,<note>So Polybius XI. i. 5, who makes no mention of Porcius.</note> Livius on the left, prepared for battle, while the command of the centre was assigned to the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hasdrubal, on seeing that he must fight, ceased fortifying his camp and placed his elephants in the front line before the standards. Flanking the elephants,<note>10 in number and in the centre, Polybius &sect; 3; 15 according to Appian <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 52.</note> on the left wing he placed the Gauls facing Claudius &mdash;not so much that he trusted them, as that he believed the enemy was afraid of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The right wing facing Marcus Livius he took for himself and his Spanish troops, and above all he rested his hopes on these veteran soldiers.<note>Polybius puts Hasdrubal in the centre, but makes him attack the Roman left wing; &sect;&sect; 3-5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Ligurians were placed in the centre behind the elephants. But the battle-line was deep rather than widely extended. A projecting hill shielded the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That part of the front which the Spaniards held clashed with the left wing of the Romans, whose <pb id="p.401"/>whole right wing extended beyond the fighting and<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> had nothing to do. The hill facing them prevented them from attacking either in front or on the flank.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Between Livius and Hasdrubal a mighty battle had begun, and a savage slaughter on both sides was in progress.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There both generals<note>Since Livius outranks Nero, he is here thought of as commander-in-chief.</note> were engaged, there the greater part of the Roman infantry and cavalry, there the Spanish troops, the old soldiers, acquainted also with the Roman mode of fighting, and the Ligurians, a hardy race of warriors. To the same place came the elephants, which had thrown the front lines<note><hi rend="italics">I.e. hastati</hi> and <hi rend="italics">principes,</hi> after which came the standards.</note> into confusion by their first charge and had by this time forced the standards back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then as the conflict and the shouting increased, they were no longer under control and roamed about between the two battle-lines,<note>Polybius stresses the confusion caused in both armies by the elephants; &sect; 9.</note> as though uncertain to whom they belonged, not unlike ships drifting without their steering-oars.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Claudius shouted to his soldiers, <quote>Why then have we covered so long a march at headlong speed?</quote> and endeavoured without success to lead his line up the hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thereupon, after discovering that they could not get to the enemy in that direction, he drew off a number of cohorts from the right wing, where he saw that they would be standing idly by instead of fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He led them round behind the battle-line,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> of the Romans; cf. Polybius &sect;&sect; 7, 10 f.</note> and to the surprise not only of the enemy, but also of his own troops, charged into the enemy's right flank. And such was his speed that, soon after showing themselves on the flank, they were already attacking the rear. Thus from all sides, front, flank, rear, the Spaniards and Ligurians <pb id="p.403"/>were slain, and the slaughter had now reached the<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At that point there was the least fighting; for a large proportion of them were not with the standards, having slipped away in the night and lying asleep scattered over the fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And further, those who were present, being exhausted by marching and lack of sleep, lusty, but utterly lacking in endurance, could scarcely carry their arms on their shoulders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> And now it was midday, and thirst and heat exposed the gasping men to unlimited slaughter or capture.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>More of the elephants were slain by their own drivers<note>Indians, <hi rend="italics">id.</hi> XI. i. 12 (six elephants killed, four captured).</note> than by the enemy. These used to have a carpenter's chisel and a mallet. When the beasts began to grow wild and to dash into their own men, the keeper would place the chisel between the ears, precisely at the joint which connects the neck with the head, and would drive it in with all possible force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That had been found to be the quickest means of death<note>This discovery is not mentioned by Polybius.</note> in a brute of such size, when they got beyond the hope of control. And the first man to introduce the practice had been Hasdrubal, a general who was often notable at other times, but pre-eminently in that battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was he that by encouraging them and sharing the same dangers sustained his men in battle; he that fired them, now by entreating, now by upbraiding, the exhausted and those who because of weariness and over-exertion were giving up; he that recalled those who tried to flee and at not a few points revived the battle they were abandoning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Finally, when fortune unquestionably was on the enemy's side, in order not to survive so large an army that had followed his fame, he spurred his horse and <pb id="p.405"/>charged into a Roman cohort. There, in a manner<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> worthy of his father Hamilcar and of Hannibal his brother, he fell fighting.<note>Polybius pays a high tribute to Hasdrubal as a general and as a man; XI. ii.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Never in a single battle of that war were so many of the enemy slain, and a disaster equal to that of Cannae, whether in the loss of the general or that of an army, seemed to have been inflicted in return.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fifty-six thousand<note>Livy's high figures for the losses on both sides (cf. &sect; 7) must be contrasted with those of the Greek historian &mdash;10,000 and 2,000 respectively; ch. iii. 3.</note> of the enemy were slain, fifty-four hundred captured. Great was the rest of the booty, both of every kind and of gold and silver as
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> well. In addition, Roman citizens &mdash;over four thousand of them &mdash;who as captives were in the hands of the enemy were recovered. This was some compensation for the soldiers lost in the battle. For the victory was by no means
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> bloodless. About eight thousand Romans and allies were slain, and to such an extent were even the victors sated with bloodshed and slaughter that on the next day, when word was brought to Livius, the consul, that the Cisalpine Gauls and Ligurians, who either had not been present in the battle, or had escaped in the midst of the carnage, were moving away in one column, with no trustworthy guide, no standards, no formation or high command, that they all
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> could be wiped out, if a single regiment of cavalry should be sent, the consul said, <quote>No! let there be some survivors, to carry the news both of the enemy's disaster and of our valour.</quote><note>Livy omits mention of a temple to Iuventas vowed on this day by Livius.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nero on the night following the battle set out<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> for Apulia, and with a column moving more rapidly than when he had come from that region, reached his permanent camp and the enemy on the sixth day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His march was attended by smaller throngs, because no messenger had come in advance, but by rejoicing so great that people were almost beside themselves for joy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Rome, of course, neither state of feeling can be sufficiently described and set forth, neither that in which the city had waited in suspense for the outcome, nor that in which it heard news of the victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not once in all the days since it was first reported that Claudius, the consul, had set out did a senator leave the Senate House and the magistrates from sunrise to sunset, nor did the people leave the Forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The matrons, being in themselves unable to help, resorted to prayers and supplications, and wandering from one to another of all the temples, importuned the gods with entreaties and vows.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While the city was in a state of such anxiety and suspense, came first a vague rumour that two horsemen of Narnia, coming from the battle, had reached the camp which had been placed to guard the gateway of Umbria,<note>The pass of Furlo, Intercisa of the Itineraries; cf. xliii. 9.</note> reporting that the enemy had been cut to pieces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And at first men had heard it, rather than taken it in, as something too great and too joyous for them to grasp and quite believe. And the promptness was in itself an obstacle to belief, in that the battle was said to have been fought but two days before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then came a letter sent by Lucius Manlius Acidinus from the camp in regard to the arrival of the Narnian horsemen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This letter, carried through the <pb id="p.409"/>Forum to the tribunal of the praetor,<note>Until Gaius Hostilius could make his way to the Curia there could be no session of the senate.</note> brought the<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> senate out of the Curia. And with such rivalry and disorder did the people rush up to the doors of the Curia that the messenger could not get near, but was jostled by men asking questions and shouting that the letter should be read from the Rostra before the reading in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Finally the rioters were pushed aside and restrained by magistrates, and the joy could be successively imparted to men unable to contain it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The letter was read in the senate first, then in the assembly; and, according to each man's temperament, some felt a delight already well founded, others would have no assurance until they should hear the emissaries or a letter from the consuls.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next came word that the emissaries themselves were approaching. Then in truth all ages ran to meet them, everyone eager to be the first to take in a joy so great with eyes and ears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> An unbroken column reached all the way to the Mulvian Bridge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The emissaries, who were Lucius Veturius Philo, Publius Licinius Varus and Quintus Caecilius Metellus, beset by a crowd of men of every class made their way into the Forum, while some were questioning the emissaries themselves, some their companions, as to what had happened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And whenever a man heard that the army of the enemy and their general had been slain, that the Roman legions were intact, the consuls safe, forthwith he would share his delight with others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After they had made their way with difficulty into the Senate House and with much more difficulty the crowd had been pushed aside, so as not to mingle with the senators, the letter was read in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the emissaries were led over into the <pb id="p.411"/>assembly.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> across the Comitium to the Rostra.</note> Lucius Veturius, after the reading of the<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> letter, himself set forth more clearly everything that had been done, with great approval and finally even shouting from the entire assembly, since they were barely able to contain their joy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then some hastened to one temple of the gods after another to return thanks, others to their homes, to share news so joyous with wives and children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate decreed that, whereas Marcus Livius and Gaius Claudius, the consuls, with their army safe, had slain the general and legions of the enemy, there should be a thanksgiving for three days. This thanksgiving was proclaimed before an assembly by Gaius Hostilius, the praetor, and observed by men and women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> All the temples were uniformly crowded for all three days, while the matrons in their richest garments, together with their children, being relieved of every fear, just as if the war were already finished,<note>And the once dreaded Hannibal seemed no longer to be in Italy (Polybius XI. iii. 6).</note> returned thanks to the immortal gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Even the financial situation of the state was changed by that victory, so that from that time on, just as if in peace, they ventured to carry on business with one another, selling and buying, lending money and repaying loans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Gaius Claudius, the consul, having returned to his camp, ordered the head of Hasdrubal, which he had kept with care and brought with him, to be thrown in front of the enemy's outposts,<note>For parallel examples v.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Hannibal, under the blow of so great<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> a sorrow, at once public and intimate, is reported to have said that he recognized the destiny of Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And moving his camp away, with the intention to concentrate in that most distant part of Italy, the land of the Bruttii, all the forces which he was unable to defend if widely scattered, he removed the whole body of citizens of Metapontum, whom he had summoned to leave their homes,<note>As Metapontum was close to the border of Apulia and dangerously near Tarentum; cf.

				<p>Gnaeus Fulvius, the proconsul, was slain with his army
					by Hannibal near Herdonea. With a happier outcome a
					battle was fought by Claudius Marcellus, the consul,
					against the same commander near Numistro. Hannibal
					thereupon withdrew by night. Marcellus pursued him
					and repeatedly bore heavily on him as he retreated, until
					he engaged. In the first battle Hannibal was the winner,
					Marcellus in the second. Fabius Maximus the father, as
					consul, recovered Tarentum by treachery. Claudius
					Marcellus and Titus Quinctius Crispinus, the consuls,
					having advanced from the camp to reconnoitre, were overpowered by Hannibal in an ambush. Marcellus was slain,
					Crispinus escaped. The ceremony of purification was
					completed by the censors. Listed in the census were
					137,108 citizens, from which number it was evident how
					many men the unfavourable fortune of so many battles
					had carried off from the Roman people. In Spain Scipio
					engaged with Hasdrubal and Hamilcar<note>An obvious error.</note> near Baecula and was victorious. A boy of royal birth and remarkable
					beauty, who had been captured with the rest of the spoils,
					was sent away to his maternal uncle Masinissa by Scipio
					with gifts. Hasdrubal, who with a fresh army had
					crossed the Alps to unite with Hannibal, was slain with
					56,000 men, and 5,400 were captured, under the command
					of Marcus Livius, the consul, but with no smaller share
					borne by Claudius Nero, the consul, who, after being
					assigned to confront Hannibal, had left his camp in such a
					way as to escape the enemy's notice, had set out with a
					picked force and overpowered Hasdrubal. The book
					contains in addition the operations successfully carried on
					by Publius Scipio in Spain and by Publius Sulpicius, the
					praetor, against Philip and the Achaeans.</p>
