			<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
				<p>This volume furnishes one span of a bridge ultimately to connect the Vth (1929) with the IXth
					(1935), that is, to link book XXII, the last of those
					translated by Professor Foster, with book XXXI,
					where the late Professor Sage began his work upon the
					Fourth Decade. In these three books (XXIII-XXV)
					are covered the years 216-<date value="-212">212 B.C.</date>, including the
					consequences of disaster at Cannae, also Capua
					taken, Syracuse besieged for two years and finally
					captured, and the successes of Publius and Gnaeus
					Scipio in Spain, until they were separately overwhelmed by numbers.</p>
				<p>For works dealing with this period of the Second
					Punic War the reader is referred to the <hi rend="italics">Cambridge</hi>
					<hi rend="italics">Ancient History,</hi> Vol. VIII, and the bibliographies for
					its chapters ii-iv, pp. 721 if. Lists so recent and so
					generally accessible make it unnecessary to insert
					here a bibliography, to supplement those already
					contained in Vols. V (pp. xiii ff.) and IX (p. xv ff.).
					A recent work of Professor Fabricius, of Copenhagen,
					correcting current errors in the topography of Syracuse, is discussed in the Appendix.</p>
				<p>The text here offered represents careful and oft-repeated consideration of its many problems. Obligations to a long line of previous editors, including
					Madvig, Weissenborn, H. J. M&uuml;ller, Riemann, are
					gratefully acknowledged. In particular every student
					of Livy is now constantly aware of his great indebtedness to the labours of the late Professors Walters and
					<pb id="p.viii"/>
					Conway, whose Oxford text edition reached a third
					volume in 1928 (books XXI-XXV). Every citation
					of the Puteanus made by them has been verified
					for the present volume by collation of the facsimile
					published by the Bibliotheque Nationale, with corrections in a very few instances.</p>
				<p>Limited space for critical notes on so small a page
					obviously forbade the inclusion of the mass of interesting conjectures, often of recent date, especially
					many of the plausible <hi rend="italics">supplementa</hi> suggested by
					Conway or Walters, where a short line (14-22 letters)
					may have been omitted in P or its archetype; also
					such emendations as Professor G. H. Hirst's <hi rend="italics">aries</hi> for
					<hi rend="italics">acies</hi> in XXIII. xvi. 12 (p. 54; <hi rend="italics">Classical Review</hi> XXV,
					109), or Professor E. H. Warmington's suggestion
					that in XXV. xxxvii. 11 (p. 480) <hi rend="italics">ad arma</hi> may originally have been directly followed by <hi rend="italics">ad portas,</hi> which
					in the MSS. and in our text follows the second <hi rend="italics">discurrunt,</hi> suspiciously repeated and hence, he thinks,
					to be omitted (as also <hi rend="italics">ac,</hi> which may have been
					inserted later before <hi rend="italics">velut</hi>).</p>
				<p>The translator is indebted to the publishers of the
					<hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi> for permission to use
					three maps from Vol. VIII, with such alterations
					as were deemed necessary. The map of Syracuse
					is based upon a large Italian sheet (Catania, 1931),
					with important additions and radical changes due
					chiefly to the map of the Danish historian Fabricius
					mentioned above.</p>
				<p>It may be added that this translation was begun,
					as it happened, at Syracuse, with the passages in
					XXIV and XXV dealing with the siege and capture
					of the city, and that such an opportunity was due
					to a second visit after an interval of forty years.</p>

			<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AFTER the battle of Cannae and the capture and<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> plunder of the camps, Hannibal had moved at once out of Apulia into Samnium, being invited into the land of the Hirpini by Statius Trebius, who promised that he would turn over Compsa to him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Trebius was a Compsan of high rank among his people, but opposed by the party of the Mopsii, a family made powerful by the favour of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the news of the battle of Cannae, and when the coming of Hannibal had been made known by utterances of Trebius, since the Mopsii had left the city, it was handed over to the Carthaginians without resistance and a garrison admitted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There Hannibal left all his booty and the baggage, divided his army, and ordered Mago either to take over such cities of that region as were deserting the Romans or to compel them to desert in case they refused.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He himself made his way through the Campanian region to the Lower Sea,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the Tuscan Sea; cf. xxxviii. 1.</note> intending to attack Neapolis, that he might have a seaport.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On entering the territory of the <pb id="p.5"/>Neapolitans, he stationed some of the Numidians in<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> ambush, wherever he conveniently could (and most of the roads are deep-cut and the turnings concealed). Other Numidians he ordered to ride up to the gates, making a display of the booty they were driving along before them from the farms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Against these men, because they seemed to be few in number and disorganized, a troop of cavalry made a sally, but being drawn into the ambush by the enemy's purposely retreating, it was overpowered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And not a: man would have escaped if the proximity of the sea and the sight of vessels, chiefly of fishermen, not far from the shore had not given those who could swim a way of escape.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> However a number of young nobles were captured or slain in that battle, among them, Hegeas, a cavalry commander, who fell as he rashly pursued the retreating.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From besieging the city the Carthaginian was deterred by the sight of walls such as by no means invited an attacker.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal then directed his march to Capua, which was pampered by its long-continued prosperity and the favour of fortune, but, along with the general corruption, especially from the licence of the common people, who enjoyed an unlimited freedom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As for the senate, Pacuvius Calavius, a noble who was at the same time of the people's party, but had gained his influence by base arts, had made it subservient both to himself and to the common people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He, being in their highest office,<note>He was called <hi rend="italics">medix tuticus;</hi> cf. xxxv. 13. For the defeat of Faminius at the Trasumennus cf. XXII. iv ff.</note> as is happened, in the year of the defeat at Lake Trasumennus, thought that the commons, long hostile to the senate, would use the opportunity of a revolution and dare to commit a great crime, namely, if Hannibal should come into the region with his victorious army, they would slay <pb id="p.7"/>the senators and hand over Capua to the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A bad man, but not utterly abandoned, he preferred to dominate a state still intact rather than one that had been wrecked, yet believed that none was intact if deprived of its deliberative body. He accordingly entered upon a scheme to save the senate and at the same time to make it submissive to himself and to the commons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Summoning the senate he began by saying that, unless it should prove necessary, a plan to revolt from the Romans would by no means have his approval, since he had
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> children by a daughter of Appius Claudius and had given a daughter in marriage to Marcus Livius at Rome. But, he went on to say, something much more serious and more to be dreaded was impending;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for the common people were not aiming to rid the state of the senate by a revolt, but by the massacre of the senate wished to hand over the republic, left helpless, to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From that danger he could free them if they should leave it to him, and, forgetting civil conflicts, trust him. When, overcome by fear, they unanimously left matters to him, <quote>I will shut you up,</quote> he said, <quote>in the Senate House and,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> just as if I were myself a sharer in the crime intended, by approving plans which it would be vain for me to oppose, I will find a way to save you. For this accept a pledge, as you yourselves desire.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having given the pledge he went out, ordered the Senate House to be closed and left a guard before the entrance, that no one might be able to enter the Senate House or leave it without his order.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then calling the people to an assembly he said: <quote>You have often desired, Campanians, to have the power to exact punishment from a base and <pb id="p.9"/>odious senate. That power you have, not by<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> riotously storming, with great danger to yourselves, the houses of individuals who defend them with garrisons of clients and slaves, but you have the power secure and unrestricted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As they are shut up there, every man of them, in the Senate House, seize them, left alone, unarmed!
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And do nothing in haste or at haphazard. I will give you the right to decide their fate in each separate case, so that each shall pay the penalty he has deserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But above all things you should vent your wrath with due regard to the conviction that your safety and advantage are worth more than wrath. For it is these senators that you hate, I think; it is not your wish to have no senate at all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In fact you must either have a king &mdash;save the mark! &mdash;or else a senate, the only deliberative body in a free state. And so you have two things to do at the same time &mdash;to do away with the old senate, and to choose a new one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I will order the senators to be called one by one and will consult you as to their fate. Whatever is your opinion in each case shall be done, but before punishment is inflicted on the guilty one you will choose in his place a brave and active man as a new senator.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then sat down, and after the names had been placed in the urn, he ordered the first name drawn by lot to be called and the man himself to be led out of the Senate House.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On hearing the name every man shouted his loudest, that he was a bad man and base and deserved punishment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Upon that Pacuvius said: <quote>I see what your verdict is in this man's case; therefore in place of a bad man and base nominate a good and just senator.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At first there was silence from their inability to suggest a better man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then when someone, <pb id="p.11"/>overcoming his timidity, named a man, at once there was<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> a much louder outcry, some saying they did not know him, others taunting him, now with shameful conduct, now with low rank and sordid poverty and the disreputable nature of his trade or business.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> All the more was this done in the case of the second and third senator called. So it was clear that people were dissatisfied with the man himself, but had no one to put in his place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For nothing was gained by once more naming the same men, who had been named only to be reviled. And the rest were much lower in rank and less known than those who first came to mind.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Accordingly men slipped away, saying that the most familiar evil is the most endurable, and bidding Pacuvius release the senate from confinement.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this way Pacuvius, having made the senate much more subservient to himself than to the common people by saving their lives, ruled without arms, as all now gave way to him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereafter the senators, forgetting their rank and freedom, flattered the common people, greeted them, invited them graciously, entertained them at well appointed feasts;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> invariably undertook cases, appeared as counsel, or as jurors gave a verdict, only for that side which was the more popular and better suited to win favour with the populace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover, nothing was done in the senate otherwise than if a meeting of the common people was being held there. The state had always been inclined to luxury,<note>Capua, prospering by its varied industries established by the Etruscans, was already noted for its wealth and a luxury greater than that of Croton and Sybaris; Polybius VII. i. 1 and III. xci. 6; Cicero <hi rend="italics">Leg. Agr.</hi> II. 95; cf. Strabo V. iv. 3.</note> not only from defects in character, but also from the abundant opportunity for indulgences and the beguilement of all the charms of sea and land.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But at that time, thanks to the servility of the leading men and the <pb id="p.13"/>licence of the common people, they were so<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> unrestrained that no limit was set to passion or to expense.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To their contempt for laws, the magistrates, the senate, there was now added, after the defeat at Cannae, their disparagement of the Roman power also, for which there used to be some respect.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All that held them back from at once revolting was that the long-established right of intermarriage had united many distinguished and powerful families with the Romans, and that,
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> although a considerable number were serving on the Roman side, the strongest bond was the three hundred horsemen, noblest of the Campanians, who had been chosen to garrison Sicilian cities by the Romans and sent thither.<note>As belonging to the most prominent families and dispersed among the cities of Sicily, they were in effect hostages.</note> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Their parents and relatives with difficulty carried their point, that representatives should be sent to the Roman consul.</p> 
			<p>These men found the consul not yet departed for Canusium, but with a few half-armed men at Venusia,<note>Immediately after the battle of Cannae; XXII. xlix. 14; liv. 1 and 6.</note> exciting the utmost pity in good allies, but contempt in the haughty and faithless, such as were the Campanians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And the consul increased the contempt for his situation and for himself by needlessly uncovering and laying bare the disaster.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For when the delegation had reported that the senate and the Campanian people were distressed that any reverse had befallen the Romans, and were promising everything that might be needed for the war, he said:
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>You, Campanians, have observed the customary manner of speaking to allies, in bidding me requisition whatever is needed for the war, rather than spoken conformably to the present state of our fortunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.15"/>For what has been left to us at Cannae, so that, as if<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> we had something, we may wish what is lacking to be made up by the allies? Are we to requisition infantry from you, as though we had cavalry? Are we to say that money is lacking, as if that alone were lacking? Nothing has fortune left us, even to supplement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Legions, cavalry, arms, standards, horses and men, money and supplies have vanished either in the battle or in the loss of two camps the next day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so you, Campanians, have not to help us in war, but almost to undertake the war in our stead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Recall how, when your ancestors were once confined in alarm within their walls, dreading not only the Samnite enemy but also the Sidicinian,<note>On the contrary, it was by aiding the Sidicinians against the Samnites that the Campanians became involved in the 1st Samnite War, <date value="-343">343 B.C.</date>; VII. xxix.</note> we took them under our protection and defended them at Saticula. Also how with varying fortunes we endured for almost a hundred years<note>Really seventy-one years. More rhetorical exaggeration in <hi rend="italics">propter vos,</hi> and especially in the following sentence.</note> the war begun with the Samnites on your account.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Add to this that upon your submission we gave you a fair treaty and your own laws, and finally &mdash;and before the disaster at Cannae this was certainly the greatest privilege &mdash;our citizenship to a large number of you and shared it with you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A share, then, Campanians, you should believe you have in this disaster which has befallen us, and should think that you must defend the country in which you have a share.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not with the Samnite or Etruscan is the struggle to have the power which has been wrested from us nevertheless remain in Italy. A Carthaginian enemy, not even of African origin, is dragging after him from the farthest limits of the world, from the strait of Ocean and the Pillars of Hercules, soldiers who <pb id="p.17"/>are unacquainted with any civilized laws and<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> organization and, one may almost add, language too.<note>So Polybius had said of Hannibal's polyglot troops, <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> XI. xix. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Ruthless and barbarous by nature and custom, these men have been further barbarized by the general himself, in making bridges and embankments of piled up human bodies, and by teaching them &mdash;horrible even to relate &mdash;to feed upon the bodies of men.<note>Livy makes Varro repeat exaggerated statements about Hannibal; cf. Appian <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 28.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> To see and have as our masters men who fatten upon these unspeakable feasts, men whom it is a crime even to touch, and to get our law from Africa and Carthage, and to allow Italy to be a province of the Numidians and the Mauri &mdash;who, if merely born in Italy, would not find that abominable?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> It will be a glorious thing, Campanians, if the Roman power, brought low by disaster, shall have been maintained and restored by your loyalty and your resources.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Thirty thousand foot-soldiers and four thousand horsemen can be enrolled from Campania, I believe. Moreover you have sufficient money and grain. If you have a loyalty to match your prosperity Hannibal will not be aware of his victory, nor the Romans of their defeat.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech of the consul the legates were dismissed, and on their way home Vibius Virrius, one of them, said the time had come when the Campanians could not only recover the territory formerly taken from them unjustly by the Romans, but could also gain authority over Italy. For they would make a treaty with Hannibal on their own terms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And there would be no doubt that, when Hannibal, upon the completion of the war, retired as victor to Africa and removed his army, authority over Italy would be left to the Campanians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Having agreed unanimously with these words of Virrius, they <pb id="p.19"/>made such a report of their embassy that the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> name seemed to all to have been blotted out.<note>Not so to Calavius' son; viii. 3 and 11.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At once the populace and most of the senate were aiming to revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But action was postponed for a few days by the weighty advice of the older men. Finally the view of the majority prevailed, that the same legates who had gone to the Roman consul should be sent to Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Before they went to him and' before the plan to revolt was settled upon, I find in some of the annals that legates were sent to Rome by the Campanians with the demand that, if they wished' them to aid the Roman state, one of the consuls should be a Campanian;<note>Cicero mentions this demand of Capua; <hi rend="italics">Leg. Agr.</hi> II. 95.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that resentment was aroused and the legates were ordered to be removed from the Senate House, and that a lictor was sent to lead them out of the city and bid them lodge that night outside of Roman territory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Because there was once a suspiciously similar demand made by the Latins,<note>That one of the consuls should be from Latium, <date value="-340">340 B.C.</date>, VIII. v. 5 and 7 (the threat of Manlius mentioned below, xxii. 7).</note> and Coelius and other historians had not without reason omitted the matter, I have been afraid to set this down as established.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The legates came to Hannibal and made an alliance with him on these terms: that no general or magistrate of the Carthaginians should have any authority over a Campanian citizen, and that no Campanian citizen should be a soldier or perform any service against his will;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that Capua should have its own laws, its own magistrates; that the Carthaginian should give the Campanians three hundred of the Roman captives of their own choosing, with whom there should be an exchange of the Campanian <pb id="p.21"/>horsemen who were serving in Sicily.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Such were the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> terms. In addition to what was agreed upon the Campanians perpetrated these misdeeds: the populace suddenly seized prefects of the allies and other Roman citizens, some of them employed in a military duty, some engaged in private business, and with the pretence of guarding them ordered them all to be confined in the baths, that there they might die a terrible death, being suffocated by the extreme heat.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Such conduct and the sending of an embassy to the Carthaginian had been opposed to the utmost by Decius Magius, a man who lacked nothing for the attainment of the highest authority except sanity on the part of the citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But when he heard that a garrison was being sent by Hannibal, recalling the haughty rule of Pyrrhus and the wretched servitude of the Tarentines as warning examples, he at first openly protested that the garrison should not be admitted;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> then, after it had been admitted, either that it should be driven out, or, if they wished to atone for their evil action in having revolted from their oldest allies and men of the same blood by a brave and notable act, that they should slay the Punic garrison and return to their Roman allegiance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this was reported to Hannibal (for it was not done in secret), he first sent men to summon Magius to him at the camp. Then when the latter replied with spirit that he would not go, for Hannibal had no authority over a Campanian citizen, the Carthaginian was enraged and ordered the man to be seized and brought before him in chains.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Later, fearing that in the use of force some commotion, and in view of the excitement some unpremeditated conflict, might occur, he first sent word to Marius Blossius, the <pb id="p.23"/>Campanian magistrate, that he would be in Capua the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> next day, and then he set out from the camp with a small escort.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marius, calling an assembly, ordered them to go out to meet Hannibal <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> with wives and children. This was done by all not only obediently but also eagerly, owing to the enthusiasm of the crowd as well and the desire to go and see a general already famous for so many victories.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Decius Magius neither went out to meet him nor remained in seclusion, by doing which he might show some fear due to conscience. He strolled idly in the market-place with his son and a few clients, although the whole city was astir to welcome and to see the Carthaginian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hannibal entered the city and at once demanded a session of the senate, and then when the leading Campanians begged him not to do any serious business that day, and that he should
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> himself cheerfully and willingly honour the day gladdened by his coming, though he was naturally hot-tempered, still in order not to deny them anything at the start, he spent a large part of the day in seeing the city.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He lodged at the house of the Ninnii Celeres, the brothers Sthenius and Pacuvius, men distinguished for their rank and wealth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To that house Pacuvius Calavius, of whom mention has been made above,<note>Chapters ii-iv.</note> leader of the party which had drawn the state to the side of the Carthaginians, came bringing his young son.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had got him away from the company of Decius Magius, with whom the son in the most confident spirit had stood up for the Roman alliance against a treaty with Carthage. And neither the decision of the state for the other side nor his father's high position had dislodged him from his opinion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Such was the young man to whom his father, rather <pb id="p.25"/>by pleading than by excusing, reconciled Hannibal,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> and he, prevailed upon by the father's prayers and tears, even ordered that the son should be invited
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> with the father to a dinner at which he was to have the company of no Campanian except his hosts and Vibellius Taurea, a distinguished soldier.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They began feasting by daylight, and the banquet was not according to Carthaginian custom or military regimen, but provided with all that tempts indulgence, as it was to be expected in a city, and a house as well, of wealth and luxury.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Calavius the son was the only one who could not be prevailed upon to drink either by the invitation of the owners or even, now and then, of Hannibal. He himself pleaded ill health as an excuse, while his father alleged distress of mind also, at which one could not wonder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> About sunset the son followed the elder Calavius coming out from the feast, and when they had reached a secluded spot &mdash;it
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> was a garden in the rear of the house &mdash;he said: <quote>I propose a plan, father, by which we may not only gain pardon from the Romans for our offence in having revolted to Hannibal, but as Campanians may be in a position of much greater respect and favour than we should ever have been otherwise.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the astonished father asked what that plan was, the son throwing his toga off his shoulder bared his side girt with a sword.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>Presently,</quote> he said, <quote>I will ratify a treaty with the Romans by the blood of Hannibal. I wished you to know that in advance, in case you should prefer not to be there when the deed is being done.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the old man saw and heard that, he was beside himself with fear, as if he were already present at the execution of the plan of which he was <pb id="p.27"/>being told, and said:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>I pray and implore you, my<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> son, by all the rights which link children to their parents, not to do and suffer all that is unutterable before the eyes of your father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is but a few hours since, with an oath by all the gods that exist and joining our right hands to his, we pledged our honour. Was it with the intention, as soon as we left the conference, to arm against him the hands hallowed by our plighted faith?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From the hospitable board, to which you were invited by Hannibal with but two other Campanians, do you rise with the intention of staining that very board with the blood of a guest?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Was I able as a father to reconcile Hannibal with my son, and can not reconcile my son with Hannibal? But assuming that there is nothing hallowed, no honour, no scruple, no filial devotion, dare to do unspeakable things, if they do not bring destruction to us as well as guilt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Single-handed will you attack Hannibal? What of that crowd, so many free men and slaves? What of all men's eyes fixed upon one man?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What of so many sword-hands? Will they be paralysed in the moment of that mad deed? Will you withstand Hannibal's own countenance, which armed forces have been unable to withstand, which the Roman people dreads? Supposing that help from others is lacking, will you bring yourself to strike <hi rend="italics">me,</hi> when I interpose my body in place of Hannibal's? And yet it is through my breast that you will have to attack him and run him through.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But allow yourself to be dissuaded here, rather than overpowered there. Let my prayers prove effectual with you, as they have proved this day for you.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Seeing the young man in tears he threw his arms about his waist, and repeatedly kissing him he did <pb id="p.29"/>not desist from entreaties until he had prevailed upon<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> him to put down his sword and give his pledge that he would do no such crime.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then the young man said: <quote>As for me, I will pay my father the debt of devotion which I owe to my country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For you I am sorry, for you will have to meet the charge of thrice betraying your country, once when you took part in the revolt from the Romans, a second time when you advised peace with Hannibal, a third time today when you are an obstacle and a hindrance to restoring Capua to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Do you, my country, take back the sword with which I had armed myself in your defence and entered this stronghold of the enemy; for my father wrests it from me.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Having thus spoken, he threw the sword over the garden wall into a street, and, that his conduct might not be open to suspicion, himself returned to the banquet.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day a full session of the senate was given to Hannibal. There his speech was at the outset very genial and kindly, thanking the Campanians for having preferred his friendship to a Roman alliance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And among his other magnificent assurances he promised them that Capua should soon be the capital of all Italy, and that from it the Roman people along with the rest of the nations should derive its law.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He said that <hi rend="italics">one</hi> man had no part in friendship with Carthage and the treaty made with himself, namely Magius Decius, a man who ought neither to be a Campanian nor to be so called; he demanded that the man be surrendered to him, and that in his own presence his case be brought up and a decree of the senate framed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All voted for that proposal, although it seemed to many of them that the man did not deserve that misfortune; also <pb id="p.31"/>that the right of liberty was being infringed by a first<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> act that was not insignificant.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Leaving the Senate House Hannibal took his seat on the tribune of the magistrates and ordered the arrest of Decius Magius, and that he be placed at his feet and make his defence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While with undaunted spirit Magius was saying that by the terms of the treaty he could not be compelled to do that, chains were put upon him and he was ordered to be led to the camp with a lictor following.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So long as they led him with bare head, he kept haranguing as he went, shouting to the crowd all about him: <quote>You have the freedom you wanted, Campanians. Through the middle of the market-place, in broad daylight, before your eyes, I, who am second to no one of the Campanians, am being hurried away in chains to my death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What deed of greater violence could be done if Capua had been taken? Go to meet Hannibal, decorate your city and make the day of his coming a holiday, &mdash;that you may witness this triumph over your fellow-citizen.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>As he was thus shouting and the populace seemed to be aroused, his head was covered and they were ordered to drag him more swiftly outside the gate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus he was led into the camp, at once put on shipboard and consigned to Carthage, for fear, if there should be some outbreak at Capua in consequence of the shameful act, the senate also might regret having surrendered a leading man, and, when an embassy was sent to demand his return, Hannibal either must offend his new allies by refusing their first request, or by granting it be obliged to keep at Capua a fomenter of insurrection and riots.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A storm carried the ship to Cyrenae, which was then subject to kings.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> of Egypt. Ptolemy IV Philopator was then reigning; XXIV. xxvi. 1.</note> On fleeing for refuge to the statue of <pb id="p.33"/>King Ptolemy there, Magius was carried under guard<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> to Ptolemy at Alexandria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And having informed him that he had been bound by Hannibal contrary to his treaty rights, he was freed from his chains and allowed to return to Rome or to Capua, as he might prefer.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Magius said that Capua was unsafe for him, and on the other hand, at a time when there was a war between the Romans and the Campanians, Rome would be the abode of a deserter rather than of a guest; that he had no wish to live elsewhere than in the land of a king in whom he found the giver and defender of his freedom.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on, Quintus Fabius Pictor<note>He had been sent to Delphi after the battle of Cannae; XXII. lvii. 5. His history, written in Greek, was one of Livy's sources.</note> returned to Rome from his embassy to Delphi and read from a manuscript the response of the oracle. In it were indicated the gods and goddesses to whom offerings should be made, and in what manner.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It continued: <quote>If you do thus, Romans, your situation will be better and easier, and your state will go on more in accordance with your desire, and the Roman people will have the victory in the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When you have successfully administered and preserved your state, from the gains made you shall send a gift to Pythian Apollo and do honour to him out of the booty, the profits and the spoils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> You shall keep yourselves from exulting.</quote> After reading these words translated from the Greek verses, he went on to say that, on coming out of the oracle, he had at once made offerings to all those divinities with incense and wine;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> also that he had been bidden by the high-priest of the temple, just as he had come to the oracle and also conducted the rite while wearing a garland of laurel, so also to wear the garland when he boarded the ship, and not to lay <pb id="p.35"/>it aside until he should reach Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Further, that<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> he had carried out with the utmost scrupulosity and care all the instructions given him, and had then laid the wreath upon the altar of Apollo at Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate decreed that at the first opportunity those rites should be duly observed with prayers.</p> 
			<p>While these things were happening at Rome and in Italy, Mago, the son of Hamilcar, had come to Carthage to report the victory at Cannae. He had not been sent by his brother directly from the battle, but had been detained for some time in taking over the Bruttian states which were revolting.<note>Livy possibly mentioned others besides the Bruttii. In i. 4 Mago is in Samnium for the same purpose.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accorded a hearing in the senate, he set forth the achievements of his brother in Italy: that he had fought pitched battles with six high commanders, of whom four were consuls,<note>Five consuls had been defeated by Hannibal: Scipio (Ticinus), Sempronius (Trebia), Flaminius (Trasumennus) Paulus and Varro (Cannae). As Scipio was the wounded consul of &sect;9, it must be Sempronius who is here omitted. Yet elsewhere much is made of the battle of the Trebia (xviii. 7; xlv. 6). A copyist may have written <hi rend="italics">viimperatoribus</hi> instead of <hi rend="italics">viiimperatoribus.</hi> That done, the change of <hi rend="italics">v</hi> to <hi rend="italics">iv</hi> (same line and &sect;9) would be an effort to make the figures tally.</note> and two a dictator and a master of the horse,<note>Fabius Maximus, the Cunctator, and Minucius Rufus. Both are included among the defeated generals in spite of what is said in regard to the dictator in &sect;10.</note> in all with six consular armies;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that he had slain over 200,000 of the enemy and captured over 50,000;<note>Exaggerated figures in both cases.</note> that of the four consuls he had slain two;<note>Flaminius and Aemilius Paulus.</note> of the other two one had fled wounded,<note>Scipio at the Ticinus.</note> the other with barely fifty men, after losing his entire army;<note>Terentius Varro.</note> that the master of the horse, whose power is that of a consul, had been routed and put to flight;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that the dictator was accounted an extraordinary general because he never ventured into battle-line;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that the Bruttians and Apulians and some of the Samnites and Lucanians had revolted to the Carthaginians; that <pb id="p.37"/>Capua, which was the capital not only of Campania,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> but, since the blow inflicted upon the Roman state by the battle of Cannae, of Italy also, had surrendered to Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For these victories, so many and so great, it was proper, he said, that gratitude be expressed and felt toward the immortal gods.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then in evidence of such successes he ordered the golden rings to be poured out at the entrance of the Senate House. And so great was the heap of them that, when measured, they filled, as some historians assert, three pecks and a half.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The prevailing report, and nearer the truth, is that there was not more than one peck. Then, that it might be proof of a greater calamity, he added in explanation that no one but a knight, and even of the knights only those of the higher class, wore that token.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The main point of his speech was that the nearer Hannibal came to realizing his hope of ending the war, the more necessary it was to help him by every means. For his campaigning was far from home, in the midst of the enemy's country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A large amount of grain and money was being consumed, he said, and though so many battles had destroyed the enemy's armies, still they had considerably diminished the forces of the victor as well.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore they must send reinforcements, they must send money to pay them and grain to soldiers who had deserved so well of the Carthaginian nation.</p> 
			<p>After these words of Mago, while all were rejoicing, Himilco, a man of the Barca party, thought it an opportunity to rebuke Hanno.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>Tell me, Hanno,</quote> he-said, <quote>is it still to be regretted that we undertook a war against the Romans? Order the surrender of Hannibal!
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the midst of such successes forbid the <pb id="p.39"/>rendering of thanks to the immortal gods! Let us<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> listen to a Roman senator in the Carthaginian 'Senate House.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon Hanno said: <quote>I should have remained silent to-day, members of the senate, for fear of saying something which in the universal rejoicing would bring less joy to you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As it is, when a senator asks me whether it is still a matter of regret that we entered upon a war against the Romans, if I were to remain silent I should be thought either haughty or subservient, of which the one marks a man forgetful of another's independence, the other a man who forgets his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I should like to say in reply to Himilco,</quote> he said, <quote>that I have not ceased to regret the war, and will not cease to accuse your invincible commander until I shall see the war ended on some sufferable terms; nor will anything else than a new peace end my longing for the old peace.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so those facts which Mago has just boastfully reported already give joy to Himilco and the other minions of Hannibal, and <hi rend="italics">may</hi> give joy to me, since successes in war, if we are willing to make use of our good fortune, will give us a more favourable peace.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> I mean that if we let slip this moment, when we may be considered as giving, rather than receiving, a peace, I fear that this joy also of ours may run to excess and come to nothing.<note>As in the last years of the 1st Punic War.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But even now what is it worth? ' I have slain armies of the enemy. Send me soldiers! ' What else would you ask for if you had been defeated?
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> ' I have captured two camps of the enemy,' full of booty and supplies, of course. ' Give me grain and money!
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> ' What else would you beg if you had been despoiled, if you had lost your camp? And, not to have all the amazement to myself &mdash;for it is right and proper for me too, having <pb id="p.41"/>answered Himilco, to turn questioner, &mdash;I
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> should like<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> either Himilco or Mago to answer, in the first place, whether any state among the Latins has revolted to us, although the battle of Cannae meant the utter destruction of the Roman power, and it is known that all Italy is in revolt; in the second place, whether any man out of the thirty-five tribes has deserted to Hannibal.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> On Mago's negative answer to both Hanno said: "Accordingly there remains, to be sure, a very great number of the enemy. But what spirit, what hope that multitude has, I should like to know.' 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As Mago said he did not know, <quote>Nothing is easier to know,</quote> said Hanno. <quote>Have the Romans sent any emissaries to Hannibal suing for peace? Has it been reported to you that even any mention of peace has been made at Rome?</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The answer to this also being negative, <quote>Therefore,</quote> he said, <quote>we have the war intact, as truly as we had on the day on which Hannibal crossed into Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> How often victory shifted in the previous Punic War<note><quote>Roman War</quote> would seem to us better suited to a speaker addressing Carthaginians. Livy here prefers the Roman standpoint.</note> very many of us are alive to remember. Never have our fortunes seemed more favourable on land and sea than they were before the consulship of Gaius Lutatius and Aulus Postumius. But in the consulship of Lutatius and Postumius we were utterly defeated off the Aegates Islands.<note>It was this defeat which brought the previous war to an end, <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And if now also-may the gods avert the omen! &mdash;fortune shall shift to any extent, do you hope that at the time of our defeat we shall have a peace which no one gives us now when we are victorious?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For myself, if some one is about to bring up the question either of offering peace to the enemy or of accepting it, I know what opinion to express. But if you are raising the question of Mago's demands, I do not think it to the <pb id="p.43"/>point to send those things to victors, and I think it<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> much less necessary to send them to men who are deluding us with a hope unfounded and empty.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Not many were moved by Hanno's speech. For the feud with the Barca family made his advice less weighty, and then minds filled with the joy of the moment would not listen to anything which made their rejoicing less well-founded. And they thought that, if they were willing to add a little to their efforts, the war would soon be finished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly the senate with great unanimity decreed that four thousand Numidians should be sent to Hannibal as a reinforcement;<note>Infantry are not mentioned as to be sent from Carthage. Mercenaries were to be engaged in Spain and sent thence to Hannibal.</note> also forty elephants and . . . silver talents.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And . . . was sent in advance to Spain with Mago,<note>In fact Mago is still at Carthage in xxxii. 5.</note> for the purpose of hiring twenty thousand infantry and four thousand horse, to reinforce the armies that were in Italy and those in Spain.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But, as usual in prosperous times, these measures were carried out without spirit and in leisurely fashion, while the Romans, in addition to their inborn activity, were prevented by misfortune also from delaying.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That is, the consul was not found wanting in anything which it was his to do, and the dictator, Marcus Junius Pera, after performing the religious rites, proposed to the people according to custom a bill allowing him to be mounted.<note>The dictator, as commander of the infantry, was by tradition unmounted. Special permission could be obtained from the people, as here, or from the senate, as Plutarch has it in <hi rend="italics">Fabius</hi> iv.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And then, in addition to the two city legions which had been enrolled by the consuls at the beginning of the year, and the levy of slaves, also the cohorts raised from the Picene and Gallic districts, he stooped <pb id="p.45"/>to that last defence of a state almost despaired of,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> when honour yields to necessity: namely, he issued an edict that, if any men who had committed a capital offence, or were in chains as judgment debtors, should become soldiers under him, he would order their release from punishment or debt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Six thousand such men he armed with Gallic spoils which had been carried in the triumph of Gaius Flaminius,<note>He triumphed over the Gauls in the Po valley in <date value="-223">223 B.C.</date></note> and thus set out from the city with twenty-five thousand armed men.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Hannibal, after gaining possession of Capua and vainly trying, partly by hope, partly by fear, to work for the second time upon the feelings of the Neapolitans, led his army over into the territory of Nola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Though this was not at first with hostile intent, since he did not despair of a voluntary surrender, still he was ready, if they baulked his hope, to omit none of the things which they might suffer or fear to suffer. The senate and especially its leading members stood loyally by the alliance with Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the common people, as usual, were all for a change of government and for Hannibal; and they called to mind the fear of devastation of their lands and the many hardships and indignities they must suffer in case of a siege. And men were not lacking to propose revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly the senators, now obsessed by the fear that, if they should move openly, there could be no resisting the excited crowd, found a way to postpone the evil by pretending agreement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For they pretend that they favour revolt to Hannibal, but that there is no agreement as to the terms on which they may go over to a new alliance and friendship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus gaining time, they send emissaries in haste to the Roman praetor, Marcellus Claudius, who <pb id="p.47"/>was at Casilinum<note>Marcellus had been sent to Canusium directly after the battle of Cannae to take command (XXII. lvii. 1), and is now near Capua.</note> with his army, and inform him in<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> what danger the Nolan state is placed; that its territory is in the hands of Hannibal and the Carthaginians, and that the city will be so at once, if help be not given;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that the senate, by conceding to the common people that they would revolt whenever the people wished, had prevented their making haste to revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Marcellus, after warmly praising the men of Nola, bade them postpone matters by the same pretence until his arrival; in the meantime to conceal the dealings they had had with him and all hope of Roman aid.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He himself went from Casilinum to Caiatia, and thence, after crossing the river Volturnus, made his way to Nola through the territory of Saticula and that of Trebia, above Suessula and through the mountains.<note>This wide detour into mountain country was in order to avoid meeting Hannibal.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon the arrival of the Roman praetor the Carthaginian left the territory of Nola and came down to the sea near Neapolis, desiring to gain possession of a coast town to which ships might have a safe passage from Africa.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But on learning that Neapolis was held by a Roman prefect &mdash;it was Marcus Junius Silanus, who had been called in by the Neapolitans themselves &mdash;he turned aside from Neapolis also, as he had from Nola, and made for Nuceria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had besieged that city for some time, often attacking, often attempting in vain to win over the populace, and at another time the leading citizens, when at last by starving them he gained their surrender, stipulating that they leave unarmed and with one garment only.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And then, as from the beginning he had wished to be thought merciful to all Italians except the Romans, he promised rewards and honours to any who remained and would serve under <pb id="p.49"/>him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And yet he did not hold anyone by that hope.<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> They all dispersed, wherever hospitality or impulse happened to carry them, among the cities of Campania, especially Nola and Neapolis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A group of some thirty senators, and as it chanced all the most prominent, came to Capua, and being refused admission because they had closed their gates to Hannibal, went to Cumae. At Nuceria the booty was given to the soldiers, the city sacked and burned.</p> 
			<p>As for Nola, Marcellus held it not more by confidence in his force than by the good-will of the leading citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was apprehensive of the common people and above all of Lucius Bantius, who was impelled by the consciousness of an attempted revolt and by fear of the Roman praetor, now to betray his native city, now, if fortune should not favour him in that, to desert.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was a young man of spirit and at that time almost the best-known horseman among the allies. He had been found half-dead at Cannae in a pile of the slain; and Hannibal, after nursing him kindly, had sent him home, even adding gifts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Out of gratitude for that service Bantius had wished to put the state of Nola under the authority and rule of the Carthaginian. And the praetor saw that he was troubled and tormented by his desire for a revolution. But since he had either to be restrained by punishment or else won over by kindness, Marcellus preferred rather to gain for himself a brave and energetic ally than merely to take such a man away from the enemy, and
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> summoning him addressed him kindly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was easy, he said, to judge that he had among his countrymen many who envied him, and this from the fact that no citizen of Nola had told the speaker how many were his <pb id="p.51"/>brilliant feats of arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But to a man who had served<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> in the Roman camp his bravery could not be unknown. Many who had been in the service with Bantius were telling the speaker what a man he was, and what dangers he had incurred for the safety and honour of the Roman people, and how often;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> also how at the battle of Cannae he had not ceased fighting until, almost lifeless, he had been overwhelmed by the mass of men, horses and arms that fell upon him. <quote>And so,</quote> he said, <quote>all honour to your courage!
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Under me you will have every advancement and every reward, and the more constantly you are with me, the more you will feel that it is a distinction and an advantage to you.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The youth was delighted with the promises, and Marcellus gave him a fine horse and ordered the quaestor to pay him five hundred denarii.<note>These silver coins at that time bore the image of Diana (of Victory not long after) driving a two-horse chariot (<hi rend="italics">biga</hi>).</note> The lictors were bidden to allow him access to the commander whenever he wished. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By this kindliness on the part of Marcellus the high spirit of the young man was so tempered that thereafter none of the allies more bravely and loyally aided the Roman cause.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>While Hannibal was at the gates &mdash;for he again moved his camp from Nuceria to Nola &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the common people of Nola were making fresh plans to revolt, Marcellus, upon the arrival of the enemy, withdrew within the walls, not fearing for his camp, but lest he give the great number who were impatient for it an opportunity to betray the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then on both sides they began to form their battle-lines, the Romans before the walls of Nola, the Carthaginians in front of their camp. Thereupon there were small engagements with varying results in the space between the city and the camp, since the commanders <pb id="p.53"/>wished neither to forbid small numbers who rashly<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> challenged the enemy, nor to give the signal for a general engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During this daily guard-duty of the two armies leading citizens of Nola reported to Marcellus that conferences between the common people and the Carthaginians were taking place by night;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and that it had been settled that, when the Roman force should be outside the gates and in line, they would plunder their baggage-train and their packs, then close the gates and take possession of the walls, so that, having the control of their affairs and the city in their own hands, they would then admit the Carthaginian instead of the Roman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This being reported to Marcellus, he warmly praised the senators of Nola and resolved to try the fortune of battle before there should be any movement in the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the three gates facing the enemy he drew up his army in three sections. He ordered the baggage to bring up the rear, the camp-servants and sutlers and incapacitated soldiers to carry stakes. At the middle gate he posted the pick of the legionaries with the Roman cavalry, at the two gates to right and left the recruits, light-armed and cavalry of the allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The men of Nola were forbidden to approach the walls and gates, and the forces to be used as reserves were assigned to the baggage, in order to prevent an attack upon it while the legions were fighting.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In this formation they were standing inside the gates.</p> 
			<p>Hannibal, who remained in battle-line under the standards until late in the day, as he had done for several days, at first wondered that the Roman army did not come out of the gate and that there was not one armed man on the walls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then, supposing <pb id="p.55"/>the conferences to have been betrayed, and that<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> inaction was the result of fear, he sent part of his soldiers back to the camp, with orders to bring up in haste to the front line all the equipment for besieging the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He was quite confident that, if he should press the hesitating, the common people would stir up some outbreak in the city. While they were scattering to their several duties and hastening to the first standards, and the line was advancing to the walls, the gate suddenly opened and Marcellus ordered the trumpets to be sounded and a shout raised; that infantry at first, and then cavalry should sally out against the enemy with all the dash possible.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They had carried sufficient panic and confusion into the centre, when Publius Valerius Flaccus and Gaius Aurelius, his lieutenants, sallied out of the two gates on this side and that, to attack the enemy's wings.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Sutlers and camp-servants raised another shout, as did the rest of the crowd stationed to guard the baggage so that the shouting gave the sudden impression of a very large army to the Carthaginians, who particularly despised their small numbers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> I should hardly venture to assert, what some have affirmed, that 2800 of the enemy were slain, while not more than 500 of the Romans were lost.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> But whether the victory was on such a scale or less, a very great thing, I rather think the greatest in that war, was accomplished that day. For not to be defeated by Hannibal was a more difficult thing than it was later to defeat him.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now that Hannibal had lost hope of gaining Nola and had retired to Acerrae, Marcellus at once closed the gates, stationed guards to prevent anyone from leaving, and carried on in the forum an <pb id="p.57"/>investigation of those who had been in secret<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> conferences with the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Over seventy having been condemned as traitors, he beheaded them and ordered that their possessions should be public property of the Roman people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And setting out with his whole army, after turning over the government to the senate, he pitched camp and established himself above Suessula.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Carthaginian first tried to entice Acerrae into a voluntary surrender; then, seeing them steadfast, prepared to blockade and attack them. But the men of Acerrae had more courage than resources.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly they gave up hope of defending the city, and when they saw that their walls were being encircled, before the enemy's works should be made continuous, they slipped away in the dead of night through the gaps in the earthworks and through neglected guard-posts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Making their way along the roads and where there were none, just as prudence or chance guided the wanderer, they fled for refuge to those cities of Campania of which it was known that they had not changed sides.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After plundering and burning Acerrae, when word had come from Casilinum that the Roman dictator and fresh legions were being summoned, Hannibal led his army to Casilinum, in order to prevent any uprising at Capua also, while the enemy's camp was so near.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Casilinum was at that time held by five hundred Praenestines, with a few Romans and Latins, whom the news of the disaster at Cannae had brought thither.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As the levy at Praeneste was not completed at the proper date, they had been late in setting out from home, and had reached Casilinum before the news of the defeat. And joined by others, Romans and allies, they set out from Casilinum and, as <pb id="p.59"/>they were proceeding in a fairly large column, the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> report of the battle of Cannae turned them back again to Casilinum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There, being suspected by the Campanians and apprehensive, they spent some days in alternately guarding against plots and hatching them. When credibly informed that the revolt of Capua and Hannibal's entry were being negotiated, they slew townspeople in the night and seized that part of the city which is on this side<note>The right (north) bank of the river.</note> of the Volturnus &mdash;for it is divided by that river; and this was the garrison the Romans had at Casilinum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was joined by a cohort from Perusia, four hundred and sixty men, who had been driven to Casilinum by the same news as the Praenestines a few days before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And there were quite enough men to defend so small a walled city, bounded on one side by the river. But the lack of grain made it seem that there were even too many men.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, being now not far away, sent his Gaetulians ahead under a prefect named Isalcas.. And he ordered him, if there should be an opportunity for a conference, at first by kind words to entice them to open the gates and admit a garrison; but if they persisted in their obstinacy, to use force and see if at some point he could make his way into the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they approached the walls, because of the stillness they thought them deserted. And the barbarian, supposing the garrison had withdrawn in alarm, was preparing to force the gates and break open the bars, when suddenly
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the gates were opened and the two cohorts, drawn up inside for that very purpose, sallied out with a mighty uproar, and wrought havoc among the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The first troops being thus beaten back, Maharbal, who had been <pb id="p.61"/>sent with a larger number of picked men, was<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> likewise unable to withstand the sally of the cohorts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Finally Hannibal pitched his camp directly before the walls and prepared to assault the small city and small garrison with the greatest violence and with all his forces. And while he was pressing the attack, the walls being completely encircled by his men, he lost a considerable number, the most active at that, being hit by missiles from the wall and the towers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When they actually sallied out once, he almost cut off their retreat by sending a column of elephants<note>The elephants sent by order of the Carthaginian senate (xiii. 7) must have arrived. Of those he had brought from Spain only one reached Central Italy (XXII. ii. 10).</note> against them, and drove them in alarm into the city, after a good number, for so small a force, had been slain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> More would have fallen if night had not interrupted the battle. On the next day all were fired to make the assault, especially after a mural crown of gold<note>Awarded to the first man to scale the wall of a city; Polybius VI. xxxix. 5; Livy XXVI. xlviii. 5; Gellius V. vi. 16 and 19.</note> was displayed to them, and the general himself kept making their spiritless attack upon a fort on level
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> ground a reproach to the captors of Saguntum,<note>Cf. XXI. xv.</note> reminding them singly and collectively of Cannae and Trasumennus and Trebia. Then they began to push forward their sheds also and mines.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And to meet the different attempts made by the enemy no kind of activity, no ingenuity, proved lacking to the allies of the Romans. They set up defences to meet the sheds; by transverse mines they intercepted the enemy's mines; they forestalled his attempts both visible and invisible, until shame helped to divert Hannibal from his undertaking.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And after fortifying his camp and posting a small garrison, that the attempt might not appear to have been abandoned, he retired into winter-quarters at Capua.</p> 
			<p>There he kept under roofs for the greater part of <pb id="p.63"/>the winter troops that had been hardened long and<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> repeatedly against all human hardships, but had no experience or familiarity with comforts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so those whom no severe hardship had conquered were ruined by excess of comfort and immoderate pleasures and the more completely ruined the more eagerly they in their inexperience had plunged into them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For sleep and wine, and feasts and harlots, and baths and idleness, which habit made daily more seductive, so weakened their bodies and spirits that it was their past victories rather than their present strength which thereafter protected them; and this was regarded among the military experts as a more serious failure in their commander than that he had not led his men from the field of Cannae forthwith to the city of Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For that delay could be regarded as having merely retarded the victory, this mistake as having robbed him of the power to win.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And so in fact, just as if he were setting out from Capua with a different army, not a trace of the old-time morale survived.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For they came back most of them ensnared by harlots, and also as soon as they began to be quartered in tents, and the march and other tasks of the soldier followed, they would give out both in body and in spirit after the manner of recruits.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And afterwards through the whole season of summer camps a great many kept slipping away from their standards without furloughs; and deserters had no hiding-places other than Capua.<note>For the effect of wintering at Capua cf. xlv. 4 (the famous epigram, as if from the lips of Marcellus), and <hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> 6 (Hannibal's words, as Livy imagined them). Strabo confirms, Polybius denies (V. iv. 13; XI. xix. 3 respectively).</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But when winter was now growing mild, Hannibal led his troops out of winter quarters and returned to Casilinum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, although they had been making no more attacks, an uninterrupted <pb id="p.65"/>blockade had nevertheless brought townspeople<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> and garrison to extreme want.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman camp was commanded by Tiberius Sempronius, since the dictator had gone to Rome to take new auspices.<note>If the auspices were alleged to be defective, the commander returned to Rome to take them again; VIII. xxx. 2.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcellus, who was likewise eager to bring aid to the besieged, was held back both by a flood of the river Volturnus and by entreaties of the men of Nola and Acerrae,<note>The city had not been entirely destroyed (xvii. 7), and part of the population must have returned.</note> who feared the Campanians if the Roman garrison should withdraw.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Gracchus, merely remaining near Casilinum, because it was the dictator's order that he take no action in his absence, made no move, although facts which would easily pass all endurance were being reported from Casilinum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For it was established that some, unable to endure hunger, had thrown themselves from the wall, and that men stood unarmed on the walls exposing unprotected bodies to wounds from missile weapons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Gracchus, though indignant at this, did not dare to engage the enemy without the dictator's order, and saw that, if he should try openly to carry in grain, he must fight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As there was also no hope of carrying it in secretly, he filled many huge jars with spelt brought from the farms all around, and sent word to the magistrate at Casilinum that they should catch up the jars which the river was bringing down.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the following night, while all were intent upon the river and the hope aroused by the Roman messenger, the jars set adrift in midstream floated down, and the grain was evenly divided among them all. This was done the next day also and the third day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was night when they were set adrift and when they arrived.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In that way they escaped the notice of the enemy's guards. After that the stream, now swifter than usual because of incessant rains, forced <pb id="p.67"/>the jars by a cross current to the bank guarded by<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> the enemy. There, caught among the willows growing on the banks, they were seen and it was reported to Hannibal. And thereafter by a closer watch they saw to it that nothing sent down the Volturnus to the city should escape notice.<note>Hannibal had a chain across the river according to Frontinus <hi rend="italics">Strat.</hi> III. xiv. 2.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> However nuts which were poured out from the Roman camp, as they floated down the middle of the river to Casilinum, were caught by wattled hurdles.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Finally they reached such a pitch of distress that they tried, after softening them by hot water, to chew thongs and the hides stripped off of shields; and they did not abstain from rats and other animals, and dug out every kind of plant and root from the bank beneath the wall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And when the enemy had ploughed up all the grassy ground outside the wall, the garrison sowed turnips,<note>This was to impress Hannibal with their confidence that their supplies would hold out for months, and that they did not need the grass and herbs of which he had deprived them; Frontinus III. xv. 3; Strabo V. iv. 10.</note> so that Hannibal exclaimed <quote>Am I to sit before Casilinum until those seeds come up?</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And the man who had never before listened to any terms now at last allowed them to treat with him in regard to ransoming the free men. Seven-twelfths of a pound of gold was agreed upon as the price per man.<note>Nearly four times the ransom demanded for an ally (200 denarii) after the battle of Cannae; XXII. lii. 2.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> On receiving his promise they surrendered. They were kept in chains until all the gold was paid, then with strict regard for his promise they were released.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> This is the more correct version than that they were slain by a charge of cavalry as they departed. The majority were Praenestines. Of the five hundred and seventy who were in the garrison sword and starvation carried off less than half. The rest returned safe to Praeneste with their commander Marcus Anicius, who had <pb id="p.69"/>formerly been a clerk.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> As evidence there formerly<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> stood in the forum of Praeneste a statue of the man, wearing a cuirass and draped in a toga, with his head covered. It had an inscription on a bronze plate, stating that Marcus Anicius had paid his vow on behalf of the soldiers who were in the garrison at Casilinum. The same inscription was placed beneath three images of gods set up in the Temple of Fortune. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The town of Casilinum was restored to the Campanians and defended by a garrison of seven hundred men from the army of Hannibal, that the Romans might not attack it when the Carthaginian should withdraw.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the Praenestine soldiers the Roman senate voted double pay and exemption from service for five years. Though rewarded for their courage with the gift of Roman citizenship, they made no change.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> they did not accept.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As to the fate of the Perusians the report is less clear, since no light has been thrown upon it either by any record of their own or by a decree of the Romans.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the same time the Petelini,<note>Petelia, not far north of Croton, was an exception to the statement that all the Bruttians had gone over to the Carthaginians; XXII. lxi. 12.</note> who alone among the Bruttians had remained in the friendship of Rome, were being attacked not only by the Carthaginians, who were holding the region, but also by the rest of the Bruttians for not making common cause with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Unable to withstand these dangers, the Petelini sent legates to Rome to ask for a garrison. The prayers of the legates and their tears &mdash;for when ordered to shift for themselves they gave way to tearful complaints before the entrance of the Senate House &mdash;stirred great compassion among senators and people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And when consulted a second time by Marcus Aemilius, a praetor,<note>Probably elected in place of Postumius, who fell in Gaul (xxiv. 11).</note> the senators, after surveying all the resources of the empire, were <pb id="p.71"/>compelled to admit that they themselves no longer<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> had any means to protect distant allies. They ordered them to return home, and having fulfilled their obligation to the last, to shift for themselves for the future as best the situation permitted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this outcome of the embassy was reported at Petelia, such dejection and fear unexpectedly seized their senate that some proposed to flee, each taking any possible road, and to
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> abandon the city, while others, since they had been deserted by their old allies, proposed to join the rest of the Bruttians and through them to surrender to Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But those who thought nothing should be done hastily or rashly, and that they should deliberate again, prevailed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the matter was brought up in less excitement the following day, the optimates carried their point, that they should bring in everything from the farms and strengthen the city and the walls.<note>The siege lasted eleven months, and at the last they were subsisting on hides, bark, twigs, etc.; xxx. 1 ff.; Polybius VII. i. 3.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time letters from Sicily and Sardinia were brought to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First to be read in the senate were those from Sicily and Titus Otacilius, the propraetor, reporting that Publius Furius, the praetor, had come with his fleet from Africa to Lilybaeum; that Furius himself had been seriously wounded and his life was in the utmost danger;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that neither pay nor grain was being furnished to the
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> soldiers and the crews at the proper date, and they had no means of doing so;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that he strongly urged that both be sent as soon as possible, and that they send a successor chosen, if they saw fit, from the number of the new praetors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Much the same facts in regard to pay and grain were reported from Sardinia by Aulus Cornelius Mammula, the propraetor. To each the reply was that there <pb id="p.73"/>was nothing on hand to send, and they were ordered<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> to provide for their own fleets and armies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Titus Otacilius sent legates to Hiero, the mainstay of the Roman people,<note>Hiero II had ruled Syracuse 270-<date value="-215">215 B.C.</date>; a faithful ally of the Romans from 263 to his death. For his sympathy and aid, including the gift of a golden Victory, after the battle of the Trasumennus, cf. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxxvii.</note> and received what money was needed for pay, and grain for six months. In Sardinia the allied states made generous contributions to Cornelius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And at Rome besides, on account of the lack of money, three bank-commissioners were named in accordance with a bill of Marcus Minucius, a tribune of the plebs, namely, Lucius Aemilius Papus, who
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> had been consul and censor, and Marcus Atilius Regulus, who had been consul twice, and Lucius Scribonius Libo, who was at that time a tribune of the plebs. And Marcus Atilius and Gaius Atilius, elected duumvirs, dedicated a temple of Concord,<note>In the citadel, begun in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date>; XXII. xxxiii. 7 f.</note> which Lucius Manlius had vowed in his praetorship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And three pontiffs, Quintus Caecilius Metellus and Quintus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, were elected<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> by the college of pontiffs. Fabius is the Delayer, dictator in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date> Fulvius was consul twice before this war, and twice again during the war, 212 and 209.</note> in place of Publius Scantinius, deceased, and of Lucius Aemilius Paulus, the consul, and Quintus Aelius Paetus, both of whom had fallen in the battle- of Cannae.</p> 
			<p>XXII. After making good, in so far as they could accomplish it by human wisdom, the other losses fortune had caused by a series of disasters, the fathers at last had regard for themselves as well and for the desolate Senate House and the small number that came to the council of state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For since the censorship of Lucius Aemilius and Gaius Flaminius the list of the senate had not been revised, although the defeats and in addition the fate of individuals <pb id="p.75"/>had in the five years carried off so large a number<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> of senators. Marcus Aemilius, the praetor, raised that question, as all demanded that he should, since the dictator had already gone to the army after the loss of Casilinum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon Spurius Carvilius, after complaining in a long speech, not of the lack of senators only, but also of the small number of citizens from whom
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> men might be chosen into the senate, said that for the sake of recruiting the senate and of linking the Latins more closely with the Roman people, he strongly urged that citizenship be bestowed upon two senators from each of the Latin states, to be selected by the Roman fathers; and that from this number men be chosen into the senate in place of the deceased members.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fathers gave no more favourable hearing to this proposal than they had given to a former demand of the Latins themselves.<note>Cf. above, vi. 8 and note.</note> There was a murmur of indignation everywhere in the hall, and in particular Titus Manlius said that there still lived a man of the family to which belonged the consul who on the Capitol had once threatened that he would slay with his own hand any Latin he should see in the Senate House.<note>The threat was recorded in VIII. v. 7. The present Manlius had opposed ransoming the captives at Cannae; XXII. lx. 5 ff.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Upon that Quintus Fabius Maximus said that never had anything been mentioned in the senate at a more unfavourable moment than this had been broached, in the midst of such unsettled feeling and wavering loyalty among the allies, only to stir them up the more; that that rash utterance of a single man should be drowned by silence on the part of them all; and that, if there was ever any hallowed secret to be left unmentioned <pb id="p.77"/>in the senate, this above all others must be covered,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> concealed, forgotten, considered unsaid.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So mention of the matter was suppressed.</p> 
			<p>It was decided that as dictator, to draw up the list of the senate, a man should be appointed who had previously been censor and was senior to all the other living ex-censors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And they ordered that Gaius Terentius,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Varro, defeated at Cannae.</note> the consul, be summoned that he might name a dictator. He returned to Rome by long stages from Apulia, leaving a garrison there; and that night, as was the custom, in accordance with the decree of the senate he named Marcus Fabius Buteo dictator for six months without master of the horse. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Fabius mounted the Rostra with his lictors and said that he did not approve of two dictators at the
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> same time, an unprecedented thing,<note>Minucius, master of the horse, had finally been given by the people equal authority with Fabius, but that did not make him legally a dictator; XXII. xxvi. 7; xxvii. 3.</note> nor of a dictator without master of the horse, nor of conferring a censor's power upon one man, and in fact to the same man a second time, nor of giving the full military authority for six months to a dictator not appointed for the conduct of affairs. He said that he would set a limit to such possible irregularities as the crisis and necessity had occasioned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For he would not eject from the senate any of those whom Gaius Flaminius and Lucius Aemilius as censors had chosen into the senate, but would order their names merely
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> to be copied and read out, that judgment and decision in regard to the reputation and character of a senator might not rest with one man. And in place of the deceased he would make his choice in such a way that rank should obviously have been preferred to rank, not man to man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After reading the list of the old senate, he chose in place of the deceased first those who since the censorship of Lucius Aemilius <pb id="p.79"/>and Gaius Flaminius<note>In <date value="-220">220 B.C.</date>; <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> 20.</note> had held a curule office and had<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> not yet been chosen into the senate,<note>Pending the revision of the list by the censors, once in five years in the normal course of things.</note> in each case in the order of his election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then he chose those who had been aediles,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> plebeian aediles.</note> tribunes of the people or quaestors; then, from the number of those who had not held offices, the men who had spoils of the enemy affixed to their houses or had received the civic wreath.<note>The reward of a soldier who had saved the life of a fellow-citizen.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having thus chosen a hundred and seventy-seven into the senate with great approval, he at once abdicated his office and came down from the Rostra a private citizen, after ordering his lictors to leave him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And he mingled with the crowd of those engaged in private business, deliberately killing time, in order not to draw the people away from the forum for the purpose of escorting him. Yet men's attention was not relaxed by that delay, and so in large numbers they escorted him home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul returned that night to the army without informing the senate, for fear of being detained in the city to conduct the elections.</p> 
			<p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the next day the senate, presided over by Marcus Pomponius, the praetor, decreed that the dictator should be informed by letter that, if he thought it to the public interest, he should come with the master of the horse and the praetor, Marcus Marcellus, for the election of consuls, in
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> order that from them in person the fathers could learn what was the condition of the state and make their plans in accordance with the facts. All of those summoned came, leaving their lieutenants to command the legions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The dictator spoke briefly and <pb id="p.81"/>modestly of himself, and then diverted a large share<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> of the glory<note>What were the special achievements of M. Junius Pera we are not told. Probably <quote>glory</quote> is only conventional for <quote>credit.</quote> The consul is absent with the army.</note> to the master of the horse, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus; and he ordered the elections at which these consuls were named: Lucius Postumius for the third time, then absent with Gaul as his sphere of action, and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, who was at that time master of the horse and curule aedile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the following men were elected as praetors: Marcus Valerius Laevinus for the second time, Appius Claudius Pulcher, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, Quintus Mucius Scaevola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The dictator, after the election of magistrates, returned to the army and the winter quarters at Teanum,<note>The northernmost town in Campania was Teanum Sidicinum, an important road centre in a strong position.</note> leaving the master of the horse at Rome, in order that he, inasmuch as he was to enter upon office a few days later, might advise with the fathers in regard to enrolling and providing armies for the year.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Just as these measures were being taken, a fresh disaster was reported &mdash;for fortune was piling one upon another for that year &mdash;namely, that the consul designate, Lucius Postumius, had perished, himself and his army, in Gaul. There was a huge forest,<note>Near Mutina (Modena), and northwest of Bononia (Bologna).</note> called Litana by the Gauls, by way of which he was about to lead his army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In that forest the Gauls hacked the trees to right and left of the road in such a way that, if not disturbed, they stood, but fell if pushed slightly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Postumius had two Roman legions, and had enlisted from the coast of the Upper Sea<note>Cf. xxxviii. 1; contrast i. 5.</note> such numbers of allies that he led twenty-five thousand armed men into the enemy's territory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Gauls had surrounded the very edge of the forest, <pb id="p.83"/>and when the column entered a defile<note>The particular spot chosen for the trap. Although <hi rend="italics">saltus</hi> often = <hi rend="italics">silva,</hi> the hacking of trees must have been confined to some stretch of the road offering special advantages to the enemy, and near the point where the road emerged into open country. Cf. xxxiii. 8.</note> they pushed<note type="margin">B.C. 261.</note> against the outermost of the trees that had been hacked near the ground. As these fell, each upon the next tree, which was in itself unsteady and had only a slight hold, piling up from both sides they overwhelmed arms, men and horses, so that hardly ten men escaped.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For after very many had been killed by tree-trunks and broken branches, and the rest of the troops were alarmed by the unforeseen calamity, the Gauls under arms, surrounding the whole defile<note>Here also it is difficult to believe that <hi rend="italics">saltus</hi> is used as another word for <quote>forest,</quote> since the whole <hi rend="italics">silva vasta</hi> (&sect; 7) could hardly be surrounded by the Gauls. Cf. Frontinus I. vi. 4. Even in <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date> there were still remnants of forest along the Aemilian Way; <hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> II. v. 39.</note> slew them, while but few out of so many were captured, &mdash;the men who were making their way to a bridge over a river, but were cut off, since the bridge had by that time been occupied by the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There Postumius fell fighting with all his might to avoid capture. Spoils taken from his body and the severed head of the general were carried in triumph by the Boians to the temple which is most revered in their land.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then after cleaning the head they adorned the skull with gold according to their custom. And it served them as a sacred vessel from which to pour libations at festivals and at the same time as a drinking cup for the priests and keepers of the temple.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The booty also meant no less to the Gauls than the victory. For although a large part of the cattle had been crushed by fallen trees, still everything else was found strewn the whole length of the column of the slain, since nothing was scattered by flight.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this disaster was reported, the city was for many days in such alarm that, in view of the stillness, like that of night, produced <pb id="p.85"/>throughout the city by the closing of the shops, the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> senate charged the aediles with the duty of going about the city and ordering that shops be opened and the appearance of public mourning removed from the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And then Tiberius Sempronius held a session of the senate;<note>This he did as <hi rend="italics">magister equitum.</hi> His consulship would begin at the Ides of March; xxx. 17.</note> and he comforted the fathers, and urged that men who had not given way to the catastrophe at Cannae should not lose heart in the face of lesser disasters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So far as concerned the Carthaginian enemy and Hannibal, he said that, if only coming events should prove favourable, as he hoped, a Gallic war could be both safely neglected and postponed, and punishment for that treachery would be in the power of the gods and of the Roman people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was in regard to the Carthaginian enemy and the armies with which to carry on that war that they must deliberate and debate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He himself first stated what number of infantry and cavalry, of citizens and allies, were in the dictator's army. Then Marcellus set forth the total of his forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As to what troops were in Apulia with the consul Gaius Terentius, those who knew were questioned; and no method of making up consular armies strong enough for so great a war was found. And so, although righteous indignation goaded them, it was decided that Gaul should be left out of account that year. The dictator's army was assigned to the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As for the army of Marcus Marcellus, it was voted that those of them who were survivors of the rout at Cannae should be transported to Sicily and serve there so long as there should be war in Italy;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> also that from the dictator's legions all the least efficient soldiers should be sent away to the same province, with no definite term of service except that of the campaigns <pb id="p.87"/>fixed by law.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The two city legions were assigned to<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> the other consul, to be elected in place of Lucius Postumius; and it was voted that he be elected as soon as possible with due regard to the auspices;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> further, that two legions be summoned as soon as might be from Sicily, and that from them the consul to whom the city legions fell should take as many soldiers as he needed;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> also that the command of Gaius Terentius, the consul, should be extended<note>The usual word would be <hi rend="italics">prorogari.</hi> But Cicero has <hi rend="italics">provinciae propagator, Att.</hi> VIII. iii. 3, and uses the verb in the sense of <quote>prolong</quote> in <hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> iii. 26; so Suetonius <hi rend="italics">Aug.</hi> 23.</note> for one year and no reduction made in the army which he had for the defence of Apulia.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During these operations and these preparations in Italy the war in Spain was no less active, but up to that time more successful<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> than in Italy.</note> for the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius and Gnaeus Scipio had divided the forces between them, so that Gnaeus should carry on the war on land, Publius with the fleet; and Hasdrubal, commander-in-chief of the Carthaginians, since he could not fully depend upon either arm of his forces, remained far from the enemy, being protected by distance and position, until, in answer to pleas urgent and long-continued, four thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry were sent from Africa to reinforce him.<note>As voted by the Carthaginian senate, xiii. 7.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, with hopes at last renewed, he moved his camp nearer to the enemy, and he too ordered that a fleet should be built and equipped, in order to protect the islands and the sea-coast.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the very flush of renewed operations he met a blow in the desertion of the commanders of his ships, who, being severely reprimanded after their abandonment of the fleet at the Hiberus in their fright,<note>Cf. XXII. xix. 11 f. Their desertion now consisted in going over to native tribes which sided with the Romans, especially to the Tartesii (Turdetani), on the lower Baetis (Guadalquivir).</note> had never <pb id="p.89"/>since been entirely loyal either to the general or to<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> the cause of Carthage. These deserters had made trouble in the tribe of the Tartesii, and at their instigation a number of cities had rebelled. One city had even been stormed by them.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It was against this tribe that the war was now diverted from the
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> Romans, and Hasdrubal, having entered the territory of the enemy with a hostile army, resolved to attack a noble in command of the Tartesii, Chalbus, who with a strong army was keeping to his camp before the walls of a city captured a few days before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Therefore Hasdrubal, sending the light-armed in advance, to draw out the enemy to battle, scattered part of his cavalry over the farms to ravage them and to capture stragglers. There was confusion at the camp and at the same time flight and slaughter in the country around.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, after they had made their way from all sides back to the camp by different roads, fear was so suddenly banished from their hearts that they had sufficient spirit not only to defend the fortifications but also to attack the enemy. Accordingly they sallied out of the camp in a column, dancing, as is their custom; and their sudden boldness inspired alarm in the enemy, who a little before had been the aggressor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so Hasdrubal likewise led his forces up a very steep hill, further defended by a river in front.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Also he got back the light-armed who had been sent ahead and the scattered cavalry to the same position. Unable to put sufficient confidence in either the hill or the river, he strongly fortified his camp with an earthwork.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While fear was shifting thus from one side to the other, a number of engagements took place, and the Numidian horseman was no match for the <pb id="p.91"/>Spaniard, nor the Moorish dart-thrower for the man<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> with the wicker shield, the Spaniard in both cases being an equal in speed and quite superior in spirit and strength.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the Tartesii had repeatedly failed to draw the Carthaginian out to battle by facing his camp, and it was also not easy to assault the camp, they took by storm the city of Ascua, to which Hasdrubal, on entering the land of the enemy, had brought grain and other supplies;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and they gained possession of all the country around.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And they could no longer be restrained by any authority either on the march or in camp. Hasdrubal, perceiving that this carelessness came, as usually happens, from success, exhorted his soldiers to attack the enemy while dispersed and in no formation, and coming down from the hill he proceeded to their camp in battle order.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When his approach was reported by messengers fleeing wildly from the watch-towers and guard-posts, they shouted <quote>To arms!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Snatching up arms, each man for himself, without commanders, without orders, in no units or formations, they dashed into battle. Already the first men had engaged, while some charged in separate masses and others had not yet left the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless they at first frightened the enemy by sheer audacity. Then, as stragglers advancing against dense ranks, finding no safety in small numbers, they looked to one another for help; and, beaten back from every side, they formed a circle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And as they crowded bodies against bodies and touched arms to arms, they were forced into close quarters. Having hardly room enough to move their weapons, they were encircled by the enemy, and the slaughter continued until late in the <pb id="p.93"/>day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A very small part of them sallied out and made<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> for the woods and the mountains. In no less alarm the camp was abandoned, and on the next day the whole tribe surrendered.</p> 
			<p>Yet not for long did the tribe abide by the agreement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For soon came the order from Carthage that Hasdrubal should at the first opportunity lead his army into Italy. And the spreading of this news throughout Spain made nearly all incline to the side of the Romans.<note>Evidently exaggerated, as in xxix. 16 and xxxii. 6. A prosperous city near the Hiberus is mentioned in xxviii. 10 as still loyal to the Carthaginians.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly Hasdrubal at once sent a letter to Carthage, showing what a loss the mere report of his departure had caused; that if he were actually to leave the country, Spain would belong to the Romans before he should cross the Hiberus.<note>The Ebro was the treaty boundary; XXI. ii. 7.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For besides the lack of both an army and a general to leave in his place, so able were the Roman generals that they could scarcely be resisted if the forces were evenly matched.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so, if they had any regard for Spain, they should send him a successor with a strong army. Even if all should go well, that man would still find it no peaceful province.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though this letter at first greatly stirred the senate, nevertheless, since concern for Italy was older and stronger, no change was made either in regard to Hasdrubal or to his forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But Himilco was sent with a complete army and an enlarged fleet to hold and defend Spain by land and sea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After transporting his land and naval forces, Himilco fortified a camp, beached his ships and surrounded them with an earthwork. Then he himself with picked horsemen, making his way with all possible speed, and with equal alertness through the <pb id="p.95"/>wavering and the hostile tribes, reached Hasdrubal.<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After setting forth the decrees and instructions of the senate, and being himself informed in turn how the war in Spain must be conducted, he went back to his own camp, being protected by his quickness more than anything else, since he had left each place before the enemy could agree upon action.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hasdrubal, before breaking camp, exacted money from all the tribes under his rule, knowing well that Hannibal had repeatedly bought the right of passage, and that he had Gallic auxiliaries only by hiring them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but that if he had set out on so long a march without funds, he would scarcely have made his way to the Alps.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Therefore he exacted money in haste and came down to the Hiberus.</p> 
			<p>When news of the decrees of the Carthaginians and Hasdrubal's expedition reached the Roman commanders, both dropped everything, and uniting their forces prepared to meet and resist his efforts, thinking
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> that if Hannibal, who was himself an enemy Italy could scarcely endure, should be joined by Hasdrubal as a general and by an army from Spain, that would be the end of the Roman power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Troubled by these apprehensions, they concentrated their troops at the Hiberus, crossed the river, and after protracted deliberation, whether to pitch camp near that of the enemy or to be satisfied with keeping him from his projected march by attacking
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> allies of the Carthaginians, they prepared to attack a city which had its name Hibera from the river near by, the richest city of the region at that time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On learning this Hasdrubal, instead of bringing aid to his allies, proceeded likewise to attack a city which had recently surrendered to the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus the siege <pb id="p.97"/>already begun was abandoned by the Romans and<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> the war directed against Hasdrubal himself.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They had their camps five miles apart for a few days, not without skirmishes, but without drawing up lines of battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Finally on one and the same day, as though by agreement, the signal for battle was raised on both sides and with all their forces they went down into the plain. The Roman line stood in triple ranks.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some of the light-armed were posted in the intervals between the maniples in advance of the standards, some placed behind the standards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Cavalry covered the wings. Hasdrubal made a strong centre of Spanish troops; on the right wing he placed Carthaginians, on the left Africans and mercenary auxiliaries. Of the cavalry he stationed the Numidians on the wing of the Carthaginian infantry, the rest on that of the Africans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And not all of his Numidians were placed on the right wing, but only those who, taking two horses apiece<note>Cf. XXXV. xxviii. 8.</note> after the manner of performers, had the custom of leaping armed from the tired horse to the fresh, often in the very heat of battle; such was the agility of the men, and so well-trained their breed of horses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While they were standing in this array, the hopes of the generals on the two sides were fairly balanced; for there was also not much superiority for the one army or the other either in the number or the type of its soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the spirit of the soldiers was far from being matched. For the Romans, although fighting far from their country, had been easily persuaded by their generals that they were fighting in defence of Italy and the city of Rome. And so, as men whose return to their native land would depend upon the issue of that battle, they had made up their <pb id="p.99"/>minds to win or die.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other battle-line had men<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> less firmly resolved. For the majority were Spaniards, who preferred to be vanquished in Spain, rather than as victors to be dragged to Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Therefore at the first clash, when they had barely hurled their javelins, the centre fell back, and, as the Romans advanced with a great charge, retreated. On the wrings, however, there was more spirited fighting.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the one hand the Carthaginians pressed them hard, on the other hand the Africans; and it was a double conflict against men presumed to have been surrounded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But, although the whole Roman line had by this time crowded into the centre, it had sufficient strength to force apart the wings of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus there were two battles in opposite directions. In both the Romans were unquestionably victorious, since, once the centre had been routed, they were superior both in the numbers and in the strength of their men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A great number of men<note>As many as 25,000 according to Eutropius III. 11.</note> were slain there, and if the Spaniards had not fled in such confusion when the battle had scarcely begun, very few out of that entire line would have survived.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The cavalry were not engaged at all, since, as soon as the Mauri and the Numidians saw the centre giving way, they at once abandoned the wings, exposed by their wild flight as they drove the elephants also before them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Hasdrubal, after waiting for the final outcome of the battle, escaped with a few men out of the midst of the slaughter. His camp the Romans captured and plundered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> That battle brought to the Roman side all that still wavered in Spain, and Hasdrubal had left to him no hope, not only of leading his army over into Italy, but not even of remaining with any safety in Spain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> When these facts were generally known <pb id="p.101"/>at Rome through the letter of the Scipios, people<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> rejoiced, not so much over the victory, as that Hasdrubal's crossing into Italy had been prevented.<note>Hasdrubal's invasion of Italy was carried out nine years later to a fatal conclusion at the Metaurus, XXVII. xlix. 4.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on in Spain, Petelia,<note>For the long siege of Petelia cf. the note on xx. 10.</note> in the land of the Bruttii, was taken by Himilco, Hannibal's prefect, some months after the siege began.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That victory cost the Carthaginians much blood and many wounds, and starvation<note>Polybius also (VII. i. 3) gave such details as follow.</note> more than any assault overpowered the besieged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For after they had consumed their food-supply in cereals and flesh, the familiar and the unfamiliar, of four-footed beasts of every kind, they finally lived on hides and grasses and roots and tender bark and leaves stripped off.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And they were not overpowered until they had no strength left to stand on the walls and bear arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having taken Petelia, the Carthaginian led his troops across to Consentia, and as it was less obstinately defended, he received its surrender within a few days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> About the same time an army of the Bruttians also besieged Croton,<note>The story of the siege and capture of Croton, on the Gulf of Tarentum, is told in some detail in XXIV. ii f.</note> a Greek city formerly rich in arms and men, but even then so crushed by many great disasters that, including all ages, less than two thousand citizens remained.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so the enemy easily gained possession of the city bereft of its defenders. Only the citadel was still held, and to it some, in the uproar of a captured city, made their escape out of the midst of slaughter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And Locri went over to the Bruttians and Carthaginians, the populace having been betrayed by the leading men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Regium alone in that region remained loyal to the Romans and to the very last independent. <pb id="p.103"/>The same trend of feeling reached Sicily also, and<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> even the house of Hiero did not hold aloof entirely from the revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For Gelo, the eldest son, scorning both the old age of his father and
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the Roman alliance since the disaster at Cannae, went over to the Carthaginians.<note>Polybius makes him a model of filial devotion (VII. viii. 9). Coins prove that he was king with his father.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And he would have caused an uprising in Sicily, had not death, so timely as to besmirch even his father with suspicion, carried him off as he was arming the populace and trying to gain allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Such were the checkered events of that year in Italy, in Africa, in Sicily, in Spain.<note>This brief resume covers the events narrated from XXII. xxxviii up to this point. An eventful year.</note></p> 
			<p>At the end of the year Quintus Fabius Maximus requested of the senate that he be permitted to dedicate the Temple of Venus of Eryx<note>Where the temple was we learn presently, xxxi. 9. Her chief temple was on the western headland of Sicily, Mt. Eryx.</note> which he had vowed in his dictatorship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The senate decreed that Tiberius Sempronius, consul designate, as soon as he entered upon his office should propose to the people that they order that Quintus Fabius should be a duumvir for the purpose of dedicating the temple.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And in honour of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been consul twice and augur, his three sons, Lucius, Marcus, Quintus, gave funeral games for three days and showed twenty-two pairs of gladiators in the Forum.<note>The earliest known example of a gladiatorial combat at Rome was in <date value="-264">264 B.C.</date> That also was on the occasion of a funeral, and the gift of sons.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The curule aediles, Gaius Laetorius and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, consul designate, who in his aedileship had been master of the horse, celebrated the Roman Games, and on three of the days they were repeated. The Plebeian Games of the aediles, Marcus Aurelius Cotta and Marcus Claudius Marcellus, were repeated three times.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><pb id="p.105"/>
			<p>The third year of the Punic War being at an end,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> Tiberius Sempronius entered upon office as consul on the Ides of March.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Of the praetors Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, who had previously been consul<note>In fact twice, 237 and <date value="-224">224 B.C.</date></note> and censor, had by lot his assignment as judge between citizens, Marcus Valerius Laevinus had his as judge in the cases of strangers, while to Appius Claudius Pulcher Sicily was allotted, and Sardinia to Quintus Mucius Scaevola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> That Marcus Marcellus should have full military authority as proconsul was ordered by the people, because he alone of the Roman commanders since the disaster at Cannae had met with success in Italy.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate on the first day on which it was in session on the Capitol, decreed that a double tax should be imposed that year and the normal tax collected at once;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that from it pay should be given in cash to all the soldiers except those who had been soldiers at Cannae.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As for the armies, they decreed that Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, should set for the two city legions a date for mobilization at Cales; that these legions should be led thence to the Claudian Camp<note>In fact twice, 237 and <date value="-224">224 B.C.</date></note> above Suessula; that the legions already there &mdash;it
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> was chiefly the army of Cannae &mdash;should be taken over into Sicily by Appius Claudius Pulcher, the praetor, and that those which were in Sicily should be brought to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcus Claudius Marcellus was sent to the army for which a date of mobilization at Cales had been set; and he was ordered to conduct the city legions to the Claudian Camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To take over the old army and conduct it thence to Sicily, Appius Claudius sent his lieutenant, Tiberius Maecilius Croto.</p> 
			<p>At first men had been waiting in silence for the <pb id="p.107"/>consul to preside over an election for the naming of<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> his colleague.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, when they saw that Marcus Marcellus, whom they particularly desired to have elected consul for that year, on account of remarkable successes in his praetorship, had been sent away, apparently on purpose, murmurs began to be heard in the Senate House.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Noting this the consul said: <quote>Both acts were to the advantage of the state, fellow-senators, that Marcus Claudius should be sent to Campania to make the change of armies, and that the coming election should not be proclaimed until he, after accomplishing the task which was assigned him, should return thence, so that you might have the consul whom the critical situation in the state requires and whom you particularly desire.</quote> So until Marcellus returned, nothing was said about an election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Meanwhile Quintus Fabius Maximus and Titus Otacilius Crassus were made duumvirs for the dedication of temples, Otacilius for that of Mens, Fabius for that of Venus of Eryx. Both are on the Capitol,<note>Exact situation of the temples is unknown; cf. xxxii. 20; XXII. ix. 10; x, 10.</note> separated by a single water-channel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And in regard to the three hundred Campanian knights 2 who, after loyally serving their terms in Sicily, had come to Rome, a bill was brought before the people that they should be Roman citizens; further, that they should be townsmen of Cumae from the day before that on which the Campanian people had revolted from the Roman people.<note>The Roman citizenship which they had lost with the revolt of Capua was restored, while their municipal rights and privileges were transferred to loyal Cumae and made to antedate the Campanian secession.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> What had chiefly prompted the making of this proposal was that they said they did not themselves know with whom they belonged, having given up their old home-city, and not being enrolled as yet in the city to which they had returned. After Marcellus returned from the army, an election to name one consul in place of Lucius <pb id="p.109"/>Postumius was ordered by edict.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With great<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> unanimity Marcellus was elected, to assume office at once.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Just as he was entering upon his consulship it thundered, and thereupon the augurs, being summoned, declared that there seemed to be a defect in his election. And the fathers widely circulated the statement that it did not meet the approval of the gods that two plebeians had then for the first time been elected consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> In place of Marcellus, after he had abdicated, Quintus Fabius Maximus was substituted as consul for the third time.</p> 
			<p>The sea was aflame in the course of that year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At Sinuessa a cow gave birth to a colt. At the Temple of Juno Sospita at Lanuvium images of the gods dripped blood, and it rained stones around the temple &mdash;a shower on account of which there were ceremonies, as usual, for nine days. And the rest of the portents were duly expiated.<note>A very short list of portents and expiations, compared with those in XXI. lie., XXII. i. and elsewhere.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls divided the armies between them. To Fabius fell the army at Teanum, formerly commanded by Marcus Junius, the dictator; to Sempronius the slave volunteers<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the slaves who, after the battle of Cannae, volunteered and were purchased by the state.

				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To Marcus Valerius, the praetor, were assigned the legions which had returned from Sicily. Marcus Claudius was sent as proconsul to the army which was above Suessula, in order to guard Nola. The praetors set out for Sicily and Sardinia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls issued an edict that, whenever they might call a meeting of the senate, the senators and any who had the right to give an opinion in the senate<note>In the present case the persons meant can only be the newly-elected magistrates, since the list has just been revised, and none can be waiting for a new <hi rend="italics">lectio senatus.</hi> Cf. xxiii. 5.</note> should assemble at the <pb id="p.111"/>Porta Capena.<note>By this gate in the <quote>Servian Wall</quote> the Via Appia left the city, near the east end of the Circus Maximus. Meeting probably in the nearby Temple of Honos, the senate could confer with returning generals outside the city.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The praetors who had judicial duties<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> set up their tribunals at the Piscina Publica.<note>This swimming-pool of uncertain location was also outside the gate.</note> That place should be named &mdash;so they ordered &mdash;in recognizances,<note>The defendant was bound to give assurances (in one of the various forms prescribed by the praetor's edict) that he would appear on the day and at the place named &mdash;here at the Piscina instead of in the Forum.</note> and there justice was rendered that
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> year.</p> 
			<p>Meanwhile Carthage, from which Mago,<note>He had not yet gone to Spain, as was intended in xiii. 8.</note> Hannibal's brother, was on the point of transporting into Italy twelve thousand infantry and fifteen hundred cavalry, twenty elephants and a thousand talents of silver, with a convoy of sixty warships, received the news that in Spain operations
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> had failed and nearly all the tribes in that province had revolted to the
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Romans. There were some who, neglecting Italy, were ready to divert Mago to Spain with that fleet and those forces, when there suddenly appeared a ray of hope of recovering
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sardinia. It was reported that the Roman army there was small; that the old praetor, Aulus Cornelius, who was well acquainted with the province, was retiring, and a new praetor
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> expected; further, that the Sardinians were now weary of the long continuance of Roman rule, and in the previous year had been ruled with harshness and greed; that they were burdened by a heavy tribute and an unfair requisition of grain; that nothing was lacking but a leader to whom they might go
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> over. Such was the report of a secret embassy sent by the leading men at the special instigation of Hampsicora, who at that time was far above the rest in prestige and
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> wealth. By such news they were almost at the <pb id="p.113"/>same moment dejected and encouraged, and sent<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> Mago with his fleet and his forces to
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Spain. For Sardinia they chose Hasdrubal as general, and voted him about the same number of troops as to Mago.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And at Rome the consuls did what had to be done in the city, and were now bestirring themselves for the
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> war. Tiberius Sempronius set his soldiers a date for mobilization at Sinuessa, and Quintus Fabius, after first consulting the senate, gave orders that all should bring their grain crops<note>Either ripe or ripening, to be threshed in towns of such regions as were named in the order.</note> from the farms into fortified cities before the next Kalends of June; that if any man should fail to do so, he would lay waste his farm, sell his slaves at auction and burn the farm
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> buildings. Not even those praetors who had been appointed to administer justice<note>In normal times short absences only from the city were permissible for the <hi rend="italics">urbanus</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">peregrinus.</hi></note> were granted exemption from the conduct of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> war. It was decided that Valerius, the praetor, should go to Apulia, to take over the army from Terentius; that when the legions should arrive from Sicily, he should chiefly use these troops for the defence of that region; that Terentius' army should be sent to Tarentum under some one of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> lieutenants. And twenty-five ships were given him, that with them he might be able to defend the coast between Brundisium and
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Tarentum. An equal number of ships was assigned by decree to Quintus Fulvius, the city praetor, for the defence of the shore near the
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> city. Gaius Terentius as proconsul was given the task of conducting a levy of troops in the Picene territory and defending that
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> region. And Titus Otacilius Crassus, after dedicating the Temple of Mens on the Capitol, was sent with full authority to Sicily, where he was to command the fleet.</p> <pb id="p.115"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this conflict of the two richest peoples<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> in the world all kings and nations had turned their attention, among them
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Philip, king of the Macedonians, all the more since he was nearer to Italy and separated from it only by the Ionian Sea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On first learning by report that Hannibal had crossed the Alps, although he had rejoiced at the outbreak of war between the Romans and the Carthaginians, still, as their resources were not yet known, he had wavered, uncertain which of the two peoples he wished to have the victory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Now that a third battle, a third victory, favoured the Carthaginians, he inclined to the side of success and sent ambassadors to Hannibal. These avoided the ports of Brundisium and Tarentum, because they were kept guarded by Roman ships, and landed at the Temple of Lacinian Juno.<note>A famous temple on a promontory near Croton; cf. XXIV. iii. 3 ff.; XLII. iii. 2 ff.; Strabo VI. i. 11.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Making their way thence toward Capua by way of Apulia, they encountered the centre of the Roman forces and were brought before Valerius Laevinus, the praetor, whose camp was near Luceria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There Xenophanes, the leader of the embassy, boldly said that he had been sent by King Philip to negotiate a friendly alliance with the Roman people; that he had communications for the consuls and for the senate and the Roman people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The praetor, who in the midst of the revolts of old allies was greatly delighted by a new alliance with so famous a king, hospitably received enemies as guests.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He furnished men to escort them, to indicate the roads carefully, and what positions and what passes were held either by the Romans or by the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Xenophanes made his way through the Roman forces into <pb id="p.117"/>Campania and thence by the shortest road to the<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> camp of Hannibal, and arranged a treaty of friendship with him on the following terms: that King Philip with the largest possible fleet &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> it was thought that he would make it two hundred ships &mdash;should cross to Italy and ravage the coast, and should carry on the war on land and sea with all his might;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that after the war was over all Italy with the city of Rome itself should belong to the Carthaginians and Hannibal, and all the booty fall to Hannibal;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that after the complete subjugation of Italy they should sail to Greece and wage war with such enemies as the king might choose; and that such states on the mainland and such islands as face Macedonia should belong to Philip and be a part of his kingdom.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On terms such as these a treaty was made between the Carthaginian general and the ambassadors of the Macedonians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And Gisgo and Bostar and Mago, who were sent with them as ambassadors, to reassure the king himself, reached the same place, the Temple of Juno Lacinia, where a ship lay in a hidden anchorage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Setting out thence and making for the open sea, they were sighted by the Roman fleet which was defending the coasts of Calabria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And Valerius Flaccus sent light craft to pursue the ship and bring her back; whereupon the king's ambassadors at first attempted to flee. Then, when they saw that they were being outstripped in speed, they surrendered to the Romans and were brought before the admiral of the fleet.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he asked who they were and whence, and whither they were bound, Xenophanes at first set up the false pretence which had been quite successful once before: that, being sent by Philip to the Romans, he had made his way <pb id="p.119"/>to Marcus Valerius, the one man to whom there was<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> a safe road; that he had been unable to get across Campania, which was blocked by the enemy's forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, when Carthaginian dress and appearance cast suspicion on Hannibal's ambassadors, upon being questioned they were betrayed by their speech.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thereupon their attendants were led aside and frightened by threats; and a letter also from Hannibal to Philip was found, along with agreements between the king of the Macedonians and the Carthaginian general.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So much being established, it seemed best to send the captured men and their attendants as soon as possible to the senate at Rome, or else to the consuls, wherever they might be.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For that purpose five very swift ships were selected and Lucius Valerius Antias was sent to command them. And instructions were given him to distribute the ambassadors among all his ships, to be separately guarded; and he was to see to it that there should be no conversation among them or any interchange of plans.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>About the same time at Rome Aulus Cornelius Mammula, on retiring from his province of Sardinia, reported what was the condition of affairs in the island:
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that all were aiming at war and rebellion; that Quintus Mucius, his successor, upon arriving was affected by the unwholesome climate and bad water, and having contracted an illness not so dangerous as protracted, would for a long time be useless for the performance of war duties;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> also that the army there, while strong enough to garrison a peaceful province, was not so for the war which seemed on the point of breaking out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The senate thereupon decreed that Quintus Fulvius Flaccus should enlist five thousand <pb id="p.121"/>infantry and four hundred cavalry, and should see<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> to it that that legion should be transported to Sardinia at the first opportunity;
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> also that he should send whomever he thought best with full authority, to carry on the war until Mucius should recover.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For that duty Titus Manlius Torquatus was sent, a man who had been consul twice and censor, and in his consulship had conquered the Sardinians.<note>In his first consulship, <date value="-235">235 B.C.</date>; cf. xxii. 7.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> About the same time a fleet which had been sent from Carthage also to Sardinia, under command of the Hasdrubal who was surnamed Calvus, was damaged by a terrible storm and driven to the Balearic Islands.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> And there the ships were beached, to such an extent had not only the rigging but also the hulls been injured; and while undergoing repairs they caused a considerable loss of time.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Italy, while the war was less active after the battle of Cannae, since the resources of one side had been broken and the spirit of the other sapped, the Campanians attempted without assistance to reduce the state of Cumae to subjection, at first tempting them to revolt from the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When that failed, they contrived a ruse to entrap them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All the Campanians had a regular sacrifice at Hamae.<note>To the north-east of Cumae. An inscription gives some clue to its location.</note> To it they informed the men of Cumae that the Campanian senate would come, and requested that the senate of Cumae should come thither to deliberate together, so that both peoples might have the same allies and enemies. They said they would have an armed guard there, lest there be any danger from the Roman or the Carthaginian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Cumaeans, though they had suspected guile, made no objections, thinking that a ruse of their own<note>Their plan to aid the consul against the Campanians.</note> to outwit them could thus be concealed.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><pb id="p.123"/>
			<p>Meanwhile Tiberius Sempronius, the Roman consul,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> after reviewing his army at Sinuessa, at which place he had announced a date for mobilization, crossed the river Volturnus and pitched camp near Liternum. There, since the permanent camp lacked occupation, he required the soldiers to man&oelig;uvre frequently, that the recruits &mdash;they
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> were most of the slave-volunteers &mdash;might learn to follow the standards and to recognize their own ranks in the battle-line.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In this it was the commander's greatest care, and he had instructed the lieutenants and tribunes to the same effect, that no reproach of any man's previous lot should sow strife between the different classes of soldiers; that the old soldier should allow himself to be rated with the recruit, the freeman with the slave-volunteer; that they should consider all to whom the Roman people had entrusted its arms and standards as sufficiently honoured and well-born.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He said that the same fortune which had compelled them to do so now compelled them to defend what had been done.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These injunctions were not given with greater care by the commanders than that with which they were followed by the soldiers. And soon they were all united in a harmony so great that it was almost forgotten from what status each man had been made a soldier.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>While Gracchus was thus employed, legates from Cumae reported to him on what mission an embassy had come a few days before from the Campanians, and what answer they had themselves given them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that the festival was to be three days later, and not only would the whole senate be there, but a camp also and a Campanian army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Gracchus, having ordered the Cumaeans to bring everything from the <pb id="p.125"/>farms into the city and to remain inside the walls,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> moved his own camp to Cumae the day before the Campanians had their regular sacrifice. Hamae is three miles distant. Already the Campanians in large numbers had gathered there according to agreement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And in concealment, not far from there, Marius Alfius, the <hi rend="italics">medix tuticus,</hi><note>For this Oscan term cf. XXIV. xix. 2.</note> that is, the chief magistrate of the Campanians, had his camp, with fourteen thousand armed men, he being decidedly more intent upon preparing the sacrifice and contriving treachery during the same than upon fortifying his camp or upon any task of the soldier.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The sacrifice took place at night, but it was to be finished before midnight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Gracchus, thinking he must be in waiting for that moment, placed guards at the gates, that no one might be able to carry away news of his undertaking.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And having assembled his soldiers as early as the tenth hour of the day, he ordered them to get themselves in condition and take care to sleep, so that, as soon as it was dark, they might come together at the signal; and at about the first watch he ordered that the standards be taken up.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> And setting out with a silent column, he reached Hamae at midnight and entered the Campanian camp by all its gates at once; for, as was to be expected in view of the vigil, it was carelessly guarded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Some they slew as they lay asleep, others as they were returning unarmed after the rite had been completed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> More than two thousand men were slain in that affray by night, including Marius Alfius, the commander himself. Captured were . . . thousand men<note>The large number makes the correctness of <hi rend="italics">capta</hi> (sc. <hi rend="italics">milia</hi>) doubtful; cf. xxxvii. 11.</note> and thirty-four military standards.</p> <pb id="p.127"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gracchus, having captured the camp of<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> the enemy with the loss of less than a hundred soldiers, hastily withdrew to Cumae in fear of Hannibal, who had his camp on Mount Tifata above Capua. And he was not mistaken in his forecast.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For as soon as the defeat was reported at Capua, Hannibal, thinking he would find the army of recruits, largely slaves, at Hamae gloating for once over a success, spoiling the defeated and driving off the booty, rushed his column with all speed past Capua, and ordered that those of the fleeing
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> Campanians whom he met should be furnished with an escort and led to Capua, and the wounded carried on wagons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for himself, he found at Hamae a camp deserted by the enemy, and nothing except the traces of recent slaughter and corpses of his allies scattered everywhere. Some advised him to lead his troops away forthwith to Cumae and to attack the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although Hannibal was very eager to do so, in order that he might
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> have Cumae at least as a seaport, since he had been unable to gain one at Neapolis, nevertheless, as his soldiers in their rapidly moving column had brought out nothing but their arms with them, he withdrew again to his campon Tifata.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Moved by the importunities of the Campanians, he returned thence on the following day to Cumae with all the equipment for besieging the city, and after ravaging the territory of Cumae, pitched his camp a mile from the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Meanwhile Gracchus, ashamed to desert allies in such straits and begging for his help and that of the Roman people, rather than because he had full confidence in his army, had remained there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nor did the other consul, Fabius, who had his camp at Cales, venture to lead his army across the river Volturnus, being <pb id="p.129"/>employed at first in taking new auspices and then<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> with the portents which were being reported one after another.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And as he was making expiation, the soothsayers kept repeating their opinion that it was not easy to obtain favourable omens.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these reasons detained Fabius, Sempronius was blockaded and already beset by siege-works.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As a defence against a great wooden tower which was moved up to the city, the Roman consul reared from the wall itself another tower considerably higher. For he had used the wall, which in itself was quite high, as a base, shoring it up with stout timbers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From that tower the defenders first held the wall and the city by hurling stones and stakes and every other missile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Finally, seeing that the enemy's tower had been pushed close against the wall, they hurled a vast amount of fire all at once from their blazing torches.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While great numbers of armed men, alarmed by the fire, were leaping down from the tower, a sally out of two gates of the town at the same time routed the enemy's guards and sent them in flight to the camp, so that on that day the Carthaginian resembled a besieged army more than a besieger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> About one thousand and three hundred were slain and fifty-nine captured alive of the Carthaginians, who were relaxing and idling along the walls and
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> at guard-posts, and, having feared anything rather than a sally, had unexpectedly been overpowered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Gracchus, before the enemy could recover from their sudden fright, gave the signal for the recall and withdrew his men inside the walls. On the next day Hannibal, supposing that the consul, elated by success, would engage in a regular battle, drew up his line between the camp and the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <pb id="p.131"/>But on seeing that no one stirred from the usual<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> defence of the city and that nothing was entrusted to a rash hope, he returned with nothing accomplished to Tifata.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>At the same time that the siege of Cumae was raised, Tiberius Sempronius, surnamed Longus,<note>This Sempronius was consul with P. Scipio in <date value="-218">218 B.C.</date>, and defeated by Hannibal at the Trebia; XXI. vi. 3 and liv ff.</note> also fought successfully in Lucania, near Grumentum, with Hanno the Carthaginian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He slew above two thousand men, and captured two hundred and eighty soldiers and some forty-one military standards. Driven out of Lucanian territory, Hanno withdrew into the land of the Bruttians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And three towns of the Hirpini, Vercellium, Vescellium and Sicilinum, which had revolted from the Roman people, were forcibly recovered by Marcus Valerius, the praetor, and those who had advised revolt were beheaded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Over five thousand captives were sold at auction; the rest of the booty was given over to the soldiers, and the army led back to Luceria.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on in Lucania and among the Hirpini, the five ships which were carrying to Rome the captured ambassadors of the Macedonians and the Carthaginians cruised along nearly the whole coast of Italy from the Upper Sea to the Lower.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> from the Adriatic to the Mare Tuscum; cf. i. 5; xxiv. 8.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And when they were passing Cumae under sail, and it was uncertain whether they belonged to enemies or friends, Gracchus sent ships from his fleet to meet them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When in the course of questioning on both sides it was learned that the consul was at Cumae, the ships put in at Cumae and the prisoners were brought before the consul and the letters handed over to him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul, after reading the letters of Philip and Hannibal, sent everything under seal by land to the senate, and ordered the <pb id="p.133"/>ambassadors to be carried on the ships.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Letters<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> and ambassadors arrived at Rome on about the same day, and upon enquiry their words and the texts were in agreement. Thereupon the senators were at first gravely concerned, seeing how serious a war with Macedonia threatened, at a time when they could scarcely endure that with the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> However, they were so far from giving way to that concern that they at once discussed how by actual aggressive warfare they might keep the enemy away from Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The prisoners were ordered put in chains, their attendants were sold at auction, and it was decreed that, in addition to the twenty-five ships which Publius Valerius Flaccus commanded as admiral, twenty-five others should be made ready.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The latter being now ready and launched, with the addition of the five ships which had brought the ambassadors as captives, thirty ships sailed from Ostia for Tarentum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And Publius Valerius was ordered to put on board the soldiers who had been Varro's, and at Tarentum were commanded by Lucius Apustius, the lieutenant, and then with a fleet of fifty-five<note>The total should be fifty; the five which carried the captives are counted twice; cf. xxxiv. 9.</note> ships not merely to defend the coast of Italy, but to get information in regard to the Macedonian war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If the designs of Philip should agree with the letters and with the statements of the ambassadors, then he was to inform Marcus Valerius, the praetor, by letter;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and Valerius, after placing his lieutenant, Lucius Apustius, in command of the army, was to proceed to the fleet at Tarentum, and as soon as possible to cross into Macedonia and take steps to keep Philip within his kingdom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For the maintenance of the fleet and for the Macedonian war there was voted the money which had been sent to Appius Claudius in Sicily, to <pb id="p.135"/>be repaid to king Hiero.<note>Pay for the soldiers had been lent by him in the previous year; cf. xxi. 5. His successor presently took the Carthaginian side; XXIV. vi f.</note> This money was carried<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> to Tarentum by Lucius Antistius, the lieutenant.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At the same time two hundred thousand pecks of wheat and a hundred thousand of barley were sent by Hiero.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Romans were engaged in these preparations and activities, the one captured ship escaped while under weigh from those which had been sent to Rome,<note>Cf. xxxiv. 8 f.</note> and returned to Philip.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thus it became known that the ambassadors had been captured with the letter. And so the king, not knowing what had been agreed upon between his ambassadors and Hannibal, and what message the latter's ambassadors were to have brought to him, sent another embassy with the same instructions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As ambassadors to Hannibal there were sent Heraclitus, surnamed Scotinus,<note>This term (<quote>The Obscure</quote>) had been applied to the early philosopher of Ephesus of the same name, <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> <date value="-500">500 B.C.</date> A pointless marginal note may have got into the text here, displacing the adjective of place which would be expected with this unknown Heraclitus.</note> and Crito, the Boeotian, and Sositheus, of Magnesia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These succeeded in carrying and in bringing back instructions; but the summer was over before the king could make any active preparations. So effectual was the capture of a single ship and ambassadors in postponing a war which threatened the Romans.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Also in the vicinity of Capua both consuls were carrying on the war, now that Fabius, after finally making atonement for the prodigies,<note>Mentioned in xxxi. 15.</note> had crossed the Volturnus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The cities of Combulteria and Trebula and Austicula, which had revolted to the Carthaginian, were forcibly taken by Fabius, and in them Hannibal's garrisons and very many Campanians were captured.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And at Nola, just as in the previous year, the senate sided with the Romans, the common people with Hannibal, and secret plans were being formed for the <pb id="p.137"/>murder of the leading men and the betrayal of the<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That their undertaking should go no farther, Fabius led his army between Capua and the camp of Hannibal, which was on Tifata, and established himself above Suessula in the Claudian Camp.<note>Cf. xxxi. 3 and 5; xlvi. 9.</note> From there he sent Marcus Marcellus, the propraetor,<note>Really proconsul; cf. xxx. 18; xxxii. 2; xlviii. 2.</note> with the forces which he had to Nola, to serve as a garrison.</p> 
			<p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And in Sardinia under the direction of Titus Manlius, the praetor<note>Acting in place of the regular praetor; cf. xxxiv. 15.</note> the operations which had been neglected ever since Quintus Mucius, the praetor, was attacked by a serious malady, were resumed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Manlius, after beaching his warships at Carales and arming their crews,<note>Regularly called <hi rend="italics">socii navales,</hi> from the time when seamen and oarsmen were allies, while the soldiers on board were Romans.</note> in order to wage war on land, and receiving an army from the praetor, made up a total of twenty-two thousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With these cavalry and infantry forces he set out for the enemy's territory and pitched camp not far from the camp of Hampsicora. At that time Hampsicora, as it happened, had gone to the region of the Skin-clad Sardinians,<note>An earlier population living in the mountainous interior of the island and wearing goat-skins.</note> to arm their young men, in order to enlarge his forces. His son named Hostus was in command of the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He with the overconfidence of youth rashly went into battle, was routed and put to flight. About three thousand Sardinians were slain in that battle, some eight hundred taken alive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The rest of the army, at first wandering in flight through the farms and woods, then fled to the place to which it was reported that the commander had fled, a city named Cornus, the capital of that region.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And the war in Sardinia would have been ended by that battle, had not the <pb id="p.139"/>Carthaginian fleet commanded by Hasdrubal, which<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> had been carried by a storm to the Balearic Islands, arrived at the right moment to revive hopes for the rebellion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Manlius, when the arrival of the Punic fleet was reported, withdrew to Carales. By so doing he gave Hampsicora the opportunity to unite with the Carthaginian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Hasdrubal, after landing his forces and sending the fleet back to Carthage, set out with Hampsicora as his guide to lay waste the lands of allies of the Roman people. And he would have reached Carales, had not Manlius by confronting him with an army restrained him from his widespread devastation. At first camp faced camp at no great distance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then charges led to skirmishes with varying results. Finally they went into line of battle. With standards against standards they fought a regular engagement for four hours.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For a long time the Carthaginians made the issue uncertain, while the Sardinians were used to being easily defeated. Finally, when the slain and the fleeing Sardinians had covered the whole field, the Carthaginians also were routed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But when they tried to flee, the Roman general hemmed them in by a flank movement of the wing with which he had beaten back the Sardinians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was a slaughter after that, rather than a battle. Twelve thousand of the enemy were slain, Sardinians and Carthaginians reckoned together. About three thousand seven hundred were captured, and twenty-seven military standards.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>What more than all made it a famous and memorable battle was the capture of Hasdrubal, the commander, and Hanno and Mago, Carthaginian nobles, Mago being of the Barca
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> family and nearly related to Hannibal, while Hanno had advised the <pb id="p.141"/>Sardinians to rebel and had undoubtedly fomented<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> that war. And the Sardinians' generals made the battle no less notable by their deaths.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For Hostus, the son of Hampsicora, fell in battle, and also Hampsicora as he fled with a few horsemen, on hearing, not of
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the defeat only, but also of the death of his son, took his own life, doing this at night, that no one might come upon him and interfere with his attempt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For all the rest the same city of Cornus was a place of refuge, as before. Manlius with his victorious army attacked it and took it within a few days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then other cities also which had revolted to Hampsicora and the Carthaginians gave hostages and surrendered. From these cities Manlius exacted tribute and grain in proportion to the resources of each or its guilt, and led his army back to Carales.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There he launched his warships, took on board the soldiers he had brought with him, sailed for Rome, and reported to the senate the complete subjugation of Sardinia. He also turned over the tribute to the quaestors, the grain to the aediles, the captives to Quintus Fulvius, the praetor.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>About the same time Titus Otacilius, the praetor,<note>Here = <hi rend="italics">praefectus,</hi> commander of the fleet.</note> sailed with his fleet from Lilybaeum across to Africa, and after laying waste the country about Carthage, was steering thence toward Sardinia, to which it was reported that Hasdrubal had recently crossed from the Balearic Islands, when he encountered the fleet returning to Africa;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and in a slight engagement fought in open water he captured seven of their ships together with their crews. The rest were widely scattered by their fear quite as much as they had been by the storm.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><pb id="p.143"/>
			<p>About the same time, moreover, as it happened,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> Bomilcar arrived at Locri with the soldiers sent as reinforcements from Carthage and with elephants and supplies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In order to take him unawares Appius Claudius, with the pretence of making the round of his province, led his army in haste to Messana, and with wind and current in his favour crossed over to Locri.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Already Bomilcar had left that place, to join Hanno among the Bruttii, and the Locrians closed their gates against the Romans. Appius, having accomplished nothing by his great effort, returned to Messana.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The same summer Marcellus from Nola, which he held with a garrison, made frequent raids into the country of the Hirpini and the Samnites about Caudium and laid waste the whole
				<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> region with fire and sword so completely that he revived the Samnites' memory of their old disasters.<note>In the Samnite Wars, as narrated in books VII to X, especially their defeats at Suessula, <date value="-343">343 B.C.</date>, and at Sentinum, 295.</note> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly ambassadors were sent at once to Hannibal from both tribes, and they addressed the Carthaginian thus:<note>The speech is, of course, that of their leader.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>We were enemies of the Roman people, Hannibal, at first by ourselves, so long as our arms and our resources were able to defend us. When we had lost confidence in these, we attached ourselves to Pyrrhus, the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Abandoned by him we accepted an inevitable peace, and have remained in that peace for about fifty years, down to the time when you came to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is not more your courage and success than your singular kindness and consideration toward our citizens, whom you captured and then sent back to us, that so won us over to you that, so long as you were a friend safe and sound, we not only did not fear the Roman people, but not even the anger of the gods, if it is right to say so.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But in fact, <pb id="p.145"/>while you are not merely safe and victorious, but also<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> here present, although you could almost hear the wailing of our wives and children and could see the blazing houses, we have been so ravaged several times this summer that Marcus Marcellus, not Hannibal, appears to have been the victor at Cannae, and the Romans are boasting that you, having strength for but a single stroke, are inactive, as if you had spent your sting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For a hundred years we waged war with the Roman people, unaided either by commander or army from abroad, except that for two years Pyrrhus did not so much defend us with his resources as enlarge these by adding our soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I shall not boast of our successes, that two consuls and two consular armies were sent under the yoke by us, nor of any other events which have brought us either joy or fame. But the hardships and defeats which then befel us we can relate with less indignation than the things that are happening today.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Great dictators<note><hi rend="italics">E.g.</hi> Papirius Cursor, VIII. xxix ff.; again IX. xxxviii; five times consul.</note> and masters of the horse, two consuls and two consular armies, used each time to enter our territory.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Already they roam over our whole territory, not even in maniples, but after the manner of brigands, with less caution than if they were wandering in the country around Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The reason moreover is this: that you are not defending us, and at the same time our young men, who would be protecting us if they were at home, are all serving under your standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> I should be unacquainted both with you and your army if I were not to hold <pb id="p.147"/>it easy for one who, I know, has routed and laid low<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> so many Roman battle-lines to surprise our scattered plunderers, roaming without their standards wherever a man is drawn by even the vain hope of booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> To a few Numidians they will in any case fall a prey, and you will have sent us troops and at the same time will have rid Nola of its garrison, if only men whom you have considered worthy to be your allies are not judged by you unworthy to be taken under your protection and defended.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Hannibal replied that the Hirpini and Samnites were doing everything at once, reporting their losses, and asking for troops, and complaining that they were undefended and neglected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But they ought first to have reported, then asked for protection, finally, if this was not obtained, they should then, and not sooner, have complained that help had been besought in vain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He would lead his army, not into the territory of the Hirpini or the Samnites, in order not to be another burden, but into the nearest lands of allies of the Roman people. By devastating these he would satisfy his own army and drive the frightened enemy to a distance from them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the Roman war, if the battle of Lake Trasumennus was more celebrated than that of the Trebia, if Cannae than Trasumennus, he would overshadow the memory even of Cannae by a greater and more famous victory.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>With this answer and also with ample gifts he sent the ambassadors away. He himself set out, leaving a moderate force on Tifata, and proceeded with the rest of his army to Nola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hanno also came thither from the land of the Bruttii with reinforcements brought from Carthage and with the elephants. <pb id="p.149"/>Having pitched his camp not far away, Hannibal<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> found on enquiry that everything was very different from what he had heard from the legates of his allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For Marcellus had not done anything in such a way that it could be said to have been left to fortune or rashly left to the enemy. After reconnoitring, having strong forces and a safe refuge, he had gone out to forage, and every possible precaution had been taken, as though against Hannibal in person.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then on learning of the approach of the enemy, he kept his troops inside the walls. He ordered the senators of Nola to walk up and down on the walls, and to observe everything that went on among the enemy all around.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hanno, having come close to the wall, called out from their number Herennius Bassus and Herius Pettius to a conference, and when they came out with Marcellus' permission, he addressed them through an interpreter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He lauded Hannibal's courage and success.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He belittled the majesty of the Roman people, as wasting away along with their resources. And if these qualities were evenly matched, he said, as once they had been, nevertheless those who had found out how burdensome was Roman rule to the allies, how great had been Hannibal's indulgence even to all captives who called themselves Italians, these were bound to prefer Carthaginian alliance and friendship to Roman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If both consuls were at Nola with their armies, still they would be no more a match for Hannibal than they had been at Cannae; much less could one praetor with a few raw soldiers defend Nola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It was their own concern more than Hannibal's whether he took Nola by capture or by surrender. For he would take it, as he had taken Capua and Nuceria. But what a difference <pb id="p.151"/>there was between the lot of Capua and that of<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> Nuceria the men of Nola themselves knew, being situated about half-way between them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He did not wish to forecast what would happen to the city if captured, but assured them instead that if they surrendered Marcellus and Nola with the garrison, no one but themselves should name the terms on which they might enter alliance and friendship with Hannibal.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Herennius Bassus replied that for many years there had been friendship between the Roman people and that of Nola; that down to that time neither party regretted it, and for themselves, if with altered fortune they ought to have changed their loyalty, it was now too late to change.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If they were going to surrender to Hannibal, had they needed to send for a Roman garrison? With the men who had come to defend them they had allied themselves in everything, and it would be so to the end.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This conference deprived Hannibal of the hope of getting Nola by treachery. And so he completely invested the town, in order to attack the walls from all sides at once.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcellus, on seeing that Hannibal had approached the walls, drew up his line inside the gate and sallied out with a great uproar. Not a few were terrified by the first attack and slain. Then, when they had charged the attacking force and brought up equal numbers, the battle began to be a fierce one, and would have been among the most memorable, if a downpour of rain in heavy squalls had not separated the combatants.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That day, after beginning an engagement of no importance and merely inflaming their passions, they withdrew, the Romans into the city, the Carthaginians to the camp. For of <pb id="p.153"/>the Carthaginians not more than thirty,<note>The small number is probably an error of the copyists.</note> who were<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> terrified by the first sally, fell, of the Romans fifty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The rain continued incessantly throughout the night to the third hour of the next day. And so, although both sides were eager for the fray, they nevertheless kept within their fortifications that day.</p> 
			<p>On the third day Hannibal sent a part of his forces into the country about Nola to plunder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On observing this Marcellus at once drew up his troops in line. And Hannibal did not refuse battle. There was about a mile between the city and the camp. In that space &mdash;and there is only a plain around Nola &mdash;they met each other.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A shout raised on both sides recalled to a battle already begun the nearest men of the cohorts which had gone out to the farms for booty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And the men of Nola reinforced the Roman line. Marcellus praised them and ordered them to keep their place among the reserves and to carry off the wounded from the field; to refrain from fighting unless they should receive a signal from him. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The battle was doubtful. The generals were doing their utmost in cheering on their men, the soldiers in fighting. Marcellus bids them attack men defeated two days before, driven from Cumae in flight a few days earlier, beaten back from Nola the previous year by himself, the same commander, and other soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not all of the enemy, he said, were in the line of battle; the booty-hunters were roaming about the country, and those who were fighting were weakened by Campanian luxury, exhausted by wine and harlots and every kind of dissipation the whole winter through.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Gone was that force and energy, lost the strength of body and spirit with which they had crossed the ranges of the Pyrenees and the Alps. <pb id="p.155"/>Remnants only of those men were fighting, scarcely<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> able to hold up their weapons and their limbs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Capua had been Hannibal's Cannae. It was there that warlike courage had been extinguished, there the discipline of the soldier, there the past reputation, there the hope for the future.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While by thus reviling the enemy Marcellus was raising the spirits of his soldiers, Hannibal was uttering much more serious reproaches;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he recognized the same arms and standards which he had seen and had at the Trebia and Trasumennus, finally at Cannae; but as for the soldier, he had certainly led one man into winter quarters at Capua, and out of them a different man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <quote>Are you,</quote> he said, <quote>hardly able with great effort to hold out against a mere Roman lieutenant,<note>Again disparagement of Marcellus, as in xlii. 10.</note> and an engagement with a single legion and its auxiliaries &mdash;you, whom two consular armies combined have never withstood?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Marcellus with recruits and with reserves from Nola is now attacking us for the second time with impunity! Where is that soldier of mine who pulled Gaius Flaminius, the consul, down from his horse and carried away his head?<note>A somewhat different account in XXII. vi. 4.</note> Where the man who slew Lucius Paulus at Cannae?<note>Cf. XXII. xlix. 12.</note> Is the sword now blunted? Or are your right hands benumbed?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Or is it some other portent? You who, though few, were wont to defeat larger numbers, now in larger numbers with difficulty resist the few? You used to boast, brave men in speech, that if some one led you, you would take Rome by storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Look you, in a less difficult situation, here and now I wish to test your might and courage. Take Nola by storm, a city of the plain, not fenced by a river nor by the sea. From this place, a city of such wealth, I will either lead you, laden with booty and <pb id="p.157"/>spoils, or I will follow you whithersoever you shall<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> desire.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Neither encouragement nor reproaches had any effect in steadying their spirits.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Since they were everywhere beaten back, while the Romans' courage rose, as not only the general exhorted them, but the men of Nola also kindled their ardour for battle by shouting as evidence of their support, the Carthaginians retreated and were forced back into the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman soldiers were eager to assault the camp, but Marcellus led them back to Nola, in the midst of great rejoicing and congratulation on the part of the common people as well, who had previously been more inclined to the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of the enemy more than five thousand were slain that day, six hundred captured alive, and nineteen military standards and two elephants were taken, four killed in battle. Of the Romans less than a thousand were slain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The next day they spent under a tacit armistice, burying those slain in the battle on both sides.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Marcellus burned the spoils of the enemy, paying a vow to Vulcan. Two days later in anger on some account, I suppose, or in the hope of a more generous service, two hundred and seventy-two horsemen, partly Numidians, partly Spaniards, deserted to Marcellus. Their brave and loyal services were repeatedly employed by the Romans in that war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As a reward for their courage farm land was given after the war to the Spaniards in Spain, to the Numidians in Africa.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Hannibal, sending Hanno back from Nola into the country of the Bruttii with the forces with which he had come, himself sought winter quarters in Apulia and established himself near Arpi.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Quintus Fabius, <pb id="p.159"/>on hearing that Hannibal had gone into Apulia,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> brought in grain from Nola and Neapolis to the camp above Suessula, strengthened the fortifications, and left a garrison which was strong enough to hold the place through the winter season.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then moved his camp nearer to Capua and ravaged the Campanian territory with fire and sword, until the Campanians, who had no confidence at all in their own resources, were compelled to come out of the gates and fortify a camp in the open before the city. They had six thousand armed men, infantry unfit for war; but in cavalry they were more effective.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly they kept harassing the enemy by cavalry battles.</p> 
			<p>Among the many distinguished Campanian horsemen was Cerrinus Vibellius, surnamed Taurea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A citizen of that state, he was far the bravest horseman of all the Campanians, so much so that while he served with the Romans only one Roman, Claudius Asellus, rivalled him in reputation as a cavalryman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At this time Taurea, looking all around again and again, rode up to the squadrons of the enemy's cavalry and, when silence was at last obtained, asked where Claudius Asellus was, and why, since he had been in the
				<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> habit of disputing with him about their courage, did he not settle the matter with the sword and, if vanquished, give, or if victorious, take, the splendid spoils.<note>Strictly speaking the <hi rend="italics">opima spolia</hi> were those taken by a Roman general in command from the general of the enemy after a single combat; I. x. 4-7 (Romulus); IV. xx. 2 and 5-6 (Cossus); <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> 20 (Marcellus).</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this was reported to Asellus in the camp, he waited only to ask the consul whether he might fight out of the ranks against an enemy who <pb id="p.161"/>challenged him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With the consul's permission he at<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> once took up his arms, and riding out in front of the guard-posts he addressed Taurea by name and bade him engage wherever he pleased.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Already the Romans had gone out in crowds to that spectacle of a combat, and the Campanians who looked on had filled not only the earthwork of the camp but also the walls of the city. First calling attention to the affair by high-spirited words, they levelled spears and spurred their horses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, dodging each other in the open space, they prolonged the bloodless fray.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the Campanian said to the Roman: <quote>This will be a contest of horses, not of horsemen, unless we let our horses go down from the open field into this deep-cut road. There, with no room to avoid each other, we shall fight hand to hand.</quote> Almost sooner than said Claudius put his horse into the road.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Taurea, more spirited in words than in action, said: <quote>Never a nag, please, into a ditch!</quote><note>To be supplied is a verb, probably <hi rend="italics">demiseris.</hi> Colloquial <hi rend="italics">sis</hi> (=<hi rend="italics">si vis,</hi> an insistent <quote>please</quote>) merely strengthens the prohibition.</note> &mdash;words which have come down from that time as a farmer's parable.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Claudius rode a long way on that road, and then riding back to the field without meeting any enemy, returned as victor to the camp, reviling the cowardice of his enemy in the midst of great rejoicing and congratulations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this combat of horsemen some annals add what is certainly marvellous &mdash;how true, it is for everyone to judge &mdash;that, as Claudius was pursuing Taurea fleeing to the city, he rode in through the enemy's open gate and, while they were spellbound in amazement, escaped unharmed by the opposite gate.</p> <pb id="p.163"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereafter the winter quarters were<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> undisturbed, and the consul moved his camp back again, that the Campanians might do their sowing.<note>The time is early autumn.</note> And he did not ravage the Campanian country until the growing grain in the fields was tall enough to furnish fodder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This he transported to the Claudian Camp above Suessula and there built winter barracks. He ordered Marcus Claudius, the proconsul, to keep at Nola only the garrison needed to defend the city, and to send away the rest of the soldiers to Rome, lest they be a burden to the allies and an expense to the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And Tiberius Gracchus, after leading his legions from Cumae to Luceria in Apulia, sent thence Marcus Valerius, the praetor, to Brundisium with the army which he had had at Luceria, and ordered him to defend the coast of the Sallentine region<note>In the extreme south of Calabria; XXIV. xx. 16; XXV. i. 1.</note> and to take measures concerning Philip and the Macedonian war.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the end of the summer in which occurred the events I have described, there came a letter from Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, reporting how great and how successful had been their operations in Spain;<note>As told in XXII. xxii. and XXIII. xxvi ff.</note> but that money for pay, also clothing and grain, were lacking for the army, and for the crews everything. So far as pay was concerned, if the treasury was empty, they would find some method of getting it from the Spaniards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Everything else, they said, must in any case be sent from Rome, and in no other way could either the army or the province be kept. After the reading of the letter, there was no one among them all<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the senators present.</note> who did not admit that the statements were true and the demands fair.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But they reflected what great forces on land and sea they were maintaining, and how large a new fleet must soon be made ready <pb id="p.165"/>if a Macedonian war should begin; that Sicily and<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> Sardinia, which before the war had paid taxes in kind, were hardly feeding the armies that garrisoned those provinces;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that necessary expenses were met only by the property tax;<note>A direct tax paid by Roman citizens.</note> that the number of those who paid that particular tax had been diminished by such great losses of troops at Lake Trasumennus and also at Cannae; that if the few who survived should be burdened by a much greater levy, they would perish by another malady.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so they thought that, unless support should be found in credit, the
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> state would not be sustained by its assets;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that Fulvius, the praetor, must go before the assembly, inform the people of the public needs and exhort those who by contracts had increased their property to allow the state, the source of
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> their wealth, time for payment, and to contract for furnishing what was needed for the army in Spain, on the condition that they should be the first to be paid, as soon as there was money in the treasury.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To this effect the praetor addressed the people, and named a date on which he would let the contracts for furnishing clothing and grain to the army in Spain and whatever else was needed for the crews. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When that day came, three companies of nineteen members presented themselves to take the contracts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And their demands were two: one, that they should be exempt from military duty so long as they were in that public service, the other, that the cargoes which they shipped should be at the risk of the state, so far as concerned the violence of enemies and of storms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both demands being obtained, they contracted, and the state was carried on by private funds. Such character and such love of country pervaded all the classes virtually without <pb id="p.167"/>exception.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As all the supplies were magnanimously<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> contracted for, so they were delivered with great fidelity, and nothing was furnished to the soldiers less generously than if they were being maintained, as formerly, out of an ample treasury.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When these supplies arrived, the town of Iliturgi,<note>In southern Spain, on the upper course of the Baetis (Guadalquivir), destroyed by Scipio Africanus in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>; XXVIII. xx.</note> because of its revolt to the Romans, was being besieged by Hasdrubal and Mago and Hannibal, the son of Bomilcar.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Between these three camps of the enemy the Scipios made their way into a city of their allies with great effort and great loss to those that opposed them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And they brought grain, of which it had no supply, and encouraged the townspeople to defend their walls with the same spirit with which they had seen the Roman army fighting for them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then they led their troops to an attack upon the largest camp, which Hasdrubal commanded. To it also came the other two generals and two armies of the Carthaginians, seeing that the whole issue was at stake there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly a sally from the camp opened the battle. Sixty thousand of the enemy were in the battle that day, about sixteen thousand on the Roman side.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Yet so far was the victory from being uncertain that
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the Romans slew more than their own number, captured more than three thousand men, a little less than a thousand horses, fifty-nine military standards, seven elephants, five having been slain in battle. And they took the three camps that day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The siege of Iliturgi having been raised, the Carthaginian armies were led over to attack Intibili,<note>Apparently not far from Iliturgi; cf. Frontinus II. iii. 1. The only town of this name of which we hear elsewhere was on the east coast south of the Hiberus (Ebro).</note> while their forces were recruited from a province which, more than any <pb id="p.169"/>other, was eager for war, if only there was booty or<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> pay, and at that time was well supplied with young men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A second time there was a battle in regular line, with the same result for each side. Over thirteen thousand of the enemy were slain, over two thousand captured, with forty-two standards and nine elephants.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then indeed nearly all the peoples of Spain revolted to the Romans, and there were much greater achievements that summer in Spain than in Italy.</p></div1>

			<p>THE Campanians revolted to Hannibal. Mago, who was
				sent to Carthage to report the victory at Cannae, poured
				out before the entrance of the Senate House golden rings
				taken from bodies of the slain; and the tradition is that
				there were more than a peck of them. After that report
				Hanno, one of the Carthaginian nobles, tried to persuade the
				Carthaginian senate to sue for peace from the Roman people.
				And he did not carry it through, since the Barca faction
				protested loudly. Claudius Marcellus, a praetor, fought
				with success at Nola, making a sally from the city against
				Hannibal. Casilinum, beset by the Carthaginians,
				suffered so much from starvation that the besieged
				ate thongs, hides stripped off from shields, and rats.
				They lived on nuts sent down the river Volturnus by the
				Romans. The senate was recruited by one hundred and
				ninety-seven men from the equestrian order. Lucius
				Postumius, the praetor, was slain with his army by the
				Gauls. Gnaeus and Publius Scipio defeated Hasdrubal
				in Spain and made Spain their own. The remnant of the
				army of Cannae was relegated to Sicily, not to leave it
				except after the end of the war. Sempronius Gracchus,
				the consul, utterly defeated the Campanians. Claudius
				Marcellus, a praetor, routed and worsted Hannibal's
				army in battle at Nola, and was the first to give the Romans,
				exhausted by so many disasters, a better hope for the war.
				An alliance was formed between Philip, king of Macedonia,
				and Hannibal. The book also contains the successes
				gained over the Carthaginians by Publius and Gnaeus
				Scipio in Spain and by Titus Manlius, the praetor, in
				Sardinia. Hasdrubal, the general, and Mago and Hanno
				were captured by them. The army of Hannibal lived in
				such indulgence in winter quarters as to be weakened in
				body and spirit.</p></div1>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>HAVING returned from Campania to the land of<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> the Bruttii, Hanno,<note>He had been with Hannibal around Nola, and was sent back to the country of the Bruttii; XXIII. xlvi. 8.</note> with the Bruttii as supporters and guides, attacked the Greek cities,<note>Operations against Regium, Locri and Croton, barely mentioned in XXIII. xxx. 6 ff., are given here in greater detail. It is late autumn, <date value="-215">215 B.C.</date></note> which were all the more ready to remain in alliance with Rome because they saw that the Bruttii, whom they both hated and feared, had gone over to the side of the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Regium was the first city to be attacked, and some days were spent there to no purpose. Meantime the Locrians hastily brought grain and wood and the other things needed to supply their wants from the farms into the city, also that no booty might be left for the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And every day a larger crowd poured out of all the gates. Finally there were left in the city only six hundred men, who were made to repair walls and gates and to carry arms to the battlements.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Against the multitude made up of all ages and classes, wandering about the country, many of the unarmed, Hamilcar the Carthaginian sent out his cavalry. Forbidden to injure anyone, they interposed their squadrons merely to shut off from the city those who had scattered in flight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The commander himself, after capturing higher ground from which he could see the country and the city, ordered a cohort of Bruttii <pb id="p.177"/>to go up to the walls and call out the chief men of<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> the Locrians to a conference, and with a promise of Hannibal's friendship to encourage them to surrender the city. In the conference the Bruttians at first were not believed at all.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, when the Carthaginians were seen on the hills, and a few returning fugitives repeatedly asserted that all the rest of the multitude were in the power of the enemy, overcome by fear, they answered that they would consult the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> An assembly being at once called, all the fickle preferred political change and a new alliance; also those whose relations had been shut off outside the city by the enemy had mortgaged their affections, having virtually given hostages.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And the few silently approved of steadfast loyalty, rather than dared to declare and defend it. Hence surrender to the Carthaginians was voted with apparently unquestioned unanimity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After Lucius Atilius, commander of the garrison, and the Roman soldiers who were with him had been secretly led down to the harbour and put on ships to be carried to Regium, they admitted Hamilcar and the Carthaginians into the city on condition that a treaty be made at once on fair terms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The promise of such a treaty was almost broken after they surrendered, when the Carthaginian charged that the Roman had been allowed by trickery to go away, while the Locrians pleaded that he had escaped unaided.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Also the cavalry pursued him in the hope that possibly the current in the strait might delay the ships or bring them to shore. They did not indeed overtake the men they were pursuing, but they sighted other ships crossing the strait from Messana to Regium.<note>Not directly opposite Messana, but about seven miles to the southeast.</note> It was the Roman soldiers sent by Claudius, the <pb id="p.179"/>praetor, to garrison and hold the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so the<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> siege of Regium was at once raised.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Peace was granted the Locrians by Hannibal's order: they were, namely, to live in freedom under their own laws, the city to be open to the Carthaginians, the harbour in the power of the Locrians, the alliance to rest upon this basis: that the Carthaginian should help the Locrian, the Locrian the Carthaginian, in peace and in war.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus the Carthaginians were withdrawn from the strait, though the Bruttians were indignant because they had left Regium and Locri untouched, the cities which they had counted upon plundering.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so without aid they enlisted and armed 15,000 of their young men and set out to besiege Croton, another Greek city and on the sea, believing
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> that it would be a great addition to their resources if they should hold a fortified city and harbour on the seacoast.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It troubled them that they did not quite dare not to call the Carthaginians to their aid, for fear they might seem to have failed to act as became allies. At the same time they feared that, if the Carthaginian should again be rather an arbiter of peace than a helper in war, fighting to secure freedom for Croton might be profitless, as previously for Locri.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And thus it seemed best to send legates to Hannibal and gain assurance from him that Croton when captured should belong to the Bruttians. Hannibal having replied that decision in the matter lay with those on the ground, thus referring them to Hanno, they obtained no definite answer from Hanno.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He did not wish a city well-known and rich to be plundered, and he was hoping that, while the
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> Bruttian was besieging them and the Carthaginians <pb id="p.181"/>obviously neither approving nor helping the siege,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> they would all the more promptly come over to his side. At Croton there was among the citizens no one policy or common preference.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> One malady, so to speak, had attacked all the city-states of Italy, that the common people were at odds with the upper class, the senate inclining to the Romans, the common people drawing the state to the side of the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This disagreement in the city was reported to the Bruttians by a deserter: that Aristomachus was the leader of the plebeians and advised surrender of the city; also that in the sparsely inhabited city, with its walls at a great distance, there were only scattered posts and guards of the senators; that wherever plebeians were on guard there was free access to the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With the deserter as adviser and leader the Bruttians completely encircled the city, and being admitted by the plebeians, they took the whole city by assault, with the exception of the citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The optimates held the citadel, having previously prepared a place of refuge for such an emergency. To it Aristomachus also fled, as though he had advised surrendering the city to the Carthaginians, not to the Bruttians.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The city of Croton had a wall with a circuit of twelve miles before the coming of Pyrrhus to Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Since the desolation caused by that war scarcely half of the city was inhabited.<note>According to XXIII. xxx. 6 the city now had less than 2000 inhabitants.</note> The river which had flowed through the middle of the city now flowed past, outside the quarters which had numerous houses, and the citadel was far from the inhabited portions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Six miles from the famous city was a temple more <pb id="p.183"/>famous than the city itself, that of Lacinian Juno,<note>Cp. XXIII. xxxiii. 4. At that temple, the most celebrated shrine in Magna Graecia, Polybius found and used Hannibal's own inscription in Punic and Greek, recording his successes (Polyb. III. xxxiii. 18; lvi. 4), a document which Livy barely mentions (XXVIII. xlvi. 16). A single column of the temple still stands on the promontory. Livy is correct in regard to the distance from the city of Croton (<hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 9 km.).</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> revered by all the surrounding
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> peoples. There a sacred grove, which was enclosed by dense woods and tall fir-trees, had in its centre luxuriant pastures, where cattle of all kinds, being sacred to the goddess, used to pasture without any
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> shepherd. And at night the flocks of each kind would return separately to their stalls, being never harmed by wild beasts lying in wait, nor by the dishonesty of
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> men. Therefore great profits were made from the cattle, and out of the profits a massive golden column<note>Coelius the historian said that Hannibal, finding it was not merely plated, decided to carry it away, but was deterred by a dream; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> I. 48.</note> was wrought and consecrated. And the temple was famous for its wealth also, not merely for its
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> sanctity. They give it some pretended marvels also, as generally in places so noted. It is reported that in the space in front of the temple there is an altar whose ashes are never stirred by any
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> wind. But the citadel of Croton, on one side overhanging the sea, while the other slopes down toward the country, was once protected merely by its natural situation, but later encircled with a wall also, where, along the cliffs on the farther side, it had been taken by ruse of Dionysius,<note>Who captured Croton about <date value="-389">389 B.C.</date> and is said to have held it twelve years.</note> tyrant of
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Sicily. In that citadel, sufficiently safe, as it seemed, the optimates of Croton were at the time maintaining themselves, besieged even by their own plebs as well as by the
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Bruttians. Finally the Bruttians, seeing that the citadel was for their resources impregnable, were of necessity constrained to beg aid of
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hanno. He attempted to compel the Crotonians to surrender on condition that they <pb id="p.185"/>permit a colony of Bruttians to be established there,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> and allow the city, desolate and depopulated by wars, to recover its old-time
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> numbers. But among them all he prevailed upon no one except Aristomachus. They claimed that they would sooner die than mingle with the Bruttians and change to the rites, customs and laws, and presently even the language, of another
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> people. Aristomachus, since he was unable by persuasion to bring them to surrender and could find no opportunity to betray the citadel, as he had betrayed the city, alone went over to
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Hanno. Soon after that the Locrian legates entered the citadel with Hanno's consent and persuaded them to allow themselves to be transferred to Locri, and not to risk desperate
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> measures. Permission to that effect they had already obtained from Hannibal, having sent legates for that very purpose. So Croton was evacuated, and the Crotonians were led down to the sea and went on
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> shipboard. They went, the whole number of them,<note>The entire population, while <quote>Crotonians</quote> refers primarily to the optimates.</note> to Locri.</p> 
			<p>In Apulia even the winter was not without conflict between the Romans and Hannibal. Sempronius, the consul, was wintering at Luceria, Hannibal not far from
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Arpi. Skirmishes between them kept occurring as opportunity offered, or the favourable moment for one side or the other. And in consequence the Romans were better soldiers, daily more cautious and safer from surprise attacks.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Sicily everything had been changed for the Romans by the death of Hiero<note>For Hiero's family see the table on p. 338.</note> and the transfer of the kingdom to his grandson Hieronymus, a boy hardly able to keep his independence under control, much less absolute power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Such was the age, such <pb id="p.187"/>the disposition which guardians and friends took in<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> hand, to throw him into all the vices. Hiero, seeing that this would happen, is said in his extreme old age to have wished to leave Syracuse free, that kingly power gained and confirmed by good qualities might not come to an end in disgrace under the tyranny of a boy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This his plan was opposed might and main by his daughters, who thought the boy would have the kingly title, but that complete control would be in their hands and those of their husbands, Adranodorus and Zoippus, who were being left as the principal guardians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was not easy for a man now in his ninetieth year,<note>He lived more than ninety years according to Polybius VII. viii. 7.</note> surrounded day and night by the blandishments of women, to be independent and turn his attention from the personal to the public interest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly he merely left fifteen guardians for the boy, and dying entreated them to keep inviolate that loyalty to the Roman people which he had maintained for fifty years<note>In fact 48 years (263-<date value="-215">215 B.C.</date>).</note> and to choose above all to have the young man tread in his footsteps and continue the training in which he had been brought up. Such were his instructions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After he had breathed his last the guardians produced the will and brought the boy, at that time about fifteen years old, before an assembly of the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While a few men, who had been posted in all parts of the assembly to start applause, showed approval of the will, while the rest, as if deprived of a father and in an orphaned city, had only fears, the guardians &lt;took charge&gt;.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then came the king's funeral, honoured rather by the love and regard of the citizens than by the grief of his <pb id="p.189"/>family.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Soon afterwards Adranodorus removed the<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> rest of the guardians, saying that Hieronymus was now a young man and capable of ruling. And laying down his own guardianship, which was shared with a number of others, he took to himself alone the powers of them all.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It would have been difficult for any king, even a good one and self-controlled, to find favour with the Syracusans as successor to Hiero, so beloved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But certainly Hieronymus at his very first appearance showed how different everything was, just as if he wished by his vices to make them regret his grandfather.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For, though through so many years they had seen Hiero and his son Gelo<note>See note on XXIII. xxx. 11.</note> not differing from the rest of the citizens in garb or in any other distinction, they beheld purple and a diadem and armed attendants and a man who came forth from the
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> palace sometimes even in a chariot with four white horses after the manner of Dionysius the tyrant.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This haughty state and costume were suitably attended by contempt shown towards everyone, by haughty ears, insulting words, infrequent access, not only for outsiders but even for his guardians, by unheard of lusts, by inhuman cruelty.<note>See note on XXIII. xxx. 11.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Consequently such alarm had laid hold of all that some of the guardians anticipated the dreaded punishments either by suicide or by flight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Three of them, who alone had more intimate access to the palace, Adranodorus and Zoippus, the sons-in-law of Hiero, and a certain Thraso, were not indeed much listened to on other matters;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but as two of them were inclining to the Carthaginians, Thraso to alliance with Rome, by their partisan rivalry they were occasionally attracting the young man's attention, when a conspiracy <pb id="p.191"/>formed against the life of the tyrant was revealed<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> by one Callo, of the same age as Hieronymus and from boyhood accustomed to all the rights of intimacy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The informer was able to name but one of the conspirators, Theodotus, by whom he had himself been approached.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And Theodotus, at once seized and handed over for torture to Adranodorus,<note>Zoippus had been sent about this time to Egypt; xxvi. 1.</note> confessed without hesitation in regard to himself, but did not reveal his accomplices.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Finally, racked by all the tortures which pass human endurance, pretending to be mastered by his sufferings, he turned informer against the innocent instead of against his accomplices, and falsely stated that Thraso was responsible for the plan: that they would not have ventured upon such an undertaking if they had not relied upon so powerful a leader.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He also named attendants of the tyrant as associates, men whose lives, it occurred to him, as he was fabricating between pains and groans, were of the least account.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> His mentioning Thraso made the information particularly credible to the mind of the tyrant. Accordingly Thraso was forthwith handed over for execution, and the rest, equally innocent, shared his punishment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Not one of the accomplices either hid himself or fled, though their partner in the plot was long under torture. Such confidence was theirs in the courage and loyalty of Theodotus, and such will-power to keep secrets did Theodotus himself possess.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus as soon as Thraso,
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> who was the sole link to
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> an alliance
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> with the Romans, had been removed from their midst, matters
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> at once tended unquestionably
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> toward defection. And ambassadors<note>Livy mentions only Hannibal's envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Polybius gives the names of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> two sent from Hieronymus' court, viz.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Polyclitus and Philodemus (
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ii. 2).</note> were sent to Hannibal, and he sent back with a young noble named Hannibal<note>This Hannibal was only a trierarch; <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> &sect; 3.</note> also Hippocrates and Epicydes, <pb id="p.193"/>who were born at Carthage but Syracusans by origin<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> (their grandfather being an exile), Carthaginians themselves on the mother's side. Through these men an alliance was made between Hannibal and the tyrant of Syracuse, and with Hannibal's consent they remained with the tyrant.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Appius Claudius, the praetor, whose province was Sicily, on learning of this, forthwith sent legates to Hieronymus. While they were saying that they had come to renew the alliance which they had had with his grandfather, they were heard with derision and dismissed by Hieronymus, who in jest asked what success they had had in the battle at Cannae; for Hannibal's envoys reported what was scarcely to be believed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He wished to know, he said, what the truth was, that he might accordingly determine from which side he had the more to hope.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans departed, saying that they would return to him when he began to give a sober hearing to embassies, and warning rather than asking him not to be rash in changing his loyalty. Hieronymus sent ambassadors to Carthage to make a treaty in accordance with the alliance arranged with Hannibal. The agreement was that, after they had driven the Romans out of Sicily (and this would be shortly done if <hi rend="italics">they</hi> would send ships and an army), the river Himera, which nearly divides the island in halves, should be the boundary of the kingdom of Syracuse and the Carthaginian empire.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thereupon, puffed up by the flatteries of those who bade him remember not Hiero only but also King Pyrrhus, his maternal grandfather,<note>Pyrrhus seems to have been his mother's grandfather; see table on p. 338.</note> Hieronymus sent another embassy, through which he declared it was fair for them to yield all Sicily to him, and for the Carthaginian people to seek their own dominion over Italy. <pb id="p.195"/>At this trifling and boastful spirit in a madcap youth<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> they did not wonder, nor find fault either, provided they made him break with the Romans.</p> 
			<p>VII. But in everything he was on the verge of ruin.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For after sending Hippocrates and Epicydes in advance, each with two thousand armed men, to attack the cities which were held by Roman garrisons, he too setting out with all the rest of the army &mdash;and they were about fifteen thousand infantry and cavalry &mdash;had gone to Leontini.<note>Northwest of Syracuse and looking down on a lake and the plain of Catana; captured by Marcellus, xxx. 1.</note> The conspirators all of whom, as it happened, were in the army, took possession of an empty house looking down upon the narrow street by which the king used to go down to the market-place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There, while the rest, drawn up under arms, were to stand waiting for him to pass, one of them &mdash;his name was Dinomenes &mdash;, as being a body-guard, was assigned the r&ocirc;le of halting, on some pretext, the column following the king in the narrow street, when he approached the door of the house. This was carried out as had been arranged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Dinomenes, raising one foot and pretending to loosen a knot drawn too tight, delayed the crowd and caused such a gap that, when the attack on the king was made as he passed without guards, he was stabbed with several thrusts before help could reach him. On hearing the shouting and uproar they hurled their weapons at Dinomenes, who was now obviously blocking the way.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the midst of these, however, he escaped with only two wounds. The guards fled as soon as they saw the king lying there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Of the assassins some proceeded to the market-place and into a crowd which rejoiced in its freedom, some to Syracuse to forestall the designs of Adranodorus and the other supporters of the king. In the unsettled <pb id="p.197"/>state of affairs Appius Claudius, seeing a war<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> beginning near at hand, informed the senate by letter that Sicily was being won over to the Carthaginian people and Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For his own part, to meet the schemes of the Syracusans, he concentrated all his garrisons on the frontier between the province and the kingdom.<note>In <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date> Hiero as a faithful ally for 22 years was allowed to keep the eastern end of the island (about one-fourth, and not including Messana).</note></p> 
			<p>At the end of that year Quintus Fabius<note>The Delayer, consul this year and the next (five times in all), dictator in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date></note> by the authority of the senate fortified and garrisoned Puteoli, which as a commercial centre had grown in population during the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then, while on his way to Rome to hold the elections, he proclaimed them for the first date available for an election, and without stopping passed the city and came down to the Campus.<note>Thus he retains full military authority, which would not be the case if he had entered the city; cp. ix. 2.</note> On the day set the right to vote first fell to the century of the younger men of the Aniensis tribe, and it named Titus Otacilius and Marcus Aemilius Regillus as consuls. Thereupon Quintus Fabius, after silence had been made, spoke somewhat as follows:</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>If we had either peace in Italy or such a war and such an enemy that there was ample room for carelessness, should someone interpose any delay to the enthusiasm which you bring to the Campus in order to entrust magistracies to the men of your choice, such a man would seem to me forgetful of your freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But since in this war, in dealing with this enemy, never has a mistake been made by any commander without huge losses to us, you ought in electing consuls to enter the polls with the same seriousness with which you go into battle-line under arms, and each man should say to himself: 'I name as consul a man who is a match for Hannibal the general.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This year at Capua, when Vibellius <pb id="p.199"/>Taurea, a distinguished Campanian knight,<note type="margin">B.C. 215</note> challenged, Asellus Claudius, a distinguished Roman knight, was matched against him.<note>Cf. XXIII. xlvii.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Against the Gaul who once challenged at the bridge over the Anio our ancestors sent Titus Manlius,<note>Cf. VII. x. 2 ff.</note> who relied upon his courage and his strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was the same reason, I am inclined to admit, why not many years later Marcus Valerius<note>Also in Book VII (xxvi. 2 ff.).</note> found no lack of confidence in him when he took up arms for the fray against a Gaul who made a like challenge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Just as we desire to have foot and horse stronger than those of the enemy, if not, then a match for him, so let us seek a general who is a match for the commander of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When we shall have chosen the man who is the greatest commander in the state, nevertheless, although suddenly chosen, elected for a single year, he will be pitted against an experienced permanent general, hampered by no restrictions of time or authority to prevent him from doing and directing everything as the phases of the war shall require.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But with us the year rolls round in mere preparation and while we are just beginning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having sufficiently stated what kind of men you ought to elect as consuls, it remains for me to say a few words in regard to those to whom the favour of the first century to vote has inclined.

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The rites which concerned peace with the gods being now completed, the consuls laid before the senate the condition of the state and the conduct of the war, and what forces there were and where severally stationed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was voted to carry on the war with eighteen legions;<note>Not including those in Spain.

				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To make up this number of legions six new legions had to be enrolled. <pb id="p.211"/>The consuls were ordered to enroll them as soon as<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> possible, and to furnish a fleet, so that, including the ships at anchor defending the coast of Calabria, the fleet should amount that year to a hundred and fifty warships.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After conducting the levy and launching a hundred new ships, Quintus Fabius held an election for the choosing of censors. Marcus Atilius Regulus and Publius Furius Philus were elected.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As the rumour that there was a war in Sicily spread more widely, Titus Otacilius was ordered to set sail thither with his fleet. Owing to the lack of sailors<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> <date value="-220">220 B.C.</date>; XXIII. xxiii. 5.</note> the consuls in accordance with a decree of the senate issued an edict that a man who in the censorship of Lucius Aemilius and Gaius Flaminius<note>Meaning chiefly <hi rend="italics">remiges</hi>, who pulled the long oars and were in general slaves; cf. XXVI. xxxv.</note> had been rated &mdash;either he or his father &mdash;at from 50,000 to 100,000 asses, or if his property had since increased to that amount, should furnish one sailor provided with six months' pay;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that one who had more than 100,000 and up to 300,000 should furnish three sailors and a year's pay; he who had over 300,000 and up to a million asses, five sailors; he who had over a million, seven; that senators should furnish eight sailors and a year's pay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The sailors furnished in accordance with this edict went on board armed and equipped by their masters, and with cooked rations for thirty days. It was the first time that a Roman fleet was manned with crews secured at private expense.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This extraordinary preparation particularly alarmed the Campanians, for fear the Romans might begin that year's war with a siege of Capua. Accordingly they sent legates to Hannibal to beg him to bring his army to Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> New armies, they said, <pb id="p.213"/>were being enrolled at Rome for besieging it, and the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> defection of no city had more embittered the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since they reported this with such excitement, Hannibal, thinking he must make haste, lest he be anticipated by the Romans, set out from Arpi and established himself by Tifata in his old camp above Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then leaving Numidians and Spaniards to defend the camp and Capua at the same time, he came down with the rest of his army to the Lake of Avernus, with the pretext of sacrificing,<note>Probably in connection with the necromancy practised at Avernus.</note> in reality to attack Puteoli and the garrison which was there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Maximus, on being informed that Hannibal had left Arpi and was returning to Campania, without interrupting his journey by day or night returned to the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And he ordered Tiberius Gracchus to bring his troops from Luceria to Beneventum, and Quintus Fabius, the praetor &mdash;he was the consul's son &mdash;, to relieve Gracchus at Luceria.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Two praetors set out at the same time for Sicily, Publius Cornelius to the army, and Titus Otacilius to take command of the sea-coast and of naval operations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And the others set out for their several assignments, and those whose commands had been prolonged held the same regions as in the previous year.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Hannibal was at the Lake of Avernus five-noble young men came to him from Tarentum, some of whom had been captured at the Lake of Trasumennus, others at Cannae, and sent to their homes with that same courtesy which the Carthaginian had shown toward all allies of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Mindful of his favours, they reported that they had induced a large part of the young men of Tarentum to prefer the friendship and alliance of Hannibal to <pb id="p.215"/>those of the Roman people; and that, as legates<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> sent by their people, they asked Hannibal to bring his army nearer to Tarentum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If his standards, if his camp should be seen from Tarentum there would be no delay in the surrender of the city; that the common people were in the power of the younger men, the Tarentine state in the hands of the common people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal praised them and overwhelmed them with great promises, and bade them return home to carry out their undertaking promptly; that he would be there at the right moment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> With this hope the Tarentines were sent away. He himself had conceived a great desire to gain possession of Tarentum. He saw that the city was not only rich and famous but also a seaport, and favourably placed in the direction of Macedonia, and that accordingly King Philip, if he should cross into Italy, would make for this port, since the Romans held Brundisium.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, after accomplishing the rite for which he had come, and devastating the territory of Cumae as far as the promontory of Misenum, while he lingered there, he suddenly headed his column toward Puteoli, to surprise the Roman garrison.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were six thousand men and the place was defended by a wall also, not merely by nature. There the Carthaginian tarried three days, attacking the garrison from every side; and then, when he met with no success, he set out to ravage the territory of Neapolis, rather in anger than with the hope of taking the city.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>His coming into a neighbouring region aroused the common people of Nola, who had long been estranged from the Romans and hostile to their own senate. Consequently legates came to invite Hannibal, bringing a definitive promise to surrender the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <pb id="p.217"/>Marcellus, the consul, was called in by the leading<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> men and forestalled their undertaking. From Cales he had hastened in one day to Suessula, though the river Volturnus had delayed his crossing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thence he sent six thousand infantry and three hundred horsemen that night into Nola, to defend the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And whereas the consul did everything with energy, in order to anticipate him in occupying Nola, Hannibal was wasting time, having twice already made the vain attempt, and being now less inclined to believe the men of Nola.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time not only did Quintus Fabius, the consul, come to Casilinum, to attack the city, held by a Carthaginian garrison,<note>Since Hannibal had captured the city; XXIII. xix; 15 f.; xx. 1.</note> but also, as if by prearrangement, Hanno, with a large force of infantry and cavalry, from the land of the Bruttii, came to Beneventum from one side, while on the other side Tiberius Gracchus came to it from Luceria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The latter at first entered the town, and then, on hearing that Hanno had pitched his camp about three miles from the city by the river Calor, and from that point was ravaging the country, he likewise left the city and pitched camp about a mile from the enemy. There he held an assembly of the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The legions he had were largely made up of slave-volunteers, who now for two years had preferred silently to earn their freedom rather than openly to demand it. Yet as he came out of winter quarters he had been aware that there was murmuring in the column, as they asked whether they were ever at all to serve as free men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And he had written to the senate, not so much what they wanted as what they had deserved; that he had had good and brave service from them up to that time, and that they lacked <pb id="p.219"/>nothing toward the standard of the real soldier except<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> their freedom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this matter he had been given permission to do whatever he thought to be for the good of the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so, before engaging the enemy, he announced that the time had come for them to gain the freedom for which they so long had hoped; that the next day he would fight, standards against standards, in a clear and open field, where without any fear of ambush the battle could be fought with pure courage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whoever should bring back the head of an enemy would by his order be a free man at once.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whoever retreated from his post would meet the punishment of a slave. Each man's fortune was in his own hand. The giver of their freedom would be not merely himself, but the consul Marcus Marcellus, but the whole senate, for they had been consulted by him and had given him permission in the matter of their freedom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then read the letter of the consul and the decree of the senate. Upon that a shout was raised with great applause. They clamoured for battle and with high spirit insisted that he give the signal at once.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Gracchus announced a battle for the morrow and dismissed the assembly. The soldiers were happy, especially those for whom freedom was to be the reward of a single day's service, and spent the rest of the day in putting their arms in order.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the next day, when the signals began to sound, these soldiers were the first of all to assemble at headquarters, ready and in formation. After sunrise Gracchus led his troops out into line, and the enemy did not delay the battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had seventeen thousand infantry, mostly Bruttians and Lucanians, twelve hundred cavalry, among them very few <pb id="p.221"/>Italians, nearly all the rest Numidians and Mauri.<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> The battle was fierce and long; for four hours it did not incline either way.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And nothing hampered the Romans more than that enemies' heads were made the price of freedom. For when a man had boldly slain an enemy, in the first place he was wasting time in cutting off the head with difficulty in the confusion and turmoil;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and then, as his right hand was occupied in holding the head, the bravest had ceased to be fighters, while the battle was turned over to the spiritless and the fearful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the tribunes of the soldiers reported' this to Gracchus: that they were not wounding a single enemy standing, but butchering the fallen; and that in the soldier's right hands there were human heads instead of swords, he ordered the command at once given that they should throw away the heads and attack the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their courage, he said, was sufficiently clear and conspicuous, and for active men freedom would be beyond a doubt. Thereupon the battle Was renewed, and the cavalry also charged the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since the Numidians met this charge gallantly and the cavalry battle was no less spirited than that of the infantry, the issue was for the second time made doubtful. While the commanders on both sides heaped abuse, the Roman on the Bruttians and Lucanians, so many times defeated and subdued by their ancestors, the Carthaginian on the Roman slaves and prison-house
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> .soldiers, Gracchus finally declared that they had no reason to hope for freedom, unless on that day the enemy should-be routed and put to flight. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Those words at last so fired their courage that, as though they were suddenly different men, they raised a shout again and charged the enemy <pb id="p.223"/>with such force that they could no longer be<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> withstood.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At first the front line<note>Livy often applies Roman military terms to the enemy's army. Here <hi rend="italics">signa</hi> suggests a second line somewhat like the Roman <hi rend="italics">principes.</hi> Cf. XXII. v. 7 for <hi rend="italics">antesignani.</hi></note> of the Carthaginians, then the second was in confusion; finally the whole line was forced back. Then it was unmistakeable flight, and fleeing they dashed into their camp in such fright and excitement that no one halted even at the gates or on the wall. And the Romans, pursuing in almost unbroken column, fought an entirely new battle while hemmed in by the enemies' wall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There the battle was indeed more hampered in a confined space, but the slaughter was more savage. And they were aided by the captives, who, seizing weapons during the confusion and advancing in a mass, slashed the Carthaginians from the rear and also hindered their flight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so out of that great army less than two thousand men, mainly cavalry at that, escaped along with the general himself. All the rest were slain or captured. Captured were also thirty-eight standards. Of the victors about two thousand fell.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All the booty except the captives was given to the soldiers. Cattle also were excepted, if the owners should identify them within thirty days.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When they had returned to camp laden with booty, about four thousand of the slave-volunteers, who had fought with less spirit and had not dashed into the camp with the others, for fear of punishment occupied a hill not far from the camp. The next day they were brought down by military tribunes and arrived after an assembly of the soldiers had been called by Gracchus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There the proconsul first presented military decorations to the old soldiers, to each according to his valour and his part in that battle;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and then he said that, so far as the slave-volunteers <pb id="p.225"/>were concerned, he preferred to have all of them, the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> . worthy and the unworthy, praised by himself, rather than to have any one of them punished that day;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that, with the prayer that it might be good and happy and fortunate for the state and for the men themselves, he ordered them all to be free.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At these words they raised a shout with great enthusiasm, and now embracing and congratulating each other, now raising their hands to heaven, they prayed for every blessing for the Roman people and for Gracchus himself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thereupon Gracchus said: <quote>Before making you all equals by the right of freedom, I wished to stamp not one man of you with the mark of a brave or of a cowardly soldier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But now, the promise made in the name of the state being already fulfilled, to prevent the loss of every distinction between valour and cowardice, I shall order the names of those who, remembering their refusal to fight, left us a while ago to be reported to me;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and summoning them one by one I shall make them swear that, excepting men who shall have illness as an excuse, they will take food and drink standing only, so long as they shall be in the service. This penalty you will bear with patience, if you will reflect that you could not have been marked with any slighter sign of cowardice.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He then gave the signal to pack baggage, and the soldiers carrying and driving their booty returned with sport and mirth so gaily to Beneventum that they
				<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> seemed to be returning from a feast on a day of general festivity, not from a battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All the people of Beneventum, having come out <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> to the gates to meet them, embraced the soldiers, congratulated them, invited them into their houses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Feasts had been made ready by all in the atria<note>Thus the good things could be seen through the open door, as in XXV.<hi rend="italics"></hi>xii. 15: <hi rend="italics">apertis ianuis in propatulo epulati sunt.</hi></note> of <pb id="p.227"/>their houses. To these they invited the soldiers and<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> implored Gracchus to allow the soldiers to feast. And Gracchus did permit them, provided they all feasted in the open, each before the door of his house.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Everything was brought out. Wearing caps<note>The <hi rend="italics">pilleus</hi> was evidence of freedom, as was the <hi rend="italics">lana alba.</hi></note> or white woollen headbands the volunteers feasted, some reclining, and some standing served and ate at the same time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> This seemed to deserve the order Gracchus gave on his return to Rome for a representation of that day of festivity to be painted in the Temple of Liberty which his father, with money yielded by fines, caused to be built on the Aventine and dedicated.<note>The closing words are possibly copied from an inscription on the temple. The father was consul in <date value="-238">238 B.C.</date></note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on about Beneventum, Hannibal, after ravaging the territory of Neapolis, removed his camp to Nola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consul learned of his approach, summoning Pomponius, the propraetor, with the army which was in camp<note><hi rend="italics">Castra Claudiana;</hi> XXIII. xxxi. 3 and elsewhere. Pomponius must have been relieved of his duties in the North (x. 3).</note> above Suessula, he prepared to advance to meet the enemy and to engage without delay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He sent Gaius Claudius Nero with the best of the cavalry out by the gate farthest from the enemy in the silence of the night, and commanded him to ride around unseen and follow the enemy's column slowly, and when he saw that the battle had begun, to throw himself upon their rear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whether it was by losing the way that Nero was unable to carry this out, or from the shortness of the time, is uncertain. After the battle had begun in his absence, the Roman indeed unquestionably had the upper hand; but since the cavalry were not there at the right moment, the <pb id="p.229"/>prearranged plan for the battle was ruined.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcellus,<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> not venturing to pursue the retreating, gave his men, victorious though they were, the signal to retire.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> More than two thousand of the enemy, however, are said to have been slain that day, of the Romans less than four hundred.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> About sunset Nero, returning with his horses and men exhausted to no purpose by their efforts for a day and a night, without even seeing the enemy, was sternly rebuked by the consul, who went so far as to say that it was his fault that the disaster suffered at Cannae was not paid back to the enemy.<note>Cannae was avenged by this Nero and his colleague Livius at the Metaurus, <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>; XXVII. xlviii f.; xlix. 5.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the next day the Roman went into line of battle, while the Carthaginian, beaten, as he tacitly admitted also, remained in camp. The third day, giving up hope of capturing Nola, an undertaking which had never prospered, he set out in the dead of night for Tarentum, led by a surer hope of its betrayal.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And it was with no less spirit that the Roman state was administered at home than in the field.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The censors, freed from the charge of contracting for public works on account of the emptiness of the treasury, turned their attention to the control of morals and the punishment of vices which had sprung from that war, just as bodies suffering from long illnesses of themselves produce defects.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> First they summoned those who after the battle of Cannae were said to have abandoned the state. The foremost among them, Marcus Caecilius Metellus,<note>For his plan to leave Italy cf. XXII. liii. 5, where his praenomen is Lucius.</note> happened at this time to be quaestor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Inasmuch as he and the rest of those guilty of the same offence, on being ordered to plead their cases, proved unable <pb id="p.231"/>to clear themselves, the censors gave their verdict<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> that in conversation and formal speeches they had attacked the state, in order to form a conspiracy to desert Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next after them were summoned those who had been too crafty in interpreting the discharge of an oath, &mdash;those of the captives who, after setting out and then returning secretly to Hannibal's camp, thought the oath they had sworn, that they would return, had been discharged.<note>So ten of them pretended to think, XXII. lxi. 8. Another version (<hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> 4 and lviii. 8) had only a single perjurer.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From these men and those mentioned above their horses, if they had such from the state, were taken away, and all were ejected from their tribes and made <hi rend="italics">aerarii.</hi><note>Transfer to one of the four city tribes was a degradation, but, since the reform of <date value="-312">312 B.C.</date>, <hi rend="italics">aerarii</hi> (<quote>taxpayers only</quote>) were allowed to vote and serve in the army.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And the diligence of the censors did not confine itself to regulating the senate and the order of the knights. From the lists of the younger men they culled the names of all who during four years had not served, without having had a legitimate exemption from the service or ill health as an excuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And of these above two thousand names were placed on the list of the <hi rend="italics">aerarii,</hi> and they all were ejected from their tribes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And to this relentless stigma of the censors was added a severe decree of the senate that all of those whom the censors had stigmatised should serve on foot and be sent to Sicily, to the remnant of the army of Cannae. For this class of soldiers the term of service was not at an end until the enemy should be driven out of Italy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Since the censors on account of the emptiness of the treasury now refrained from letting contracts for the maintenance of temples and the furnishing of horses<note>The two-wheeled vehicles (<hi rend="italics">tensae</hi>) which carried attributes of the Capitoline deities in procession to the Circus were usually drawn by four horses.</note> used in religious processions and for similar <pb id="p.233"/>matters, those who had been in the habit of such<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> ; bidding<note>At sales and the letting of contracts a spear (<hi rend="italics">hasta</hi>) symbolised the authority of the state, and gave its name to the proceedings.</note> came in large numbers to the censors, and urged them to take action and let contracts at once for everything, just as if there were money in the treasury;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that no one would claim his money from the treasury until the war was over.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then came the owners of the slaves Tiberius Sempronius had manumitted at Beneventum, and said they had been summoned by the bank commissioners<note>Cf. XXIII. xxi. 6. These emergency officials (<hi rend="italics">triumviri mensarii</hi>) evidently served for some years; cf. XXVI. xxxvi. 8.</note> to receive the price of their slaves; but that they would not receive it until the war was over.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Such being now the tendency of the people to relieve the poverty of the treasury, funds, first of wards, and then of widows and single women, began also to be turned in; for those who brought in the sums believed that nowhere could they deposit them with a sense of greater safety and honesty than under the guarantee of the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thereafter when anything was purchased or provided for wards and widows and single women, it was paid for by an order of a quaestor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> This generosity of private citizens spread from the city also even to the camps, so that no knight, no centurion accepted pay, and the man who did accept was reproachfully called a hireling.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quintus Fabius, the consul, had his camp near Casilinum, which was held by a garrison of two thousand Campanians and seven hundred of Hannibal's soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In command was Statius Metius, who had been sent by Gnaeus Magius, of Atella (who was the <hi rend="italics">medix tuticus</hi><note>Cf. XXIII. xxxv. 13; XXVI. vi. 13.</note> that year), and Metius had armed slaves and plebeians without distinction, in order to <pb id="p.235"/>make an attack upon the Roman camp while the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> consul was occupied with the siege of Casilinum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of all this nothing escaped Fabius. So he sends word to his colleague at Nola that he needs the other army, to face the Campanians while Casilinum was being besieged:
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> either Marcellus should leave a suitable garrison at Nola and come in person, or if Nola held him back and there was still danger from Hannibal, he would himself summon Tiberius Gracchus, the proconsul, from Beneventum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On receiving this message Marcellus left two thousand soldiers as a garrison at Nola, and with the rest of his army came to Casilinum; and upon his arrival the Campanians, who were already bestirring themselves, became inactive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So began the siege of Casilinum by the two consuls. Since in this operation the Roman soldiers rashly approaching the walls were receiving many wounds and the undertaking was not successful, Fabius thought that they should give up a small affair which was as difficult as great ventures, and that they must leave the place, since greater matters were impending.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcellus, saying that, while there were many places which great generals ought not to attack, yet, once the attack has begun, they should not give them up, since reputation has great influence in both directions, carried his point, not to depart while their attempt was unsuccessful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then while sheds and all other kinds of siege-works and apparatus<note>Catapults, towers, rams, etc. Movable sheds protected the besiegers.</note> were being brought up, and the Campanians were begging Fabius for permission to go to Capua in safety, after a few had left the city, Marcellus occupied the gate by which they were leaving.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And a general slaughter began,<note>Livy touches lightly upon Marcellus' apparent ruthlessness; cf. xxxix. 7.</note> first around the gate, and then, as the troops burst in, <pb id="p.237"/>even inside the city. About fifty Campanians who<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> had left the city first sought refuge with Fabius and, escorted by his men, reached Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Casilinum was captured, as opportunity offered during the conversations and the delay due to those who begged a promise of protection. And the captives, whether Campanians or of Hannibal's soldiers, were sent to Rome and there imprisoned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The mass of the townspeople were distributed among the neighbouring communities to be guarded.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time that they left Casilinum after their success, Gracchus in Lucania sent a number of cohorts which had been enlisted in that region, under the command of a prefect of the allies, into the enemy's farm lands to plunder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hanno attacked as they were widely scattered, inflicting upon the enemy in return a defeat not much less serious than that which he had received near Beneventum, and withdrew hastily into the land of the Bruttians, that Gracchus might not overtake him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of the consuls, Marcellus returned to Nola, whence he had come, Fabius advanced into Samnium, to lay waste their farms and to recover by force the cities which had revolted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Samnium around the Caudine Pass was more thoroughly laid waste.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Farms were burned over far and wide, cattle and men carried off as booty. Conpulteria, Telesia and Compsa, towns of that region, were taken by storm, also Fugifulae and Orbitanium in Lucania.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Blanda and, in Apulia, Aecae were taken after a siege. In these cities twenty-five thousand of the enemy were captured or slain, and three hundred and seventy deserters recovered. These were all sent to Rome by the consul, scourged in the Comitium and hurled from <pb id="p.239"/>the Rock.<note>The Tarpeian Rock of the Capitol (site still disputed).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such were the acts of Fabius within a<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> few days, while Marcellus was kept out of employment by illness at Nola.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And the praetor Quintus Fabius, whose field of duty was around Luceria, stormed the town of Acuca about that time and fortified a permanent camp at Ardaneae.<note>The same as Herdonea, XXV. xxi. 1; XXVII. i. 3.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>While the Romans were thus employed elsewhere, Hannibal had now reached Tarentum, leaving the most complete devastation wherever he had passed. Not until it had entered the territory of Tarentum did his column begin to advance peaceably.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There they did no damage, and nowhere did they leave the road. And it was plain that this was not due to the self-restraint of the soldiers, but to the commander's orders, for the purpose of winning over the Tarentines.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But when he had come quite close to the walls, and there was no movement at the first sight of his column, as he supposed there would be, he pitched camp about a mile from the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In Tarentum three days before Hannibal approached the walls, Marcus Livius, who had been sent by Marcus Valerius, the propraetor in command of the fleet at Brundisium, actively enlisted young
				<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> men, posted guards at all the gates and along the walls, wherever required, and alert by night as well as by day, he left neither the enemy nor wavering allies any opening for an attack.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> After spending some days there to no purpose, Hannibal, since none of the men who had come before him at the Lake of Avernus either came in person or sent a messenger or letter, saw that he had rashly followed empty promises and moved his camp away.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Even then he left the <pb id="p.241"/>territory of Tarentum unharmed, as he did not give<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> up his hope of weakening their loyalty, although his pretended clemency had had no effect as yet. Arrived at Salapia, he brought in grain from the districts of Metapontum and Heraclea; for the summer was now over, and he thought well of the place for winter quarters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> From it Numidians and Mauri were sent out to plunder in the Sallentine territory<note>Cf. XXIII. xlviii. 3.</note> and the nearest forests of Apulia. From these places not many other cattle were driven off as booty, but chiefly herds of horses, about four thousand of which were distributed among the cavalry to be broken.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Romans, inasmuch as a war that was by no means to be despised was breaking out in Sicily, and the death of the tyrant had given energetic commanders to the Syracusans, and had not changed the situation or their feelings, assigned that country to Marcus Marcellus, one of the consuls, as his province.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Directly after the assassination of Hieronymus there was at first an uproar among the soldiers at Leontini, and a fierce outcry that they must offer sacrificial vengeance to the dead king in the blood of the conspirators.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Later the frequent mention of restored freedom &mdash;a word sweet to the ears &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the hope of a largess out of the king's money, and of serving under better generals, also the enumeration of the shameful crimes and still more shameful lusts of the tyrant, so changed their feelings that they allowed the body of the king, whose loss they had just been regretting, to lie unburied.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although the rest of the conspirators had remained, in order to keep their hold on the army, Theodotus<note>Cf. V. 10 ff</note> and Sosis hastened to <pb id="p.243"/>Syracuse on the king's horses at the greatest possible<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> speed, to surprise his supporters while they were in complete ignorance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> However, not only rumour, than which nothing is swifter in such cases, but also a messenger, one of the royal slaves, had anticipated them. And so Adranodorus had garrisoned the Island<note>The oldest quarter of Syracuse, Ortygia. Cf. Cicero's description of the city, <hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> IV. 117 ff.</note> and the citadel and such other places as were possible and of advantage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By the Hexapylon<note>The great northern gate of the Wall of Dionysius; xxxii. 4 ff.; XXV. xxiv. 2f., etc.; v. Appendix.</note> after sunset Theodotus and Sosis rode into the city in the twilight, showing the bloody garment of the king and his diadem. Then riding across the quarter of Tycha, and calling people to freedom and at the same time to arms, they bid them assemble in Achradina.<note>A quarter that included a level tract, in which lay the market-place (xxii. 12), but not the rocky heights to the northward facing the sea; frequently mentioned below; v. Appendix.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of the populace some dash into the streets, some stand before the entrance to their houses, some look out from roofs and windows and keep asking what it means.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Everywhere there are bright lights, every place filled with mingled noises. The armed gather in open spaces; those without arms take down from the Temple of Olympian Jupiter<note>On the market-place; built by Hiero; not to be confused with the much older and larger temple west of the Great Harbour; xxxiii. 3; cf. Cicero <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 119.</note> the spoils of Gauls and Illyrians, presented by the Roman people to Hiero and hung up there by him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And this they did with a prayer to Jupiter that he graciously consent to furnish consecrated arms to men arming themselves for their native city, for the temples of the gods, for liberty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This crowd also was added to the guard stationed by the leading citizens of the quarters. On the Island Adranodorus had garrisoned, among other positions, the public granaries.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This place, which was walled about with squared stone and made strong like a citadel, was captured by the young <pb id="p.245"/>men who had been assigned to its defence; and they<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> sent messengers into Achradina to say that the granaries and the grain were under the authority of the senate.<note>A council, rather than a senate in the Roman sense.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At daybreak all the people, armed and unarmed, gathered at the Senate House in Achradina. There, standing on the altar of Concord,<note>This altar and the Senate House were in the market-place; 12f.</note> which had been erected on that spot, one of the leading men, Polyaenus by name, delivered a speech at once outspoken and restrained.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He said that men who had experienced the terrors of slavery and its humiliations had been inflamed against an evil which they knew. As for civil strife, the Syracusans had heard from their fathers, rather than seen for themselves, what disasters it brings.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He praised them for having taken up arms readily, and would praise them the more willingly if they did not use them except when compelled by absolute necessity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the present he approved of sending representatives to Adranodorus, to instruct him to put himself under the authority of the senate and people, open the gates of the Island and surrender the citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time, if Adranodorus should try to turn a regency into a kingship of his own, he favoured reclaiming their freedom from Adranodorus much more fiercely than from Hieronymus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After this speech representatives were sent directly. Then began a session of the senate, which in the reign of Hiero had indeed continued to be the council of state, yet since his death had not been called together nor consulted about anything until that day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the legates reached Adranodorus, he for his part was <pb id="p.247"/>moved by the agreement of the citizens, also by the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> occupation of other quarters of the city, and especially by the betrayal and loss of the most strongly fortified part of the Island.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But his wife Damarata, daughter of Hiero and still puffed up with princely pride and a woman's boldness, called him aside from the legates and reminded him of the oft-repeated utterance of Dionysius the tyrant, that one should leave a tyranny, not on horseback, but dragged by the feet.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was easy, she said, to give up the possession of an exalted station at any moment one wished; to create and achieve it was difficult and all but impossible. He should gain time for deliberation from the legates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He should use it to summon the soldiers from Leontini, and if he should promise them money from the royal treasury everything would be in his power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These feminine counsels Adranodorus neither wholly rejected nor at once adopted, thinking it a safer way to gain power if for the moment he should yield to the crisis. And so he bade the legates report that he would be under the authority of the senate and people.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>On the following day at dawn he opened the gates of the Island and came to the market-place of Achradina. There he mounted the altar of Concord, from which Polyaenus had addressed the people the day before, and began a speech in which he first begged pardon for his hesitation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For he had kept the gates closed, he said, not that he wished to separate his cause from that of the people, but because he feared what limit there would be to slaughter, when swords should once be drawn;
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> whether they would be content with the death of the tyrant, which would be sufficient to secure freedom, <pb id="p.249"/>or on the other hand every one who either by blood<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> or marriage or certain duties was connected with the palace would be slain, as being chargeable with another's guilt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After he observed that those who had freed their native city wished also to keep her free, and that the common good was the aim of all, he had not hesitated to surrender to the city his own person and in addition all that had been confided to his honour and protection, since the man who had given that charge had been destroyed by his own madness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Turning then to the assassins of the tyrant and addressing Theodotus and Sosis by name, he said: <quote>It is a memorable deed that you have done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But believe me, your glory is but begun, not yet finished, and unless you provide for peace and harmony there remains a very great danger that this may be the funeral of the liberated state.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech he laid the keys of the gates and those of the royal treasure at their feet. And they, dismissed from the assembly and happy that day at least, with their wives and children gave thanks at all the temples of the gods. On the next day elections for the naming of magistrates were held.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Among the first so named was Adranodorus, the rest largely assassins of the tyrant. Two who were not even present, Sopater and Dinomenes, were elected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These, hearing what had been done at Syracuse, brought the royal treasure that was at Leontini to Syracuse and turned it over to treasurers elected for that very purpose.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The money that was on the Island was also transferred to Achradina. And that part of the wall which shut off the Island from the rest of the city by a needlessly strong fortification was thrown down by common consent. The other <pb id="p.251"/>measures also were in keeping with this trend toward<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> freedom.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Hippocrates and Epicydes, on hearing of the tyrant's death, which Hippocrates had wished to keep secret even by slaying the messenger, were deserted by the soldiers and returned to Syracuse,<note>For their service under Hieronymus, cf. vii. 1.</note> since that course seemed safest in the circumstances.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There, to avoid going about under suspicion as seeking some opportunity for a revolution, they first came before the magistrates, and then through them before the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They stated that, having been sent by Hannibal to Hieronymus as his friend and ally, they had obeyed the orders of the man to whom their own commander wished them to be obedient.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They wished to return to Hannibal; but since the way was unsafe while the Romans were at large everywhere in Sicily, they asked the senators to give them some escort to conduct them to Locri<note>Cf. i. 2 ff.</note> in Italy. The senate, they said, would gain great favour with Hannibal by a small service.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This request was readily granted; for the senate greatly desired the departure of the king's generals, as men skilled in military art, and, what was more, needy also and daring. But they took no active steps to carry out their wish with the required promptness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Meanwhile the generals, as young men of military training and familiar with soldiers, at one time in the presence of these, at another among the deserters, the majority of whom were from the crews of the Romans, at another even among the lowest of the people, made charges against the senate and the aristocrats:
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that they were secretly working and contriving that Syracuse under the guise of a reestablished alliance should be subject to the <pb id="p.253"/>Romans, and that then a faction, that is, a few who<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> supported the renewal of the treaty, should rule.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ready to hear and believe these charges, a daily larger multitude was flocking to Syracuse and giving not Epicydes only, but also Adranodorus, the hope of a revolution.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The latter was at length wearied by admonitions of his wife: that it was now the time to seize the power, while everything was confused by the new freedom not yet organized; while the soldiers one met were fattened on the king's pay; while generals sent by Hannibal and familiar with the soldiers could aid the undertaking. Accordingly he formed a plot with Themistus, whose wife was Gelo's daughter, and after a few days rashly revealed it to one Aristo, a tragic actor, to whom he had been in the habit of confiding other secrets. This man's family and station were respectable and not tarnished by his artistic profession, since among the Greeks nothing of the sort brings discredit.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And so thinking that the loyalty he owed to his native city took precedence, he reports the matter to the magistrates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They, finding from trustworthy information that this was not unfounded, conferred with the older men, placed a guard at the doors on their advice, and when Themistus and Adranodorus had entered the senate, slew them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And after the confusion resulting from an act even more terrible in appearance than in reality, since others were unaware of the reason, they at length secured silence and brought the informer into the Senate House.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He first told everything in order: that the conspiracy had taken its start from the marriage of Gelo's daughter Harmonia, uniting her with Themistus;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that African and Spanish auxiliaries had been made ready for the <pb id="p.255"/>slaughter of the magistrates and other leading<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> citizens, and the announcement made that their property would be spoil for the assassins; moreover that a force of mercenaries accustomed to the orders of Adranodorus had been provided, to occupy the Island again.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then set forth in detail what was to be done, and by whom, and pictured the whole conspiracy manned and armed. And to the senators indeed they appeared to have been slain with as much justice as Hieronymus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But in front of the Senate House there was shouting by the mixed crowd unacquainted with the situation. Uttering wild threats, they were checked by the corpses of the conspirators before the entrance to the Senate House, in such fear that they silently followed the orderly populace to the assembly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Sopater was instructed by the senate and his colleagues to speak.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Beginning with their previous life, just as if he were prosecuting them, he charged that every act of violence or impiety committed since the death of Hiero had been done by Adranodorus and Themistus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For what could Hieronymus, a boy who had hardly reached puberty, have done of his own motion? His guardians and teachers, shielded by the embitterment directed against another, had been the real kings. Accordingly they ought to have perished either before Hieronymus or at least with Hieronymus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But though doomed already and marked for death, they had contrived fresh crimes since the death of the tyrant, at first openly, when Adranodorus, closing the gates of the Island, took over the kingdom as his own inheritance and as owner entered into possession of what he had held as agent:
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> again when, betrayed by those who were on the Island, beset by the whole <pb id="p.257"/>body of citizens holding Achradina, he attempted<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> secretly and craftily to win the kingdom which he had sought in vain openly and above board, and could not be won over even by the bestowal of public office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For among those who gained liberty for the state, he, a plotter against liberty himself, had been elected a magistrate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But their autocratic temper was due to their royal consorts, Hiero's daughter married to the one, Gelo's daughter to the other.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Following this statement there arose in all parts of the assembly a shout that none of those women ought to live, nor any one of the family of the tyrants to survive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This is the nature of the mass: either it is a humble slave or a haughty master. As for freedom, which is the mean, they know no moderation either in assuming or in keeping it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And angry passions usually do not lack complaisant helpers, to provoke to bloodshed those who are immoderately eager for punishment;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> as in this case the magistrates forthwith proposed a bill-and it was adopted almost before it was proposed-that all members of the royal family should be put to death.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And by order of the magistrates men were sent who put to death Damarata the daughter of Hiero and Harmonia the daughter of Gelo, being the wives of Adranodorus and Themistus.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Heraclia was the daughter of Hiero and wife of Zoippus,<note>Cf. v. 7.</note> who was sent as ambassador to King Ptolemy<note>Ptolemy IV Philopator, XXIII. x. 11.</note> by Hieronymus and had accepted voluntary exile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> She, having learned in advance that they were coming to her house also, fled into the chapel of the household gods with her two maiden daughters, her hair dishevelled and her general appearance moving to pity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And in addition were <pb id="p.259"/>her prayers, now by the gods, now by the memory of<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> her father Hiero and her brother Gelo, that they should not allow her innocent self to perish by the fire of resentment against Hieronymus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nothing had she gained by his reign except the exile of her husband; and while Hieronymus lived, her station had not been so high as her sister's, nor was their situation the same after his death.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What of it that, if Adranodorus' plans had succeeded, the sister would have reigned with her husband, while she herself and all the rest must be slaves?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If someone should inform Zoippus that Hieronymus had been slain and Syracuse set free, who would have any doubt that he would forthwith board ship and return to his native city?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> How the hopes of men were disappointed! In his native city, now set free, his wife and children were fighting for their lives, offering what obstacle to freedom and laws?
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What danger to anyone was there from herself, a lone woman, virtually a widow, and from maidens living as orphans? But they might say that no danger was indeed feared from her, that nevertheless the royal family was hated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Therefore they should send them far from Syracuse and Sicily and bid them to be carried away to Alexandria, the wife to her husband, the daughters to their father.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they paid no attention whatever and shouted not to waste time, she could see some men drawing swords. Then ceasing entreaties for herself, she urgently begged them at least to spare the girls &mdash;an age on which even enraged enemies do not lay hands;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that in taking vengeance on the tyrants they should not themselves imitate the crimes which they hated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> While still speaking, they dragged her away from the altar and cut her throat, <pb id="p.261"/>then turned their attack upon the girls spattered with B.C. 214 their mother's blood. Beside themselves for grief and fear, as though insane, they dashed out of the chapel with such speed that, if there had been any escape to the street, they would have caused a riot throughout the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Even as it was, in the limited space of the house, amidst so many armed men, they several times escaped unharmed and tore themselves away from those who tried to hold them, although they had to fight off hands so many and so strong.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At last exhausted by wounds, after staining everything with their blood, they fell lifeless. The slaughter, in itself pitiful, was made still more pitiful by the coincidence that shortly after came the word that they were not to be put to death, for animosity had suddenly changed to pity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> From pity then came anger, that such haste to punish had been made, and no chance left for a change of mind or a cooling of anger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And so the multitude complained, and to replace Adranodorus and Themistus &mdash;for both had been magistrates &mdash;they clamoured for an election, which would not prove at all to the liking of the magistrates.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A day was set for the election, and on that day, to the surprise of everybody, one man on the outskirts of the crowd nominated Epicydes, then after him another named Hippocrates, whereupon these shouts were repeated and with evident approval of the multitude.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And the assembly was disturbed by the crowd not only of citizens but also of soldiers, even deserters in large part mingling with them and eager for any change. The magistrates at first ignored them and by postponing delayed matters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Finally, compelled by the general <pb id="p.263"/>agreement and fearing an uprising, they declared<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> Epicydes and Hippocrates magistrates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And at first the newly elected did not reveal their intentions, although they were indignant that legates had gone to Appius Claudius<note>Now a legatus of Marcellus; praetor in Sicily the previous year; vi. 4; vii. 8.</note> to sue for a ten days' truce, and that, this being secured, others had been sent to negotiate the renewal of the old treaty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At that time the Roman commander had a fleet of a hundred ships off Murgantia,<note>A seaport of unknown situation. Another town of the same name was in the interior, to the east of Henna.</note> waiting to see what would be the outcome of the disturbances at Syracuse due to the massacre of the tyrant's family, and to what the new and unwonted freedom would prompt them.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>About the same time Marcellus was just arriving in Sicily, and the Syracusan ambassadors were sent to him by Appius. After hearing the peace terms, Marcellus thought agreement could be reached, and himself sent ambassadors to Syracuse to treat in person with the magistrates for a renewal of the treaty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And by this time the situation there was by no means so orderly and peaceful. When word was received that a Carthaginian fleet had reached the promontory of Pachynum,<note>Little more than thirty miles south of Syracuse.</note> Hippocrates and Epicydes, relieved of their fear, kept making the charge, now before the mercenaries, now among the deserters, that Syracuse was being betrayed to the Roman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But from the time Appius began to keep ships at anchor at the harbour mouth in order to encourage the men of the other party, the false charges apparently had received strong confirmation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And at first the crowd had even rushed down in disorder to keep them off in case they should be landing.</p> <pb id="p.265"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this confused state of affairs it 'was<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> decided to summon the people to an assembly. There while some inclined in one direction, some in another, and an uprising was not far away, Apollonides, one of the leading citizens, made a speech which was well-advised, considering the crisis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He said that neither the prospect of safety nor that of destruction had ever been nearer to any state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For if with one mind they should all incline, whether to the Romans or to the Carthaginians, no state would be in a more highly favoured and happier condition.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If they pulled in different directions, war between Carthaginians and Romans would not be more cruel than that among the Syracusans themselves, since within the same walls each side would have its own armies, its own weapons, its own generals. Accordingly they must make the greatest effort to reach agreement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Which alliance was the more advantageous was a question decidedly subordinate and of far less weight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Yet Hiero's authority ought to be followed in choosing allies rather than that of Hieronymus; in other words, a friendship which had proved happy for fifty years should be preferred to one unknown at present and formerly faithless.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For their decision it was also of considerable importance that they could decline the Carthaginians' offer of peace without necessarily waging war with them at once. With the Romans they must straightway have either peace or-war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The less of party passion the speech seemed to have, the greater was its influence. To the magistrates and picked senators they added a military council also. Commanders of units and prefects of auxiliaries as well were ordered to take part in the deliberations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the question had been repeatedly debated with <pb id="p.267"/>great contention, finally, as they evidently had no<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> means of carrying on a war with the Romans, it was decided to make an alliance with them, and to send ambassadors for the ratification.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not many days had elapsed, when ambassadors from Leontini arrived, pleading for a force to defend their territory. The request of this embassy seemed very timely for the purpose of relieving the city of a disorderly and turbulent multitude and of sending away its leaders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hippocrates as magistrate was ordered to lead the deserters thither. Many of the mercenary auxiliaries followed, making four thousand armed men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That enterprise gave joy both to the senders and the sent; for the one party were given a long-desired opportunity for revolution, and the other rejoiced also to think that the dregs of the city had been drained off. But they relieved the diseased body, so to speak, merely for the moment, only to have it relapse presently into a more serious ailment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For Hippocrates began, at first with stealthy raids, to ravage lands on the border of the Roman province. Later, when Appius had sent troops to protect the farms of the allies, he made an attack with all his forces upon the unit on, guard duty facing him, and many were slain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcellus, being informed of this, at once sent legates to Syracuse, to say that the promised peace had been broken, and that a reason for war would never be wanting unless Hippocrates and Epicydes should be sent far away, not merely from Syracuse, but from all Sicily. Epicydes, to avoid being present under an accusation brought against his absent brother, or else failing to do his part in provoking war, went likewise to Leontini; and seeing that its citizens were sufficiently <pb id="p.269"/>aroused against the Roman people, began also to<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> estrange them from the Syracusans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, he explained, the Syracusans had made an alliance with the Romans with the provision that all the states which had been subject to the kings should be under their rule;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that now they were not satisfied with freedom, without also being lords and masters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They must therefore report to them that the Lenities likewise thought it right that they should be free, either because it was on the soil of their city that the tyrant fell, or because there for the first time men shouted the summons to liberty, and deserting the king's generals flocked to Syracuse. Accordingly either that clause, he said, must be removed from the treaty, or else an alliance on such terms was not to be accepted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The multitude was easily persuaded, and when the legates of the Syracusans complained of the slaughter of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Roman guard-post and also bade Hippocrates and Epicydes go away to Locri or wherever they preferred, provided they withdrew from Sicily, the people replied with spirit that they had not instructed the Syracusans to make a treaty for them with the Romans, and that they were not bound by treaties not of their own making.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This was reported to the Romans by the Syracusans, who stated that the men of Leontini were not subject to their authority;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and that consequently the Romans would make war upon them without violating the treaty made with Syracuse; also that they would themselves not refuse to give help in the war, on condition that, when reduced to subjection, the Leontini should again be under their authority, as had been settled in the treaty.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, proceeding with his whole army <pb id="p.271"/>to Leontini and summoning Appius also to make an<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> attack from the other side, found such enthusiasm in his soldiers, due to anger aroused by the slaughter of men of the guard while negotiations were pending, that they took the city at the first assault.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hippocrates and Epicydes, on seeing that the walls were being taken and gates forced, sought refuge with a few men in the citadel. Thence they fled secretly by night to Herbesus.<note>Probably between Syracuse and Leontini, perhaps on the Mylas.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Syracusans, who had set out from home in a column of eight thousand men, were met at the river Mylas by a messenger, reporting that the city<note>Leontini.</note> had been captured, but for the rest mingling the false with the true:
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that a general massacre of soldiers and townspeople had occurred, and no adults, he thought, had survived; that the city had been plundered, the property of the wealthy given away.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On hearing news so terrible the column halted, and in the general excitement the commanders &mdash;and they were Sosis and Dinomenes &mdash; considered what they should do.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The appearance of well-founded alarm had been lent to the falsehood by the scourging and beheading of deserters, about two thousand men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But not one of the Leontinians or of the other soldiers had been injured after the capture of the city; and, except what had been lost in the first confusion of the capture of the city, all their property was being restored to them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And the soldiers, complaining that their comrades had been betrayed to their death, could neither be induced to go to Leontini nor to wait at the same spot for more trustworthy news.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The generals,<note>The <hi rend="italics">praetores,</hi> having taken the field, are now generals, as repeatedly below.</note> seeing them inclined to mutiny, but that the outbreak would not last long if the leaders in folly should be removed, led the army to Megara:<note>On the coast north of Syracuse; destroyed by Marcellus, xxxv. 2.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and then with a few <pb id="p.273"/>horsemen they went themselves to Herbesus, in the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> hope of getting possession of the city by treachery, owing to the general alarm.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When this undertaking disappointed them, they thought they must use force, and moved their camp from Megara the next day, to attack Herbesus with all their troops.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Hippocrates and Epicydes, thinking that their plan to put themselves at the mercy of the soldiers, who were in large part used to them and also at that time inflamed by the report of the slaughter of their comrades, was not so much one which at first sight promised safety, as it was the only possible plan in a desperate situation, went out to meet the column.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The first unit happened to be that of six hundred Cretans, who had served under them in the army of Hieronymus and were under obligations to Hannibal, as they had been captured among the Roman auxiliaries at Lake Trasumennus and allowed to go free.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Recognizing them from their standards and the character of their weapons,<note>They were archers.</note> Hippocrates and Epicydes, holding out olive branches and in addition the woollen bands of suppliants, implored them to admit them and, having done so, to protect and not betray them to the Syracusans, to be themselves presently surrendered by the same to the Roman people for brutal execution. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And in fact the Cretans shouted to them to take courage, saying they would share every lot with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During this conversation the standards had halted and the column was being held up. And word had not yet reached the generals as to what was the cause of the delay. When the report that Hippocrates and Epicydes were there did reach them, and down the whole length of the column there was a shout of evident joy over their coming, at once the <pb id="p.275"/>generals made their way at a gallop to the head<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> of the column.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Asking what a practice, what a breach of discipline, it was on the part of the Cretans to
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> join in conversation with an enemy and to admit the men to their own column without orders from the generals, they ordered them to be arrested and Hippocrates<note>Mention of one brother is meant to include the other, Epicydes; xxiv. 1; xxxv. 4.</note> to be put in chains.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Upon that command such an outcry was first raised by the Cretans, and then caught up by others, that it was easy to see that if they took any further steps they would have to fear for themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Troubled and uncertain as to their own situation, they ordered a retreat to Megara, from which they had set out, and sent messengers to Syracuse to report how matters stood.</p> 
			<p>While men were inclined to suspect everything, Hippocrates also resorted to a ruse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After sending some of the Cretans to lie in wait by the roads, with the pretence that it had been intercepted, he publicly read a letter written by himself: <quote>The magistrates of Syracuse to the Consul Marcellus.</quote><note>Only the heading is quoted verbatim, with suppression of the conventional greeting.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Following the customary greeting it was stated that he had been entirely right in sparing no one at Leontini;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but that the situation of all the mercenary soldiers was the same, and Syracuse would never have peace so long as there were any foreign auxiliaries in either the city or its army. Therefore he should take measures to reduce to submission the men who were encamped at Megara under the command of their own generals, and by their punishment to set Syracuse free at last.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After this had been read, they rushed to arms with such shouting that during the confusion the generals rode away in alarm to Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And the mutiny was not quelled even by their flight; but attacks were repeatedly made on the Syracusan soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <pb id="p.277"/>Nor would they have spared any of them, had not<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> Epicydes and Hippocrates opposed the enraged multitude, not out of pity and a humane intent, but in order not to cut off the hope of their own return, and that they might not only keep the men themselves as
				<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> loyal soldiers and at the same time hostages, but also win over their relatives and friends, first by so great a service, and then by the personal security.<note>Since the soldiers would virtually be hostages, to ensure the support of many friends and relatives in the city.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And having learned how empty or faint a breath moves the crowd, they took a soldier from among those who had been besieged at Leontini and bribed him to carry to Syracuse a message in agreement with what had been falsely reported at the Mylas, and by showing
				<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> himself to vouch for it and by relating the doubtful as things that he had seen, to inflame men's anger.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This man was not only believed by the common people, but on being admitted to the Senate House, he stirred the senate as well. Some men of consequence openly declared it was very well that the avarice and cruelty of the Romans had been revealed at Leontini; that if they had entered Syracuse they would have done the same things or even more terrible, in proportion to the greater prize for avarice there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, they all voted that the gates should be closed and the city guarded. But not all were afraid of the same persons or hated the same men. Among the whole military class and a large part of the common people the Roman name was hated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As for the generals and a few of the best citizens, although they had been misled by the false news, they were nevertheless more circumspect in the face of a danger more immediately impending.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And already Hippocrates <pb id="p.279"/>and Epicydes were at the Hexapylon, and there were<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> communications through intermediaries who were relatives of citizens in the army: that they should open the gates and allow the defence of the city, their common home, against attack by the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By this time one of the gates of the Hexapylon had been opened, and by it they had begun to be admitted, when the generals intervened. And at first by their military authority and by threats, then by using their personal influence to restrain them, finally, when all was without affect, disregarding dignity they prayed them not to betray their native city to former minions of the tyrant and present seducers of the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the ears of the excited crowd were deaf to all that; and the gates were being forced with no less violence from within than from without, and when all had been forced, the column was admitted through the whole breadth of the Hexapylon.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The generals with the younger citizens flee for refuge to Achradina. The mercenary soldiers and deserters and such royal troops as were at Syracuse swell the column of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus Achradina also is taken by assault, and all the magistrates, except those who escaped in the midst of the uproar, are slain. Night put an end to the slaughter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the next day slaves were called to wear the cap of freedom<note>Cf. xvi. 18.</note> and criminals in chains released from prison; and all this assorted multitude elected Hippocrates and Epicydes generals. And Syracuse, after the light of liberty had shone upon it for a short time, had fallen back into its old-time servitude.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these facts were reported to the Romans, the camp was at once removed from Leontini <pb id="p.281"/>to Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And, as it happened, legates had<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> been sent by Appius by way of the harbour on a five-banker. The four-banker sent in advance was captured on entering the narrows. The legates barely escaped.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And now there remained no longer any rights even of war, not to say of peace, when the Roman army pitched camp at the Olympium, that is, the Temple of Jupiter,<note>Westward of the Great Harbour, plainly visible from the Island and from part of Achradina. Near this great temple the Athenians had encamped, as also the Carthaginians, in other sieges. Two columns still stand.</note> a mile and a half from the city. From this place also it was decided to send legates in advance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To prevent their entering the city, Hippocrates and Epicydes and their retinue advanced beyond the gate to meet them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The speaker for the Romans said he was not bringing war, but aid and comfort to the Syracusans, both to those who, escaping from the midst of the slaughter, had sought refuge with the Romans, and to those who, subdued by their fear, were enduring a slavery more shameful, not only than exile, but even than death; and that the Romans would not leave the atrocious slaughter of their allies unavenged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly, if a safe return to their native city should be open to those who had sought refuge with the Romans, if those responsible for the slaughter should be surrendered and their freedom and laws restored to the Syracusans, there was no need of arms. If those conditions should not be met, the Romans would wage war against every man who caused delay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In reply Epicydes said that, if their message had been addressed to his colleague and himself, they would have given them an answer. When the Syracusan state should be under the control of the men to whom they came, then let them return. Should they make war, they would find from actual experience that to attack Syracuse was by no means the same as <pb id="p.283"/>to attack Leontini.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So he left the ambassadors and<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> closed the gates.</p> 
			<p>Thereupon began the siege of Syracuse at the same time by land and by sea, by land from the side of the Hexapylon, by sea from that of Achradina, the wall of which is washed by the waves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And because, having taken Leontini by a panic and the first assault, the Romans did not doubt that at some point they would make their way into a city immense and widely scattered, they brought all their equipment for besieging cities up to the walls. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And an undertaking begun with so vigorous an assault would have met with success if one man had not been at Syracuse at that time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was Archimedes, an unrivalled observer of the heavens and the stars, more remarkable, however, as inventor and contriver of artillery and engines of war, by which with the least pains he frustrated whatever the enemy undertook with vast efforts.<note>Livy does not mention Archimedes' celebrity as a mathematician.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The walls, carried along uneven hills, mainly high positions and difficult to approach, but some of them low and accessible from level ground, we reequipped by him with every kind of artillery, as seemed suited to each place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The wall of Achradina, which, as has been said already, is washed by the sea, was attacked by Marcellus with sixty five-bankers.<note>The number sixty agrees with Polybius VIII. 4(6). 1.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From most<note><quote>Most,</quote> since <hi rend="italics">coterie</hi> is contrasted with <hi rend="italics">alias</hi> in &sect; 6 (eight in Polybius).</note> of the ships archers and slingers, also light-armed troops, whose weapon is difficult for the inexpert to return,<note>Owing to the skill required in using the thong (<hi rend="italics">agendum</hi>).</note> allowed hardly anyone to stand on the wall without being wounded; and these men kept their ships at a distance from the wall, since range is needed for missile weapons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.285"/>Other five-bankers, paired together, with the inner<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> oars removed, so that side was brought close to side, were propelled by the outer banks of oars like a single ship,
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> and carried towers of several stories and in addition engines for battering walls. To meet this naval equipment Archimedes disposed artillery of different sizes on the walls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Against ships at a distance he kept discharging stones of great weight; nearer vessels he would attack with lighter and all the more numerous missile weapons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Finally, that his own men might discharge their bolts at the enemy without exposure to wounds, he opened the wall from bottom to top with numerous loopholes about a cubit wide,<note>Livy seems to mean the width on the inside, while Polybius gives a palm (three inches) as the width of a loophole on the outside (VIII. 7. 6).</note> and through these some, without being seen, shot at the enemy with arrows, others from small scorpions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As for the ships which came closer, in order to be inside the range of his artillery, against these an iron grapnel, fastened to a stout chain, would be thrown on to the bow by means of a swing-beam projecting over the wall. When this<note>Literally the grappling hook; but here, as if the <hi rend="italics">ferret</hi> <hi rend="italics">manus</hi> might serve as a name for the entire crane, the reference is in fact to another part, viz. the beam, the after end of which sank to the ground inside the wall when the leaden weight was shifted. Polybius, VIII. 6(8). 1-4, gives a more detailed account.</note> sprung backward to the ground owing to the shifting of a heavy leaden weight, it would set the ship on its stern, bow in air.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then, suddenly released, it would dash the ship, falling, as it were, from the wall, into the sea, to the great alarm of the sailors, and with the result that, even if she fell upright, she would take considerable water.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus the assault from the sea was baffled, and all hope shifted to a plan to attack from the land with all their forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But that <pb id="p.287"/>side also had been provided with the same complete<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> equipment of artillery, at the expense and the pains of Hiero during many years, by the unrivalled art of Archimedes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The nature of the place<note>Evidently meaning the northern face of Etiolate, the great triangle at whose western apex stood the fortress of Burials; cf. XXV. xxiv. 4; ax. 2; v. Appendix.</note> also helped, in that the rock on which the foundations of the wall were laid is generally so steep that not only missiles from a machine, but also whatever rolled down of its own weight fell heavily upon the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The same circumstance made approach to the wall difficult and footing unsteady.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> So, after a war council, since every attempt was being balked, it was decided to give up the assault and merely by a blockade to cut off the enemy by land and sea from their supplies.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Marcellus set out with about a third of his army to recover the cities which in the unsettled state of affairs had gone over to the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Helorus and Herbesus he did recover by their own surrender; Megara he took by assault, destroyed and plundered, to terrify the others and especially the Syracusans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the same time also Himilco, who had long kept his fleet off the promontory of Pachynum, landed at Heraclea,<note>West of Agrigentum, on the south coast.</note> called Minoa, 25,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and twelve elephants, a very much larger force than that with which he had previously kept his fleet off Pachynum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But after Syracuse had been seized by Hippocrates, Himilco went to Carthage and was aided there both by the legates of Hippocrates and by a letter from Hannibal, who said the time had come to recover Sicily in the most honourable manner.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Himilco <pb id="p.289"/>himself, being an influential adviser, present in<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> person, had easily prevailed upon them to send across to Sicily the largest possible forces of infantry and cavalry. Arrived at Heraclea, he recovered Agrigentum within a few days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And the hopes of the other city-states which were on the side of the Carthaginians were so fired to drive the Romans out of Sicily that finally even those who were besieged at Syracuse took courage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And thinking the city could be sufficiently defended by a part of the forces, they so divided the military duties that Epicydes should be in charge of the defence of the city, and Hippocrates, together with Himilco, should carry on the war against the Roman consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With 10,000 infantry and five hundred horse he set out by night through places unguarded and pitched camp near the city of Acrillae.<note>To the west of Syracuse, as was Acrae, xxxvi. 1.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As they were fortifying, Marcellus arrived, returning from Agrigentum, which was already occupied, since it was in vain that he had endeavoured to anticipate the enemy by hastening thither. Nothing was farther from his thoughts than that a Syracusan army should meet him there at that time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless, from fear of Himilco and the Carthaginians, being no match for them with the forces he had, he was advancing with all possible alertness and with a column so formed as to meet any emergency. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The precaution which had been taken against Carthaginians served him, as it happened, against Sicilians. Coming upon them after they had broken ranks and were scattered in the act of pitching camp and mostly unarmed, he overwhelmed all the infantry. The cavalry, after a slight engagement, fled with Hippocrates to Acrae.</p> <pb id="p.291"/>
			<p>Marcellus, by that battle having restrained the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> Sicilians inclined to revolt from the Romans, returned to Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And a few days later Himilco was joined by Hippocrates and pitched camp by the river Anapus,<note>The small river of Syracuse, emptying into the Great Harbour. Near its mouth was a Roman camp; xxxiii. 3.</note> about eight miles away.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the same time it so happened that fifty-five warships of the Carthaginians under Bomilcar sailed from the open sea into the Great Harbour of Syracuse, and also a Roman fleet of thirty quinqueremes debarked the first legion at Panormus.<note>Now Palermo; the chief city of Carthaginian Sicily, until taken by the Romans in <date value="-254">254 B.C.</date>; Polybius I. xxxviii. fin.</note> And the war could be considered as now diverted from Italy, so intent were both nations upon Sicily.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Himilco, thinking that the legion which had been landed at Panormus would certainly fall a prey to him on its way to Syracuse, was baffled by its route.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the Carthaginian led his troops along an inland road, while the legion, escorted by the fleet, made its way along the coast to Appius
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> Claudius, who with a part of his forces had advanced as far as Pachynum<note>Probably an error for Pelorum, the north-eastern promontory of Sicily, since, with Agrigentum in the hands of the Carthaginians, the route via the western and southern coasts (much longer in any case) would have been impracticable.</note> to meet it. And so the Carthaginians did not tarry longer near Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the one hand Bomilcar, lacking confidence in his own ships, since the Romans had a fleet of fully double the number, and at the same time seeing that by useless delay the lack of supplies for the allies was only intensified by his forces, put out to sea and crossed over to Africa.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the other hand Himilco first followed Marcellus to Syracuse to no purpose, in the hope that there might be some opportunity for an engagement before should unite with larger forces. Then, when no such opportunity fell to him, and he <pb id="p.293"/>saw the enemy safe near Syracuse thanks to his<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> fortifications and military strength, fearing to waste time in besieging him in vain and watching the blockade of the allies, he moved his camp away.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His purpose was to bring up his army to any point to which the hope of revolting from the Romans might call him, and by his presence to give encouragement to those who inclined to support his cause.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Murgantia<note>Cf. xxvii. 5.</note> was first recovered, after the inhabitants had betrayed the Roman garrison. There a great quantity of grain and supplies of every kind had been accumulated for the Romans.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon this revolt, feeling was aroused in other city-states, and Roman garrisons were being either driven out of citadels or betrayed by treachery and slain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Henna,<note>The most commanding city-site in Sicily, with its citadel 3200 ft. above the sea. Described by Cicero <hi rend="italics">in Verr.</hi> IV. 107. Henna was the centre of the worship of Demeter and Persephone; cf. xxxix. 8.</note> perched on a lofty site with cliffs on every side, was not only impregnable from its position, but also had a strong garrison in its citadel and a garrison commander who was certainly no easy prey to plotters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was Lucius Pinarius, a man of high spirit and one who gave more weight to precautions against possible deception than to the honour of Sicilians. And at this time the news of so many cities betrayed and in revolt and of so many garrisons destroyed had made him more intent upon guarding against every danger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly every position had been prepared and provided with guards and sentinels night and day; and the soldier did not leave his arms and his post.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When this was noticed by the leading men of Henna, who had already made an agreement with Himilco to betray the garrison, namely, that the Roman left no opportunity for treachery, they were forced to act openly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They said that city and citadel ought to be under their own control, if as free men <pb id="p.295"/>they had entered into alliance with the Romans,<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> and had not been consigned to custody as slaves. Consequently they said they thought it right that the keys of the gates should be restored to them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For good allies their loyalty was the strongest bond, and the Roman people and senate would be grateful to them only in case they remained in their friendship willingly and not under compulsion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In reply to this the Roman commandant said that he had been placed at his post by his general and had received from him both the keys to the gates and the guarding of the citadel, to keep them, not at his own discretion nor that of the people of Henna, but of the man who had confided them to him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To leave one's post was among the Romans a capital offence, and fathers had punished that crime with the death even of their own sons. The consul Marcellus was not far away; they should send legates to him who had the right to decide the matter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But they said that they would not send them, and asserted that if they accomplished nothing by words, they would seek some means of recovering their freedom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Upon that Pinarius said that, if they objected to sending to the consul, very well, let them at least give him an assembly of the people, that it might be known whether their demand was that of a few men or of the whole city. They agreed to an assembly on the next day.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Returning from that conference to the citadel, he called his men together and said: <quote>I believe you have heard, soldiers, how in these days Roman garrisons have been beset and overwhelmed by Sicilians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Such treachery you have escaped, thanks first to the favour of the gods, and then to your own courage, by standing guard day and night <pb id="p.297"/>under arms. Would that the remaining time<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> could be passed without either suffering or committing atrocities! In covert trickery the method of defence is that which we have so far employed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since the trick does not succeed, they demand back the keys of the gates openly and above board. And the moment we surrender them, Henna will be in the hands of the Carthaginians, and we shall be more cruelly slaughtered here than was the garrison slain at Murgantia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With difficulty I have gained for deliberation one night in which to inform you of the impending danger. At daybreak they are to hold an assembly for the purpose of accusing me and arousing the people against you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so tomorrow Henna will be deluged either with your blood or with that of the Hennensians. If forestalled, you will have no hope, nor any danger if you forestall them. Who first draws the sword will have the victory. Therefore, alert and armed, you will all await the signal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I shall be in the assembly, and I will kill time in speaking and disputing, until everything is ready.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When I give the signal with my toga, then do you from all sides raise a shout, attack the crowd, and strike down everyone with the sword; and see to it that no one survives whose violence or treachery can be feared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Mother Ceres and Proserpina, and all the other gods, above and below, who inhabit this city, these hallowed lakes and groves, I pray that ye attend us with your favour and support, if so be that we are taking this step for the purpose of guarding against treachery, not of practising it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I should exhort you, soldiers, at greater length if your battle were to be with armed men. Unarmed and off their guard, you will massacre them to your hearts' content. <pb id="p.299"/>And the consul's camp is near; I tell you this that<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> you may have no possible fear from Himilco and the Carthaginians.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Dismissed immediately after this exhortation, they took food and rest. On the following day they were posted in different places, to occupy the roads and close the ways of escape. The majority took their positions above and around the theatre, being already familiar with the sight of an assembly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Roman commandant, being brought before the people by the magistrates, said that right and authority in the matter belonged to the consul, not to himself, and in general the same things he had said the day before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And at first insensibly and only a few, presently a larger number, then all, now with one voice kept bidding him to deliver the keys; and when he delayed and postponed, they repeated savage threats and apparently would not further postpone violence, their last resort.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon the prefect gave the signal with his toga, as had been agreed, and the soldiers, alert and ready long before, dashed down, some of them from above, upon the rear of the assembly with a shout, while others, massed at the exits of the theatre, blocked the way.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The men of Henna, shut up in the cavea, were slain and piled together not only owing to the slaughter, but also by the panic, since they rushed down over each others' heads, and as the unharmed fell upon the wounded, the living upon the dead, they were lying in heaps.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thence the soldiers scattered in every direction, and, just as in a captured city, flight and slaughter were in complete possession, while the wrath of the soldiers was not a whit less intense because they were slaying an unarmed <pb id="p.301"/>crowd, than if equal danger and ardour for the fray<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> were spurring them on.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So by an act, it may have been criminal, it may have been unavoidable, Henna was held.</p> 
			<p>Marcellus, without reproving the act, allowed the soldiers to plunder the Hennensians, thinking the frightened Sicilians had been deterred from betraying their garrisons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And as was natural in the case of a city in the heart of Sicily and famous, whether for the remarkable natural defences of its site, or as hallowed everywhere by the footprints of Proserpina, long ago carried away,<note>As in Cicero <hi rend="italics">in Verr.</hi> IV. 107 the very place reminds one how Pluto carried off Proserpina from the meadows below Henna.</note> news of the massacre made its way over the whole of Sicily almost in a single day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And then in truth, since they thought that the abode, not of men only but also of gods, had been desecrated by an atrocious massacre, even those who till then had wavered went over to the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hippocrates thereupon went back to Murgantia, Himilco to Agrigentum, after bringing up their army to Henna to no purpose at the summons of the traitors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Marcellus returned to Leontini, had grain and other supplies brought into the camp, left a suitable garrison there and came to Syracuse to carry on the siege.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then relieved Appius Claudius, to sue for the consulship at Rome, and in his place put Titus Quinctius Crispinus in command of the fleet and the old camp.<note>Cf. xxxiii. 3; XXV. xxvi. 4. The new winter camp was northwest of Syracuse.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As for himself, he fortified and built winter quarters five miles from the Hexapylon &mdash; Leon they call the place. Such were the events in Sicily up to the beginning of the winter.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same summer the war with King Philip also that for some time had been foreshadowed broke <pb id="p.303"/>out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Legates came from Oricum<note>In southern Illyria (Albania), at the south end of the bay behind the Acroceraunian Mountains, almost directly opposite Brundisium.</note> to Marcus<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> Valerius, the praetor,<note>Strictly propraetor; x. 4; xx. 12.</note> who with his fleet was guarding Brundisium and the neighbouring coast of Calabria. They reported that Philip had first sailed up the river with a hundred and twenty small vessels having two banks of oars and attacked Apollonia;<note>The city, in southern Illyria, and allied with Rome since <date value="-229">229 B.C.</date>, lay near the river Ao&uuml;s and about seven miles inland, about thirty miles north of Oricum. Later it attracted young Romans pursuing their studies, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Octavian.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that then, when the undertaking proved slower than he anticipated, had secretly moved his army to Oricum by night; also that that city, situated in a plain and not strong either in walls or armed men, had been taken by assault.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Making this report, they begged him to lend aid and by land and sea to keep an undoubted enemy of the Romans away from the coast cities, which were being attacked for no other reason than that they faced Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcus Valerius, after leaving a garrison of two thousand soldiers and placing Publius Valerius, his lieutenant, in command of them, with his fleet drawn up and in readiness, while such soldiers as the warships could not accommodate had been placed on transports, came on the second day to Oricum;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and as only a small garrison which the king had left when he withdrew held the city, he recaptured it after slight resistance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To it came legates from Apollonia, reporting that they were being besieged because they refused to revolt from the Romans and could no longer withstand the attack of the Macedonians, unless a Roman force should be sent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Valerius promised to do as they desired, and sent two thousand picked soldiers in <pb id="p.305"/>warships to the mouth of the river<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the Ao&uuml;s.</note> under the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> command of a prefect of the allies, Quintus Naevius Crista, a man of action and an experienced soldier.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He landed his men, sent the ships back to the rest of the fleet at Oricum, his starting-point, led his soldiers at a distance from the river along the road least beset by the king's troops and entered the city by night, so that no one of the enemy was aware of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The following day they rested, that the prefect might inspect the young men of Apollonia and the arms and resources of the city. The result of that inspection gave him sufficient encouragement, and he learned also from scouts what carelessness and indifference there was among the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thereupon in the silence of the night and without making any noise he went out of the city and entered the enemy's camp, so neglected and open that a thousand men had entered the wall before anyone was aware of it, so it was generally asserted; also, that if they had refrained from slaughter, they could have reached the king's tent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The slaughter of the men nearest to the gate aroused the enemy. Then such alarm and panic took possession of them all that not only did no one else seize his arms and attempt to drive the
				<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> enemy out of the camp, but even the king himself, fleeing almost half-naked, just as he was when awakened, fled to the river and his ships in a garb scarcely seemly even for a common soldier, much less a king. Thither the rest of the disorderly crowd also poured out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Little fewer than three thousand soldiers were either captured or slain in the camp; a considerably larger number of men were captured than slain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After plundering the camp the Apollonians carried away the catapults, ballistae and other <pb id="p.307"/>engines which had been provided for a siege of the<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> city to Apollonia, in order to defend their walls, if ever a similar situation should arise. All the remaining booty of the camp was left to the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> When this news reached Oricum, Marcus Valerius at once led his fleet to the mouth of the river, to prevent the king from escaping by ship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> And so Philip, believing he would not be quite equal to a battle either on land or sea, stranded his ships, set fire to them, and started for Macedonia with an army in large part disarmed and despoiled. The Roman fleet wintered at Oricum under the command of Marcus Valerius.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same year operations in Spain were chequered. For Mago and Hasdrubal, before the Romans should cross the Ebro, routed immense forces of Spaniards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And Farther Spain would have revolted from the Romans if Publius Cornelius had not hastily led his army across the Hiberus and arrived in the nick of time, while the allies were still wavering.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first the Romans had their camp at Castrum Album,<note>Probably modern Alicante, on the coast and northeast of Carthago Nova; built by Hamilcar Barca, who fell in battle there 229-<date value="-8">8 B.C.</date></note> noted as the place where the great Hamilcar fell.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The citadel had been fortified and they had previously brought in grain. Yet the country all around was filled with the enemy, and the Roman column had been attacked with impunity by the enemy's cavalry and about two thousand men, either straggling or scattered over the farms, had been slain. The Romans therefore retired from the place to a position nearer peaceful regions and fortified a camp at Victory Mountain.<note>Situation unknown.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thither came Gnaeus Scipio with all his troops, and Hasdrubal the son of Gisgo, making three Carthaginian generals and a complete army; and all three established themselves across <pb id="p.309"/>the river, opposite the Roman camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> Scipio, who set out secretly to reconnoitre with unencumbered troops, did not escape the notice of the enemy, and they would have overwhelmed him in the open meadows if he had not captured a hill near by.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even there he was beset, but by the arrival of his brother he escaped a siege. Castulo<note>In the upper valley of the Baetis (Guadalquivir), on the main road from the Pyrenees to Gades.</note> revolted to the Romans, a strong and famous city of Spain, so closely joined to the Carthaginians by alliance that Hannibal's wife<note>Imilce, if Silius Italicus (III. 97 and 106) is correct.</note> was from that place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Carthaginians attempted to capture Iliturgis,<note>On the left bank of the Baetis, southwest of Castulo; cf. XXIII. xlix. 5, where the form was Iliturgi.</note> because there was a Roman garrison there, and it seemed that they would take the town mainly by starvation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Gnaeus Scipio, to lend aid to the allies and the garrison, set out with an unencumbered legion, passing between their two camps, and after slaying many of the enemy entered the city, and on the following day engaged them in an equally successful sally.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Over twelve thousand men were slain in the two battles, more than a thousand men captured, with thirty-six military standards. So they withdrew from Iliturgis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then began the siege of Bigerra<note>Site unknown.</note> &mdash;these also were allies of the Romans &mdash;by the Carthaginians. Gnaeus Scipio on his arrival raised the siege without an engagement.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereupon the Carthaginian camp was removed to Munda,<note>Near Corduba. This is the first mention of Caesar's Munda; probably Montilla.</note> and the Romans promptly followed them thither.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There they fought in pitched battle for about four hours, and though the Romans were winning a brilliant victory, the signal for recall was given, because Gnaeus Scipio's thigh had been <pb id="p.311"/>pierced by a light javelin, and fear that the wound<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> might prove fatal had seized the soldiers around him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But there was no doubt that, if this delay had not occurred, the Carthaginian camp could have been captured that day. Already not only soldiers but the elephants also had been driven even up to the wall, and just as they crossed the trenches thirty-nine elephants were struck down by heavy javelins.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In this battle also about twelve thousand men are said to have been slain, about three thousand captured, with fifty-seven military standards. The Carthaginians then retired to the city of Aurinx,<note>Perhaps the same as Orongis, XXVIII. iii. 2.</note> and the Roman followed, to threaten men already terrified.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There Scipio again engaged, being carried into battle-line in a litter, and the victory was not to be questioned. Less than half as many of the enemy as before, however, were slain, because fewer men had survived to fight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But, as Mago was sent by his brother to recruit soldiers, a race adapted by nature to renew wars and to make fresh preparations for them soon refilled the army and gave them the spirit to essay another conflict.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The soldiers were mostly Gauls,<note>From Celtic tribes already established in Spain, even in the southwest.</note> and they fought with the same spirit as their predecessors for the side which had been beaten so many times within a few days, and with the same result.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> More than eight thousand men were slain, and not much less than a thousand captured, also fifty-eight military standards. And the spoils were largely Gallic, golden collars and armbands &mdash;a great number of them. Also two conspicuous princes of the Gauls &mdash;Moeniacoeptus and Vismarus were their names <pb id="p.313"/> &mdash;fell in that battle. Eight elephants were captured,<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> three slain.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The situation in Spain being so favourable, the Romans came at last to be ashamed that the town of Saguntum, which was the cause of the war, had been by that time seven years<note>Livy's own chronology would make it four complete years; XXI. vii. ff.; xv. 5; XXIV. ix. 7.</note> in the power of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> enemy. Accordingly the Carthaginian garrison was driven out by force, and recovering the town the Romans restored it to its former inhabitants &mdash;such of them as the violence of war had
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> spared. And as for the Turdetani,<note>Cf. XXI. vi. 1. Better known is the tribe of the same name in southern Baetica.</note> who had brought on the war between Saguntum and the Carthaginians, they reduced them to subjection, sold them under the garland and destroyed their city.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the events in Spain in the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Marcus Claudius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At Rome, immediately after the newly elected tribunes of the plebs had entered upon office, a day was set by Marcus Metellus, a tribune of the plebs, for the censors Publius Furius and Marcus Atilius to appear at the bar of the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In his quaestorship the year before they had taken away his horse, removed him from his tribe and made him an aerarian on account of the conspiracy formed at Cannae to desert Italy.<note>Cf. xviii. 3 and 6; XXVII. xi. 12. The scene was Canusium, after Cannae.</note> But by the aid of nine tribunes they were forbidden to plead their cause while in office and were released.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From completing the ceremony of purification they were prevented by the death of Publius Furius. Marcus Atilius abdicated his office.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For the consulship the election was conducted by Quintus Fabius Maximus, the consul. Elected consuls, both in absence, were Quintus Fabius Maximus, the consul's son, and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the latter for the second time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two men <pb id="p.315"/>who were at the time curule aediles, Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 214</note> Sempronius Tuditanus and Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus, were made praetors, and with them Marcus Atilius and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Tradition has it that at the festival given that year by the curule aediles four days had dramatic performances for the first time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The aedile Tuditanus was the man who at Cannae, when others were paralyzed by fear in such a disaster, led his men through the midst of the enemy.<note>Cf. XXII. 1. 6 ff.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>These elections being completed, the consuls<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> designate were summoned to Rome, as proposed by Quintus Fabius, the consul, entered upon office and consulted the senate in regard to the war and the provinces, their own and those of the praetors, and as to the armies which they should respectively command; 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				and the provinces and armies were divided as follows: the war with Hannibal was assigned to the consuls, and two armies, one which Sempronius himself, and the other which Fabius had commanded as consul. These were of two legions each.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcus Aemilius, the praetor to whom fell jurisdiction in cases involving foreigners, was to assign his judicial function to his colleague Marcus Atilius, the city praetor, and have Luceria as his province, and two legions which Quintus Fabius, who was now consul, had commanded as praetor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To Publius Sempronius Ariminum fell as his assignment,<note>Gallia was the more recent name of this <quote>province,</quote> <hi rend="italics">ager Gallicus</hi> in x. 3.</note> to Gnaeus Fulvius, Suessula,<note>With the important Roman camp near it, the <hi rend="italics">castra</hi> <hi rend="italics">Claudiana;</hi> xvii. 2; xlvii. 12; XXIII. xxxi. 3.</note> likewise with two legions in each case, so assigned that Fulvius should take with him the legions at the city, and Tuditanus take over from Marcus Pomponius his legions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Commands and assignments were continued as follows: for Marcus Claudius Sicily, with the <pb id="p.317"/>boundaries which Hiero's kingdom had had; for<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> Publius Lentulus, as propraetor, the old province; for Titus Otacilius the fleet; and for them new armies were not added.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So also for Marcus Valerius Greece and Macedonia, with the legion and the fleet which he had; for Quintus Mucius Sardinia, with its old army &mdash;there were two legions; for Gaius Terentius one legion which he already commanded, and Picenum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was further ordered that two city legions should be enrolled, also twenty thousand allies. With these generals, these forces, they defended the Roman empire at the same time against many wars, either already begun or foreshadowed.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The consuls, after enrolling two legions for the city and enlisting recruits to reinforce the others, before setting out from the city made expiation for the prodigies which had been reported. The wall and gates at...
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and at Aricia even the temple of Jupiter had been struck by lightning. And for eyes and ears there were other illusions, accepted as real: that in the river at Tarracina forms of warships which had no existence had been seen; and that in the temple of Jupiter Vicilinus, in the territory of Compsa,<note>Cf. XXIII. i. 1. In that southern part of Samnium Jupiter had the rare epithet Vicilinus.</note> there was a sound of clashing arms; and that the river at Amiternum ran with blood. These portents being expiated according to a decree of the pontiffs, the consuls set out, Sempronius for Lucania, Fabius for Apulia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The father came as his son's lieutenant to the camp at Suessula.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While the son was advancing to meet him and the lictors out of respect for the father's dignity were silent as they preceded the consul, the old man rode past eleven fasces. And not until the consul had ordered the last lictor to take notice and the latter had called <pb id="p.319"/>out the order to dismount, did the father leap to the<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> ground and say: <quote>I wished to find out, son, whether you were quite aware that you are consul.</quote><note>A famous story. Gellius (II. ii. 13) gives the brief version of Claudius Quadrigarius.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To that camp came Dasius Altinius of Arpi secretly by night with three slaves, promising that if rewarded he would betray Arpi.<note>In northern Apulia, east of Luceria and not far from the Adriatic; cf. iii. 16; xii. 3, 5; XXIII. xlvi. 8.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When Fabius brought the matter before the council, the others thought that as a deserter he should be scourged and put to death, a waverer and an enemy to both sides, who after the disaster at Cannae, as if loyalty should side with success, had gone over to Hannibal and dragged Arpi into revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But now, because, contrary to his expectation and his wishes, the Roman state seemed to be springing up again, as it were from the roots, he was promising to present the betrayed with a new betrayal, and always taking part with one side, but with the other in heart, faithless as an ally, inconstant as an enemy. To the betrayers of Falerii<note>Cf. V. xxvii. 2 ff.</note> and of Pyrrhus<note>This story was told in the lost XIIIth book (cf. <hi rend="italics">Epit.</hi>).</note> he should be added as a third example to deserters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the contrary the consul's father Fabius said that men were forgetting the situation, when they exercised free judgment in each individual case in the midst of the heat of war, as though in peace, the result was that, although
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the thing to be done and to be borne in mind was rather to prevent any allies-if this was somehow possible from abandoning the Roman people, they were not bearing that in mind. On the contrary, they were saying that, if a man came to his senses and turned his eyes to the previous alliance, he ought to be made a <pb id="p.321"/>warning example.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If then it was permissible to leave<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> the Romans, but not to return to them, who could doubt that soon the Roman state, despaired of by the allies, would see the whole of Italy joined together by Carthaginian treaties?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For himself, however, he was not the man to think that any trust should be placed in Altinius, but would follow a middle course.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He thought it best, namely, that Altinius should not be treated as either enemy or ally for the present, that under qualified arrest he should be guarded for the duration of the war in some loyal city-state not far from the camp. When the war was over they should then deliberate whether his previous defection deserved punishment more than his present return merited pardon. They agreed with Fabius, and the man was turned over to representatives of Cales, himself and his companions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And it was ordered that the gold &mdash;and the weight of it was considerable &mdash;which he had then brought with him should be kept for him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At Cales he was free to go about by day followed by guards, at night confined and watched by them. At Arpi it was in his house that he was first missed and search for him began.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then the report spreading through the city caused the usual commotion when a leading man is missing, and for fear of a rebellion they at once sent messengers.<note><hi rend="italics">I,e.</hi> to Hannibal.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Carthaginian was by no means displeased at this news, since he had long regarded the man himself with suspicion, as unsettled in his loyalty, and also he now had an excuse for taking possession of the property of a man of such wealth and selling it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But that men might believe he was yielding to anger rather than greed, he added cruelty also to avarice, that is, he summoned
				<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> the wife and children to the camp, and, <pb id="p.323"/>after investigating first the flight of Altinius, then<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> how much gold and silver had been left in his house, now fully informed, he burned them alive.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Fabius setting out from Suessula first pressed the siege of Arpi. There he pitched his camp at a distance of about five hundred paces, and after observing the situation of the city and the walls at close range, he decided to attack just at that part of the city which was best defended by walls, because he saw that that was the most carelessly guarded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He assembled everything useful for siege operations, selected from the entire army the pick of the centurions, and placed tribunes who were brave men in command of them. And he assigned them six hundred soldiers &mdash;all that seemed necessary &mdash;and ordered them to carry ladders to that place, when the trumpet should sound for the fourth watch.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was a low, narrow gate there, as the street, leading through a deserted part of the city, was not much frequented. He ordered them first to climb over the wall by means of their ladders, and then to open that gate from the inside, or else break down the bars, and then, holding a part of the city, to give the signal on a trumpet for the rest of the troops to move up. He would have everything ready and in order.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These commands were carried out with spirit, and a circumstance which seemed likely to hamper action proved of the greatest help to secrecy. Heavy rain beginning at midnight forced the guards and sentries to slip away from their posts and run to cover.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And the sound, at first of a heavier shower, prevented the noise they made in forcing the gate from being heard clearly, and then, gentler and more monotonous as they listened, it lulled a great many <pb id="p.325"/>of the men to sleep.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Once in possession of the gate,<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> they ordered the trumpeters, posted at equal intervals along the road, to sound, in order to summon the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This done according to agreement, the consul orders the standards to be carried out of the camp, and a little before daylight enters the city through the gate they had forced.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not until then were the enemy aroused, as the noise of the rain was now lessening and daylight approaching.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the city there was a garrison of Hannibal's, about five thousand armed men, and the citizens of Arpi also had armed three thousand men. These were the first troops with which the Carthaginians, to prevent any treachery in the rear, confronted the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They fought at first in darkness and in narrow streets. The Romans gained possession not only of the streets but also of the houses nearest to the gate, that they might not be attacked and wounded from above.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon some Arpini and Romans recognized each other and then began conversations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans asked what the Arpini meant, for what offence on the part of the Romans, or for what service on the part of the Carthaginians they, although Italians, were waging war for foreigners and barbarians against their old allies the Romans, and making Italy a tributary and a taxpayer to Africa.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Arpini pleaded as excuse that in complete ignorance they had been sold by their leading citizens to the Carthaginian and captured and overpowered by a few men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With that beginning larger groups conversed with larger. Finally the magistrate of Arpi was escorted by fellowcitizens to the consul, and after promises had been given in the midst of standards and battle-lines, the <pb id="p.327"/>Arpini suddenly fought for the Romans, turning their<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> weapons against the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Spanish troops also, hardly fewer than a thousand men, after making no other terms with the consul than that the Punic garrison be allowed
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> to go without injury, brought their standards over to the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The gates were opened for the Carthaginians, they were allowed to leave, as promised, and came unharmed to Hannibal at Salapia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Arpi, with the loss of no man but a single veteran traitor and recent deserter, was restored to the Romans. To the Spaniards double rations were ordered to be issued, and the state repeatedly availed itself of their brave and faithful service.</p> 
			<p>While one consul was in Apulia, the other<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Gracchus; xliv. 9.</note> in Lucania, a hundred and twelve noble Campanian horsemen, setting out from Capua, with permission of the magistrates, under pretext of plundering the enemy's country, came to the Roman camp above Suessula.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They told the guards outside who they were; that they wished to speak with the praetor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Gnaeus Fulvius was in command of the camp, and on being informed, he ordered that ten of their number be disarmed and brought to him. After he had heard their demands &mdash;and they made no other request than that upon the recovery of Capua their property should be restored to them, they were all taken under his protection.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And the other praetor, Sempronius Tuditanus, took the town of Atrinum<note>Situation unknown.</note> by storm. More than seven thousand men were captured and a considerable amount of coined copper and silver.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At Rome a terrible fire lasted two nights and a day. Everything between the Salinae and Porta Carmentalis was levelled to the ground, <pb id="p.329"/>including the Aequimaelium and Vicus Iugarius,<note>The devastated area was that along the river from the Aventine to the Capitoline, including part of the southeast slope (Aequimaelium) of the latter, and the street (Vicus Iugarius) leading to the Forum. The temples mentioned were near the Tiber and close together; cf. XXXIII. xxvii. 4.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> also the Temples of Fortune and Mater
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Matuta. Outside the gate also the fire spread to a distance and destroyed many buildings sacred<note>Among these was the Temple of Spes, one of three in the Forum Holitorium, outside the wall; XXI. lxii. 4; XXV. vii. 6.</note> and profane.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same year Publius and Gnaeus Cornelius, in consequence of their success in Spain and their recovery of many old allies and the addition of new allies, enlarged their hopes in the direction of Africa as well.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was Syphax, king of the Numidians,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> of the western Numidians, the Masaesulians, in Algeria and Oran; XXVIII. xvii. 5.</note> who had suddenly become an enemy of the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To him they sent three centurions as legates, to establish friendship and alliance with him, and to promise that if he should continue to embarrass the Carthaginians by war, it would be acceptable to the senate and the Roman people, and they would endeavour to return the favour at the right moment and with generous interest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This embassy pleased the barbarian, and he conferred with the ambassadors on the conduct of the war; and hearing what was said by experienced soldiers, he noted, from comparison with so well-ordered a system, how many things he did not know himself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, as the first act befitting good and faithful allies, be begged that two of the legates might report to their generals, and one remain with him as instructor in tactics. He said the Numidian nation was inexpert in infantry warfare, of service only as horsemen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was the way their ancestors from their earliest history had waged war, thus they had <pb id="p.331"/>themselves been trained from boyhood. But he<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> had an enemy who relied upon infantry battles, and if he wished to be a match for him in military strength he too must acquire infantry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And for that purpose his kingdom was supplied with men in great numbers, but they did not understand the art of arming and equipping them and placing them in battle-line. Everything was formless and unmethodical, as if a mob had been gathered by chance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The legates replied that for the present they would do as he desired, after receiving his pledge to send back the man at once, if their generals should not approve of their action.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Quintus Statorius was the name of the one who remained with the king. With the two Romans the king sent three legates from the Numidians to Spain, to receive confirmation from the Roman generals.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He further instructed them at once to persuade Numidians who were auxiliaries in the forces of the Carthaginians to desert them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And Statorius out of the mass of young men enrolled infantry for the king, organized them almost in the Roman manner, taught them in formation and evolution to follow standards and keep their ranks, and to such an extent accustomed them to fortifying and other regular
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> duties of the soldier that in a short time the king had as much confidence in his infantry as in his cavalry, and in a regular engagement in formal array on level ground he defeated the Carthaginian enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Romans also in Spain profited greatly by the coming of the king's representatives. For upon the news of their arrival desertions by the Numidians began to be frequent.</p> 
			<p>Thus began the friendship of the Romans with Syphax. When the Carthaginians learned of the <pb id="p.333"/>matter they at once sent legates to Gala, who reigned<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> in the other part of Numidia,<note>The eastern part, adjoining Carthaginian territory. Cirta (Constantine) was Syphax's capital, until it fell to Masinissa in <date value="-203">203 B.C.</date>; XXX. xii.</note> his people being called the Maesulians. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gala had a son Masinissa,<note>Who fought against the Romans in Spain down to the time of Gala's death in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>, and then became an ally of Rome, and a friend of Scipio. At present he must have been nearer twenty-seven, since he died in <date value="-149">149 B.C.</date> at 92 (<hi rend="italics">Epit.</hi> 48 fin.; cf. 50).</note> seventeen years old, but a young man of such promise that even then it was evident that he would make the kingdom larger and richer than what he had received.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The legates stated that, inasmuch as Syphax had attached himself to the Romans, in order, through alliance with them, to be more powerful against the kings and peoples of Africa, it would be well for Gala too to attach himself as soon as possible to the Carthaginians, before Syphax should cross into Spain or the Romans into Africa.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Syphax could be surprised, they said, while he had as yet no advantage from his treaty with the Romans except the name.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They easily persuaded Gala to send an army, as his son was begging for the command; and reinforced by the Carthaginian legions, Masinissa defeated Syphax in a great battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thirty thousand men are said to have been slain in that battle. Syphax with a few horsemen fled from the field to the Maurusian Numidians, who live far away, near the Ocean opposite Gades.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And as the barbarians on hearing of him flocked together from all sides, he soon armed immense forces with which to cross into Spain, separated only by a narrow strait. But Masinissa came with his victorious army, and there by himself, without any help from the Carthaginians, he carried on war against Syphax with great distinction.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.335"/>
			<p>In Spain nothing notable occurred except that the<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> Roman commanders attracted to their side the young men of the Celtiberians at the same pay at which these had made an agreement with the Carthaginians, and more than three hundred Spaniards of the highest rank were sent to Italy to win over their fellow-countrymen who were among Hannibal's auxiliaries.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This is the only occurrence of that year in Spain that is worthy of record, since the Romans had no mercenary soldiers in their camps previous to the Celtiberians whom they had at that time.</p></div1>

			<p>HIERONYMUS, king of the Syracusans, whose father<note>An error for grandfather.</note> Hiero had been a friend of the Roman people, revolted to the
				Carthaginians and on account of his cruelty and haughtiness was slain by his own men. Tiberius Sempronius
				Gracchus as proconsul fought with success against the
				Carthaginians and Hanno their general near Beneventum,
				chiefly by the help of the slaves, whom he ordered to be
				free men. Claudius Marcellus, the consul, in Sicily, which

				was sent to conduct that war. Furthermore the book

			<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHILE these things were being done in Africa<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> and Spain, Hannibal spent the summer in the Sallentine region,<note>Hannibal is now in the southern part of Calabria, three days' march from Tarentum; cf. viii. 12. He had previously been near Arpi, in Apulia; XXIV. xlv. 11 ff.</note> in the hope of getting possession of the city of Tarentum through treachery. Meantime, however, Sallentine cities of no importance went over to his side.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the same time among the Bruttians, out of twelve states which in the previous year had revolted to the Carthaginians, Consentia and Taurianum returned to their allegiance to the Roman people;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and more would have returned if a prefect of the allies, Titus Pomponius Veientanus, who by successfully ravaging Bruttian territory a number of times gained the appearance of a regularly appointed general, had not gathered a hastily mustered army and engaged Hanno.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A great many men were slain or captured there, an ill-organized mass, however, of rustics and slaves. It was the smallest part of the loss that, along with the rest, the prefect was captured, who was responsible at that time for a reckless battle, and had previously been a tax-farmer possessed of all the dishonest devices, faithless and ruinous both to the state and to the companies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Sempronius, the consul, fought many small engagements in Lucania, not one worthy of record, and took by storm a number of unimportant Lucanian towns.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.343"/>
			<p>The longer the war dragged on and success and<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> failure altered the situation, and quite as much so the attitude of men, superstitious fears, in large part foreign at that, invaded the state to such a degree that either men or else gods suddenly seemed changed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And now not only in secret and within the walls of houses were Roman rites abandoned, but in public places also and in the Forum and on the Capitol there was a crowd of women who were following the custom of the fathers neither in their sacrifices nor in prayers to the gods.<note>Forsaken, as they felt, by their own gods, the populace were turning to foreign divinities and strange cults.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Petty priests and also prophets had taken hold on men's minds. And the number of these was increased by the mass of rustics forced by want and fear into the city from their farms neglected and endangered because of the long war, and by easy profit from the delusion of others-a trade which they plied as though it were sanctioned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At first good men's indignation was voiced in private; then the matter reached the senate and now even official complaints.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The aediles and the three police magistrates were roundly censured by the senate because they did not stop it; and after they had attempted to drive that crowd out of the Forum and to scatter the properties required for the rites, they narrowly escaped violence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Now that the disorder appeared to be too strong to be quelled by the lower magistrates, the senate assigned to Marcus Aemilius,<note>An error of Livy for Marcus Atilius; XXIV. xliv. 2, where Aemilius, <hi rend="italics">praetor peregrinus,</hi> assigns his duties to Atilius, <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus,</hi> and takes a command in Apulia. The error is repeated in iii. 12 and xii. 3.</note> the city praetor, the task of freeing the people from such superstitions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He read the decree of the senate in an assembly, and also issued an edict that whoever had books of prophecies or prayers or a ritual of sacrifice set down in writing should bring all such <pb id="p.345"/>books and writings<note>Exact compliance with written directions being essential, as in the Roman religion, to seize the texts was in effect to suppress the cults.</note> to him before the first of April,<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> and that no one should sacrifice in a public or consecrated place according to a strange or foreign rite.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A number of priests of the state died that year: Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, pontifex maximus, and Gaius Papirius Masso, son of Gaius, a pontifex, and Publius Furius Philus, an augur, and Gaius Papirius Masso, son of Lucius, a decemvir in charge of rites.<note>Cf. xii. 10 f.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In place of Lentulus they made Marcus Cornelius Cethegus a pontiff and Gnaeus Servilius Caepio in that of Papirius; Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was named augur, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, decemvir in charge of rites.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the consular elections the time was now approaching, but because the consuls were occupied with the war and it was not thought advisable to call them away, Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, named Gaius Claudius Cento dictator to hold the elections. He in turn named Quintus Fulvius Flaccus master of the horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the first day available for elections the dictator announced the choice as consuls of Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, master of the horse, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who as praetor had had Sicily as his province.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the following were elected praetors: Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, Gaius Claudius Nero, Marcus Junius Silanus, Publius Cornelius Sulla. Having finished the elections, the dictator laid down his office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Curule aedile that year, together with Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, was Publius Cornelius Scipio,<note>Scipio was probably only 22, but the famous law fixing statutory ages for the different offices (Lex Villia annalis) was not passed until <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date>; XL. xliv. 1.</note> who was later called Africanus. When he was a candidate for the aedileship, and the tribunes of the plebs tried to oppose him, saying that he ought not to be considered because he did <pb id="p.347"/>not have the legal age for candidacy, he said, <quote>If all<note type="margin">B.C. 213</note> the citizens want to make me aedile I have years enough.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thereupon with such enthusiasm they separated to form by tribes in order to cast their votes, that the tribunes suddenly gave up their attempt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The generosity of the aediles consisted in celebrating the Roman Games<note>The <hi rend="italics">ludi Romani</hi> or <hi rend="italics">maximi</hi> occurred in mid-September and lasted four days. For repetition cf. XXIII. xxx. 16.</note> splendidly, for the resources of that time, and in repeating them for one day; also in giving ... measures<note><hi rend="italics">A congius</hi> held about three quarts.</note> of oil for each precinct.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Lucius Villius Tappulus and Marcus Fundanius Fundulus as plebeian aediles brought before the people charges of immorality against a number of matrons. Some of these being convicted, they drove them into exile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Plebeian Games were repeated for two days, and on account of the festival a banquet for Jupiter was held.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quintus Fulvius Flaccus and Appius Claudius<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> entered upon their consulship, the former for the third time. And the praetors received by lot the following assignments: Publius Cornelius Sulla, the duties of praetor urbanus and praetor peregrinus,<note>As in wartime cases to be heard by the <hi rend="italics">praetor peregrines</hi> would be much reduced in number, he could be spared for service at the front; XXIV. xliv. 2.</note> previously two separate offices;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, Apulia, Gaius Claudius Nero, Suessula,<note>A military base in Campania, southeast of Capua, half-way to Nola. Its Castra Claudiana lay near the entrance to the Caudine Pass. Cf. XXIII. xxxi. 3; XXIV. xvii. 2; xliv. 3.</note> Marcus Junius Silanus, Etruria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the consuls were assigned by decree the war with Hannibal and two legions each. The one was to take over his troops from Quintus Fabius, consul in the previous year, the other from Fulvius Centumalus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of the praetors, Fulvius Flaccus was to have the legions which had been at Luceria under the praetor Aemilius, Nero Claudius the one<note>Terentius Varro had had only one legion; XXIV. xliv. 5.</note> which had been in the Picene district under Gaius Terentius. They were themselves to enlist more recruits for the same. To Marcus Junius the <pb id="p.349"/>city legions of the previous year were given for<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Etruria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus their commands and provinces, Lucania and Gaul, with their armies, were continued.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And the same was done for Publius Lentulus, within the limits of the old province in Sicily, and for Marcellus, whose province was Syracuse and up to the former boundaries of Hiero's kingdom.<note>Cf. XXIV. xliv. 4; vii. 9.</note> The fleet was assigned to Titus Otacilius, Greece to Marcus Valerius, Sardinia to Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the Spanish provinces to Publius and Gnaeus Cornelius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In addition to the old armies two city legions were enrolled by the consuls, and the total that year amounted to twenty-three legions.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The consular levy was hampered by the conduct of Marcus Postumius of Pyrgi, which almost occasioned a serious insurrection.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Postumius was a tax-farmer, who in many years had had no equal in dishonesty and avarice in the state, except Titus Pomponius Veientanus, whom the Carthaginians under Hanno's command had captured in the preceding year, while he was rashly ravaging the country in Lucania.<note>Cf. i. 3 f.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> These men, since the state assumed the risk from violent storms in the case of shipments to the armies, had falsely reported imaginary shipwrecks, and even those which they had correctly reported had been brought about by their own trickery, not by accident.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They would put small cargoes of little value on old, battered vessels, sink them at sea, after taking off the crews in small boats that were in readiness, and then falsely declare that the shipments were far more valuable.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This dishonesty had been reported in the previous year to Marcus Aemilius, the praetor, and by him brought before the senate, but it was not branded by <pb id="p.351"/>any decree of the senate, because the senators were<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> unwilling to offend the tax-farmers as a class at such a crisis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The people proved a more unsparing avenger of dishonesty; namely, two tribunes of the plebs, Spurius and Lucius Carvilius, were at length aroused, and seeing that the affair was unpopular and notorious, imposed a fine of two hundred thousand asses upon Marcus Postumius. When the day for his protest against this fine arrived, the assembly of the commons<note>It was left for the people to confirm or remit such a fine; cf. XXXVII. li. 4 f.; lviii. 1; Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> XI. 18; <hi rend="italics">de Leg.</hi> III. 6.</note> was so large that the open space on the Capitol could scarcely contain the crowd.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> After the arguments were concluded, there seemed to be but one hope, namely, if Gaius
				<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> Servilius Casca, a tribune of the plebs who was a blood-relative of Postumius, should interpose his veto before the tribes should be called to vote.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The tribunes provided witnesses,<note>The witnesses were to watch the balloting.</note> cleared the people away, and the urn was brought, that they might determine by lot in which tribe the Latins<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> such Latins as were present at Rome. In which of the tribes they should vote was determined by the tribunes, who cast lots.</note> should vote. Meantime the tax-farmers pressed Casca to adjourn that day's hearing before the assembly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The people protested; and it so happened that the first seat at the end of the platform was occupied by Casca, whose mind was swayed at once by fear and shame.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Finding in him no sufficient protection, the publicans, in order to prevent action, rushed in a wedge through the space cleared by removal of the crowd, while at the sametime they reviled the people and the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> And it had almost come to a battle when Fulvius, the consul, said to the tribunes, <quote>Do you not see that you are reduced to the ranks,<note>Any action interfering with a tribune's duties or privileges was held equivalent to degrading him from office; cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxxii. 9; xxxiii. 1.</note> it was said, a man whose exile would have been followed by the ruin of the city, had allowed himself to be condemned by the angry citizens;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that before his time the decemvirs, under whose laws they were then still living, and later many leading men in the state, had submitted to the judgment of the people in their cases; that Postumius of Pyrgi had wrested the vote from the Roman people, had brought to naught an assembly of the plebs, reduced the tribunes to the ranks, drawn up a battle-line against the Roman people, had taken his position, to separate the tribunes from the people and to prevent the tribes from being summoned to vote.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nothing had restrained men from slaughter and battle but the forbearance of the magistrates in yielding for the moment to the mad audacity of a few men, and in allowing themselves and the Roman people to be worsted, also in that, as regards the voting, which the defendant would have prevented by force of arms, they had of their own accord suspended it, to avoid giving excuse to those eager for the fray.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These words were interpreted by all the best citizens as deserved by an outrageous occurrence, and the senate declared that this violence had been employed against the state, setting a dangerous precedent. Thereupon the Carvilii, tribunes of the people, in place of the procedure to fix the amount of the fine, at once named a day for Postumius' appearance on a capital charge, and ordered that if he did not furnish sureties he should be seized by an attendant and taken to prison. Postumius furnished sureties, but did not appear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.355"/>The tribunes put the question to the plebs and the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> plebs ordained that, if Marcus Postumius should not appear before the first of May, and on being summoned on that day should not reply nor be excused, it should be understood that he was in exile, and be decided that his property should be sold and himself refused water and fire. The tribunes then began to name a day for the appearance on a capital charge of each of those who had been instigators of riot and sedition, and to demand sureties from them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first they threw into prison those who did not give security, and then even those who were able to do so. Avoiding this danger many went into exile.</p> 
			<p>V. Such was the outcome of dishonesty on the part of the publicans and of audacity seeking to cover dishonesty. Next was held an election for the choice of a pontifex maximus. This election was conducted by a new pontiff, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Three men canvassed with great rivalry: Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the consul, who had been consul twice before and also censor, and Titus Manlius Torquatus, likewise distinguished by two consulships and a censorship, and Publius Licinius Crassus, who was only about to be a candidate for a curule aedileship. This young man defeated in that contest old men who had held high offices.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Before him for a hundred and twenty years no one who had not occupied a curule chair had been elected pontifex maximus, except Publius Cornelius Calussa.</p> 
			<p>The consuls were finding it difficult to complete the levy, since the scant supply of young men was hardly sufficient for the two purposes, enrollment of new legions for the city and replacements for the old ones.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senate accordingly forbade them to give <pb id="p.357"/>up the attempt and ordered the appointment of two<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> commissions of three officials each, to inspect in rural districts, market-towns and local centres<note>For <hi rend="italics">for a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">conciliabula,</hi> cf. xxii. 4; XXXIX. xiv. 7; xviii. 2; XL. xxxvii. 3 f.; XLIII. xiv. 10. <hi rend="italics">A forum</hi> was a Roman settlement, usually on an important road (e.g. Forum Appii), but lacking the status of a <hi rend="italics">colonia.

				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The tribunes of the plebs, if they should see fit, were to bring before the people a bill that, in the case of those who had taken the military oath at less than seventeen years, their campaigns should run just as if they had been recruited at seventeen years or older. In accordance with this decree of the senate two commissions of three members each were appointed and they conducted the search for freeborn men in the country.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>At the same time a letter from Marcus Marcellus in Sicily was read in the senate concerning demands of the soldiers serving under Publius Lentulus. This army was the remnant of the disaster at Cannae, and, as has been said above, was relegated to Sicily, not to be brought back to Italy before the end of the Punic War.<note>Cf. XXIII. xxv. 7; XXIV. xviii. 9.</note> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These men with Lentulus' permission sent their leading knights and centurions and picked men from the infantry of the legions to Marcus Marcellus at his winter quarters as their representatives, and one of them, receiving permission to speak, said:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>In your consulship,<note>But at the time of the <hi rend="italics">senatus consultum</hi> Marcellus was not consul, but praetor, and the men in question were in his own army; cf. XXIII. xxiv. 1; xxv. 7.</note> Marcus Marcellus, and in Italy we should have come to you already, directly after the senate made in our case a decree that, if not unjust, was surely severe, had it not been our hope that we were being sent into a province thrown <pb id="p.359"/>into confusion by the death of its kings, to carry on<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> a serious
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> war against Sicilians and Carthaginians combined, and that by our blood and wounds we were to give satisfaction to the senate, just as in the time of our fathers the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> men who had been captured by Pyrrhus at Heraclea had done by fighting against Pyrrhus himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And yet for what desert of ours have you been angry at us, conscript fathers, or are now angry? It seems that I am looking at both consuls and the entire senate when I look at you, Marcus Marcellus. If we had had you as consul at Cannae the lot of the state, and of ourselves as well, would be a better one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Before I complain of our plight, permit us, I pray, to clear ourselves of the offence of which we are charged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If it was not by anger of the gods nor by Fate, according to whose law the chain of human events is unalterably linked, but by a fault that we were undone at Cannae, whose fault, pray, was it? Of the soldiers or of the generals? For my part I, a soldier, will never say anything about my general, especially since I know that he was thanked by the senate because he did not lose hope for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> state, and that after the flight from Cannae his command was continued year after year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The others too who survived that disaster, the men whom we had as our tribunes of the soldiers, canvass for offices, we have heard, and hold them, and govern provinces. Can it be, conscript fathers, that you readily pardon yourselves and your sons, but are cruel to these creatures of no account? And while it was no disgrace to the consul and other leading men in the state to flee, since there was no other hope, did you send your common soldiers into battle to die inevitably?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At the Allia<note>CF. V. xxxviii</note> almost the entire <pb id="p.361"/>army fled; at the Caudine Forks,<note>Cf. IX. iv. The following phrase is exaggerated.</note> without even<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> attempting a battle, the army surrendered its weapons to the enemy, not to mention other shameful defeats of armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But so far were men from devising any disgrace for those armies that the city of Rome was recovered by the army which
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> had fled from the Allia over to Veii, and the Caudine legions, which had returned to Rome without their arms, were sent back armed into Samnium and sent under the yoke that same enemy who had exulted in a disgrace now their own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But at Cannae can any one accuse the army of panic and fright, where more than fifty thousand men fell, whence the consul fled with seventy horsemen, and of which no one survives except the man whom the enemy, tired of slaying, spared?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At the time when ransom was refused to captives, men were everywhere praising us because we had saved ourselves for the state, had returned to the consul at Venusia and had formed the semblance of a regular army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But now we are in a worse situation than in our fathers' time were captives. For in their case only their arms and their rank and the position of their tents when in camp were changed. These, however, they recovered by a single service rendered to the state and one victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Not one of them was sent into exile, not one of them was deprived of the hope of serving out his term; in fine they were given an enemy, so that in battle with him they might once for all end either life or disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But we, against whom no charge can be brought except that we are to blame for the survival of any Roman soldier from the battle-line at Cannae, have been sent far away, not only from our native city and Italy, but also from the enemy, that there
					<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> <pb id="p.363"/>we may grow old in exile, that we may have no hope,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> no opportunity of wiping out disgrace, none of appeasing the anger of our citizens, none even of dying bravely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It is neither an end of our disgrace nor a reward for our courage that we ask. Only let us prove our spirit and put our courage into practice. It is for hardship and danger we are asking, that we may do the duty of men and soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> The war in Sicily has now been carried on with intensity for two years. Some cities are being stormed by the Carthaginian, some by the Roman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Infantry and cavalry clash in battle-line. At Syracuse the war goes on by land and by sea. The cries of men in battle and the din of arms can be heard by us, who are ourselves unemployed and listless, as if we had neither hands nor weapons. With legions of slaves Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, has engaged the enemy again and again in battle formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> As a reward for their service they have freedom<note>XXIV. xvi. 9.</note> and citizenship. Reckon us at least slaves purchased for this war; let us engage the enemy and by fighting earn freedom. Do you wish, sir, to test our courage on sea, on land, in battle-line, in besieging cities?
					<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> We demand all the worst in hardship and danger, in order that what should have been done at Cannae be done as soon as possible, since every day that we have since lived has been marked for disgrace.</quote></p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the close of this speech they fell at Marcellus' knees. Marcellus said the matter was neither within his competence nor his authority; he would write to the senate and do everything, according to the opinion of the fathers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The letter was delivered to the new consuls and by them read in the senate. And after discussion of the letter the senate decreed <pb id="p.365"/>as follows:
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that to soldiers who had deserted their<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> comrades in battle at Cannae the senate saw no reason why the welfare of the state should be entrusted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If Marcus Claudius, the proconsul, should take a different view, he should do what he thought to accord with the interest of the state and his own conscience, provided that no one of them should be exempt from duties, or be decorated for valour, or be brought back to Italy, so long as the enemy should be in the land of Italy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Elections were then held by the praetor urbanus in accordance with a decision of the senate and a plebiscite, and at these there were elected five commissioners for the restoration of the walls and towers, and two boards of three, one to recover sacred vessels and register temple gifts, the
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> other to rebuild the Temple of Fortune and that of Mater Matuta inside Porta Carmentalis, and that of Hope outside the gate &mdash;temples that had been destroyed by fire the preceding year.<note>Cf. XXIV. xlvii. 15 f.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>There were terrible storms; on the Alban Mount it rained stones steadily for two days. Many things were struck by lightning: two temples on the Capitol, the embankment of the camp above Suessula in many places, and two sentries were killed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At Cumae the wall and certain towers were not merely struck by the bolts but even thrown down. At Reate a huge stone seemed to fly, the sun to be redder than usual and of a bloody colour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On account of these prodigies there was a single day of prayer, and for several days the consuls devoted themselves to religious rites; and about the same time there was a nine days' observance.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Phileas of Tarentum, a man of restless spirit and quite unable to endure the long inactivity in which he seemed to be losing his powers, had been at Rome for a long time, nominally as an ambassador. Thus he found means of access to the hostages from Tarentum and Thurii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They were kept under guard in the Atrium Libertatis, with less watchfulness because it was to the interest neither of the hostages themselves nor of their states to outwit the Romans. Phileas worked upon them by frequent conferences, and after bribing two temple-wardens brought them out of confinement at nightfall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then he himself fled, sharing their secret journey.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At daybreak their flight was reported everywhere in the city, and the men sent to pursue them arrested and brought them all back from Tarracina. They were led into the Comitium, scourged with rods with the approval of the people, and thrown down from the Rock.<note>As in XXIV. xx. 6.</note></p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The relentlessness of this punishment outraged two of the most important Greek cities in Italy, both as states and personally as well, whenever
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> individuals were connected either by relationship or friendship with those who were so cruelly executed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of those so connected some thirteen noble youths of Tarentum formed a conspiracy, and Nico and Philemenus were the leaders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thinking that they ought to confer with Hannibal before taking any step, these men left the city by night under pretext of hunting and set out to go to him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And when they were not far from his camp, the rest concealed themselves in the woods near the road; but Nico <pb id="p.369"/>and Philemenus advanced to the outposts, were<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> seized and at their own request brought before Hannibal. After explaining the reasons for their plan and what they were plotting, they were warmly commended and loaded with promises. In order to make their fellow-citizens believe they had left the city to forage, they were bidden to drive to the city cattle belonging to the Carthaginians which had been turned out to graze. Promise was given that they would do so in safety and without a conflict.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The young men's booty attracted attention, and less astonishment was caused by their making the same venture again and again.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On meeting Hannibal again they had his formal assurance that the Tarentines as free men should have their own laws and all their possessions, and pay no tribute to the Carthaginians nor admit a garrison against their own wish;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that houses occupied by Romans should be handed over, together with the garrison, and be assigned to the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So much agreed upon, Philemenus thereafter made it his more constant habit to leave the city and return to it by night. In fact he was noted for his devotion to the chase, and his hounds and other equipment would follow him. Usually he carried back something he had taken or that the enemy had brought him by agreement, and he would give it either to the commandant or to the gate-guards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They believed that he came and went preferably by night for fear of the enemy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>When the thing had become so habitual that the gate was opened at whatever hour of the night he gave the signal by a whistle, it seemed to Hannibal to be the time for action.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He was at a distance of three days' march, and there he played the invalid, that his <pb id="p.371"/>keeping a fixed camp so long in one and the same<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> place might cause less wonder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> ' The Romans also on garrison duty at Tarentum had ceased to find such prolonged inaction suspicious. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Once he had determined, however, to go to Tarentum, he picked ten thousand infantry and cavalry &mdash;the men whom he thought best suited to the enterprise on account of swiftness of foot and lightness of arms &mdash;and at the fourth watch of the night got in motion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And he ordered some eighty Numidian horsemen, who were sent in advance, to scour the country near the roads and keep an eye in every direction, that no farmer in the distance might observe the column without being noticed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were to hold up those ahead of them and slay those they met, so that people living near by might have- the impression of foragers rather than of an army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He himself, after a forced march, pitched camp at a distance of about fifteen miles from Tarentum. And not even there did he announce whither they were going. He merely summoned the soldiers and bade them all to keep to the road and not allow anyone to turn aside or leave his place in the column; and to be especially alert to hear commands and not to do anything without orders from their officers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He would in due time inform them what he wished to have done. About the same hour a rumour had preceded him to Tarentum that a- few Numidian horsemen were ravaging the farms and had inspired widespread alarm among the rustics.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On receiving this news the Roman commandant was only so far aroused- as -to command part of the cavalry to go out the next day at dawn, in order to prevent depredations of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the rest his attention was so little aroused that <pb id="p.373"/>on the contrary the raid of the Numidians was to<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> him a proof that Hannibal and the army had not stirred from their camp.</p> 
			<p>Hannibal broke camp early in the night.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> at the time of the first sound sleep, not yet <hi rend="italics">intempesta</hi> <hi rend="italics">nocte</hi> (toward midnight); Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> I. 57;<hi rend="italics"></hi>Macrobius I. iii. 15.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> His guide was Philemenus with his usual load of game. The rest of the traitors were waiting for acts previously arranged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It had been agreed, namely, that Philemenus, as he brought in his game by the usual postern, should lead in armed men, while on another side Hannibal should approach the Temenitis Gate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That quarter is toward the inland, facing east; tombs occupy a considerable space inside the walls. As he approached the gate the fire signal was given by Hannibal according to agreement, and in reply from Nico the same signal blazed; then on both sides the flames were extinguished. Hannibal was leading his men silently to the gate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nico unexpectedly attacks the sleeping sentries in their beds, slays them and opens the gate. Hannibal with his infantry column enters, orders the cavalry to halt, so that
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> they can meet the enemy in the open, in whatever direction the situation may require. And Philemenus on another side of the city was approaching the postern by which he was accustomed to come and go.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> His well-known voice and the now familiar signal having aroused a sentry, the little gate was opened for Philemenus, just as he was saying they could scarcely carry the weight of a huge beast.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> While two young men were carrying in the boar, he himself followed them with a huntsman who was unencumbered, and as the sentry, thrown off his guard by its marvellous size, faced the men who were carrying it, Philemenus ran him through with a hunting spear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then about thirty armed men <pb id="p.375"/>entered, cut down the rest of the sentries and broke<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> open the neighbouring gate; and the column with its standards at once rushed in. Thence they were marched in silence to the market-place and joined Hannibal. The Carthaginian then sent two thousand Gauls, divided into three units, through the city, and to each he attached two Tarentines as guides.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He ordered them to occupy the most frequented streets, and when the uproar had begun, to slay the Romans everywhere, to spare the townspeople.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But to make this possible he instructed the young Tarentines, whenever they saw one of their own people in the distance, to bid him be quiet and say nothing and be of good cheer.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Already there was such uproar and shouting as is usual in a captured city, but what it was about no one quite knew for certain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Tarentines believed the Romans had surprised them, in order to plunder the city; the Romans thought it was some kind of uprising treacherously started by the townspeople.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The commandant, aroused by the first uproar, escaped to the harbour; picked up by a skiff, he was rowed around from there to the citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Confusion was caused also by the sound of a trumpet from the theatre. For it was a Roman trumpet, furnished by the traitors for this very purpose; and in addition, being unskillfully sounded by a Greek, it left it uncertain who was giving the signal and to whom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When day broke the Punic and Gallic arms, now recognized, relieved the Romans of their uncertainty, and at the same time the Greeks, seeing slain Romans everywhere, were aware that the city had been captured by Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When it was no longer twilight and the Romans who survived the slaughter <pb id="p.377"/>had fled to the citadel, and the uproar was gradually<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> being stilled, Hannibal then gave orders to summon the Tarentines without arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They all assembled, except those who had followed the Romans in their retreat to the citadel, to share with them any outcome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon Hannibal had kind words for the Tarentines and called to mind what he had done for their fellow-citizens whom he had captured at Lake Trasumennus or at Cannae. At the same time he inveighed against the haughty rule of the Romans and ordered them to go each to his own house and to write his name on the door.<note>According to Polybius the legend was to be simply <foreign lang="greek">;</foreign> VIII. xxxi. 4.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He would order that at a given signal such houses as were not marked should at once be plundered. If any one should write his name on the quarters of a Roman citizen &mdash;now they were occupying vacant houses &mdash;he would regard such a man as an enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After the assembly had been dismissed and the marking of doors had distinguished the house of a citizen from that of an enemy, the signal was given and they scattered in all directions to plunder the Roman dwellings; and the booty was considerable.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the next day he led his men to an attack upon the citadel. He saw that not only was this defended by very high cliffs on the side towards the sea, which surrounds the larger part of it as a peninsula, but on the side toward the city itself by a wall and a great fosse, and hence could not be taken by assault nor by siege-works.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, to avoid either keeping himself from larger operations in his effort to protect the Tarentines, or else letting the Romans, whenever they pleased, make an attack from the citadel upon the Tarentines if he left them without a strong garrison, he decided to wall off <pb id="p.379"/>the city from the citadel by an earthwork.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> not without the hope also that he could engage the Romans if they tried to prevent the work, and that, if they should make a furious sally, the strength of the garrison would be so reduced by serious losses that the Tarentines by themselves could easily defend the city against them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After fortification began, a gate was suddenly opened and the Romans made an attack upon the men at work. And the outpost stationed in advance of the work allowed itself to be driven back, that boldness might grow with success and a larger number might pursue the repulsed and to a greater distance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then at a given signal the Carthaginians, whom Hannibal had kept drawn up for this purpose, rose up on all sides. And the Romans did not withstand the attack, but limited space and ground obstructed partly by the work already begun, partly by preparations for the work, kept them from a disorderly flight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Very many leaped into the fosse, and more were slain in flight than in battle. Then even fortification began to proceed, with no one attempting to prevent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A great fosse was carried along, and inside of it an earthwork was raised; and at a short distance he prepared to add a stone wall likewise in the same direction, so that even without a garrison they could protect themselves against the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He did, however, leave a garrison of moderate size, to aid as well in the completion of the wall. He himself set out with the rest of his forces and pitched camp at the river Galaesus, which is five miles from the city.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>On returning from this permanent camp to inspect, inasmuch as the work had progressed with considerably more speed than he had anticipated, he <pb id="p.381"/>hoped that the citadel also could be taken by storm.<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> And it is not defended by height,<note>According to Strabo VI. iii. 1 the only elevation of any consequence was the citadel.</note> as other citadels are, but is on level ground and separated from the city merely by a wall and a fosse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While the attack was now in progress with engines of every kind and with siege-works, a garrison sent from Metapontum encouraged the Romans to make a surprise attack by night upon the works of the enemy. Some of these they pulled apart, others they ruined by fire; and this was the end of Hannibal's attack upon the citadel from that side.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> His remaining hope was in a blockade, and that was not very effectual, because the occupants of the citadel, which is situated on a peninsula and commands the harbour mouth, had the sea at their disposal, while the city on the other hand was shut off from supplies by sea and the besiegers were nearer to starvation than the besieged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Hannibal summoned the leading men of Tarentum and laid before them all the difficulties of the situation, saying that he neither saw a way to take so well fortified
				<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> a citadel by storm, nor had any hope in a blockade, so long as the enemy had command of the sea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But if he should have ships with which to prevent the bringing in of supplies, the enemy would at once either withdraw from the citadel or surrender. The Tarentines assented, but thought that the giver of advice must give aid also to carry it out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For Carthaginian ships, summoned from Sicily, they said, could do it. As for their own ships, which were shut up inside a very small bay, while the enemy held the key to the harbour,<note>The mouth of the harbour was closed, as Strabo (<hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi>) says, by a large bridge.</note> how were they to get out into the open sea?
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <quote>They will get out</quote>, said Hannibal; <quote>many things which are naturally difficult are solved by ingenuity. You have a city <pb id="p.383"/>situated in a plain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Level streets of ample breadth<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> lead in all directions. Along the street that is carried across from the harbour through the centre of the city to the sea I shall transport ships on wagons with no great difficulty, and the sea, which the enemy now possess, will be ours, and we shall besiege the citadel on that side by sea, on this side by land; or rather we shall soon either take it, abandoned by the enemy, or take it enemy and all.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> This speech produced not merely the hope of success, but great admiration for the general as well. At once wagons were assembled from everywhere and joined together, and the tackle brought to draw up the ships, and the roadway paved, that the wagons might be easier to move, and the difficulty of transport lessened.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Then mules and men were brought together and the work was begun with energy. And so a few days later a fleet furnished and equipped sailed around the citadel and cast anchor at the very mouth of the harbour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Such was the state of things which Hannibal left at Tarentum when he himself returned to his winter quarters. But whether the rebellion of the Tarentines took place in the previous year or in this year, authorities differ.<note>That <date value="-213">213 B.C.</date> was the correct date for their defection is shown by XXVII. xxv. 4.</note> More of them and those nearer in time to men who remembered the events relate that it occurred in this year.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome the consuls and praetors were detained by the Latin festival until the 26th of April.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After performing the rites on that day on the Mount,<note>Mons Albanus (Monte Cavo), where a sacrifice on the fourth day brought the festival to an end.</note> each set out for his assignment. Then fresh religious scruples were aroused by the verses of Marcius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A noted seer had been this Marcius, and when in the preceding year search was being made by decree of the senate for such books, they had come <pb id="p.385"/>into the hands of Marcus Aemilius,<note>For the error cf. note on i. 11.</note> the praetor<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> urbanus, who was in charge of the matter. He had immediately turned them over to the new praetor, Sulla.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of the two prophecies<note>The rough hexameters (probably translated from the Greek) had been reduced to prose.</note> of this Marcius the authority of one, made known after the event, was confirmed by the outcome and lent credibility to the other also, whose time had not yet come.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the earlier prophecy the disaster at Cannae had been predicted in such terms as these: <quote>Flee the river Canna, thou descendant of Troy, that foreigners may not compel thee to do battle in the Plain of Diomed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But thou wilt not believe me until thou hast filled the plain with blood, and many thousands of thy slain will the river bear from the fruitful land down to the great sea. To fishes and birds and beasts that dwell on the land thy flesh shall be meat. For thus hath Jupiter declared to me.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And those who had fought in that region recognized the plains of the Argive Diomed and the river Canna no less than the disaster itself. Then the second prophecy was read, being not only more obscure because the future is more uncertain
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> than the past, but more difficult also in the way it was written.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>If you wish, Romans, to drive out enemies, the sore which has come from afar, I propose that a festival be vowed to Apollo, to be observed with good cheer in honour of Apollo every year. When the people shall have given a part out of the treasury, private citizens shall contribute on their own behalf and that of their families.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In charge of the conduct of that festival shall be the praetor who is then chief judge for the people and <pb id="p.387"/>the commons. The decemvirs<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">decemviri sacris faciundis,</hi> charged with the oversight of sacrifices.</note> shall offer the victims<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> according to Greek rite. If ye will do this rightly ye shall forever rejoice, and your state will change for the better. For that god who graciously nurtures your meadows will destroy your enemies.</quote> For the interpretation of the prophecy they took one day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the next day the senate made a decree that in regard to the festival to be held and the sacrifices in honour of Apollo the decemvirs should consult the books.<note>The <hi rend="italics">libri Sibyllini,</hi> of which the decemvirs were the custodians and authorized interpreters, but could not refer to them unless empowered by a decree of the senate.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Those passages having been consulted and reported to the senate, the fathers voted that a festival should be vowed and held in honour of Apollo, and after the festival had been held the sum of twelve thousand asses should be given to the praetor for the ceremonies, and two full-grown victims.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A second decree of the senate was made, that the decemvirs should offer sacrifice according to Greek rite and with these victims: to Apollo an ox with gilded horns and two white she-goats<note>As she-goats would surely be offered to Diana, not to Apollo, there is good reason to believe that her name has been lost from the text, and before Macrobius' time, since he has the same statement; <hi rend="italics">Saturnalia</hi> I. xvii. 29.</note> with gilded horns, to Latona a cow with gilded horns.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When the praetor was about to open the festival in the Circus Maximus, he ordered by edict that during that feast the people should make their contribution to Apollo according to their means.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such is the origin of the festival of Apollo, vowed and kept to secure victory, not health, as most think. The people wore garlands at the spectacles, the matrons offered prayers, everybody feasted in the atrium with open doors, and the day was kept with every kind of ceremony.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Hannibal was near Tarentum, and <pb id="p.389"/>both consuls were in Samnium but seemed about to<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> invest Capua, already the Campanians were suffering hunger (the usual hardship of a long investment), because the Roman armies had prevented them from sowing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so they sent legates to Hannibal, praying that, before the consuls should lead the legions into their lands and all the roads should be blocked by forces of the enemy, he should order grain to be brought from neighbouring places to Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hannibal ordered Hanno to march with his army from the land of the Bruttii over into Campania, and to see to it that the Campanians should have a supply of grain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hanno set out from the land of the Bruttii with his army, avoided camps of the enemy and the consuls, who were in Samnium, and when he was now nearing Beneventum, pitched camp on high ground three miles from the city itself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then he ordered grain to be brought into camp from allied peoples of the neighbourhood, among whom it had been garnered in the summer; and he furnished troops to escort the supplies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then he sent word to Capua, naming a day on which they should appear at the camp to get their grain, after bringing together from the farms on all sides every kind of vehicle and beast of burden.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This order was carried out by the Campanians with their usual carelessness and indifference. Little more than four hundred vehicles were sent, and a few beasts of burden besides. For this they were censured by Hanno, that not even hunger, which, as he said, inflames even dumb brutes, could spur their diligence; and another day was assigned for getting their grain with ampler means of transport.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When all this was reported, just as it happened, to the Beneventans, they at once <pb id="p.391"/>sent ten legates to the consuls, the camp of the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Romans being near Bovianum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consuls, on hearing what was going on near Capua, mutually arranged that one of them should lead his army into Campania, and Fulvius, to whom that assignment had fallen, set out and entered the walls of Beneventum at night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Being near now, he learned that Hanno had gone with a part of his army to procure grain; that through his quaestor grain had been furnished to the Campanians; that two thousand wagons and in addition a mixed and unarmed multitude had arrived; that everything was being done in confusion and excitement, and that the arrangement of the camp and military routine had been broken down by the influx of rustics, foreigners<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> not Campanians.</note> at that.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>These facts being sufficiently established, the consul ordered the soldiers to make ready their standards and arms, and nothing else, for the following night; they must attack the Carthaginian camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Setting out at the fourth watch, leaving all their packs and baggage at Beneventum, they reached the camp shortly before daylight and inspired such panic that, if the camp had been placed on level ground, it could undoubtedly have been taken by the first assault.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The lofty situation protected it, also the fortifications, which could not be approached from any side except by a steep and difficult slope.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At daybreak a great battle blazed up. And the Carthaginians not only defended the earthwork but, as they had the more favourable situation, pushed down the enemy struggling up the steep slope. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nevertheless obstinate courage surmounted everything, and so the earthwork and the trenches were reached in several places at once, but with many wounds and heavy loss of <pb id="p.393"/>men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly the consul called together his<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> lieutenants and tribunes of the soldiers and told them he must give up his rash undertaking; that it seemed to him safer to lead the army back that day to Beneventum, and then on the following day to pitch camp close to that of the enemy, so that the Campanians might not be able to leave it nor Hanno to return.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To accomplish that more readily, he would summon his colleague also and his army, and they would focus the entire war upon that point. These plans of the general were disrupted, when he was already sounding the recall, by the shouts of the soldiers rejecting an order so lacking in spirit.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nearest to the enemy happened to be a Paelignian cohort, whose prefect Vibius Accaus seized the banner and threw it over the enemy's earthwork.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, with a curse upon himself and the cohort if the enemy should get possession of that banner, he was himself the first to dash over the trench and wall into the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And already the Paelignians were fighting inside the wall, when from the other side of the camp, while Valerius Flaccus, tribune of the soldiers of the third legion, was reproaching the Romans for their cowardice in yielding to allies the honour of capturing the camp, Titus Pedanius, first centurion of the <hi rend="italics">principes,</hi> took a standard away from the standard-bearer and said <quote>This standard and this centurion will in a moment be inside the enemy's wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let those follow who are to prevent the standard from being captured by the enemy.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> First the men of his own maniple followed him as he crossed the trench, then the whole legion. And now the consul at the sight of men crossing the wall changed his plan, turned from recalling his soldiers to arousing <pb id="p.395"/>and encouraging them, and pointed out to them in<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> what a critical and perilous situation were the bravest cohort of the allies and a legion of their fellow-citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so, each doing his best, over ground favourable and unfavourable, while javelins were being hurled from every side and the enemy were interposing weapons and their bodies, they made their way and burst in. Many wounded men, even those whose strength and blood were ebbing, strove to fall inside the enemy's wall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so in a moment's time the camp was captured, just as if pitched on level ground and not strongly fortified. Then came slaughter, no longer mere battle, since everything inside the wall was in confusion.</p> 
			<p>Over six thousand of the enemy were slain, over seven thousand men captured, including the Campanians who came for grain, and the entire train of wagons and mules.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In addition there was the immense booty which Hanno, having set out to plunder far and wide, had taken from farms of allies of the Roman people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then after destroying the enemy's camp they returned to Beneventum, and there the two consuls &mdash;for Appius Claudius came there a few days late &mdash;sold and divided the booty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And the men by whose efforts the camp of the enemy had been captured, were rewarded, first of all Accaus the Paelignian and Titus Pedanius, first centurion of the third legion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Hanno, leaving Cominium Ocritum, where he received news of the disaster at the camp, with the few men he happened to have with him to get grain, returned in what resembled a flight rather than a march to the land of the Bruttii. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And the Campanians, hearing of what was a disaster as much to themselves as to their allies, sent legates to <pb id="p.397"/>Hannibal to report that the two consuls were at<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Beneventum, a day's march from Capua; that the war was all but at their gates and walls; and that, if he did not come to their aid in haste, Capua would fall into the power of the enemy more promptly than Arpi.<note>Cf. XXIV. xlvi f.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They said that not even Tarentum, to say nothing of its citadel, ought to be of such importance that he should hand over to the Roman people the deserted and undefended Capua, which he had usually compared with Carthage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hannibal, promising that the Campanian cause would be his concern, for the present sent two thousand horsemen with his lieutenants, that with this force they might be able to protect their farms from devastation.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Romans meantime were concerned among other things for the citadel of Tarentum and the garrison there besieged. Gaius Servilius, who as lieutenant had been sent by Publius Cornelius, the praetor, into Etruria by authority of the senate to purchase grain, made his way through the enemy's blockade into the harbour of Tarentum with a number of shiploads.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thanks to his coming, the men who until then in their faint hope had often been invited by the enemy in parleys to change sides were actually inviting and urging the enemy to change sides. And the garrison was in fact strong enough, now that soldiers who were at Metapontum had been transferred to defend the citadel of Tarentum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly the Metapontines were at once relieved of the fear by which they were restrained, and went over to Hannibal.</p> 
			<p>The Thurians also, on the same coast, did the same.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What impelled them was not more the <pb id="p.399"/>revolt of the Tarentines and that of the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Metapontines, with whom they were linked by blood as well, being sprung from the same Achaia than anger against the Romans on account of the recent execution of the hostages.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Friends and relatives of these sent a letter and messengers to Hanno and Mago,<note>Not the brother of Hannibal; xvi. 7 f., 24; xviii. 1; xxi. 4.</note> who were not far away in the land of the Bruttii, saying that, if they should bring up an army to their walls, they would themselves deliver the city into their power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Atinius was in command at Thurii with a garrison of moderate size, and they thought that he could easily be tempted to dash rashly into battle, from his confidence not so much in his soldiers, of whom he had very few, as in the young men of Thurii. He had purposely organized them in centuries<note>So in mustering old men into the service in VI. ii. 6, and freedmen in X. xxi. 4.</note> and armed them with a view to such emergencies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Carthaginian generals divided their forces between them and, on entering the territory of Thurii, Hanno, with the infantry column ready to attack, proceeded to the city. Mago with the cavalry halted under cover of hills conveniently interposed to conceal an ambuscade.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Atinius, informed of the infantry column alone by scouts, led his troops out into line, he being unaware both of the conspiracy within and of the enemy's ambuscade.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The infantry battle was very lacking in spirit, for only a few Romans were fighting in the front line, and the men of Thurii were awaiting the outcome, rather than contributing to it. And the Carthaginian line purposely retreated, in order to draw the heedless enemy to the other side of the hill occupied by their own cavalry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When they reached the place, the cavalry, suddenly attacking with a shout, at once put to flight the mass of the Thurians, which was 399 <pb id="p.401"/>almost undisciplined and not entirely loyal to the side<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> on which they were fighting. The Romans, though surrounded and hard pressed on one side by the infantry, on the other by the cavalry, nevertheless kept on fighting for some time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Finally they also faced about and fled to the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There the traitors massed together and admitted the column of their citizens through wide-open gates; but when they saw the routed Romans moving toward the city, they shouted that the Carthaginian was upon them, and unless they hastily closed the gates the enemy also, mingling with them, would make their way into the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Thus they shut out the Romans and left them to be slain by the enemy. Atinius, however, with a few men was admitted. Then for a short time dissension continued, the other party<note>In contrast with those who by admitting Atinius showed their preference for the Romans.</note> being of the opinion that they must yield to destiny and surrender the city to the victors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But, as usual, chance and bad advice prevailed. Atinius and his men were brought down to the sea and ships, more because they wished his personal safety, on account of his mild and just rule over them, than out of regard for the Romans, and then they admitted the Carthaginians to the city.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>The consuls led their legions from Beneventum into the Campanian territory, not merely to ruin the grain, which was by now green, but also to besiege Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> They thought to make theirs a notable consulship by the destruction of so rich a city, and at the same time to remove a great disgrace from the empire, in that the revolt of a city so near had been unpunished for three years.<note>It was really over three years, from <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date></note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> But, not to leave Beneventum without a garrison, and, with a view to <pb id="p.403"/>emergencies, if Hannibal should come to Capua, as<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> they had no doubt he would do, to lend aid to his allies, in order that they might be able to withstand the attack of his cavalry, they ordered Tiberius Gracchus to come from Lucania with his cavalry and light-armed troops to Beneventum. He was to put some one in command of the legions and permanent camps, in order to control the situation in Lucania.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As Gracchus was sacrificing before leaving Lucania, an unfavourable portent occurred.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the slaying of the victim two snakes gliding stealthily up to the entrails ate part of the liver, and on being noticed vanished suddenly from sight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When for that reason the sacrifice was repeated on the advice of the soothsayers, and while the entrails were being kept with greater care, they relate that the snakes for the second and the third time gliding up tasted the liver and went away unharmed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although the soothsayers had warned in advance that that portent applied to the general, and that he must beware of men in hiding and of covert plans, still the impending fate could not be averted by any foresight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was a Lucanian, Flavus, head of that party of the Lucanians which remained on the Roman side, although the other party had revolted to Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And he was now in the second year of his office, having been elected praetor by that same party. He suddenly changed his intention and, seeking to find favour with the Carthaginian, was not satisfied to change sides himself nor to draw the Lucanians into revolt without ratifying his agreement with the enemy by the life-blood of the general, betrayed though at the same time his guest-friend.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He came <pb id="p.405"/>to Mago, who was in command in the country of the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Bruttii, for a secret conference, and received his promise that, if he should surrender the Roman commander into their hands, the Lucanians as free men with their own laws would be accepted as friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then led the Carthaginian to a place to which he said he would bring Gracchus with a few men; there Mago should conceal armed infantry and cavalry; and the hiding-place had room, he said, for a very large number.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After they had sufficiently examined the spot and reconnoitred all around, a day was settled upon for the execution of the plan.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Flavus came to the Roman commander, saying that he had begun an important business for the completion of which he needed Gracchus' own help;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that he had persuaded the magistrates of all the peoples which in that general commotion in Italy had gone over to the Carthaginians, to return to the friendship of the Romans, since the Roman state also, which had been nearly destroyed by the disaster at Cannae, was daily improving and increasing, while Hannibal's power was growing feebler and had been reduced almost to nothing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To their old offence, he said, the Romans would not be implacable; no people had ever been more easily entreated and readier to grant forgiveness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> How often had a rebellion even of their own ancestors been pardoned! These things he said he had told them; but that they preferred to hear these same statements from Gracchus himself, and to take hold of his right hand there before them, and to carry with them that pledge of his honour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He had appointed for their council a place out of sight, not far from the Roman camp; there in a few words it could be <pb id="p.407"/>settled that the whole Lucanian people should be<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> under the protection of the Romans and in alliance with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Gracchus, thinking that both speech and proposal were free from guile, and misled by the plausibility of it, set out from the camp with his lictors and a troop of cavalry, and with a guest-friend as his guide fell into the ambush.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The enemy suddenly came out, and, to leave no doubt about his treachery, Flavus joined them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Javelins assail Gracchus and his horsemen from every side. He springs from his horse, bids the rest to do the same and urges them to ennoble by courage the one thing fortune has left open to them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But to a few men surrounded by a multitude, in a valley hedged about by forest and mountains, what was left, he asked, but death?
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The one thing that mattered was whether they were to submit themselves like sheep to be slaughtered unavenged, or, far from calmly awaiting the outcome, were to be altogether bent on angry attack, and then, daring and doing, drenched by the blood of the enemy, among the heaps of arms and bodies of their dying foes, were to fall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> They must all attack the Lucanian traitor and deserter. The man who sent that victim before him to the lower world would find great distinction and for his own death an extraordinary consolation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> While thus speaking he wound his general's cloak around his left arm &mdash;for they had not taken even shields with them &mdash;and attacked the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> The battle was out of all proportion to the number of men engaged. The bodies of the Romans were especially unprotected against javelins, and were pierced by them, as they could be thrown from higher ground all around into the hollow valley.
				<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Gracchus, who <pb id="p.409"/>was by this time stripped of his defenders, the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Carthaginians strove to capture alive. But catching sight of his Lucanian guest-friend among the enemy, he dashed into the dense ranks with such animosity that he could not be spared without the loss of many lives.
				<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Mago at once sent the corpse to Hannibal and ordered it to be placed before the general's tribune together with the captured fasces.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/>If this is the true report, Gracchus perished in Lucania, on the Old Plains, as they are called. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There are some who maintain that in the region of Beneventum, by the river Calor, he had gone out of the camp with his lictors and three slaves to bathe, while enemies, as it
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> happened, were hiding among the willows growing on the banks, and was slain, naked and unarmed and defending himself with stones which the river rolls along.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There are some writers who say that on the advice of the soothsayers he had gone five hundred paces from the camp to make atonement on an uncontaminated spot for the prodigies mentioned above, and was overpowered by two troops of Numidians who chanced to be in ambush there. So far are both the place and the manner of his death from being established, in spite of his eminence and distinction.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In regard to Gracchus's funeral also reports vary. Some relate that he was buried in the Roman camp by his own men, others &mdash;and this is the prevalent report &mdash;that
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> by Hannibal's order a pyre was erected directly outside the gate of the Carthaginian camp, and that the army defiled under arms, with dances by the Spanish troops and such movements of weapons and bodies as were customary for each tribe, while Hannibal himself <pb id="p.411"/>honoured the obsequies with every tribute in act<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> and word.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These are the statements of those who vouch for its occurrence in Lucania. If you incline to believe those who state that he was slain at the river Calor, the enemy gained possession of Gracchus' head only.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This being brought to Hannibal, Carthalo was at once sent by him to bring it to the Roman camp and Gnaeus Cornelius the quaestor. He conducted the funeral of the general in the camp, while the people of Beneventum joined with the army in doing him honour.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consuls, on entering the Campanian region, were devastating it far and wide, being alarmed and dismayed by a sally of the Capuans and of Mago with his cavalry, they recalled their widely scattered soldiers to the standards, and being routed almost before their line was formed, lost over fifteen hundred men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Upon this the great overconfidence of a people naturally proud was greatly increased, and they sought to provoke the Romans by many battles. But a single engagement incautiously and imprudently begun had made the consuls more careful to be on their guard.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> One small occurrence, however, restored the courage of one army and lessened the boldness of the other. But in war nothing is so slight as not at times to bring about a great result.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Titus Quinctius Crispinus<note>Not to be confused with another man of the same name in xxvi. 4; XXIV. xxxix. 12; and frequently in XXVII.</note> had one Badius, a Campanian, as his guest-friend, linked to him by intimate hospitality. Friendship had grown because in an illness Badius had been generously and kindly nursed at the house of Crispinus at Rome before the rebellion of Campania.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This Badius at the time came up to the outposts stationed before the gate and bade them call <pb id="p.413"/>Crispinus. When this was reported to Crispinus, he<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> went a little beyond the others, thinking a friendly and intimate conversation was wanted, since the memory of a personal tie lingered in spite of the rupture of public treaties. When they had come in sight of each other, <quote>I challenge you to battle, Crispinus,</quote> said Badius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>Let us mount our horses and, with others kept at a distance, decide which is the better warrior.</quote> In reply Crispinus said that neither he nor Badius lacked enemies on whom to show his courage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For himself, even if he should meet the other in battle-line, he would avoid him, lest he stain his right hand with the blood of a guest-friend. And he turned and was walking away.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then in truth the Campanian more fiercely reviled the effeminacy and cowardice of Crispinus and hurled reproaches which he himself deserved against an innocent man, calling him a guest-enemy and a man who pretended to spare one to whom he knew he was not equal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If he thought that with the rupture of public treaties private ties had not also been broken, then, he said, Badius the Campanian, openly in the hearing of two armies, renounced the guest-friendship of Titus Quinctius Crispinus the Roman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For himself, an enemy, nothing was hallowed by association, nothing by compact, with him, an enemy, since he had come to attack his native city and the Penates of the state and of the household. If he was a man, let him come on.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Crispinus, after long hesitation, was prevailed upon by his comrades not to allow the Campanian to revile him with impunity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so he delayed only long enough to consult the generals as to whether they permitted him to fight out of ranks against an enemy who challenged him. <pb id="p.415"/>With their permission he took his arms and mounted<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> his horse, and addressing Badius by name called him out to battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Campanian made no delay; riding directly at each other they clashed. Crispinus with his spear pierced Badius' left shoulder above the shield; and after he fell wounded, leaped upon him from his horse, that, now dismounted, he might despatch the fallen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Badius, not to be overpowered, left shield and horse and fled to his own men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Crispinus, decked with spoils and displaying the horse and captured arms and his bloody spear, was conducted with much praise and congratulation on the part of the soldiers to the consuls, and there he was highly praised and rewarded with gifts.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, having moved his camp from the region of Beneventum to the vicinity of Capua, led his troops out into battle-line on the third day after his arrival.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Since in his absence the Campanians had had a successful battle a few days before, he had no doubt whatever that the Romans would be much less able to withstand himself and his repeatedly victorious army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But once the battle had begun, the Roman line was hard pressed, especially by the cavalry charge, being overwhelmed by their darts, until the signal was given to the cavalry to urge their horses against the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thus a cavalry battle was in progress when the distant sight of the Sempronian army,<note>For the forces Gracchus had commanded cf. xv. 20.</note> commanded by Gnaeus Cornelius, the quaestor, inspired in both armies the same fear that fresh enemies were approaching.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As if by agreement the signal for recall was given on both sides, and marching back to the camp they separated on almost even terms. Yet a larger number fell on the <pb id="p.417"/>Roman side because of the first charge of the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> horsemen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon the consuls, in order to draw Hannibal away from Capua, marched off the following night in different directions, Fulvius into the region of Cumae, Claudius into Lucania.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The next day Hannibal, on being informed that the Roman camp was empty and that they had marched away in different directions in two columns, was at first uncertain which to follow, but pushed on
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> in pursuit of Appius, who after leading the enemy around wherever he pleased, returned by a different road to Capua.</p> 
			<p>Hannibal had another opportunity for success presented to him in this region.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was one Marcus Centenius, with the cognomen Paenula, conspicuous among the centurions of the highest rank<note>A <hi rend="italics">primi pili centurio</hi> (or <hi rend="italics">primus pilus</hi>) was the ranking centurion of his legion, commanding the first century of the first maniple of the <hi rend="italics">triarii.</hi></note> for his huge body and his courage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having finished his military service, he was brought into the senate by Publius Cornelius Sulla, a praetor, and begged the fathers to give him five thousand soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He, being well-acquainted, he said, both with the enemy and the country, would soon accomplish something worth while, and as for the arts by which both our generals and our armies had till then been ensnared, he would use them against their inventor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This was not more stupidly promised than stupidly believed, as if the qualities of soldier and general were the same.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Instead of five thousand, eight thousand soldiers were given him, half of them citizens, half allies. And he himself on his march raised a considerable number of volunteers from the farms, and with his army nearly doubled reached Lucania, where Hannibal had halted after vainly pursuing Claudius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The result was never in doubt, <pb id="p.419"/>as between Hannibal as commander and a centurion,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> and between armies one of which was a veteran in victory and the other altogether raw, in large part also irregular and half-armed. When the columns were in sight of each other and neither side refused battle, the lines were immediately drawn up.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> They fought, however, as was to be expected where nothing was fairly matched. For more than two hours the battle continued, since hope inspired the Roman line so long as their commander held his ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Not only in keeping with his old reputation, but also for fear of future disgrace, if he should survive a disaster brought on by his own rashness, he threw himself upon the weapons of the enemy and fell, whereupon the Roman line was at once routed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But, as all the roads were occupied by cavalry, so far were they from having any route open even for flight that out of so great a multitude barely a thousand escaped, while the rest scattering met death in various forms.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The siege of Capua was resumed with intensity by the consuls, and all that was needed for the purpose was being brought together and made ready.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Casilinum was the depot for grain. At the mouth of the Volturnus, where there is now a city, a stronghold was fortified, and there and at Puteoli,<note>Cf. XXIV. vii. 10.</note> which Fabius Maximus had previously fortified, a garrison was placed, that the sea in that neighbourhood and the river might be in their power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To these two strongholds by the sea the grain which had been sent recently from Sardinia and that which the praetor Marcus Junius had purchased in Etruria was transported from Ostia, so that the army might have a supply through the winter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But in addition to the disaster incurred in Lucania, the army of <pb id="p.421"/>slavevolunteers also, which had served with the utmost<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> loyalty while Gracchus lived, abandoned its standards, as if discharged by the death of the general.</p> 
			<p>Hannibal did not wish that Capua should be neglected nor his allies abandoned in such a crisis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But in view of a success due to the rashness of one Roman general he was eager for an opportunity to surprise a second general and army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Apulian legates were informing him that the praetor Gnaeus Fulvius had at first been very active while besieging some Apulian cities which had revolted to Hannibal; but that later, owing to unmerited success, both he himself and his soldiers, who were loaded with booty, had gone to such lengths in licence and indifference that there was no military discipline.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hannibal, who frequently at other times, and particularly within a few days, had discovered what an army is under an incompetent general, moved his camp into Apulia. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Near Herdonea<note>Cf. XXIV. xx. 8.</note> were Roman legions and the praetor Fulvius. When the news reached them there that the enemy were approaching, they barely refrained from catching up their standards and going out into battle-line without orders from the praetor. And nothing restrained them more than the hope, now beyond question, that they would do so at their own discretion whenever they pleased.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The following night Hannibal, knowing that there had been an uproar in the camp and that many, calling to arms, had over-confidently pressed the commander to give the signal, had no doubt that an opportunity for a victory was offered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He accordingly posted three thousand lightly equipped soldiers in farmhouses near by and in the thickets and the woods, to come out of their hiding-places all at once, <pb id="p.423"/>when the signal was given.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And he ordered Mago<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> and about two thousand horsemen to lie in wait along all the roads in the direction which he believed the flight would take. After making these preparations at night, he led his troops out into line at daybreak.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor did Fulvius hesitate, dragged into it not so much by any hope of his own as by the haphazard impulse of the soldiers. And so, with the same recklessness with which they went out to form, they drew up even the line of battle according to the whim of soldiers who happened to dash forward and take their stand wherever their own fancy had carried them, and then capriciously or in fear abandoned their positions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The first legion and the left <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> were placed in front,<note>The <hi rend="italics">alae</hi> were auxiliaries of the allies, each <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> equal in strength to a legion (4200 men). When drawn up as here the second line would be made up of the other legion and the <hi rend="italics">ala dextra.</hi> Such a formation was at times employed instead of the usual three lines, <hi rend="italics">hastati, principes, triarii,</hi> of the legionaries. Cf. XXVII. i. 8; ii. 6.</note> and the line was made very long.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although the tribunes shouted that in depth it had no power to resist, and that wherever the enemy should make their attack they would pierce it, the men in line allowed no advice that was helpful to reach even their ears, not to say their attention.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And there was Hannibal, surely not that sort of a general, nor with that sort of an army, drawn up in that fashion. Consequently the Romans did not withstand even their shout and the first onset.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The general, a match for Centenius in folly and recklessness, but in courage by no means to be compared with him, seeing that the line was giving way and his own men in confusion, seized a horse and with about two hundred horsemen made his escape.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The rest of the line, beaten back in front and then surrounded in the rear and on the wings, was so cut to pieces that out of eighteen thousand men not more than two thousand escaped. The camp was occupied by the enemy.</p> <pb id="p.425"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the news of these disasters one after<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> another had reached Rome, great sorrow and alarm, it is true, took possession of the state. Nevertheless because the consuls, to whom fell the supreme command, were up to that time successful, they were less disturbed by these disasters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the senate.</note> sent Gaius Laetorius and Marcus Metilius<note>In XXII. xxv. 3 he was <hi rend="italics">tribunus plebis.</hi></note> as legates to the consuls, to inform them that they should carefully gather up the remnants of the two armies, and see to it that in fear and despair they did not surrender to the enemy, as had happened after the disaster at Cannae;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> also that they should search for the deserters from the army of slave-volunteers. The same duty was given to Publius Cornelius, to whom the levy also had been assigned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And he issued an edict in the market-towns and local centres,<note>Cf. above, note on v. 6.</note> that search should be made for the slave-volunteers, and that they be brought back to their standards. All these things were done with the utmost diligence.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Appius Claudius, the consul, placed Decimus Junius in command at the mouth of the Volturnus and Marcus Aurelius Cotta at Puteoli, in order that, as fast as ships came in from Etruria and Sardinia, they should send the grain at once to the camps.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He himself, on returning to Capua, found his colleague Quintus Fulvius transporting everything from Casilinum and making every preparation for the siege of Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then they both invested the city and summoned the praetor, Claudius Nero, from the Claudian camp at Suessula. He, leaving there only a garrison of moderate size to hold the place, likewise came down with all the rest of his forces to Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus three headquarters were set up around Capua. There were three armies too that, <pb id="p.427"/>fell to work on different sides, made ready to encircle<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> the city with a ditch and an earthwork, and erected redoubts at moderate intervals;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and at many points at the same time they fought with such success against the Campanians who endeavoured to hinder the works that finally the Campanians remained inside the gates and the wall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But before these siege-works could be made continuous, legates were sent to Hannibal, to complain that Capua had been deserted by him and almost given back to the Romans, and to implore him to bring aid, then at least, to men not only besieged but also encircled by entrenchments.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consuls received a letter from Publius Cornelius, the praetor, ordering<note>In the name of the senate.</note> that, before enclosing Capua with their works, they should permit such of the Campanians as wished to do so to leave Capua and carry their possessions with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Those who should leave before the fifteenth of March were to be free men and to keep all their property; those who left after that date and those who remained there were to be reckoned enemies. These terms were published to the Campanians, and were received with such contempt by them that they were actually insulting and made threats.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Hannibal had led his legions from Herdonea to Tarentum in the hope of getting possession of the citadel of Tarentum either by force or by ruse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When this did not succeed, he turned aside to Brundisium, thinking that town would certainly be betrayed. While there also he was wasting time, the Campanian legates came to him with complaints and at the same time entreaties. Hannibal replied to them grandly that he had previously raised a siege, and that now also the consuls would not <pb id="p.429"/>withstand his coming.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> With this hope the legates were<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> sent away, and it was with difficulty
				<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> that they were able to return to Capua, now surrounded by two trenches and a double earthwork.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Just as Capua was being encircled the siege of Syracuse came to an end, expedited not only by the vigour and valour of the general and the army but also by treachery within.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For Marcellus, who at the beginning of the spring had been uncertain whether to shift the war to Agrigentum against Himilco and Hippocrates, or to press the siege
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> of Syracuse, saw indeed that the city, impregnable in its position both on the landward and the seaward side, could not be taken by assault, nor by starvation, inasmuch as it was sustained by almost unhampered supplies from Carthage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nevertheless, to leave nothing untried, deserters from Syracuse &mdash;and there were in the Roman lines some men of highest rank who during the estrangement from the Romans had been driven out because they were averse to a change of policy &mdash;were ordered by him to sound men of their faction in conferences, and to give them a pledge that, if Syracuse should be surrendered, they should live as free men and under their own laws.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For a conference there was no opportunity, because the suspicious attitude of many men had attracted the attention and the eyes of all, to prevent such an offence from passing unnoticed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A single slave belonging to the exiles was admitted to the city as a deserter and by meeting a few men made a beginning of parleys on a matter of such moment. Then some men were hidden under nets on a fishing vessel, and thus sailed around to the Roman camp<note>Beyond the northern Wall of Dionysius, not far from the Hexapylon.</note> and talked with the deserters. And <pb id="p.431"/>the same men did this repeatedly in the same way,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> also others and again others.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Finally they amounted to about eighty. And when now everything had been arranged for the betrayal, information was brought to Epicydes by one Attalus, who was outraged that the matter had not been confided to him, and they were all put to death with torture.</p> 
			<p>This hope having proved false, another at once took its place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Damippus a Lacedaemonian, who had been sent from Syracuse to King Philip, had been captured by Roman ships.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Epicydes was very much concerned to ransom him at any cost, and Marcellus also was not averse, since the Romans were already courting the friendship of the Aetolians, whose allies the Lacedaemonians were.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The men sent to confer in regard to the man's ransom thought that the most convenient place for both sides, and just half-way, was at the Trogili Harbour,<note>Merely a small bay, of no value for large vessels.</note> near the tower called Galeagra.<note>The tower was probably beyond the wall in the open country.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As they came there repeatedly, one of the Romans, observing the wall from near at hand, by counting the courses and making his own estimate of the height of each on its face, measured the height of the wall as nearly as he could by guesswork.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And thinking it considerably lower than his own previous estimate of it and that of all the rest, and that it could be scaled by ladders even of moderate length, he reported to Marcellus. It did not seem a matter to be despised.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But since the place, being more closely guarded for the very reason mentioned, could not be approached, they cast about for an opportunity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And this was offered by a deserter, reporting that the feast of Diana was being observed for three days, and that, since other things were lacking during the siege, it was with wine that the <pb id="p.433"/>banquets were more lavishly provided, this being<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> furnished to the entire populace by Epicydes and distributed among the tribes<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> corresponding in a way to the Roman tribes.</note> by leading citizens.</p> 
			<p>On learning of this, Marcellus conferred with a few tribunes of the soldiers, and after these had chosen centurions and soldiers able to dare and do a thing of such importance, and after ladders had been secretly made ready, he ordered the signal to be given to the others to eat early and then rest. In the night, he said, they must go on a raid.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then, when it seemed to be late enough for
				<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> those who had begun their feast during the day to be sated, he thought, with their wine and now to be falling asleep, he ordered the soldiers of one maniple to carry the ladders. And about a thousand armed men were led in a thin column to the place in silence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> When the first men without noise and confusion had made their way to the top of the wall, the others followed one after another, since the boldness of those ahead of them gave courage even to the wavering. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The thousand armed men had already taken a part of the wall, when the rest of the forces were brought up, and on more ladders they were making their way to the top of the wall, a signal having been given from the Hexapylon.<note>For this, the most important gate to the north, cf. XXIV. xxi. 7; xxxii. 5, etc.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To that point they had advanced without encountering a soul, since many of the enemy, after feasting in the towers, either had been put to sleep by their wine or, while half-intoxicated, were still drinking.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A few of them, however, they surprised and slew in their beds. Near the Hexapylon there is a postern. This they had begun to break open with great force, and from the wall the signal had been given by a trumpet, as agreed; and now the fighting was from every side, no longer by stealth, but with open violence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For <pb id="p.435"/>they had reached Epipolae, a well-guarded region,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> and the enemy had rather to be terrified than deceived, as they were in fact terrified.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For as soon as they heard the notes of the trumpet and the shouting of the men holding the walls and a part of the city, the guards, thinking the whole city was occupied, fled, some of them along the wall; others leaped from the wall or were pushed over by the panic-stricken crowd.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A large part of the people, however, were unaware of the great danger; for all were heavy with wine and sleep, and in a city of immense size knowledge concerning its quarters failed to reach the whole.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At daybreak Marcellus burst open the Hexapylon, and entering the city with his entire force awakened everybody and set them to arming themselves and bringing aid, if possible, to a city now all but captured.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Epicydes came out from the Island, which they themselves call Nasos,<note>Doric for <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> Insula.</note> with a quickly moving column, not doubting that he would drive out a few men who, owing to the carelessness of the guards had got over the wall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When men met him in alarm, he would say that they were adding to the confusion and bringing exaggerated and unduly alarming news. On discovering that in and near Epipolae armed men were everywhere, he merely challenged the enemy by a few missiles and then marched his column back into Achradina.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He feared, not so much the attack of the enemy and their great numbers, as that some treachery within the city might have opportunity to break out, and he might find the gates of Achradina and the Island closed during the disturbance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Marcellus, on entering the walls and from the higher ground viewing one of the most beautiful of all cities<note>Timaeus, the historian of Sicily, had called Syracuse the greatest of Greek cities, the most beautiful of all cities; Cicero, <hi rend="italics">de Re Publica</hi> III. 43; <hi rend="italics">in Verrem</hi> IV. 117.</note> in <pb id="p.437"/>that age lying before his eyes, is said to have wept,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> partly for joy over his great achievement, partly for the ancient glory of the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The sinking of the fleets of the Athenians and the destruction of two mighty armies along with two very distinguished generals<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Nicias and Demosthenes.</note> came to his mind, and so many wars waged with so great a risk against the Carthaginians;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> tyrants and kings, so many and so wealthy, above all Hiero, a king vividly remembered and also, above all that his own merit and success had given him, conspicuous for his favours to the Roman people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Since all that came to mind and the thought suggested itself that now in the course of an hour everything there would be in flames and reduced to ashes, before
				<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> advancing his standards into Achradina, he sent forward the Syracusans who had been within the Roman lines, as has been said before, in order to entice the enemy by mild words to surrender the city.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Holding the gates and walls of Achradina were chiefly deserters, who had no hope of pardon if terms were made. They did not allow the men either to approach the walls or to speak to any one.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so Marcellus, now that this attempt was fruitless, ordered the standards to be carried back to Euryalus. This is a hill<note>At the western apex of the triangle; a narrow ridge nearly 500 feet above the sea, with a commanding view.</note> in the most distant part of the city, facing away from the sea, and commanding the road which leads to the country and the interior of the island, very conveniently placed for receiving supplies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In command of this citadel<note>The crowning point of Dionysius' great fortifications, and still accounted the strongest of Greek fortresses, with its three fosses, its towers, and a complicated system of tunnels cut through solid rock.</note> was Philodemus the Argive, posted there by Epicydes. Sosis, one of the slayers <pb id="p.439"/>of the tyrant, was sent to him by Marcellus, and after<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> being balked and put off by the delivery of a long speech, he reported to Marcellus that Philodemus had taken time to consider.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Philodemus was postponing from day to day, waiting for Hippocrates and Himilco to move up their camp and legions, and not doubting that, if he should get them into the citadel, the Roman army, shut up within the city walls, could be destroyed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Consequently Marcellus, seeing that Euryalus could neither be won by surrender nor by assault, pitched his camp between Neapolis and Tycha, these being the names of quarters of the city, virtually cities in themselves. For he feared that, if he should enter thickly settled parts, the soldiers in their eagerness for booty could not be restrained from scattering.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To this camp came legates from Tycha and Neapolis with fillets and woollen bands,<note>Cf. XXIV. xxx. 14.</note> praying that they be spared bloodshed and fires.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcellus held a council in regard to their prayers &mdash;such they were rather than demands &mdash;and with the approval of all gave an order to the soldiers that no one should injure a free person; everything else would be spoil.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The camp was enclosed by bricks from house-walls<note>Here the text is very uncertain, but most of the emendations are open to serious objections, as involving Marcellus' use of more or less continuous house-walls &mdash;a feeble defence, and not easily to be reconciled with the idea of an open space lying between two built-up quarters of the city.</note> to serve as a wall of defence. At those camp gates which opened toward the streets outposts and detachments were stationed by Marcellus, that no attack upon the camp might occur while the soldiers were
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> dispersed. Then at a given signal the soldiers scattered. And although doors were forced and everywhere were the sounds of panic and uproar, they nevertheless refrained from bloodshed. To plundering there was no limit until they had carried away all the possessions accumulated in a long-continued
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <pb id="p.441"/>prosperity. Meanwhile even Philodemus, having<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> no hope of assistance and receiving assurance that he might return unharmed to Epicydes, led his garrison out and surrendered the hill to the
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Romans. While the attention of all was diverted in the direction of the uproar of a city in part captured, Bomilcar, favoured by such a night that on account of a violent storm the Roman fleet could
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> not ride at anchor in open water, came out of the harbour of Syracuse with thirty-five ships, and with no enemy to prevent, put to sea, leaving fifty-five ships to Epicydes and the
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Syracusans. And after informing the Carthaginians how critical was the situation at Syracuse, he returned after a few days with a hundred ships. He was presented with many gifts, it is reported, by Epicydes out of the royal treasures of Hiero.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, after getting possession of Euryalus and garrisoning it, was relieved of one fear, that some troops of the enemy in the rear might be admitted to the citadel and embarrass his men, hemmed in and hampered by the walls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He thereupon laid siege to Achradina with three camps placed in suitable positions, in the hope of reducing the beleaguered to absolute want.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the outposts on both sides had been inactive for some days, suddenly the arrival of Hippocrates and Himilco had the effect that the Romans were actually besieged on all sides.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For Hippocrates, after fortifying a camp by the Great Harbour and giving the signal to the forces occupying Achradina, attacked the old Roman camp,<note>Cf. XXIV. xxxiii. 3; xxxix. 12.</note> which was commanded by Crispinus, at the same time that Epicydes made a sally against Marcellus' outposts, and just when the Carthaginian fleet put in to the shore lying between the city and <pb id="p.443"/>the Roman camp, to make it impossible for any force<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> to be sent to the aid of Crispinus by Marcellus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> However, it was more of an uproar than a battle that the enemy offered. For Crispinus not only drove Hippocrates back from his fortifications, but also pursued him as he fled in disorder, and Marcellus likewise forced Epicydes into the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And now, even for the future, he seemed to have sufficiently insured that there should be no danger from their sudden raids.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then in addition pestilence brought to both sides a calamity which forthwith diverted the attention of the two armies from strategy. For owing to the autumn season and places naturally unhealthy, unendurable heat affected the health of nearly all the men in both camps, but much more outside the city than within. And at first they sickened and died owing to the season and their position.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Later the mere care of the ill and contagion spread the disease, so that those who had fallen ill died neglected and abandoned, or else they carried off with them those who sat by them and those who nursed, having caught the same malignant disease.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so every day funerals and death were before their eyes, and wailings were heard on all sides day and night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Finally, from habituation to misery they had so lost their humane feelings that, so far from escorting the dead with tears and the wailing that was their due, they did not even carry them out and bury them; and dead bodies lay strewn about before the eyes of men awaiting a like death, and the dead seriously affected the ill, the ill the sound, not only through fear, but also by putrefaction and the pestilent odour of corpses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And some choosing to die by the sword, dashed into the outposts of <pb id="p.445"/>the enemy single-handed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A much more violent<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> epidemic, however, had attacked the Carthaginian camp than the Roman. For the Romans in their long blockade of Syracuse had grown more accustomed to the climate and the water.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Of the enemy's army, the Sicilians scattered, each to his own neighbouring city, as soon as they saw that the disease
				<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> was spreading owing to the unwholesomeness of the place, while the Carthaginians, who had no refuge anywhere, with even their generals, Hippocrates and Himilco, perished to the last man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Marcellus, as soon as the pestilence began to be so serious, had transferred his soldiers into the city, and shelter and shade had revived the invalids. Nevertheless many in the Roman army were carried off by the same pestilence.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Carthaginian land-army having been destroyed, the Sicilians who had been Hippocrates' soldiers had occupied . . .,<note>One of the two omitted towns was perhaps Bidis, mentioned by Cicero <hi rend="italics">in Verrem</hi> II. 53. Rossbach and Conway thought that the other might be Dascon (Thucydides and Diodorus).</note> not large towns, but defended both by situation and fortifications. One of them is three miles from Syracuse, the other fifteen miles. To these they were bringing supplies from their own communities and also summoning auxiliaries.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Meanwhile Bomilcar left for Carthage a second time with his fleet, and he set forth the situation of their allies in such terms as to inspire hope, not only that effectual aid could be lent to them, but also that the Romans could be captured in the virtually captured city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He thus prevailed upon them to send with him as many transports as possible, laden with all kinds of supplies, and to enlarge his fleet. Accordingly, setting out from Carthage with a hundred and thirty warships and seven hundred transports, he had winds quite favourable for the <pb id="p.447"/>crossing to Sicily. But the same winds did not allow<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> him to round Pachynum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The report at first of Bomilcar's coming, and then its unexpected delay, brought rejoicing and fear by turns to Romans and Syracusans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Upon that Epicydes, fearing that, if the same winds which were then holding should continue
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> to blow from the east for several days, the Carthaginian fleet would make for Africa again, turned over Achradina to the commanders of the mercenaries and sailed to meet Bomilcar, who
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> was keeping his fleet in a roadstead facing Africa.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He feared a naval battle, not so much because he was inferior in his forces and the number of his ships &mdash;in fact he had even more &mdash;as because the winds then blowing were more favourable to the Roman fleet than to his own. Nevertheless Epicydes gained his consent to try the fortune of a naval engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And Marcellus too, seeing that a Sicilian army was being brought together from the entire island and at the same time a Carthaginian fleet was approaching with unlimited supplies, and fearing that he might be hard pressed by land and sea, being shut up within the enemies' city, decided, although he was inferior in the number of his ships, to prevent Bomilcar from reaching Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The two opposing fleets lay on this side and that of the promontory of Pachynum, ready to engage as soon as calm weather should enable them to put to sea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so, as the southeast wind, which had been blowing hard for some days, was now dropping, Bomilcar was the first to get under weigh. And at first his fleet appeared to be heading out to sea, the more readily to round the promontory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But on seeing that the Roman ships were steering towards <pb id="p.449"/>him, Bomilcar, alarmed by something unforeseen,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> made sail for open water, and after sending messengers to Heraclea<note>Cf. XXIV. xxxv. 3.</note> to command the transports to return thence to Africa, he himself sailed along the coast of Sicily and made for Tarentum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Epicydes, suddenly bereft of a hope so high, in order not to return, only to share the siege of a city in large part captured, sailed to Agrigentum, intending to await the outcome, rather than to set anything in motion from there.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these things were reported to the camp of the Sicilians, that Epicydes had left Syracuse, that the island had been abandoned by the Carthaginians and almost handed over a second time to the
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Romans, after first ascertaining by conferences the wish of the besieged, they sent legates to Marcellus to make terms for the surrender of the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was virtually agreed that all that had anywhere belonged to the kings should belong to the Romans, that everything else should be secured to the Sicilians along with freedom and their own laws.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly the legates summoned to a conference the men to whom power had been entrusted by Epicydes, and said that they had been sent by the army of the Sicilians at the same time to Marcellus and to them, in order that all, the besieged and those who had been outside of the operations, might share the same lot and neither party make any special terms for itself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And then, being admitted by them, that they might speak with their relatives and guest-friends, they explained the terms which they had already settled with Marcellus, and by holding out assurances of safety prevailed upon them to join with themselves in an attack upon Epicydes' prefects, Polyclitus and Philistion and an Epicydes surnamed Sindon.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After slaying them and <pb id="p.451"/>calling the populace to an assembly, they complained<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> of privation and other things at which among themselves they had been in the habit of murmuring in secret. And they said that, although so many hardships were a burden to them, they ought not to blame fortune, because it was in their own power to say how long they would endure them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans, they said, had had as their ground for besieging Syracuse their love, not hatred, of the Syracusans. For on learning that the power had been seized by Hippocrates and Epicydes, minions of Hannibal and later of Hieronymus, it was then that they had made war and had begun to besiege the city, in order to capture, not the city itself, but its cruel tyrants.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But now that Hippocrates had perished, that Epicydes had been cut off from Syracuse and his prefects slain, now that the Carthaginians had everywhere been driven by land and sea from their occupation of Sicily, what reason remained for the Romans not to wish Syracuse to be preserved, just as if Hiero himself, who was unrivalled in maintaining friendship with Rome, were still alive?
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly both for the city and for individuals there was no other danger than from themselves, if they should let slip the opportunity of a reconciliation with the Romans. Moreover so favourable an opportunity as there was at that moment, if it should be evident that Syracuse, once it had been freed from insolent tyrants,. . . ,<note>Madvig's restoration is based upon the idea of an immediate return to their former friendship (<quote>and was taking the Roman side</quote>). Walters supplied the thought that the Romans might even reject such advances.</note> would never come again.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The speech was heard with great and unanimous approval. It was decided, however, to elect magistrates before naming legates. Then out of the number of these magistrates' representatives <pb id="p.453"/>were sent to Marcellus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The foremost of these said:<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> <quote>In the beginning it was not we Syracusans who forsook your friendship, but Hieronymus, who was by no means so conscienceless toward you as toward us.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And later the peace concluded on the assassination of the tyrant was broken, not by any Syracusan, but by the king's minions, Hippocrates and Epicydes, after they had subdued us, now by terrorizing, now by treason. Nor can any man say that there has ever been any time of freedom for us that was not a time of peace with you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Certain it is that now, when through the slaying of those who were holding Syracuse in subjection we have begun for the first time to be our own masters, we have come forthwith to give up our arms, to surrender ourselves, the city, the walls, to reject no lot which shall be imposed by you Romans. The glory of capturing the most notable and most beautiful of Greek cities the gods have given to you, Marcellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All that we have ever accomplished on land and sea that is worthy of record is added to the distinction of your triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Would you wish men merely to believe tradition as to the greatness of the city you have captured, rather than that it be a sight even to posterity, a city which shall show to every man who comes by land or by sea, at one spot our trophies won from the Athenians and the Carthaginians, at another your trophies won from us, and that you hand over Syracuse intact to your house, to be kept under the clientship and tutelage of those who bear the name Marcellus?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let not the memory of Hieronymus have more weight with you Romans than that of Hiero. The latter was much longer your friend than the former your enemy; and you <pb id="p.455"/>have had positive experience of the good deeds of<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> the one, while the other's folly resulted only in his own destruction.</quote> Everything could be obtained from the Romans and was already assured.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was among the Sicilians themselves that war and danger chiefly lay. For the deserters, thinking that they would surely be handed over to the Romans, aroused the mercenary auxiliaries also to the same fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And seizing arms they<note><hi rend="italics">I.e</hi> the mercenaries.</note> first slew the magistrates and then dispersed to massacre the Syracusans, and in anger they slew all whom chance threw in their way and carried off everything on which they could lay hands.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, not to be without commanders, they chose six prefects, three to be in charge of Achradina and three of Nasus. When the uproar was at last stilled and they were diligently enquiring what terms had been made with the Romans, the truth began to dawn upon them, that their case was different from that of the deserters.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Just at the right moment the legates returned from Marcellus, stating that the mercenaries had been aroused by an unfounded suspicion, and that the Romans had no reason for demanding their punishment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One of the three prefects of Achradina was a Spaniard, Moericus by name. To him, among the- retinue of the legates, one<note>We learn from XXVI. xxi. 13 that his name was Belligenes.</note> of the Spanish auxiliaries was sent on purpose. Finding Moericus alone, he first explained the condition in which he had left Spain, from which he had recently come. The whole of that country, he said, was held by Roman arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If he should do something worth while, he could be a chief among his own people, whether he preferred to serve on the Roman side or to return to his native town. On the other hand, if he <pb id="p.457"/>continued to prefer to be besieged, what hope was<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> there for a man shut in by land and sea?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moericus was impressed by these words, and when it was decided to send legates to Marcellus, sent his brother as one of them. He was escorted separately from the rest to Marcellus by that same Spaniard, and after receiving a promise and arranging the steps to be taken, returned to Achradina.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then Moericus, to divert the attention of everybody from the suspicion of treason, said he did not approve of having legates going back and forth; that none should be admitted or sent; and that, in order to keep a closer guard, suitable positions should be divided among the prefects, so that each should be responsible for the defence of his own section.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All agreed. In the assignment of sections the region extending from the Fountain of Arethusa to the entrance of the Great Harbour fell to Moericus himself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He saw to it that the Romans knew that. Accordingly Marcellus ordered a transport with armed men to be towed at night by a four-banker to Achradina,<note>An evident error for the Island (Nasus), due possibly to Livy's attempt to combine several different accounts. There is further confusion in the passage which follows.</note> and the soldiers to be landed near the gate which is by the Fountain of Arethusa.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This done at the fourth watch, and the soldiers landed there having been admitted according to agreement by Moericus through the gate, Marcellus at daybreak with all his forces assailed the walls of Achradina.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The result was that not only did he turn the attention of the defenders of Achradina to himself, but from Nasus also columns of armed men, leaving their posts, united in haste, to ward off the violent attack of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> During this confusion light vessels, previously equipped, sailed around to Nasus and landed their troops. These made an unexpected attack upon <pb id="p.459"/>the half-manned outposts and the open doors of the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> gate through which the armed men had dashed out a little while before, and with no great resistance captured Nasus, deserted by the excitement and flight of the guards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And no others showed less capacity to defend or determination to hold out than the deserters, since they did not quite trust even their own men and fled out of the midst of the conflict.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Marcellus, on learning that Nasus had been captured and one section of Achradina occupied, also that Moericus with his force had joined the Romans, sounded the recall, to prevent the royal treasures, which were reported to be larger than they really were, from being plundered.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The onslaught of the soldiers being checked and time and place for their flight given to the deserters who were in Achradina,
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the Syracusans, at last relieved of their fear, open the gates of Achradina and send representatives to Marcellus, asking nothing else than their own lives and those of their children.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcellus, calling a council and admitting also those Syracusans who, after being driven from home during the uprisings, had been inside the Roman lines, replied that the good acts of Hiero toward the Roman people during fifty years had not been more numerous than the evil deeds done in the last few years by those who held Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But most of the misdeeds, he said, had reacted just as they should, and the men had exacted from themselves much more serious penalties for the broken treaties than the Roman people wished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For his part, he was besieging Syracuse for the third year, not that the Roman people might keep the city enslaved, but to prevent the commanders of deserters <pb id="p.461"/>and foreigners from holding it in captivity and<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> subjection.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What the Syracusans could have done was shown by the example either of those Syracusans inside the Roman lines, or of the Spanish commander Moericus, who surrendered his post, or finally of the belated but courageous resolution of the Syracusans themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To his mind it was by no means a sufficient reward for all the hardships and dangers, so long endured on land and sea about the Syracusan walls, that he had been able to capture Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon the quaestor was sent from Nasus with a force to receive and guard the royal funds. The city was given over to the soldiers to plunder, guards being first assigned to the houses of the men who had been inside the Roman lines.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> While many shameful examples of anger and many of greed were being given, the tradition is that Archimedes, in all the uproar which the alarm of a captured city could produce in the midst of plundering soldiers dashing about, was intent upon the figures which he had traced in the dust and was slain by a soldier, not knowing who he was;<note>Cf. Plutarch's account, <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> 19; Valerius Maximus VIII. 7. Ext. 7; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Finibus</hi> V. 50.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that Marcellus was grieved at this, and his burial duly provided for; and that his name and memory were an honour and a protection to his relatives, search even being made for them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Such in the main was the capture of Syracuse,<note>Actually the fall of Syracuse appears to have taken place in the following year, <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date></note> in which there was booty in such quantity as there
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> would scarcely have been <pb id="p.463"/>if Carthage, with which the conflict was on even<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> terms, had at that time been captured.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>A few days before Syracuse was taken, Titus Otacilius with eighty five-bankers crossed over from Lilybaeum to Utica. And having entered the harbour before daylight, he captured cargo-ships laden with grain, and disembarking ravaged a considerable area around Utica and drove booty of every kind back to the ships.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> On the third day after he had left Lilybaeum he returned thither with a hundred and thirty cargo-ships laden with grain and booty, and sent the grain at once to Syracuse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Had it not arrived so opportunely, a famine equally destructive to victors and vanquished was impending.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Spain in the same summer, when for about two years<note>This apparently from a source which placed the defeat and death of the Scipios in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>; cf. note on xxxvi. 14.</note> nothing very notable had occurred and the war was being waged more by diplomacy than by arms, the Roman generals, on leaving their winter-quarters, united their forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon a council was called and all were of one mind, that, since up to that time they had accomplished nothing except to hold Hasdrubal back from pushing on into Italy, it was time that their task should now be to end the war in Spain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And they believed they had sufficient reinforcements for that purpose in twenty thousand Celtiberians who had been called to arms that winter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The enemy had three armies. Hasdrubal, the son of Gisgo, and Mago with adjoining camps were about five days' march from the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nearer was Hasdrubal, the son of Hamilcar, a veteran commander in Spain. He had his army near a city called Amtorgis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was he that the <pb id="p.465"/>Roman generals wished first to overpower; and they<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> hoped they had quite ample forces for that end. The one remaining concern was the fear that, if he was defeated, the other Hasdrubal and Mago might in alarm withdraw to pathless forests and mountains and prolong the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They thought it best therefore to divide their forces into two armies and include the whole of Spain in their plan of operations. And they divided in such manner that Publius Cornelius should lead two-thirds of the army of Romans and allies against Mago and Hasdrubal, and
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> that Gnaeus Cornelius with one-third of the old army and the Celtiberians in addition should carry on the war with Hasdrubal Barca.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Setting out together, with the Celtiberians in the van, both generals and armies pitched camp near the city of Amtorgis, in sight of the enemy, but separated by a river.<note>Probably the Baetis, as Iliturgi was not far away; cf. XXVIII. xix. 2.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There Gnaeus Scipio remained with the above-mentioned forces, while Publius Scipio set out for his previously appointed share of the war.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal first noted that there was only a small army of Romans in the camp and that all their hope was in the Celtiberian auxiliaries.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, as he was well acquainted with every form of treachery practised by barbarians and particularly by those tribes among which he had been campaigning for so many years, and
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> as oral communication was easy, since both camps were full of Spaniards, by means of secret conferences he made an agreement with the chief men of the Celtiberians at a high price that they should withdraw their troops.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor did it seem an outrageous act &mdash;for it was not urged that they should turn their arms against the Romans &mdash;and a price which would have been ample even for engaging <pb id="p.467"/>in the war was offered them not to wage war. Again,<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> not only peace itself, but also a return home and the advantage of seeing their families and their property were attractions to the mass of them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly their leaders were not more easily persuaded than the rank and file.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the same time they had no fear from the Romans either, if they, being so few in number, should try to hold them by force. It will always be a necessary precaution for Roman generals, and these instances must really be accounted warnings, not so to trust their foreign auxiliaries as not to have in camp more of their own strength and of forces that are absolutely their own.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Celtiberians suddenly took up their standards and departed, and when Romans asked the reason and implored them to remain, they gave no other answer than that they were called away by a war at home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, now that his allies could not be held either by entreaties or by force, saw that he could neither be a match for the enemy without them nor rejoin his brother, and that no other promising plan was available.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thereupon he decided to retire as far as possible, taking every care and being on the alert not to expose himself anywhere on level ground to the enemy, who crossed the river and kept almost at their heels as they withdrew.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Publius Scipio was beset by a fear no less grave and a danger that was greater from a new enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was the young Masinissa, at that time an ally of the Carthaginians, a man whom friendship with the Romans later made famous and powerful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With his Numidian cavalry he now encountered Publius Scipio on his advance, and also was continually at hand day and night,
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> ready <pb id="p.469"/>to attack, so that he not only captured soldiers<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> who had wandered far from the camp in search of wood and fodder, but also rode up to the camp itself, and often dashing into the midst of the outposts threw everything into great confusion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By night also there was often alarm at the gates and on the earthwork owing to a sudden attack, nor was any place or time free from fear and anxiety for the Romans, and they were confined within their earthwork, unable to obtain anything.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was almost a regular blockade, and this would evidently be stricter if Indibilis, who was reported as approaching with seven thousand five hundred Suessetani, should join the Carthaginians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Consequently Scipio, though a general marked by caution and foresight, being forced by his straits, adopted the rash plan of going by night to meet Indibilis and giving battle wherever he should encounter him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Therefore, leaving a moderate garrison at the camp and putting his lieutenant, Tiberius Fonteius, in command of it, he set out at midnight, and on meeting the enemy engaged them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was a battle of columns rather than lines; yet, so far as could be in an engagement without order, the Roman had the advantage. But the Numidian cavalry, whose notice the general had thought he had escaped, by outflanking them inspired great alarm, and in addition, when they had entered a fresh battle with the Numidians, a third enemy also arrived, the Carthaginian generals, who from the rear overtook them when already engaged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And the Romans found themselves between two battles, uncertain against which enemy and in which direction they should choose to break through in a mass.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As the general was fighting and exhorting, <pb id="p.471"/>and exposing himself where there was most to be<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> done, his right side was pierced by a lance. And those of the enemy who in a wedge had made an attack upon the men pressing close about the general, on seeing the dying Scipio slipping from his horse, dashed everywhere along the line, wild with delight, shouting and announcing that the Roman commander had fallen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The broadcasting of that announcement far and wide made the enemy as good as victors beyond a doubt and the Romans as good as vanquished. Flight directly from the battle-line began, once they had lost their general.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But while, so far as bursting through the Numidians and the light-armed auxiliaries as well was concerned, flight was not difficult, yet it was hardly possible for them to escape such numbers of horsemen and infantry who by their speed kept up with the horses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And almost more were slain in flight than in battle, nor would anyone have survived but for the coming on of night, as the day was now rapidly drawing to a close.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the Carthaginian generals directly after the battle, making no indifferent use of their success, barely allowed their soldiers necessary rest, and rushed their column with all speed in the direction of Hasdrubal, the son of Hamilcar, with the certain hope that, when they should unite with him, the war could be finished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Upon their arrival there was great congratulation between the armies and generals rejoicing in the recent victory, since so great a general and his entire army had been destroyed, and they were looking for just such another victory as beyond question.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As for the Romans, not yet indeed had a report of the great disaster reached them, but there was a gloomy silence and an unexpressed foreboding, <pb id="p.473"/>such as is usually the forecast of impending<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> misfortune when men already have presentiments.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The general himself, in addition to the knowledge that he had been deserted by his allies and that the enemy's forces had been so greatly increased, was more inclined by logical inference to suspect that a disaster had occurred than to entertain any good hope.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For how, he thought, could Hasdrubal and Mago, unless they had quite finished their own war, have been able to bring up their army without an engagement?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And how had his brother failed to confront them or to follow in their rear, so that, if unable to prevent the generals and armies of the enemy from uniting, he might himself at least combine his forces with those of his brother?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Troubled by these anxieties, he believed that the one safe course at present was to retreat as faraway as possible. Then in one night, while the enemy were unaware of it and hence made no move, he marched a considerable distance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the morning the enemy, on discovering that they had gone, sent the Numidians in advance and began to follow them in a column at its utmost speed. Before night the Numidians had overtaken them, and charging now in the rear, now on the flanks, compelled them to halt and defend their column.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Scipio kept encouraging them to fight and advance at the same time, so far, that is, as they could do so with safety, before the infantry forces should overtake them. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But while he now urged his column forward, now ordered it to halt, for a long time little progress was being made and night was now at hand.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio therefore recalled his men from battle, concentrated them and led them up a hill that was not indeed quite safe, especially <pb id="p.475"/>for a terrified column, but still was higher than the<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> country around it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There the infantry, surrounding the baggage and cavalry placed in the centre, at first kept off the charges of the Numidians without difficulty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, when three generals arrived in full force with three regular armies, and it was evident that they would be unable by arms to defend an unfortified position, the general began to cast about and consider whether he could in some way surround it with an earthwork..
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the hill was so bare and rocky that neither could thickets be found for the cutting of stakes nor ground such that they could get turf or carry a trench in it or any other earthwork. And yet no spot was naturally so elevated or rugged as to make approach or ascent difficult for the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Everywhere the ground rose at a gentle slope. However, in order to interpose some semblance of an earthwork, they laid
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> up, as it were, to the usual height all around them, pack-saddles still tied to their loads, while, wherever the pack-saddles failed to make a barricade, they piled on top lighter baggage of every kind.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The Carthaginian armies, on arriving, very easily marched in column up the hill; but the strange appearance of the defences at first checked them in a certain amazement, while their commanders kept shouting from all sides, asking why they stood still and did not pull apart and scatter that pretence, hardly strong enough to delay women or children. The enemy, they said, was held captive, lurking behind his baggage. Such were the scornful taunts of the commanders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But it was not easy to leap over or clear away
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the baggage in front of them, nor to cut apart the mass of pack-saddles, buried under <pb id="p.477"/>the added loads.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But after they had cleared away<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> the baggage in front of them with hooked poles and made a way for the armed men, and the same thing was being done in different places, the camp had by this time been captured from all sides.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Everywhere there was slaughter of the few by the many, of the panic-stricken by the victorious. A large part of the soldiers, however, after fleeing into the neighbouring forest, made their escape to Publius Scipio's camp, of which Tiberius Fonteius, his lieutenant, was commander.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As for Gnaeus Scipio, some relate that he was slain on the hill in the first onset of the enemy, others that with a few men he made his escape to a tower near the camp; that fire was lighted around this, and so, by burning the doors which they had been unable to force in any way, they captured the tower and all were slain in it along with the commander himself.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>In the eighth year<note>Correct, though inconsistent with Livy's general chronology, which would make it the seventh year; cf. XXI. xxxii. 3. In xxxviii. 6 also Livy has followed an authority who placed the disasters in Spain in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>; cf. note on xxxii. 1.</note> after his arrival in Spain Gnaeus Scipio was killed, on the twenty-ninth day after the death of his brother.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Grief for their deaths was not greater in Rome than throughout Spain; in fact among the citizens the destruction of armies and the loss of a province and the national disaster claimed a part in their sorrow, while all Spain mourned for the generals
				<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> themselves and missed them, Gnaeus more than Publius, because he had been longer in command and had earlier won their favour, and had given for the first time an example of Roman justice and self-control.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While it seemed that the armies had been wiped out and all Spain lost, a single man repaired their shattered fortunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the army was Lucius Marcius, son of Septimus, a Roman knight, an active <pb id="p.479"/>young man of much more spirit and talent than was<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> to be expected in the station in which he had been born.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In addition to his high promise he had had the training of Gnaeus Scipio, in which during so many years he had mastered all the arts of the soldier.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This man had made an army that was not to be despised out of soldiers gathered up from the flight and in part withdrawn from garrison towns, and he had united it with that of Tiberius Fonteius, the lieutenant of Publius Scipio.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But so preeminent was a mere Roman knight in his personal influence with the soldiers and in the respect they paid him that, after they had fortified a camp on this side of the Hiberus
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> and decided that a commander of the army should be chosen in an election by the soldiers, relieving each other as sentries on the wall and in outpost duty until all had cast their votes, they unanimously conferred the high command upon Lucius Marcius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then spent the whole time &mdash;and it was very short &mdash;in fortifying the camp and bringing up supplies. And the soldiers carried out all his commands, not only with energy, but also in no dejected spirit.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But when the news came that Hasdrubal the son of Gisgo, on his way to wipe out the last remains of the war, had crossed the Hiberus and was approaching, and the soldiers
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> saw the signal for battle raised by a new general, they remembered what commanders they had had a short time before, and upon what generals and forces they had usually relied as they went into battle. Suddenly they all were weeping and dashing their heads against obstacles; and some raised their hands to heaven, blaming the gods, others lying on the ground invoked their respective generals by name.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And the wailing <pb id="p.481"/>could not be stilled, although the centurions tried to<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> arouse the men of their maniples and Marcius himself to calm them and upbraided them for having given themselves up to womanish and useless weeping, instead of whetting their courage to defend themselves and with them the state, and begged them not to let their commanders lie unavenged, when suddenly &mdash;for the enemy were now near the earthwork &mdash;a shout and the sound of trumpets were heard.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Upon that, their grief instantly changing to anger, they scatter to arms, and as if fired by frenzy, to the different gates, and dash into the enemy coming on carelessly and in disorder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At once the unexpected act inspired alarm among the Carthaginians, and they wondered whence so many enemies had suddenly appeared after the army had been almost wiped out, whence came such boldness and self-confidence so great in men beaten and put to flight, what commander had arisen after the two Scipios had been slain, who was in command of the camp, who had given the signal for battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In the face of all that &mdash;so many things so unexpected &mdash;they at first retreated, completely at a loss and dumbfounded; then beaten back by the strength of the attack they took to flight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And there would have been either a terrible slaughter of the fleeing or a reckless and dangerous attack on the part of the pursuers, had not Marcius promptly given the signal for the recall and kept back his own excited line, facing his men in the front line and laying hold of some with his own hands. He then led them back to camp still thirsting for slaughter and bloodshed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Carthaginians were at first forced away in confusion from the enemies' earthwork; then, when they saw that no one was pursuing, <pb id="p.483"/>they thought they had halted for fear, and with fresh<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> contempt and at a slow pace they retired to their camp.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>There was just as much carelessness in guarding the camp. For, although the enemy was near, still they kept reflecting that it was only a remnant of the two armies wiped out a few days before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Since for this reason every precaution had been omitted on the enemy's side, Marcius, informed of the facts, turned his attention to a plan at first sight reckless rather than bold, actually to attack the camp of the enemy, in the
				<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> belief that it was easier to storm the camp of Hasdrubal alone than to defend his own, if the three armies and three generals should again unite.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> At the same time he thought that, if his efforts should prove successful, he would relieve his critical situation or, even if defeated, by venturing to attack he would at least take away their contempt for himself. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But for fear an unexpected action, and alarm in the night and a plan no longer in keeping with his present situation, might bring confusion, he thought he must address his soldiers and encourage them, called an assembly and spoke as follows:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> "Either my devotion to our commanders, living and dead, or the present situation of us all, soldiers, can convince any one that this high command, though a great honour as your tribute, is yet in fact a burden to me and an anxious care.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For at a time when, if fear did not paralyse grief, I should scarcely have such self-control as would enable me to find some comfort for distress of mind, I am compelled &mdash;a most difficult thing in sorrow &mdash;alone to plan for all of you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And even when I must consider how I may be able to save these remnants of two armies <pb id="p.485"/>for our country, I may not turn my thoughts away<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> from unremitting grief.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For a bitter memory is present with me, and both Scipios trouble me all day and all night with anxiety and loss of sleep, and often arouse me from slumber, bidding me not to allow either themselves or their soldiers, your comrades, undefeated in this land for eight years,<note>Cf. xxxvi. 14 and note.</note> or the state, to go unavenged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And they command me to follow their teachings and their methods, and, just as while they lived not a man was more obedient to their
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> orders than I, so after their death to hold that to be the best course which in each case I am confident they would have done. As for you, soldiers, I would have you also honour them, not with lamentations and tears as though dead.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They live and work by the glory of their achievements. But whenever you shall remember them, just as if you saw them encouraging you and giving the signal, &mdash;in that spirit would I have you go into battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was surely no other image which presented itself yesterday to your eyes and minds and brought about that notable battle, by which
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> you gave the enemy proof that the Roman name has not been extinguished with the Scipios, and that the people whose might and courage were not overwhelmed by the disaster at Cannae will surely survive any cruelty of Fortune.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><quote>At present, because you have of your own accord shown such daring, I should like to find how much you have when your general gives the command. For yesterday, when I sounded the recall, as you in disorder were pursuing the routed enemy, it was not my wish to crush your boldness, but to reserve it for higher fame and a more favourable situation, that <pb id="p.487"/>later, being
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> well prepared and armed, you might be<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> able, as opportunity offered, to attack the unprepared and unarmed, and even the sleeping. And not haphazard or at random do I cherish a hope of this opportunity, soldiers, but from the actual situation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> You too, if someone should ask how you, a few men, have defended your camp against many, the vanquished against the victors, would surely give no other answer than that, fearing just that, you had kept everything in a state of defence and also had been in readiness yourselves and inline.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And the fact is this: men are least protected against the thing which success leads them not to fear, since what one has made light of remains unguarded and uncovered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There is nothing in the world which the enemy now fear less than that we, who have ourselves just been beset and attacked, may venture to attack their camp. Let us dare what it is incredible that we should dare; for the very reason that it appears most difficult it will be easier. In the third watch of the night I shall lead you in a silent column.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> I am assured that there is no relieving of sentries, no regular outposts. The sound of a shout at the gate and a first assault will at once capture the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Then, among men dazed with sleep and alarmed at the unexpected uproar and surprised unarmed in their beds, let there be the slaughter from which you were recalled yesterday under protest. I know it seems a bold plan. But in dangerous and desperate situations the bravest decisions are always the safest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> For if at the opportune moment, whose advantage swiftly passes, one hesitates even a little, it is vain for one to look later for the neglected opportunity. One army is near, two not far away. If we attack now there is <pb id="p.489"/>no little hope, and already you have tried your strength<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> and theirs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> If we put off the day and owing to the report of yesterday's sally come to be no longer despised, there is danger that all the generals and all the forces may combine.
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Shall we then withstand the enemy's three generals, three armies, which Gnaeus Scipio with his army still undiminished did not withstand? Just as through dividing their forces our generals perished, so the enemy, if divided and in different places, can be overpowered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> There is no other way of conducting the war. Therefore let us wait for nothing beyond the favourable moment to-night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Go with the kind aid of the gods, put yourselves in condition, that, sound and strong, you may burst into the camp of the enemy with the same spirit with which you defended yours.</quote></p> 
			<p>With joy they heard of the new plan from their new commander, and the bolder it was the more it pleased them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> The rest of the day was spent in putting their arms in order and themselves in condition; and the larger part of the night was given to rest. At the fourth watch they started. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Beyond the nearest camp and at a distance of six miles from it were other forces of the Carthaginians. Between them there was a deep valley, densely wooded. About the middle of this wood a Roman cohort and cavalry were concealed after the Punic method.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The road being thus cut off at the half-way, the rest of the forces were led in a silent column to the nearest enemy. And as there was no outpost before the gates nor sentinels on the earthwork, and no one anywhere opposed them, they made their way into the camp as if it were their own.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the trumpets sound and a shout is raised. Some slay <pb id="p.491"/>the enemy half-asleep, some throw firebrands on<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> the dry, thatched huts, some seize the gates, to block escape.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the enemy, fire, shouting and slaughter, all at once, make them virtually senseless and do not allow them to hear any orders or to look out for themselves. Unharmed they encounter bodies of armed men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some rush to the gates, others, since the roads are blocked, leap over the earthwork. And everyone who escaped fled at once in the direction of the other camp;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> whereupon they were surrounded by the cohort and cavalry dashing out of their hiding place and were slain to the last man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Yet, even if a man had escaped from that slaughter, so swiftly did the Romans hasten from the captured nearer camp to the other camp that news of the disaster could not anticipate them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But there, the farther it was from their enemy, and since some had scattered just before daylight to bring in fodder and firewood and booty, the more neglect and disorder did they find everywhere; only stacked arms at the outposts, the soldiers unarmed, either sitting and lying on the ground or strolling outside the wall and the gates. Against these men, so care-free and regardless of order, the Romans, who were still fired by their recent battle and made confident by victory, went into battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so no resistance whatever could be offered at the gates. Inside the gates there was a rush from every part of the camp at the first shouting and commotion, and a fierce battle began.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It would have lasted long too, had not the sight of the Romans' bloody shields given the Carthaginians evidence of the other disaster and consequently inspired alarm. This terror made them all take to flight, and pouring out wherever a way could be found <pb id="p.493"/> &mdash;except those overtaken by the sword &mdash;they lost<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> possession of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> camp. Thus in a night and a day two camps of the enemy were taken by assault under the command of Lucius
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Marcius. That about thirty-seven thousand of the enemy were slain is the statement of Claudius,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Q. Claudius Quadrigarius, who wrote in the time of Sulla. His history, in at least 23 books, began with the capture of the city by the Gauls. Acilius' Greek history of Rome had begun with the founding of the city. In <date value="-155">155 B.C.</date> Acilius acted as interpreter when the three Greek philosophers, Carneades among them, appeared before the senate.</note> who translated Acilius' annals out of Greek into the Latin language; that about one thousand eight hundred and thirty were captured and a vast amount of booty
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> taken. And in this he says that there was a silver shield weighing a hundred and thirty-seven pounds, bearing the likeness of Hasdrubal
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Barca. Valerius of Antium<note>Valerius, a contemporary of Claudius, wrote a voluminous history from the founding of Rome in upwards of 75 books. Here by exception his figures for the enemy slain are very moderate.</note> relates that one camp was captured, that of Mago, and seven thousand of the enemy slain; that in a second battle they sallied out and fought with Hasdrubal; that ten thousand were slain, four thousand three hundred and thirty
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> captured. Piso<note>L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, the annalist, was consul in <date value="-133">133 B.C.</date> His work, here cited for the last time in the extant Livy, probably consisted of seven books, beginning with the founding of the city.</note> states that five thousand men were slain from an ambush, while Mago was pursuing in disorder our retreating
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> men. In all of them great is the name of Marcius the general. And to his real fame they add even marvels: that as he was speaking a flame burst from his head without his knowledge, causing great alarm among the soldiers who stood around
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> him. They say that as a memorial of his victory over the Carthaginians, down to the burning of the Capitol there was in the temple a shield called the Marcian, bearing a likeness of
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Hasdrubal.<note>Pliny (<hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> XXXV. 14) says this shield hung above the door of the Capitoline temple until the fire of <date value="-84">84 B.C.</date></note> &mdash;Thereafter the situation in Spain was quiet for a long time, since both sides, after receiving and inflicting such losses <pb id="p.495"/>upon each other, hesitated to risk a decisive<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> engagement.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were being done in Spain, it is true that Marcellus, after the capture of Syracuse, had settled matters in general in Sicily with such conscientiousness and honesty that he added not only to his own fame, but also to the dignity of the Roman people. But as regards the adornments of the city, the statues and paintings which Syracuse possessed in abundance, he carried them away to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were spoils of the enemy, to be sure, and acquired by right of war. Yet from that came the very beginning of enthusiasm for Greek works of art and consequently of this general licence to despoil all kinds of buildings, sacred and profane, a licence which finally turned against Roman gods, and first of all against the very temple which was magnificently adorned by Marcellus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For temples dedicated by Marcus Marcellus near the Porta Capena<note>The Temples of Honos and Virtus were outside the gate, on the Appian Way; XXVI. xxxii. 4; XXVII. xxv. 7-9; Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> 28. Dedicated in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> by Marcellus' son; XXIX. xi. 13. In the Temple of Virtus stood the famous <hi rend="italics">sphaera</hi> (orrery) of Archimedes; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Re Publica</hi> I. 21.</note> used to be visited by foreigners on account of their remarkable adornments of that kind; but of these a very small part is still to be seen.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Embassies from nearly all the states in Sicily kept coming to him. As their pleas were different, so was their status. Those who before the capture of Syracuse either had not rebelled or had returned to friendly relations were admitted and honoured as faithful allies. Those whom fear had led to surrender after the capture of Syracuse, as vanquished received terms from the victor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was left to the Romans, however, no small remainder of the war around Agrigentum, namely, Epicydes and Hanno, the surviving commanders in the previous war, and a third new general sent by Hannibal in place of <pb id="p.497"/>Hippocrates. He was of Libyphoenician race, from<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Hippacra,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Hippo Diarrhytus, northwest of Utica, on the coast.</note> and called Muttines by his countrymen, a man of energy who under Hannibal's teaching had mastered all the arts of war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was furnished by Epicydes and Hanno with Numidian auxiliaries, with which he so thoroughly scoured the enemy's lands and sought out allies, in order to retain their loyalty by lending aid to each man at the right
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> moment, that in a short time he filled all Sicily with his name and was the highest hope of those supporting the Carthaginian cause.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so, after being confined until then within the walls of Agrigentum, the Carthaginian general and the Syracusan, emboldened not more by the advice of Muttines than by their confidence in him to go outside the walls, pitched their camp by the river Himera.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When news of this reached Marcellus, he at once set his troops in motion and established himself at a distance of about four miles from the enemy, to wait and see what they were doing or intending.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But Muttines gave no occasion or time for hesitation, or for a plan of action; for he crossed the river and attacked the outposts of the enemy, causing great alarm and confusion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day by an engagement almost in regular form he drove the enemy inside their fortifications. Then he was recalled by a mutiny of the Numidians breaking out in the camp, after about three hundred of them had retired to Heraclea Minoa. On leaving, to pacify and recall these men, he is said to have expressly warned the generals not to engage the enemy in his absence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At that both generals were indignant, especially Hanno, already uneasy because of the man's fame. To think that Muttines, a degenerate African, should set a limit <pb id="p.499"/>for him, a Carthaginian commander, sent by senate<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> and people!
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He prevailed upon the hesitating Epicydes to cross the river and form their battle-line. For if they should wait for Muttines and the fortune of battle should favour, the glory, he said, would unquestionably fall to Muttines.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcellus, thinking it was a veritable outrage for him, a man who had driven Hannibal, backed by his victory at Cannae, from Nola, to yield to these enemies whom he had himself defeated on land and sea, ordered his soldiers to take up their arms in haste and the standard-bearers to set out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As he was drawing up his army, ten Numidians rode out of the enemy's ranks and at full speed up to him, reporting that their countrymen were aroused, first by the mutiny in which
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> three hundred of their number had retired to Heraclea, and then by seeing their commander sent away just on the eve of battle by generals who belittled his reputation, and that in the fight they would remain inactive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A deceitful race kept its promise faithfully. And so the Romans' spirits rose when the message was sent swiftly through the ranks that the enemy had been deserted by his cavalry, which they had particularly dreaded;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> at the same time the enemy were terrified not only because they were having no help from the largest part of their forces, but also by the fear thus aroused that they might themselves be attacked by their own cavalry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly it was no great struggle; the first shout, the first onset, decided the matter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Numidians, having remained motionless on the wings at the beginning of the battle, seeing their men retreating, shared only the flight with them for a short time. When they saw them all making for <pb id="p.501"/>Agrigentum in a panic-stricken column, they<note type="margin">B.C. 212</note> themselves scattered in every direction to the neighbouring cities, fearing a siege. Many thousand men were slain . . . thousand captured, also eight elephants. This was Marcellus' last battle in Sicily; from it he returned as victor to Syracuse.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>By this time the year was nearly at an end. Accordingly the senate at Rome decreed that Publius Cornelius, the praetor,
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> should send a letter to the consuls at Capua, saying that, while Hannibal was far away and there was no decisive action around Capua, one of them, if they thought it best, should come to Rome for the replacement of magistrates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On receiving the letter the consuls arranged between them that Claudius should conduct the elections, and Fulvius remain near Capua.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the consulship Claudius announced the election of Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus and Publius Sulpicius Galba, son of Servius, although he had previously held no curule office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As praetors the following were then elected: Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Gaius Sulpicius, Gaius Calpurnius Piso.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The duties of the city praetor fell to Piso,<note>Evidently the duties of the praetor peregrinus also were assigned to the praetor urbanus, as for the two preceding years; cf. notes on i. 11 and iii. 2.</note> Sicily to Sulpicius, Apulia to Cethegus, Sardinia to Lentulus. As for the consuls, their military authority was continued for one year.</p></div1>

				young Tarentines who had pretended that they were going
				hunting at night, captured the city of Tarentum, except
				the citadel, to which the Roman garrison had fled. The
				Ludi Apollinares were established in accordance with the
				oracles of Marcius, in which the disaster at Cannae had
				been predicted. A successful battle was fought by Quintus
				Fulvius and Appius Claudius, the consuls, against Hanno,
				a general of the Carthaginians. Tiberius Sempronius
				Gracchus, the proconsul, was led into an ambuscade by
				his Lucanian guest-friend and slain by Mago. Centenius
				Paenula, who had served as a centurion, after begging
				the senate to give him an army and promising a victory
				over Hannibal if he gained his request, received eight
				thousand soldiers, was made commander, engaged Hannibal
				in battle-line, and with his army was slain. Capua was
				besieged by Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius, the
				consuls. Gnaeus Fulvius, a praetor, was defeated in a
				battle with Hannibal in which twenty thousand men fell.
				Fulvius himself escaped with two hundred horsemen.
				Claudius Marcellus took Syracuse after two years and bore
				himself as a great man. In that uproar of the captured
				city Archimedes, while intent upon the figures he had
				traced in the dust, was slain. Publius and Gnaeus Scipio
				in Spain met with an unhappy end of their many successes,
				being slain with almost their entire armies in the eighth
				year after they went to Spain. And possession of that
				province would have been lost, had not the remnants of
				the armies been brought together by the bravery and
				activity of Lucius Marcius, a Roman knight, and with his
				encouragement two camps of the enemy been taken by
				storm. About twenty-seven thousand were slain, about
				one thousand eight hundred men and vast booty captured.
				Marcius was named commander.</p></div1>

			<head>The topography of Syracuse</head>
			<p>SYRACUSE is the extreme example of a Greek city
				whose walls for military reasons, and probably for
				no other reasons, enclosed a vastly larger space than
				was required by the actual size of the city. Other
				examples are Priene, Ephesus, Samos, Tarentum,
				Croton; also a number of small and little-known cities
				in Aetolia and Acarnania.<note>Cf.von Gerkan, <hi rend="italics">Griechische St&auml;dteanlagen,</hi> 1924, p. 110; Noack, in <hi rend="italics">Arch&auml;ologischer Anzeiger,</hi> 1916, 215 f.</note> In such cases the desire
				to include some commanding height or heights in
				dangerous proximity to the city led to a conspicuous
				enlargement of the walled circuit. For Syracuse
				no other motive accounts for the Wall of Dionysius,
				enclosing the great triangular plateau to the north
				and northwest of the city. Military operations on
				this elevation during the siege by the Athenian army
				(414-<date value="-413">413 B.C.</date>) had only confirmed the obvious, that
				it was essential to prevent any invader from establishing himself on heights so near the city. Dionysius accordingly extended the city walls so as to
				enclose the entire triangle, from its apex to the
				west, at his fortress of Euryalus, all the way to its
				wide base close to the Ionian Sea, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a distance of
				3 1/2 miles.</p>
			<pb id="p.506"/>
			<p>Thenceforward the entire circuit of the walls of
				Syracuse amounted to 17 miles (English) or 27 km.,
				about 7 km. (4 1/2 miles) more than the Walls of
				Aurelian at Rome, or about 9 km. (5 1/2 miles) more
				than the walls of Alexandria. No one now believes
				that Syracuse at the height of its prosperity had so
				immense a population. The tendency of recent
				estimates is in the opposite direction, due account
				being taken of the agricultural basis on which that
				prosperity rested, and of the constant practice of
				employing mercenaries, so that previous estimates
				based upon the strength of the army are to be
				discarded.<note>Cf. von Gerkan in <hi rend="italics">Deutsche Litteraturzeitung,</hi> 1933, Sp. 1403.</note> </p>
			<p>Maps produced at the beginning of the XVIIth
				century show the entire plateau occupied by streets,
				houses and other buildings, of which no trace can
				be found. They make Epipolae, the Heights, an
				inhabited quarter, though nowhere mentioned as
				such in our sources. They have Achradina stretching away to the northern Wall of Dionysius, quite
				three miles from the southern limit of the same
				quarter on the Porto Grande; and Tycha just inside
				the same north wall and near the Hexapylon. In
				these also they are unsupported by ancient authority.
				From these highly imaginative sheets of Mirabella
				and Cluver have descended the maps in all of our
				atlases, in histories (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Freeman), in special works
				on Syracuse, in editions of Thucydides, Cicero's
				<hi rend="italics">Verrines</hi> and Livy.</p>
			<p><quote>There is no doubt that the population of Syracuse
				never filled up anything like the whole space enclosed by the walls of Dionysius.</quote> So wrote
				<pb id="p.507"/>
				Haverfield fifty years ago.<note><hi rend="italics">Classical Review,</hi> 1889, p. 111.</note> Visitors, more and more numerous, have had steadily increasing doubts with
				regard to the possibility that Epipolae could ever
				have been more than very sparsely inhabited. No
				one who stands on the ruins of Euryalus and looks
				down the length and breadth of that vast isosceles
				triangle, with its base (two miles long from north to
				south) almost reaching the sea, will be easily persuaded that even scattered villas occupied so barren
				and rocky a soil.</p>
			<p>This scepticism, shared by such a master as Orsi,
				has culminated in the studies of the historian, Professor Knud Fabricius, of the University of Copenhagen, published in his <hi rend="italics">Das antike Syrakus</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Klio,</hi>
				Beiheft XXVIII, 1932), with illustrations and a map.
				A model of clear-cut method, this work shows conclusively that Epipolae was never in ancient times
				reckoned one of the quarters of the city; that the
				real city lay to the south of the plateau; that the
				latter was fortified, not for its own sake, but to
				ensure the city against attack from higher ground
				dangerously near; that it becomes necessary to
				revise our maps, to show Tycha and Achradina on
				the lower level south of the quarries.</p>
			<p>Epipolae, frequently mentioned by Thucydides,
				was to his mind simply a height (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> VI. xcvi f.;
				VII. iv), and his <quote>outer city</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> VI. iii) certainly did not extend so far from Ortygia. Livy
				mentions Epipolae in a single chapter (XXV. xxiv),
				calling it at first merely a <hi rend="italics">locus</hi> (&sect; 4), then a <hi rend="italics">pars
					urbis</hi> (&sect; 5); but this does not prove that he classed
				it with the quarters named, probably after Timaeus,
				by Cicero in his list of four <hi rend="italics">urbes</hi> (Insula, Achradina,
				<pb id="p.508"/>
				Tycha, Neapolis&mdash;<hi rend="italics">in Verrem</hi> IV. 119).<note>Strabo's <foreign lang="greek">penta/polis</foreign> (VI. ii. 4) does not necessarily include Epipolae, for he may have listed Temenites in addition to Neapolis. If he did mean Epipolae it does not follow that he really thought of it as a built-up quarter.</note> For as the
				walls belong to Syracuse, any place inside the walls
				is in a loose sense a <hi rend="italics">pars urbis.</hi><note>Cf. XXV. xxv. 2, where Euryalus is <hi rend="italics">in extreme parte urbis</hi>&mdash;too literally interpreted by the mapmakers.</note> To be sure, when
				Marcellus has forced the Hexapylon (xxiv. &sect; 7), we
				read <hi rend="italics">omnibus copiis urbem ingressus,</hi> but only the
				outer works can be meant, for it is from the high
				ground of Epipolae that he has an unobstructed
				view of the city itself in the distance (&sect; 11; cf.
				Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Marcellus</hi> 19. 1).</p>
			<p>Fabricius's demonstration that the heights were
				almost unoccupied has been completely approved by
				such competent authorities as von Gerkan (in
				<hi rend="italics">Deutsche Litteraturzeitung,</hi> 1933, Sp. 1404-07) and
				Ian Richmond (<hi rend="italics">Classical Review,</hi> 1933, pp. 16 f.),
				both of whom are experts on city walls in ancient
				times; also by Libertini (<hi rend="italics">II Mondo Classico,</hi> 1934,
				pp. 29 ff.).</p>
			<p>If, then, there were no inhabited quarters on the
				plateau it becomes necessary to remove Tycha from
				a position near the Hexapylon assigned to it by
				tradition since the Renaissance. The topographers
				have thought that that gate admitted one directly
				to this quarter, and hence placed Tycha just inside
				the northern Wall of Dionysius, adjoining Achradina,
				as they believed, on the east and Epipolae on the
				south and west. If Livy, however, is correct (XXV.
				xxiv. 4) the six-fold gate did not give entrance to
				Tycha but to Epipolae, and nothing proves that Tycha
				<pb id="p.509"/>
				was anywhere near the gate. No archaeological
				evidence supports the supposition that this quarter
				(a populous section according to Cicero, <hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> with
				several temples and a gymnasium), was more than
				two miles from the centre of the city, or even on
				the plateau at all. The most that we can be said to
				know is that those who entered Dionysius' Hexapylon came to Tycha before they could reach the
				gates of Achradina (XXIV. xxi. 7). No clue is given
				as to the distance, nor does Thucydides even mention
				Tycha.</p>
			<p>A further consequence of Fabricius's demonstration that no quarters of the city were on the plateau
				is the necessary reduction&mdash;a great reduction&mdash;in
				the area assigned to Achradina. Haverfield seems
				to have been the first to suggest that Achradina was
				merely <quote>the lower ground between Ortygia and
					Epipolae</quote> (<hi rend="italics">I.c.</hi>). This view abandoned <quote>upper
						Achradina</quote> (a modern term), extending northward
				to the sea near Livy's Portus Trogilorum (Trogilos),
				and no opinion was expressed as to the situation of
				a northern wall for the diminished quarter. Probably Haverfield would have looked for such a line of
				defence just above the series of quarries (Q, Q on
				our map).</p>
			<p>Fabricius accepts this reduction in principle, but
				brings the northern limit of Achradina still further
				south. For it is to the <hi rend="italics">north</hi> of Achradina, and extending only as far as the quarries, that he finds a
				place for Tycha, thus made to adjoin Neapolis on
				the west. Both of these quarters directly adjoined
				Achradina, which Plutarch describes as <quote>the
					strongest, most beautiful and largest part,</quote> adding
				that <quote>it had been fortified on the side towards the
					<pb id="p.510"/>
					outer city, one part of which they call Neapolis, and
					another Tyche</quote> (<hi rend="italics">Marcellus,</hi> L.C.L., by Perrin, 18. 4).</p>
			<p>This wall separating the quarters just named has
				been understood to mean the so-called <quote>Wall of
					Gelon</quote> (this unwarranted name only since 1839).
				But Fabricius (p. 14) has shown that it is not a wall;
				that it shows no signs of ever having been prolonged
				to north or south of its 700 metres; that it was, in
				fact, a quarry. Hence nothing survives to indicate
				that Achradina was vastly larger than the three
				other quarters, or that Tycha lay to the <hi rend="italics">west</hi> of any
				part of it.</p>
			<p>The new position assigned by the Danish scholar
				to Tycha, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> directly north of a much-diminished
				Achradina, has been accepted on our map, not without some hesitation. Difficulties remain in accounting for the complete disappearance both of the north
				wall of Tycha, perhaps just above the <hi rend="italics">latomie,</hi> and
				of another more or less parallel wall, still stronger,
				which separated these two quarters from each other,
				at a distance of perhaps half a mile south of the
				quarries. But any other position for Tycha involves
				greater difficulties. Further studies will probably
				bring confirmation of the main proposition, and it
				must be at once granted that a long step in advance
				has been taken by Professor Fabricius.<note>Hochholzer's <hi rend="italics">Zur Geographie des antiken Syrakus</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Klio,</hi> 1936, pp. 164 ff.) agrees substantially with Fabricius, not without some confusion, and adds little to our purpose.</note> </p>
