					<p>THE completion of this VIIIth volume closes a longstanding gap between the early years of the Second
						Punic War and the beginning of the Fourth Decade
						in Vol. IX, published in 1935. Events narrated in
						Books XXVIII-XXX fall within the years 207-<date value="-201">201 B.C.</date> A few chapters only in Book XXVIII are given
						to campaigns in Greece against Philip, much more
						space to Scipio's success in driving the Carthaginians
						out of Spain, not without a mutiny in his own army;
						and in the next year comes the threat of another
						invasion of Italy, this time by Mago from the Ligurian
						coast. Book XXIX, completing the conquest of
						Spain, includes the introduction of the worship of
						Cybele, the brutal treatment of Locri by Pleminius,
						Scipio's sailing from Sicily, his landing on African
						soil, together with a digression on the adventures of
						Masinissa in exile. In Book XXX we have preliminary engagements resulting in defeat for Hasdrubal son of Gisgo, and in captivity for Syphax,
						with a tragic end for Sophoniba; then the failure of
						Mago's plans, followed by his death on shipboard;
						Hannibal's departure at last from Italy and landing
						in Africa; the disastrous <quote>Battle of Zama,</quote> and his
						flight to the coast; finally the peace, and Scipio's
						return in triumph to Rome-a triumph for which
						Livy can spare but two words of description. So ends
						the Third Decade.</p>
					<pb n="viii"/>
					<p>The publishers of the <hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi>
						have again kindly permitted us to base several maps
						upon theirs in Vols. VIII and IX, with such alterations
						as were required for our purposes. As for Africa
						and Numidia, the campaign of 1943 has so stimulated
						interest in the geography of Tunisia that it seemed
						only proper to use a map with modern names, many
						of them still fresh in memory, and to add ancient
						names only where required by readers of Livy, or for
						other reasons desirable. We have accordingly depended chiefly upon French originals, military and
						archaeological, including the <hi rend="italics">Atlas arch&eacute;ologique,</hi>
						cited several times in the Appendix. To the Director
						of the American Geographical Society, Dr. John K.
						Wright, we are indebted for the friendly help of a
						specialist. On this map, in place of Livy's unsupported Maesulii for Masinissa's people, we have
						followed the usual practice of substituting the
						Massylii of Polybius, Appian and the <hi rend="italics">Periochae</hi> of
						Livy's Books XXIV, XXVIII, XXIX, reinforced by
						Strabo's <foreign lang="greek">Masuliei=s,</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Masulei=s</foreign> cited from a fragment of Polybius, not to mention poets from Virgil
						to Claudian. It is to be regretted that military
						operations in Tunisia could not have shed some ray of
						light upon the problem of Zama-Margaron-Naraggara, which is here relegated to an Appendix.</p>
					<p>Book 29 has been edited by T. A. Dorey and C. W.F.
						Lydall, Havant, 1968, 1969; a sixth edition of Book 30
						by H. E. Butler and H. Scullard (1939) appeared in
						1954; and a corrected reprint of the Oxford text(1935)
						of Books 26-30, R. S. Conway and S. K. Johnson, in
						1953. <hi rend="italics">The War with Hannibal,</hi> A. deS&eacute;lincourt (Penguin
						Classics, Harmondsworth 1965), is a translation of
						Books 21-30.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>The Manuscripts</head>
					<p><hi rend="italics">P</hi> = codex Puteanus, Paris, Biblioth&eacute;que
						Nationale 5730, 5th century, our principal source for the text of XXI-XXX.
						But as it is defective at the beginning, so
						it fails us at the end of the decade. In
						the closing words of XXX. xxxviii. 2
						this MS. comes abruptly to an end, the
						remainder having been lost as early,
						apparently, as the 11th century, possibly
						earlier. There is a serious lacuna also
						between xxx. 14 and xxxvii. 3 of the
						same book.</p>
					<p>From the Puteanus are descended the following:
						<list><item><hi rend="italics">C</hi> = Colbertinus, Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale
							5731, 10th century.</item>
							<item><hi rend="italics">R</hi> = Romanus, Vatican Library, 9th century.
								This fails us at XXX. v. 7.</item>
							<item><hi rend="italics">M</hi> = Mediceus, Florence, Laurentian Library,
								10th century, ending at XXX. xxvi. 10.</item>
							<item><hi rend="italics">B</hi> = Bambergensis, Bamberg, 11th century.</item>
							<item><hi rend="italics">D</hi> =Cantabrigiensis, Trinity College, Cambridge, 12th century, ending at XXX.

					<pb n="x"/>
					<p>Arabic numbers in parentheses indicate the agreement of MSS. derived from <hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Thus (1) =
						CRMBDA, and (3) = three or more of the same
						list.</p>
					<p>A different text tradition was represented by a
						codex Spirensis, 11th century, now lost with the
						exception of one leaf. This codex was copied from
						a MS. of which some leaves were loose and separated
						from their context. It is known to us from the single
						extant leaf and from many citations of its readings.
						Thus in Books XXVI-XXX we have in addition to
						deal with another tradition of the text:
						<list>
							<item>S = Spirensis, 11th century; now only a single
								folium at Munich, covering XXVIII.
								xxxix. 16 to xli. 12.</item>
							<item><hi rend="italics">Sp</hi> = readings of <hi rend="italics">S</hi> cited by Rhenanus in Froben's
								2nd edition, 1535 (<hi rend="italics">Sp?</hi> if not expressly
								cited).</item>
							<item><hi rend="italics">Ta</hi> two folia no longer extant of book XXIX
								from a Turin palimpsest of the 5th
								century; cf. Vol. VII, p. x. Insignificant as these fragments are, they carry
								us back six centuries earlier than <hi rend="italics">S.</hi></item></list>
					</p>
					<p>Some of the MSS. derived from <hi rend="italics">P</hi> were altered or
						supplemented by scribes who had compared another
						MS. descended from <hi rend="italics">S.</hi> Hence <hi rend="italics">A3</hi> and <hi rend="italics">N3</hi> will
						indicate changes thus made (14th and 13th century
						respectively).</p>
					<p>Corrections thought to be by the original scribe
						are marked <hi rend="italics">e.g.: P</hi>1, those by later hands: <hi rend="italics">p</hi>2, <hi rend="italics">P3</hi>,
						etc.; corrections which cannot be thus distinguished:
						<hi rend="italics">Px</hi> (chiefly deletions); and so for other MSS.</p>
					<pb n="xi"/>
					<p>Of MSS. partly derived from <hi rend="italics">P</hi> and partly from <hi rend="italics">S</hi>
						two are cited, both of the 15th century and in the

					<p><hi rend="italics">J</hi> = Burneianus 198, and <hi rend="italics">K</hi> = Harleianus

					<p>Further to be noted are:

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHILE the passage of Hasdrubal,<note>Hasdrubal's attempt to aid his brother Hannibal by a second invasion of Italy had ended in disaster at the Metaurus; XXVII. xlvii. ff. The narrative now reverts to Spain, where a third brother, Mago, was in command of an army.</note> by shifting<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> the war to Italy, was felt to have lightened in proportion the burden for Spain, suddenly a war as dangerous as the former broke out again in that country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Spanish territory was at that time occupied by Romans and Carthaginians as follows:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hasdrubal son of Gisgo had retired all the way to the Ocean and Gades; the coast of Our Sea and nearly all of Spain facing eastward were under Scipio and Roman rule;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> a new commander, Hanno,<note>When a second descent upon Italy was first planned nine years earlier, Hasdrubal had urged the authorities at Carthage to send out another army with a general to take his place in Spain; XXIII. xxvii. 12. A new commander has now arrived, but this Hanno is soon captured and sent to Rome; ii. 11; iv. 4.</note> as successor to Hasdrubal Barca had crossed over from Africa with a new army, and uniting with Mago, had promptly armed men in large numbers in Celtiberia, which lies directly between the two seas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whereupon Scipio sent Marcus Silanus<note>Cf. XXVI. xix. 10; XXVII. vii. 17; xxii. 7.</note> with not more than ten thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry against Hanno. Silanus made his marches as long <pb id="p.5"/>as possible, being hampered, however, both by rough<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> roads and narrow passes frequently hemmed in by wooded mountains, as is usual in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless he outstripped not only messengers reporting his approach but even rumours of it, and guided by deserters from the same Celtiberia he made his way to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From the same informants it was learned, when they were about ten miles from the enemy, that there were two camps, one on each side of the road along which they were moving; that, on the left lay the Celtiberians, a new army, over nine thousand men, on the right the Carthaginian camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that this was strongly defended by outposts, sentries and all the protection usual in the field, while the other camp was lax and carelessly guarded, as belonging to barbarians who were raw recruits and less afraid because they were in their own country.</p> 
				<p>Silanus, thinking this camp must be attacked first, ordered the standards to move as far to the left as possible, for fear he might be seen from somewhere by the Carthaginian outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He sent scouts in advance and himself proceeded towards the enemy with a swiftly moving column. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He was some three miles away when not one of the enemy had yet noticed them; a rugged terrain and brush-covered hills kept them concealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There in a deep valley that was consequently unseen he bade his soldiers sit down and take food. Meantime came the scouts confirming the deserters' reports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the Romans piled their light baggage in the centre, took up their arms and advanced to fight in regular line of battle. They were a mile away when they were seen by the enemy, who suddenly began to show alarm. Mago too, leaving his <pb id="p.7"/>camp at the first shouting and uproar, rode up at a<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> gallop. In the army of the Celtiberians there were four thousand men with long shields and two hundred horsemen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This complete legion &mdash;and they were the best of his troops &mdash;was placed in the front line. The rest, the light-armed, he posted as reserves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While he was leading the men in that order out of their camp and they had scarcely got beyond the rampart, the Romans hurled their javelins at them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Spaniards squatted down to meet the enemy's volley; then they in turn rose to hurl their weapons. After the Romans in dense array, as usual, had received these on their shields held close together, men fought at close quarters and began to use swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the roughness of the ground made nimbleness of no use to the Celtiberians, whose custom it is to be skirmishers in battle, and at the same time it was not unfavourable for the Romans, accustomed to a static order of battle, except that restricted spaces and intervening thickets broke up their ranks, and they
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> were forced to engage now singly, now in couples, as though with men paired against them. Whatever hampered the flight of the enemy exposed them to slaughter, as if they were fettered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And now that nearly all the Celtiberian heavy infantry had been slain, the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> light-armed and the Carthaginians who had come to their aid from the other camp were being routed and cut down. Not more than two thousand infantry and all the cavalry escaped with Mago almost at the beginning of the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hanno, the second in command, was captured alive with those who had been the last to arrive when the battle was nearly over. Almost all the cavalry and such old soldiers as there were in the infantry <pb id="p.9"/>followed Mago in flight and on the tenth day reached<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Hasdrubal<note>The son of Gisgo, mentioned just above, i. 2; cf. iii. 3.</note> in the region of Gades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The newly recruited Celtiberians slipped away into the neighbouring forests and thence scattered to their homes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>This very timely victory had made a sudden end, not so much indeed of the war already in progress, as of the resources for some subsequent war, had it been possible for the Carthaginians, after calling out the Celtiberian nation, to entice other tribes also to take up arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Accordingly Scipio praised Silanus in generous terms and cherished the hope of ending the war if only he should not retard the fulfilment by his own delaying. Aiming to finish what remained of the war he proceeded into the farthest part of Spain against Hasdrubal. The Carthaginian, in order to ensure the loyalty of his allies, had his camp at that time, as it happened, in Baetica.<note>Here not the later (Augustan) province of that name, but a vague term for the southernmost part of Spain, including Gades and most of the valley of the Baetis (Guadalquivir).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Nevertheless he suddenly took up his standards and with the appearance of a flight rather than of a march led his men all the way to the Ocean and Gades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> But before taking ship along the strait to Gades, thinking he would be the object of attack so long as he kept his army together, he scattered his entire force among the cities in every direction, that they might defend themselves by walls and at the same time defend walled cities by their arms.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, observing that the field of operations was widely extended, and that to attack the cities one after another would be a protracted task, if not a great one, turned back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not to leave the region, however, to the enemy, he sent his brother Lucius <pb id="p.11"/>Scipio with ten thousand infantry and a thousand<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> cavalry to besiege the wealthiest city in that country &mdash;Orongis<note>Probably the same as Auringis (or Aurinx) in Andalusia; XXIV. xlii. 5.</note> the barbarians called it. It is situated in the territory of the Maesesses,<note>Mention of silver mining places this lesser tribe in the mountains, while the Bastetani proper occupied the south coast.</note> a Bastetanian tribe. Its land is fruitful; the inhabitants mine silver also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That city had been a stronghold for Hasdrubal in making-raids among the tribes of the interior.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Scipio pitched his camp near the city and before investing it sent men up to the gates to sound the inhabitants by speaking to them from a short distance, urging them to test the friendship of the Romans rather than their power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When no peaceable replies were forthcoming, he surrounded the city with a trench and a double earthwork and divided his army into three parts, so that one third should always be attacking while two thirds in the meantime were resting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the first third essayed an attack there was, to be sure, a fierce battle and indecisive. It was not easy to come near the walls for the shower of missiles, nor to bring up ladders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some who had succeeded in raising their ladders against the walls were pushed down by forks made for that very purpose, others had iron grappling-hooks lowered upon them from above, so that they were in danger of being caught up and dragged to the top of the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When Scipio noted that owing to the greatly inferior number of his men the struggle was evenly balanced, and that the enemy had an advantage already in fighting from the wall, he attacked the city with two thirds of his men at the same time, having recalled the first third.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This <pb id="p.13"/>inspired so much alarm among men already spent in<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> fighting with the first to attack them that the townsmen in sudden flight abandoned the walls and for fear the city had been betrayed the Carthaginian garrison also left their posts and gathered in one place.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Then the men of the town were possessed by the fear that, if the enemy should enter the city, those whom they happened to meet anywhere would be slain with no distinction between Carthaginian and Spaniard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly they suddenly opened a gate and dashed out of the town in large numbers, holding their shields in front of them for fear weapons might be hurled at long range, but displaying their right hands empty, so that it should be clear that they had thrown away their swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Whether this was not seen owing to distance, or whether some ruse was suspected, has not been ascertained. The Romans, making an attack upon the deserters, cut them down like an opposing battle-line; and by the same gate hostile units entered the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Elsewhere also gates were being hewed to pieces and broken open with hatchets and pickaxes, while a cavalryman on entering would ride ahead at full speed to seize the forum; for such were their orders. A detachment of <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi><note>The seasoned infantry, here on special duty, not in the formal battle line with its <hi rend="italics">ordines</hi> (as in XXVI. xlvi. 7). Cf. VIII. viii. 9ff.; x. 5; Polybius VI. xxi. 7ff.</note> also had been assigned to support the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The legionaries made their way through the other quarters of the city. They refrained from plundering and from slaying those they met, except when men defended themselves with arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Carthaginians were all put under guard, also about three hundred of the citizens who had closed the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The town was handed over to the rest and their property restored. About two thousand of the <pb id="p.15"/>enemy were slain in the siege of the city, of the<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Romans not more than ninety.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The storming of that city brought joy not only to those who took part in the exploit but also to the commander-in-chief and the rest of his army; and the troops made their approach an impressive sight, as they drove before them a great crowd of captives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio warmly praised his brother, with the highest possible compliment placing his capture of Orongis on the same level as his own capture of (New) Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thereupon, and because winter was at hand, so that he was unable either to attack Gades or to follow up Hasdrubal's army, widely scattered throughout the province, he led all his forces back into Hither Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After sending the legions away to their winter quarters and his brother Lucius Scipio to Rome, and with him Hanno,<note>See p. 3, n. 2.</note> a general of the enemy, and the rest of the noble captives, he himself retired to Tarraco.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The same year a Roman fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus, the proconsul, was sent over from Sicily to Africa, and in the territory of Utica and Carthage they ravaged the country far and wide. Along the edge of the Carthaginian territory, close to the very walls of Utica, booty was carried off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On their return voyage to Sicily a Carthaginian fleet of seventy warships encountered them. Seventeen of these were captured, four sunk at sea, the rest of the fleet routed and put to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Victorious on land and sea, the Romans returned with ample plunder of every kind to Lilybaeum. Thereafter, as the sea was safe in consequence of the discomfiture of the enemy's ships, great supplies of grain were brought to Rome.</p> <pb id="p.17"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the summer in which these<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> events took place<note>Since Roman progress in Greece had been slow Livy is summarizing events of 208 and <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> in that theatre under the latter year. Cf. XXVII. xxix. 9 ff. (Vol. VII. p. 330, n. 2). Polybius is the source (X. xli. f.) for the events which follow.</note> Publius Sulpicius, the proconsul, and King Attalus, after wintering at Aegina, as has been stated above,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> XXVII. xxxiii. 5.</note> sailed across to Lemnus with their combined fleets, twenty-five Roman and thirty-five royal quinqueremes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And Philip, to be prepared for every effort of the enemy, whether he must be met on land or on sea, came down himself to the sea at Demetrias<note>At the north end of the Sinus Pagasaeus (Demetriacus in &sect;18), it was the chief trade centre of Thessaly; cf. Vol. VII. p. 342, n. 2.</note> and appointed a day for the army to assemble at Larisa. From his allies all around deputations gathered at Demetrias on the first report of the king's coming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the Aetolians in consequence of their alliance with the Romans, and particularly after the arrival of Attalus,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> had been emboldened and were laying waste their neighbours' lands. And not only were the Acarnanians and Boeotians and the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> inhabitants of Euboea greatly alarmed but also the Achaeans, who in addition to the Aetolian war were further terrified by Machanidas,<note>Cf. XXVII. xxix. 9; below, vii. 17.</note> tyrant of Sparta, who had pitched his camp not far from the Argive frontier. All these delegations stated the dangers impending by land and sea for their several cities and were imploring the aid of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even from his own kingdom the report was of no peaceful conditions: that Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus had taken the field;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> also that of the Thracians the Maedi<note>Between Thrace and Paeonia, in the upper valley of the Strymon and eastward; XXVI. xxv. 6, 8.</note> in particular were ready to invade the nearest part of Macedonia if some distant war should <pb id="p.19"/>engage the king's attention.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In fact the Boeotians<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> and inland Greek states reported that the pass of Thermopylae,<note>Cf. vii. 3; Strabo IX. iv. 12 ff.</note> where a narrow entrance hems in the road, was being closed with a ditch and an earthwork by the Aetolians, that it might not allow Philip a passage in order to defend the cities of his allies.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Even a general lacking in spirit might have been aroused by so many alarms from all sides. Philip sent the deputations away with a promise that he would lend aid to them all as time and circumstances might permit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As the urgency of the moment required, he sent to Pepar&emacr;thus a garrison for the city,<note>Of the same name as the island, and destroyed by Philip; XXXI. xxviii. 6.</note> from which had come the news that Attalus, sending his fleet over from Lemnus, had ravaged all the country round the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philip sent Polyphantas with a force of moderate size into Boeotia; also one of his own generals, Menippus, to Chalcis with a thousand peltasts, whose shield is not unlike the <hi rend="italics">caetra.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Five hundred of the Agrianes<note>Paeonian auxiliaries (archers) of the Macedonians; XXXIII. xviii. 9; Thucydides II. 96; Polybius II. lxv; X. xlii. 3; Strabo VII. fr. 36 f.</note> were added, to enable Menippus to protect all parts of the island. The king himself set out for Scotussa and ordered that the Macedonian troops should march across from Larisa to the same place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There the report reached him that a council had been appointed for the Aetolians at Heracl&emacr;a,<note>Above Thermopylae, to the west of the pass and commanding the road to it; XXXVI. xvi. 4 f.; xxii. 1, 4 f.; Thuc.

					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> King Attalus would attend for a consultation on the issues of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> To break up this gathering by his sudden arrival Philip led his men by forced marches to Heracl&emacr;a. He arrived indeed after the <pb id="p.21"/>council had been dismissed; but he destroyed crops<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> which were now almost ripe, especially along the Gulf of the Aenianes,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi>the Sinus Maliacus (XXVII. xxx. 3), for the Aenianes lay to the west of that gulf.</note> and led his troops back to Scotussa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> There he left the whole army and with his cohort of guards returned to Demetrias. From there, in order that he might meet every movement of his enemies, he sent men into Phocis and Euboea and to Peparethus, to select heights from which signal fires might be visible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For himself he placed a watch-tower on Mount Tisaeus,<note>Plainly visible from Demetrias across the gulf. The height of the mountain is 2112 ft. Cf. Polybius X. xlii. 7.</note> whose peak rises to a great height, so that by fires<note>For signalling by fires cf. XXIX. vi. 8, 10.

The Romans seem to have made no use of so elaborate a system; cf.

				<p>The Roman commander and King Attalus crossed from Peparethus to Nicaea.<note>A stronghold of the Eastern Locrians and a seaport 2 1/2 miles east of Thermopylae; XXXII. xxxii. 9; xxxv. 2; Polybius X. xlii. 4; XVIII. vii. 8; Strabo IX. iv. 13.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> From there they sailed over to Euboea in their fleet and to the city of Oreum,<note>Cf. XXXI. xlvi. 6 if.; Strabo X. i. 3 if. Earlier it had been called Histiaea.</note> which is the first of the cities of Euboea situated on the left as one coming from the Gulf of Demetrias steers towards Chalcis and the Euripus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Between Attalus and Sulpicius it was agreed that the Romans should attack from the sea, the king's forces from the land. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In four days after the fleet came in they attacked the city. That time was spent in secret conversations with Plator, who had been put in command of the city by Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The place has two citadels, one overhanging the sea; the other is in the centre of the city. From it a road leads down to the sea through a tunnel, and at <pb id="p.23"/>the seaward end a tower having fie stories, a<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> remarkable defensive work, used to close the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There at first a very fierce engagement began, for the tower was provided with missiles of every kind, while artillery also and engines had been landed from the ships for an attack upon it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When that conflict had diverted the attention and the eyes of all, Plator admitted the Romans through a gate in the citadel by the sea, and in an instant the citadel was seized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The citizens being repulsed hastened to the heart of the city and the other citadel; and men had been posted there to close the gates. Being thus shut out they were surrounded and slain or captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Macedonian garrison stood in a mass under the wall of the citadel, having neither taken to flight in disorder nor gone into battle with determination.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Plator, having gained permission from Sulpicius, embarked his men and landed them at Demetrium<note>Two and a half miles from Thebae Phthiotides and named from a temple of Demeter. It was known also as Pyrasus; Strabo IX. v. 14.</note> in Phthiotis, while he himself joined Attalus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Sulpicius, inspired by a success so easily won at Oreum, sailed thence with his victorious fleet directly to Chalcis, where the result by no means matched his expectation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The sea, which from a wide expanse on both sides is narrowed into a strait, might give one at first sight the appearance of a double harbour facing two entrances. But hardly any other anchorage is more dangerous for a fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For sudden, squally winds blow down from very high mountains on either shore, and also the Euripus strait itself does not reverse its direction seven times a day at <pb id="p.25"/>fixed times,<note>This is the statement of Strabo <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> ii. 8 and Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> II. 219. Regularity is stressed by Cicero <hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> III. 24, without giving the number of times daily. But the irregularity was proverbial; Plato <hi rend="italics">Phaedo</hi> 90 C. In actual fact the real tides are perfectly regular, with four changes daily, while in a strait so narrow very marked irregularities are due to secondary causes, chiefly winds.</note> as report has it, but with a current that<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> like the wind changes irregularly, now this way, now that, it races along as a torrent dashes down from a steep mountain. Thus neither by night nor by day are ships given rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not only was the anchorage into which the fleet came so dangerous, but in addition the town was strong and impregnable, being protected on one side by the sea, on the other side, towards the land, extraordinarily fortified and secured by a strong garrison and in particular by the loyalty of its commanders and leading citizens, a quality which at Oreum had been uncertain and delusive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was wise on the part of the Roman, considering his rash undertaking, that after surveying the difficulties, in order not to waste time for nothing, he promptly gave up the attempt and with his fleet crossed over to Cynus in Locris, the mart of the city of Opus, which is situated a mile from the sea.<note>Nearly two miles from the sea according to Strabo IX. iv. 2, and less than eight east of its port, Cynus. Opus was the chief city of the Eastern (Opuntian) Locrians.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip had been warned also by fire-signals from Oreum, but through the treachery of Plator they were set too late on the watch-tower. Also, since he was no match in naval strength, approach to the island by a fleet was not easy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He let slip that project by delaying, and, on receiving the signal accordingly, set out with spirit to bring aid to Chalcis. For although Chalcis is likewise a city of the same island, still it is separated by a strait so narrow that the city is linked to the mainland by a bridge, and approach by land is easier than by sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly Philip <pb id="p.27"/>hastened from Demetrias to Scotussa, whence he set<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> out in the third watch, dislodged the garrison and routed the Aetolians occupying the pass of Thermopylae. Then after driving the enemy in alarm into Heracl&emacr;a, he himself in a single day covered a distance of more than sixty miles to Elat&imacr;a<note>The largest city of Phocis, commanding roads from the north coast and Thermopylae; Strabo IX. iii. 2, 15.</note> in Phocis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On about the same day the captured city of Opus was being sacked by King Attalus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Its booty had been given up to the king by Sulpicius because Oreum<note>The name is always masculine in our Greek sources.</note> had been sacked by Roman soldiers a few days before, while the king's troops had no share in it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the Roman fleet had returned to Oreum, Attalus, unaware of the coming of Philip, was spending his time in exacting money from leading citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so unexpected was the attack that if some of the Cretans, who happened to have gone a long distance from the city to forage, had not caught sight of the enemy's column in the distance, the king could have been overpowered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Attalus' men, being unarmed and in disorder, rushed pellmell to the sea and their ships; and as they were struggling to cast off, Philip came upon them and from the shore caused further confusion among the sailors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then he returned to Opus, accusing gods and men because he had lost so great an opportunity, snatched away almost before his eyes. The men of Opus also were no less angrily upbraided because, although they could have dragged out the siege until his coming, at the first sight of the enemy they had almost willingly surrendered.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><pb id="p.29"/>
				<p>Having settled matters in the neighbourhood of<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> Opus, he went to Thronium.<note>More than two miles from the sea (Strabo IX. iv. 4), this ancient town was high-perched at the west end of Mt. Cnemis. Hence the Locrians of this region were called Epicnemidian.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Attalus also retired at first to Oreum; and then, when the report reached him that Prusias, King of Bithynia, had crossed into territory belonging to his kingdom, he sailed over to Asia, forsaking the Roman cause and the Aetolian war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And Sulpicius withdrew with his fleet to Aegina, from which he had set out at the beginning of the spring. Philip captured Thronium with no greater struggle than Attalus had in capturing Opus. The inhabitants of the former were refugees from Thebes<note>A very ancient and important city of Achaia Phthiotis, on a ridge above its port, Pyrasus, two miles away on the Sinus Pagasaeus; Strabo IX. v. 14.</note> in Phthiotis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When their city was taken by Philip they had sought refuge in the protection of the Aetolians, whereupon the Aetolians had given them an abiding-place in that city, desolated and abandoned in a previous war with the same Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then setting out from Thronium, which he had recovered, as has just been said, he captured Tithronion and Drumiae, small and unimportant towns in Doris. Then he came to Elat&imacr;a, having bidden the envoys of Ptolemy and of the Rhodians<note>Cf. XXVII. xxx. 4.</note> to wait for him there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> While they were there discussing how to end the Aetolian war &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> the envoys had recently been present at the council of the Romans and Aetolians at Heracl&emacr;a<note>Cf. v. 13 f.</note> &mdash;came the news that Machanidas had decided to attack the Eleans, who were making ready to celebrate the Olympic Games.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> those of the year <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date>; cf. XXVII. xxxv. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Thinking he must make that his first task, the king <pb id="p.31"/>sent away the envoys with a friendly answer: that<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> he had not been the cause of this war, and would not delay making peace, provided it was possible to do so on fair and honourable terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Setting out with a light column he came down through Boeotia to Megara and then to Corinth, from which he took on supplies and marched to Phl&imacr;us and Phen&#x0115;us.<note>Phl&imacr;us lay south-west of Corinth; Phen&#x0115;us farther west, near a lake of the same name, at the foot of Mt. Cyllene in north-eastern Arcadia.</note> And when he had already reached Heraea,<note>In western Arcadia, on the river Alph&emacr;us and the road to Olympia. It still belonged to the Macedonian king. Cf. Pausanias 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxvi.</note> he heard that Machanidas, alarmed by the report of his coming, had fled back to Sparta. Thereupon the king went to Aegium for the council of the Achaeans, at the same time thinking that there he would find the Carthaginian fleet which he had summoned that he might be able to accomplish something by sea as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A few days earlier the Carthaginians had crossed over to the Ox&emacr;ae,<note>The Ox&emacr;ae were small western islands off the mouth of the Achel&omacr;us and opposite Cephallenia. They formed the southernmost group of the Echinades archipelago. Cf. Strabo VIII. iii. 26 <hi rend="italics">fin.;</hi> X. ii. 19.</note> and then had made for the Acarnanian ports, on hearing that Attalus and the Romans had set sail from Oreum. They were afraid they might be pursued and overpowered inside of Rhium,<note>Properly the Headland on the south side of the strait, and its counterpart, Antirrhium, on the Aetolian side, marking the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth; Thuc. II. 86; Strabo VIII. ii. 3; Pausanias VII. xxii. 10 (Frazer). Also at times of the strait itself; so Livy here and in XXVII. xxix. 9.</note> the narrows, that is, of the Gulf of Corinth.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>VIII. Philip was sorry indeed and vexed that, although he had himself made rapid marches in every direction, nevertheless he had not met a single situation at the right moment, and that fortune had mocked his speed by whisking everything out of his sight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the council, however, concealing his vexation, he made a proud speech, calling gods and men <pb id="p.33"/>to witness that at no place or time had he failed to<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> hasten with all possible speed to any place where the din of enemies' arms had been heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But it could scarcely be made out, he said, whether his audacity in carrying on the war was the greater, or his enemies' eagerness to run away. So from Opus Attalus had slipped out of his hands, so had Sulpicius from Chalcis, so in those very days had Machanidas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But not always was flight successful, nor must that be accounted a difficult war in which you are the victor if you have merely made contact with the enemy. What was of most significance, he said, he had the confession of his enemies that they were by no means his equals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Soon he would likewise have no uncertain victory, and they would fight against him with a result no better than they had hoped.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The allies rejoiced when they listened to the king. Thereupon he delivered Heraea and Triphylia<note>Not actually given back to Achaia until <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date>; XXXII. v. 4. Cf. Strabo VIII. iii. 3. For Heraea cf. p. 30, n. 2. Triphylia lay south of the Alph&emacr;us, and reached the sea on the west.</note> to the Achaeans, but restored Aliph&emacr;ra<note>In Arcadia, near the border of Triphylia; XXXII. l.c.; Pausanias VIII. xxvi. 5-7.</note> to Megalopolis, because the citizens of the latter gave sufficient proofs that it had belonged to their territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then on receiving ships-they were three quadriremes and as many biremes-from the Achaeans, he sailed over to Anticyra.<note>The Locrian Anticyra, near the entrance to the Gulf; cf. Vol. VII. p. 100, n.</note> From there he set sail with seven quinqueremes and more than twenty light vessels previously sent by him into the Gulf of Corinth to be added to the Carthaginian fleet, and made a landing at <pb id="p.35"/>Erythrae,<note>A seaport of the Ozolian Locrians, on the north shore of the Gulf, but at this time belonging to the Aetolians. Inland and to the north lay Eupalium.</note> in Aetolia and near Eupalium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He did<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> not surprise the Aetolians, for all the men who were either on the farms or in the nearest strongholds, Potidania<note>Mentioned by Thucydides III. 96; along the upper course of the Daphnus river, north-west of Anticyra and Erythrae. Not far away was a similar stronghold, Apollonia, not to be confused with any of the better-known Apollonias.</note> and Apollonia, fled into the forests and the mountains. Sheep and goats which in their haste could not be driven away were seized and loaded on the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> With these and the rest of the booty Nicias, chief magistrate of the Achaeans, was sent to Aegium; and when the king had reached Corinth, he ordered his land forces to march from there overland across Boeotia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He himself sailing from Cenchreae along the coast of Attica round Sunium, almost through the midst of enemy fleets, came to Chalcis. Then, after praising their loyalty and courage, in that neither fear nor hope had swayed their spirit, and encouraging them to remain his allies with the same steadfastness for the future, if they preferred their own lot to that of the men of Oreum and Opus, he sailed from Chalcis to Oreum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then entrusting the government and defence of the city to leading citizens who had preferred to flee after the capture of the city rather than to surrender to the Romans, he himself crossed over from Euboea to Demetrias, from which he had first set out to bring aid to his allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At Cassandr&imacr;a<note>On the Chalcidic Peninsula; formerly called Potidaea, but rebuilt by Cassander (founder of Thessalonica also) in <date value="-316">316 B.C.</date> Cf. XLIV. xi. 2.</note> he then laid down the keels of a hundred war-ships and brought together a great number of ship-carpenters to complete the task. Having done so, inasmuch as peaceful conditions had been produced in Greece both by the departure of Attalus and by the timely aid which he <pb id="p.37"/>had himself borne to his distressed allies, he withdrew<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> into his own kingdom in order to wage war against the Dardanians.<note>For their threatened invasion cf. XXVII. xxxii. 9; xxxiii. 1.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the end of the summer in which these events took place in Greece, Quintus Fabius Maximus the son, as an emissary of Marcus Livius, the consul, reported to the senate at Rome that the consul considered Lucius Porcius with his legions a sufficient defence for Gaul, his own assignment;<note>The undefined region meant by Gallia was often called Ager Gallicus, or merely suggested by the town-name Ariminum. There was no province then in the sense comparable to' province of Sardinia.' Cf. Vol. VI. p. 315 and n. 2; below, x. 12; xxxviii. 13; XXIX, xiii. 2; XXX. i. 7.</note> that he himself could retire from it and his consular army could be withdrawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon the senators ordered that not merely Marcus Livius but also his colleague Gaius Claudius should return to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The only difference in the decree was that they ordered the return of the army of Marcus Livius, but that Nero's legions facing Hannibal should remain in that province. Between the consuls an agreement was made by letter that, just as they had carried on the war with one purpose only, so, although coming from opposite directions, they should approach the city at one and the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whichever should first reach Praeneste was instructed to wait for his colleague there. It chanced that both reached Praeneste on the same day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From there they sent in advance an edict that three days later the senate should meet with full attendance in the Temple of Bellona;<note>This temple stood below the Citadel and near the east end of the Flaminian Circus. Being outside the pomerium it was used by the senate when returning generals were to present their claims to a triumph; also when foreign ambassadors were to be received. Cf. xxxviii. 2; XXVI. xxi. 1; XXX. xxi. 12; XLII. xxxvi. 2.</note> and with the whole populace flocking out to meet them they drew near to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only did everyone in the surrounding crowd greet them, <pb id="p.39"/>but vying with one another in their desire to grasp<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> the victorious right hands of the consuls some were congratulating them, others were offering thanks because by their services the state was safe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the senate after the manner of all commanders-in-chief they stated their achievements and demanded that for a brave and successful conduct of the war honour should be paid to the immortal gods; likewise that they themselves should be permitted to enter the city in triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whereupon the senators replied that they did indeed decree the granting of their demands with due recognition first of the gods, and then next to the gods, of the consuls. After a thanksgiving had been decreed in honour of them both and
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> a triumph also to each, in order that they should not have separate triumphs after conducting the war with a common purpose, they came to an agreement as follows.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Inasmuch as the battle had been fought in the province of Marcus Livius, and on the day of the battle the auspices also, as it happened, had been his,<note>Since the consuls had commanded on alternate days, only one of them had both <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> and auspices on the day of the battle</note> and inasmuch as Livius' army had been brought back to Rome, while Nero's could not be brought back from his province, they agreed between them that Marcus Livius should enter the city in a four-horse chariot with his soldiers following him, and that Gaius Claudius should ride on horseback without his soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>This sharing of the triumph added indeed to the glory of both, but even more so for the one who had yielded to his colleague in honour to the same degree that he surpassed him in his achievement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> That man now on horseback in the space of six days had traversed the whole length of Italy, men kept saying, and had fought, standards against standards, with <pb id="p.41"/>Hasdrubal in Gaul on a day on which Hannibal had<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> believed the consul had his camp established facing his own in Apulia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thus a single consul in defence of both regions of Italy had confronted two armies and two generals, here with his strategy and there in person.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Nero's name had been enough, they said, to keep Hannibal within his camp. As for Hasdrubal, what else than Nero's arrival had overwhelmed and destroyed him?
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Thus let the other consul drive standing erect in a chariot drawn, if he wished, by many horses. The truly triumphant progress through the city was on a single horse; and Nero, even if he went on foot, would be memorable, be it for the glory won in that war, or for his contempt of it in that triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Such was the talk of the spectators who accompanied Nero all the way to the Capitol. As for money, the consuls carried into the Treasury three million sesterces and eighty thousand <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> To his soldiers Marcus Livius apportioned fifty-six <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> apiece. Gaius Claudius promised the same amount to his absent soldiers when he should return to the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> It has been remarked that in the jesting of the soldiers on that day more of their songs were levelled at Gaius Claudius than at their own consul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> that the knights highly extolled Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius, the lieutenant-generals, and urged the commons to elect them consuls for the following year;
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> also that to the knights' preliminary choice the consuls on the next day added their authority by an address to the people, stating what brave and faithful service they had had in particular from their two lieutenants.</p> <pb id="p.43"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Inasmuch as the time for elections was<note type="margin">B.C. 207</note> approaching and it had been decided that the elections should be conducted by a dictator, the consul Gaius Claudius named his colleague Marcus Livius dictator, and Livius named Quintus Caecilius master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consuls elected were announced by Marcus Livius as dictator, namely, Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius, the same being at the time master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the elections of praetors were held. Elected were Gaius Servilius, Marcus Caecilius Metellus, Tiberius Claudius Asellus, Quintus Mamilius Turrinus, who was at the time a plebeian aedile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The elections being completed, the dictator, abdicating his office and discharging his army, set out in accordance with a decree of the senate for Etruria as
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> his province, to conduct an investigation as to what communities among the Etruscans or Umbrians had discussed plans to revolt from the Romans to Hasdrubal upon his arrival, and which states had aided him with auxiliaries or supplies or any kind of assistance. Such were the events at home and in the field that year.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Roman Games were repeated three times completely by the curule aediles, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and Servius Cornelius Lentulus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Likewise the Plebeian Games were completely repeated once by the plebeian aediles, Marcus Pomponius Matho and Quintus Mamilius Turrinus.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Metellus, the land of the Bruttii was assigned by decree to them both as their province, to carry on war with Hannibal. The praetors then received their assignments by lot, Marcus Caecilius Metellus the <pb id="p.45"/>city praetorship, Quintus Mamilius the duties of<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> praetor peregrinus; Gaius Servilius received Sicily and Tiberius Claudius Sardinia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The armies were divided as follows:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> to one of the consuls the army which Gaius Claudius had had as consul in the preceding year, to the other consul that which Quintus Claudius had had as propraetor; and these were of two legions each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In Etruria Marcus Livius as proconsul, with his command continued for one year, was to take the two legions of slave-volunteers from Gaius Terentius, the propraetor;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and it was decreed that Quintus Mamilius, handing over his judicial duties to his colleague,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the city praetor. It was a frequent practice during this war to relieve the praetor peregrinus of his judicial duties so that he might take a command; <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XXV. iii. 2; XXVII. xxxvi. 11; XXX. i. 9; xxvii. 9; xl. 5.</note> should have command of Gaul with the army which Lucius Porcius, the praetor, had commanded; and he was ordered to lay waste the lands of the Gauls who had revolted to the Carthaginians upon the coming of Hasdrubal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The defence of Sicily was given to Gaius Servilius with the two legions from Cannae, just as Gaius Mamilius had held it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From Sardinia the old army which Aulus Hostilius had commanded was withdrawn. A new legion which Tiberius Claudius should take across with him was enrolled by the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Military authority was continued for the year for Quintus Claudius, to have Tarentum as his assignment, and for Gaius Hostilius Tubulus, who was to have Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Marcus Valerius, the proconsul, who had been in charge of the defence of the entire seacoast of Sicily, was ordered to turn over thirty ships to Gaius Servilius, the praetor, and to return to the city with all the rest of his fleet.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the state perturbed by so critical a moment in the war, since men attributed to the gods the causes of everything fortunate and unfortunate, <pb id="p.47"/>many portents were reported: that at Tarracina the<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> temple of Jupiter, at Satricum that of Mater Matuta, had been struck by lightning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The people of Satricum were no less alarmed by two serpents that glided into the temple of Jupiter, actually through the doorway.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both orders were carried out in accordance with the decree of the senate. More terrifying to men than all the prodigies, whether reported from outside or seen in the city, was the extinction of the fire in the Temple of Vesta; and the Vestal who had been on duty that night was scourged by order of Publius Licinius, the pontifex.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> pontifex maximus, elected in <date value="-212">212 B.C.</date>; XXV. v. 2-4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although the thing had happened without a portent from the gods but by a mortal's negligence, it was nevertheless decided that it should be expiated by full-grown victims and that a day of prayer at the Temple of Vesta should be observed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Before the consuls should leave for the field they were reminded by the senate that they should take care to restore the common people to their farms. By the favour of the gods the war had been removed, they said, from the city of Rome and from Latium, <pb id="p.49"/>and it was possible to live on the farms without fear;<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> it was illogical to give more attention to the cultivation of Sicily than of Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But it was no easy matter for the people, since free farmers had been wiped out by the war, and there was a scarcity of slaves, while cattle had been stolen and farm-houses demolished or burned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A large proportion of the rustics, however, were constrained by the authority of the consuls to move back to their farms. The occasion for bringing up the matter had been the complaints of representatives of Placentia and Cremona that their territory was being raided and laid waste by neighbouring Gauls, and that a large part of their colonists had scattered, and that now they had sparsely peopled cities and land desolated and deserted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Mamilius, the praetor, was ordered to protect the colonies from the enemy. The consuls in accordance with a decree of the senate proclaimed that all citizens of Cremona and Placentia should return to their colonies before a fixed date.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then at the beginning of spring they also set out for the field.</p> 
				<p>Quintus Caecilius, the consul, received his army from Gaius Nero; Lucius Veturius took his from Quintus Claudius, the propraetor, and recruited it with fresh soldiers whom he had himself enrolled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consuls led their army into the territory of Consentia and ravaged it far and wide. When the column was now laden with booty, they were so harried by Bruttians and Numidian spearmen in a narrow pass that not only the booty but also the troops were in danger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> However, there was more commotion than battle; and sending the booty in advance the legions without loss made their way out into arable country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Thence the consuls set out <pb id="p.51"/>for Lucania. That entire nation returned without a<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> struggle to its allegiance to the Roman people.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With Hannibal there was no campaigning that year. For neither did he invite attack, owing to his very recent wound, a blow national as well as personal, nor did the Romans provoke him so long as he remained inactive; such power they believed to be present in that one commander, even though everything else round him crashed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And I am inclined to think he was more marvellous in adversity than in success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For here he was, carrying on war in the enemy's land for thirteen years, so far from home with varying fortune, having an army not made up of his own citizens but a mixture of the offscourings of all nations, men who had in common no law, no custom, no language, differing from each other in bearing, in garb, in their arms, differing as to religious rites, sacred observances, one might almost say as to their gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Yet he somehow bound them together by a single bond, so that no outbreak ensued among the men themselves nor any mutiny against their general.<note>This passage is obviously reminiscent of Polybius' tribute to Hannibal in a fragment of Book XI (xix. esp. 3-5). Cf. XXIII. v. 11; XXX. xxxiii. 8; XXIV. iii. 12.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Yet in the enemy's country both money to pay them and supplies were often wanting &mdash;deficiencies which in the previous Punic war had given rise to many unspeakable acts on the part of commanders and soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Certainly after the destruction of Hasdrubal's army with its commander-and on them he had rested all his hope of victory &mdash;, when by retiring into the remote land of the Bruttii he had given up the rest of Italy, who would not find it a marvel that there was no outbreak in his camp?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For added to everything else was this also, that he had no hope even of feeding his army except from the Bruttian region; and even supposing all of it to be under cultivation, it <pb id="p.53"/>was nevertheless too small to feed so large an army.<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Moreover a great part of the young men, drawn off from the farming of the land, had been claimed instead by the war and by their custom of training soldiers through brigandage, a practice viciously inbred in their nation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Furthermore, nothing was being sent from home, since they were concerned about their hold upon Spain, as though everything was succeeding in Italy.</p> 
				<p>In Spain the campaign was having an issue in part the same, in part very different: the same in that the Carthaginians, vanquished in battle with the loss of a general, had been forced to the farthest coast of Spain, even to the Ocean;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> on the other hand different in that Spain, owing to the nature of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> country and its people, was better adapted not merely than Italy but than any other part of the world to preparing for another war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In consequence, though the first of the provinces, at least of those on the mainland, to be entered by the Romans, it has been the last of all to be completely conquered, and not until our own times under the command and auspices of Augustus Caesar.<note>Since Agrippa's completion of the conquest of northwestern Spain is evidently meant here, we have in this reference to a contemporary event evidence that Book XXVIII was written (or published) after <date value="-19">19 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There Hasdrubal son of Gisgo, being the greatest and most distinguished general after the Barca family in that war, had at that time returned from Gades in the hope of renewing the war. After conducting levies in Farther Spain with the help of Mago the son of Hamilcar, he armed about fifty thousand infantry and four thousand five hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As to the cavalry forces there is substantial agreement among the authorities, but some writers state that seventy thousand foot-soldiers were <pb id="p.55"/>brought to the city of Silpia.<note>In the MSS. of Polybius <foreign lang="greek">)HLIGGA</foreign> (Elinga, unknown), probably an error for <foreign lang="greek">)ILIPPA,</foreign> <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Ilipa (accepted by his editors, XI. xx. 1). It lay 10 miles north of Hispalis (Seville), and on the right bank of the Baetis. Cf. XXXV. i. 10; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 11; Strabo III. ii. 3; v. 9. For Livy's habit of substituting place-names familiar to his readers for those used by Polybius cf. Ed. Meyer, <hi rend="italics">Kleine Schriften</hi> II, 406 ff.; Veith in Kromayer, <hi rend="italics">Antike Schlachtfelder</hi> IV, 518; Scullard, <hi rend="italics">Scipio Africanus in the Second Punic War</hi> 127 f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There in open plains<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> the two Carthaginian generals established themselves, resolved not to refuse a battle.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, when the news reached him that they had got together so large an army, thought that with Roman legions alone he would be no match for such a multitude unless barbarian auxiliaries should confront them, at least for appearance' sake.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Yet he felt that these must not compose so large a part of his forces that by changing sides &mdash;which had been the cause of disaster to his father and uncle &mdash;they might decide the outcome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly he sent Silanus in advance to Culchas,<note>Kolichas in Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c. &sect;&sect;</hi> 3, 5.</note> who ruled over twenty-eight towns, in order to receive from him the cavalry and infantry which he had promised to enlist during the winter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then Scipio himself set out from Tarraco, and gathering up as he went a moderate number of auxiliaries from the allies dwelling near the road, he arrived at Castulo.<note>On a tributary of the upper Baetis, giving its name to the Saltus Castulonensis (Sierra Morena). The main road to Corduba and Gades passed through the city; Strabo III, iv. 9. <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> Cf. xix. 2, 4; xx. 8; XXIV. xli. 7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thither Silanus brought auxiliaries, three thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry. From there Scipio advanced to the city of Baecula<note>Cf. Vol. VII. p. 283 n. It was west of Castulo but on the same road. The site cannot be certainly determined, although it has been identified with Bail&eacute;n. Cf. Polybius XI. xx. 5; Veith in Kromayer <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> IV. 503 if.; Scullard <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 300 ff.</note> with the entire army, forty-five thousand legionaries and allies, infantry and cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As they were pitching camp Mago and Masinissa with all their <pb id="p.57"/>cavalry attacked them<note>The reader would naturally assume that this attack and the important battle which follows took place very near Baecula. But at xii. 14 the Carthaginian generals were encamped near Silpia (Ilipa), <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> less than 60 miles from the Atlantic at the nearest point, while Baecula is 130 miles farther in a straight line. In Polybius it is Scipio who does the marching (XI. xx. 9). No long march of the Carthaginians to meet him is mentioned, and near Baecula there is no open plain suited to this battle. Hence this was near modern Seville and not a <quote>second battle of Baecula,</quote> as Mommsen, Ihne and others have it.</note> and would have thrown the<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> men working on the fortifications into confusion, had not cavalry concealed by Scipio behind a hill favourably situated for the purpose unexpectedly charged them in their disorder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These horsemen at the very beginning of the battle put to flight the most active and those who had been the first to ride up close to the earthwork and even among the men at work. With the rest, who had advanced under their standards and in marching order, the battle was more protracted and for a long time indecisive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But when light cohorts at first drawn off from the outposts, and then soldiers withdrawn from work on the fortifications and ordered to take up arms, came up in increasing number, and fresh to assist the weary, while by this time a long column of men under arms was dashing out from camp into battle, Carthaginians and Numidians thereupon faced about in unmistakable retreat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And at first they were retiring by troops, while their ranks were not at all broken on account of fear or haste. Then when the Roman fell more fiercely upon their rear and the attack could not be withstood, no longer mindful of their ranks, they scattered in flight hither and thither, each taking the shortest way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And although the spirit of the Romans was notably higher in consequence of that battle and that of the enemy notably lowered, still for some days following there was never any respite from sudden attacks by cavalry and light-armed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When his forces had been sufficiently tested by these skirmishes, Hasdrubal was the first to lead <pb id="p.59"/>his troops out into battle-line; then the Roman also<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> went forward.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But each of the two lines stood drawn up in front of its earthwork, and when neither side had begun the battle and the day was now nearing sunset, the troops were led back into camp, first by the Carthaginian and then by the Roman. The same thing happened for a number of days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Always the first to lead his troops out of camp, the first to sound the recall for his men weary of standing still, would be the Carthaginian. From neither side was there a charge, or a missile hurled, or any raising of a shout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The centre was held on one side by the Romans, on the other by the Carthaginians combined with Africans, the wings by their allies, and for both armies these were Spanish troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In front of the wings, in advance of the Punic line of battle, the elephants presented from a distance the appearance of forts.<note>Some of the elephants carried on their backs a crenellated tower from which javelins were hurled by four or more soldiers posted on the tower; hence the resemblance to forts; XXXVII. xl. 4; cf. Curtius VIII. xii. 7; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> VIII. 22 and 27; Lucretius V. 1302. Such <hi rend="italics">elephant turriti</hi> are represented in terracotta figures and on painted ware.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Already it was common talk in both camps that they were to fight in the formation in which they had stood; that the centres, the Roman and Carthaginian troops, between whom lay the cause of the war, would clash, evenly matched in spirit and in arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When Scipio observed that this was a persistent belief, he deliberately changed everything for the day on which he was to give battle. At evening he passed a written order through the camp that before daybreak the horses should be cared for and the men have breakfast, that the horsemen
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> under arms should keep their mounts bridled and saddled.<note>Not quite literal for this period. Primarily the word has to do with a cloth kept in place by a girth and straps. Evolution of cloth into saddle was slow.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>It was not yet quite daylight when he sent all his <pb id="p.61"/>cavalry with the light-armed against the Punic<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> outposts.<note>For this battle of Ilipa see the works already cited: Scullard, 126 ff. with plan; Veith, 517 ff. with map.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Immediately afterwards he himself with the heavy column of the legions went forward, and contrary to the fixed idea of his own men and of the enemy, he formed strong wings of his Roman soldiers, while the allies were taken into the centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When Hasdrubal, who was aroused by the shouts of the horsemen, sprang out of his tent and saw the uproar outside his earthwork and the excitement among his men, and in the distance the gleaming
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> standards of the legions and the plain filled with the enemy, he forthwith sent out all his cavalry against the horsemen. As for himself, he marched out of the camp with the infantry column, and in drawing up his line made no change from the customary order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The cavalry engagement had long been uncertain, and by itself it could not be decisive because when repulsed &mdash;and this repeatedly happened almost by turns &mdash;they could safely retire into the infantry line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But when the lines of battle were not more than half a mile apart, Scipio sounding the recall and opening his ranks admitted all the cavalry and the light-armed into the centre; and dividing them into two sections he posted them as a reserve behind the wings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then, when it was now time to begin the battle, he ordered the Spaniards &mdash;they formed the centre of the line-to advance at a slow pace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> From the right wing &mdash;for he was himself in command there &mdash;he sent a message to Silanus and Marcius<note>Cf. Vol. VII. pp. 5 <hi rend="italics">fin.,</hi> 65 (and notes), 77. Repeatedly mentioned in this Book.</note> that they should prolong their wing towards the left, just as they
					<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> had seen him pressing to the right, and with the light infantry and cavalry should engage the enemy <pb id="p.63"/>before the centres could come together.<note>Here Polybius XI. xxiii has a detailed account of complicated movements executed by the Roman wings in order to outflank the weaker Carthaginian wings before fighting could reach the centre of the lines. Cf. Scullard <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 132 ff.; Veith, 522 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Thus<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> extending the wings, with three cohorts<note>It has been held that Livy here mistranslated Polybius, who meant maniples. Everything depends upon the interpretation of<foreign lang="greek">trei=s spei/ras</foreign>and a following parenthesis, <quote>this infantry unit is called a cohort (<foreign lang="greek">koo/rtis</foreign>)by the Romans</quote> (XI. xxiii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> 1). It remains debatable whether <quote>this unit</quote> refers to the single <foreign lang="greek">spei/ra,</foreign> which must then be a maniple, or to the three combined to make a cohort. For <hi rend="italics">manipulus</hi> the regular word was <foreign lang="greek">shmei/a</foreign> Later on <foreign lang="greek">spei/ra</foreign> came to be cohort almost invariably.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> But in Polybius' time one could use either <foreign lang="greek">shmei/a</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">spei/ra</foreign> in the same meaning, as VI. xxiv. 5; so even in the same sentence, as <hi rend="italics">l. c.</hi> &sect; 8; III. cxiii. 3; 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ix. 7. In this battle the larger number, 1800 men, seems absolutely required. Cf. Veith <hi rend="italics">l. c.;</hi> F. G. Moore, <hi rend="italics">Classical</hi> <hi rend="italics">Weekly,</hi> XXXVII. 238f.</note> of infantry and three troops of cavalry on each wing, and with skirmishers in addition, they led at a rapid pace against the enemy, while the rest followed them obliquely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the centre was a curve where the Spanish units were more slowly advancing.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>By this time the wings were already engaged, while the main strength of the enemy's line, the veteran Carthaginians and Africans, had not yet come within range, and did not dare to dash towards the wings to help the combatants, for fear of exposing the centre to the enemy directly advancing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The wings were being hard pressed by a double attack; cavalry and light-armed and skirmishers with enclosing wings were charging into their flanks, while the cohorts were pressing them in front, endeavouring to cut off the wings from the rest of the battle-line. XV. And not only was the battle in general far from being evenly matched, but especially because the horde of Baliares and Spanish recruits had been made to face Roman and Latin soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Besides, as the day now wore on their strength also began to fail Hasdrubal's soldiers, who had been surprised by an early morning onslaught and compelled to go out into line in haste before they <pb id="p.65"/>could take food to sustain them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And Scipio had<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> deliberately dragged out the day, in order that the battle might be belated. For it was not until the seventh hour that the infantry units<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> those of xiv. 17, three cohorts on each wing (Veith), or one cohort as the passage has been commonly understood.</note> charged the wings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The battle reached the centre of the lines considerably later, so that the heat of the midday sun and the strain of standing under arms, and at the same time hunger and thirst, weakened their bodies before they engaged the enemy. Accordingly they stood resting on their shields. By this time, in addition to everything else, the elephants also took fright at the skirmishing tactics of cavalry and skirmishers and light-armed and had shifted from the wings into the centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Weakened therefore in body
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> and spirit the men retreated, keeping their ranks nevertheless, just as if by order of the general the line was giving way intact.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>But when the victors, on seeing that the tide of battle had turned, for that reason charged with more spirit from all sides, and it was not easy to withstand their attack, although Hasdrubal tried to hold his men back and confronted them as they gave way, shouting to them again and again that in the rear there were hills and a safe refuge if they retired slowly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nevertheless, as fear overcame their respect for him and those nearest to the enemy were falling, at once they faced about and all took to flight. And at first the standard-bearers began to halt at the foot of the hills and to call the soldiers back into their ranks, while the Romans hesitated to advance their line up the hill. Then when the enemy saw the standards coming bravely on, they resumed their flight and were <pb id="p.67"/>driven panic-stricken into camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Not far from the<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> earthwork were the Romans; and by such momentum they would have captured the camp if, after a blazing sun, such as shines out in the midst of clouds heavy with rain, there had not been so extraordinary a downpour that the victors with difficulty retired to their camp, and had not some been beset by scruples also against any further attempt that day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Carthaginians, although night and pouring rain invited them to needed rest, being weak from exertion and wounds, nevertheless, because fear and danger gave them no time to be idle when the enemy would attack the camp at daybreak,
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> raised their earthwork by gathering stones from near-by valleys all round, intending to defend themselves by a fortification, since in their arms they would have no sufficient protection. But the desertion of their allies made flight seem safer than delay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Defection began with Attenes, prince of the Turdetani, who deserted with a large force of his tribesmen. Then two fortified towns were handed over with their garrisons to the Roman by their commanders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And for fear the mischief might spread farther, now that men were once disposed to change sides, Hasdrubal moved his camp in the silence of the following night.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, when men on outpost duty reported at daylight that the enemy had left, sent his cavalry ahead and ordered the standards to advance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The column also marched at such a pace that, if they had directly followed the enemy's track, they would undoubtedly have overtaken them. They believed the guides that there was another shorter road to the river Baetis, by which they might attack the enemy while crossing over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hasdrubal, finding the passage <pb id="p.69"/>of the river closed, turned aside towards the Ocean,<note>Hasdrubal had intended to cross the Baetis and then retreat to Gades (total distance about 75 miles to the harbour of that city). But now he is obliged to remain on the right bank, thus increasing the distance considerably.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> and henceforward, scattering like fugitives, away they went. Thus he put a considerable distance between himself and the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> legions. Cavalry and light-armed, dashing upon them now from the rear, now on the flanks, kept wearing them out and delaying
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> them. But when in view of the numerous clashes the standards came to a halt and the men were engaged now with cavalry, now with skirmishers and auxiliary infantry, the legions came
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> up. Thereafter it was no longer a battle but a slaughter as of cattle, until the general, himself now approving their flight, escaped to the nearest hills with some six thousand half-armed men. The rest were slain or
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> captured. The Carthaginians hastily fortified an improvised camp on a very high hill and from it they defended themselves without difficulty, since the enemy had tried in vain to come up the steep
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> slope. But in an exposed situation which furnished nothing a siege was scarcely endurable even for a few days. Accordingly there were repeated desertions to the enemy. Finally the general himself sent for ships<note>From Gades; cf. &sect; 13.</note> &mdash; the sea was not far away &mdash;and leaving his army by night he escaped to
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Gades. Scipio, learning of the flight of the enemy's general, left Silanus ten thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry to besiege the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> camp. With the rest of the forces he himself returned to Tarraco in seventy days' marches,<note>The slow progress is explained by what immediately follows.</note> hearing the cases of chiefs and states as he proceeded, in order to bestow rewards according to the real worth of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> services. After his departure <pb id="p.71"/>Masinissa conferred secretly with Silanus, then crossed<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> over to Africa with a few of his countrymen, in order that in changing his policy he might count upon the obedience of his nation
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> also. The reason for his sudden change was not so clear then as was later the evidence furnished by a loyalty unswerving down to extreme age,<note>He lived on until <date value="-148">148 B.C.</date>, upwards of 90 years old, and reigned 60 years; App. <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 106; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> VII. 156.</note> that even at that time he had not acted without a reasonable
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> ground. Mago then reached Gades on the ships sent back by Hasdrubal. The rest, abandoned by their generals, were scattered, some by desertion, others by flight, among the neighbouring states; no force remained which was notable for its numbers or its strength.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>So much in general for the manner in which under the command and auspices of Publius Scipio the Carthaginians were driven out of Spain in the fourteenth year<note>An error corrected by x. 8 and xxxviii. 12, the 14th year of the war being <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date></note> from the beginning of the war, the fifth<note>Livy had assigned Scipio's arrival in Spain to the year <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>; XXVI. xix, 11 ff.

					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> army. Not much later Silanus returned to Scipio at Tarraco, reporting the war at an end.<note>Although his readers would here infer that a campaign has now been completed, the historian goes on to include a seemingly impossible range of operations within what remained of the same year, <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date></note> 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Scipio with many noble captives was sent to Rome to announce the conquest of Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And while everyone else was publishing the fact abroad with great rejoicing and high praise, the one man who had accomplished it was insatiable in his craving for merit and well-earned distinction. He considered the conquest of Spain insignificant compared with all that he had imagined in his high-minded hopes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Already his eye was upon Africa and the greater Carthage and the glory of such a war, as if <pb id="p.73"/>accumulated to bring him honour and a name.<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, thinking that he must already make preparations and gain the goodwill of kings and tribes, he decided first to sound King Syphax.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was the king of the Masaesulians. A tribe bordering on the Mauri, the Masaesulians directly face the region of Spain in which lies New Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At that time the king had a treaty with the Carthaginians; and Scipio, thinking it would have for Syphax no more weight and sanctity than is usual for barbarians, with whom loyalty depends upon success, sent Gaius Laelius as an envoy to him with gifts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Delighted with these, and since at that time the situation
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> was everywhere favourable for the Romans but for the Carthaginians unfavourable in Italy and now quite hopeless in Spain, the barbarian indicated that he would accept the friendship of the Romans; that for its confirmation he would neither give nor receive a pledge except in the actual presence of the Roman commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So Laelius, having received from the king a promise to this effect only, that for the visit safety would be assured, returned to Scipio.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>A factor of great importance in every respect for a man planning an attack upon Africa was Syphax, the richest king in that land and one who had already gained experience even of the Carthaginians in war, while boundaries of his kingdom were also well situated with reference to Spain in being separated from it by a narrow strait only.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Consequently Scipio thought the matter deserved to be pursued even at a great risk, since it was otherwise impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Leaving Lucius Marcius at Tarraco and Marcus Silanus at New Carthage &mdash;to which he had come by land in long stages from Tarraco &mdash;that they might defend Spain, <pb id="p.75"/>he himself sailed with Gaius Laelius and two quinqueremes<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> from (New) Carthage. Using oars for the most part over a calm sea, while at times a gentle wind lent its help, he crossed over to Africa.<note>Probably to Siga, in Mauretania, where Syphax at times resided; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 19; Strabo XVII; iii. 9; App. <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 29 f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It so chanced that at the very same time Hasdrubal, who had been forced out of Spain and had sailed into the harbour with seven triremes and cast anchor, was bringing his ships to the shore when the two quinqueremes were sighted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> No one had any doubt that they belonged to the enemy, and that they could be surprised by superior numbers before they entered the harbour. But they caused nothing more than uproar and excitement both among soldiers and sailors, as they made ready their arms and ships all to no purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For the sails, catching a slightly stronger wind from the open sea, brought the quinqueremes into the harbour before the Carthaginians could weigh anchor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Nor did anyone dare to make further disturbance in the king's harbour. So first Hasdrubal and then Scipio and Laelius disembarked and went to the king. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To Syphax it seemed a splendid thing &mdash;as indeed it was &mdash;that the generals of the two richest peoples of that time had come on the same day to ask for peace and friendship from him.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He invited both of them to be his guests, and inasmuch as chance had ordained that they should be under one roof and in the same dwelling, he tried to draw them into a conference to put an end to their quarrels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Scipio indeed stated that neither as a private citizen had he any hatred toward <pb id="p.77"/>the Carthaginian which might be ended by a conference,<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> nor as regarded the state could he treat with an enemy without an order from the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the king kept insisting that he consent to come to the same feast for fear one of his guests should seem to have been excluded from his table, Scipio did not decline, and they dined together in the king's house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the same couch even, since the king would have it so, Scipio and Hasdrubal reclined.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Moreover, such was the genial manner of Scipio, such his inborn cleverness in meeting every situation, that by his eloquent mode of address he won not Syphax only, the barbarian unacquainted with Roman ways, but his own bitterest enemy as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hasdrubal plainly showed that when he met him face to face, Scipio seemed even more marvellous than in his achievements in war, and that he did not doubt Syphax and his kingdom would soon be in the power of the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> such skill did the man possess in winning men over.<note>A single sentence remains from Polybius' account of this meeting of the three and their conversation (XI. xxiva. 4), here reflected by Livy.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so, he said, it was not so essential for the Carthaginians to inquire how their Spanish provinces had been lost as to consider how they were still to hold Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was not as a traveller, nor as one who idles along beautiful shores, that so great a Roman general had left a newly subdued province, had left his armies, and with only two ships had crossed over to Africa and entrusted himself to an enemy's land, to a king's power, to a man's untested honour; on the contrary he was cherishing a hope of conquering Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It had long <pb id="p.79"/>been Scipio's constant reflection, his open complaint,<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> he added, that he was not waging war in Africa, as Hannibal was in Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio, after making a treaty with Syphax, set sail from Africa, and tossed in open sea by unsteady winds, mostly violent, he reached the harbour of New Carthage on the fourth day.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although the Spanish provinces were having a respite from a Carthaginian war, still it was evident that on account of a guilty conscience certain states were quiet out of fear rather than because of loyalty. Most conspicuous both for size and guilt among these were Iliturgi<note>The last previous mention of a town of this name was XXVI. xvii. 4. That was about 175 miles in a straight line from New Carthage, and in a quite unthinkable direction for retreating Romans. Amtorgis, where the two brothers separated, cannot be identified (XXV. xxxii. 5, 9). Iliturgi has taken the place here of a town less well known, perhaps that of Pliny's Ilorci (the <hi rend="italics">rogus Scipionis,</hi> i.e. of Gnaeus, <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 9; Ilurgia in App. <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 32, Ilourgeia in Polybius, XI. xxiv. <hi rend="italics">sub.fin.,</hi> a fragment which seems to belong here, Dindorf). This may be modern Lorca, on a tributary of the Tader, about 40 miles west of Cartagena; so Ed. Meyer, <hi rend="italics">Kl. Schr.</hi> II. 445 f. and Schulten in <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi> LXIII. 288 ff. Or possibly Lorqui on the Tader, 35 miles north-west of Cartagena; so Scullard, 143. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> <hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi> VIII. 90.</note> and Castulo.<note>Cf. xiii. 4; XXIV. xli. 7. Here App. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> has Castax, unknown and an improbable form, but accepted by Scullard, 144 and Hallward in C.A.H. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> Any argument for rejecting Castulo is less cogent than in the case of Iliturgi. We may have our doubts, however, about an advance so far to the west unsupported except by the annalistic tradition. Cf. Kahrstedt in Meltzer, <hi rend="italics">Geschichte der Karthager</hi> III. 495 if.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although in favourable times its citizens had been allies, Castulo, after the Scipios had been slain with their armies, had revolted to the Carthaginians. The men of Iliturgi, by betraying and slaying those who from that disaster had fled to them for refuge, had added a crime also to their revolt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On Scipio's first coming, when the Spanish provinces were wavering, vengeance upon those states would have been deserved but not politic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Now, however, since in a time of peace the moment for exacting the penalty seemed to have arrived, he summoned Lucius Marcius from Tarraco and sent him with a third of his forces to lay siege to Castulo. He himself with the rest of the army reached Iliturgi in about five stages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The gates had been closed and <pb id="p.81"/>everything disposed and prepared to resist an attack.<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> So true was it that consciousness of what they knew they had deserved had meant as much for them as a declaration of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With this point also Scipio opened his speech of encouragement to his soldiers, saying that the Spaniards by closing their gates had themselves shown what they had deserved to fear. Consequently, he said, they must wage war against them with much more animosity than against the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With these it was a contest almost devoid of anger in pursuit of power and glory; from the Iliturgians they must exact the penalty for treachery and cruelty and crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The time had come for them to avenge the atrocious slaughter of their comrades and the perfidy which would have been brought to bear against themselves if in flight they had reached the same city. It was time also for them by a severe example to ordain that no one should ever account a Roman citizen or soldier in any misfortune as fair game for ill treatment.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Immediately after this exhortation from their general the officers, thoroughly aroused, issued ladders to men picked out of one maniple after another, and dividing the army so that Laelius as lieutenant should command one half, they attacked the city in two places at the same time, causing a double alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was not a single commander or a number of leading men that urged the citizens gallantly to defend the city, but their own fear due to consciousness of guilt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They remembered and reminded one another also that the aim was their punishment, not victory; that when every man perished what mattered most was whether he did so in battle and in the line, where the fortune of the fray, <pb id="p.83"/>making no distinctions, often lifted up the defeated<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> and dashed down the victor, or whether later, when their city was in
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> ashes and ruins, there before the faces of their captured wives and children, after enduring every outrage and indignity, they breathed their last under the scourge and in chains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Accordingly not merely those of military age or men alone, but women and children also helped beyond their powers of mind and body, bringing up weapons for the fighting men and carrying stones for the builders up to the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The stake was not freedom only, which whets the courage of brave men alone, but all had before their eyes extreme penalties and a hideous death. Bravery was kindled by emulation in toil and danger and by the mere sight of one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And so the battle was begun with such heat that that famous army, the conqueror of all Spain, was repeatedly beaten back from the walls by the young men of a single town and thrown into disorder in an inglorious battle. When Scipio saw this, he was afraid that, owing to so many vain attempts made by his men, the enemy's spirits might be cheered and his own soldiers lose heart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Thinking that he must himself make the attempt and claim a share in the danger, he berated the soldiers for their cowardice, ordered ladders to be brought up, and threatened that if the rest hesitated he would climb up himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Already at no small risk<note>App. <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 32 has him wounded; Zonaras IX. x. 2.</note> he had come close to the walls when from all sides an outcry was made by the soldiers, who were concerned for their commander and began to set up ladders in many places at the same time; and on the other side Laelius pressed the attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Then the resistance of <pb id="p.85"/>the townsmen was broken and, once the defenders<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> had been dislodged, the walls were occupied.</p> 
				<p>The citadel also in the midst of the confusion was captured from the side on which it appeared to be impregnable. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>African deserters, who were at that time in the Roman auxiliaries, just when the townsmen had turned to the defence of places where the danger was evident, while at the same time the Romans kept coming up
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> ... by any possible approach, caught sight of a very lofty part of the city lacking any kind of fortifications, lacking defenders as well, because it was protected by a very high cliff.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Men of light build and nimble, thanks to much training, they carried iron spikes with them and climbed up wherever they could over the irregular projections of the cliff.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherever they encountered rock too steep and smooth, by driving in spikes at suitable intervals they made something like steps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then while the first men with their hands drew up those who followed and the last pushed up those ahead of them, they made their way up to the summit. Thence they dashed down with a shout into the city already captured by the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was then in truth evident that the city had been attacked out of anger and hatred. No one thought of taking men alive, no one thought of booty, although every place was open for plunder. They slaughtered the unarmed and the armed alike, women as well as men; cruel anger went even so far as to slay infants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then they threw firebrands into houses and demolished what could not be consumed by the flames. So delighted were they to destroy even the <pb id="p.87"/>traces of the city and to blot out the memory of<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> their enemies' abode.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Scipio then led his army to Castulo, a city defended not only by Spaniards from other places but also by remnants of the Carthaginian army after a scattering flight in every direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But Scipio's coming had been preceded by a report of the disaster at Iliturgi, and in consequence alarm and despair had taken possession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Also as their interests were different, since everyone wished to be safeguarded himself without regard to any one else, at first unexpressed suspicion, then open discord produced a separation between Carthaginians and Spaniards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The latter were commanded by Cerdubelus, an open advocate of surrender, the Punic auxiliaries by Himilco. After receiving a secret promise Cerdubelus betrayed garrison and city to the Roman commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> More merciful was this victory. Not so serious a crime had been committed and voluntary surrender had greatly appeased their anger.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcius was thereupon sent to bring under Roman sway and authority any barbarians who had not yet been thoroughly subdued. Scipio returned to (New) Carthage to pay his vows to the gods and to conduct the gladiatorial show which he had prepared in honour of his deceased father and uncle. The exhibition of gladiators was not made up from the class of men which managers are in the habit of pitting against each other, that is, slaves sold on the platform and free men who are ready to sell their lives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In every case the service of the men who fought was voluntary and without compensation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For some were sent by their chieftains to display an example of the courage inbred in their tribe;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> some declared on their <pb id="p.89"/>own motion that they would fight to please the<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> general; in other cases rivalry and the desire to compete led them to challenge or, if challenged, not to refuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some who had been unable or unwilling to end their differences by a legal hearing, after agreeing that the disputed property should fall to the victor, settled the matter with the sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Men also of no obscure family but conspicuous and distinguished, Corbis and Orsua, being cousins and competing for the post of chief of a city called Ibes,<note>Only here, site unknown, unless it be Ibi, 12 miles northnorth-west of Alicante (Castrum Album, XXIV. xli. 3).</note> declared that they would contend with the sword. Corbis was the older in years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Orsua's father had lately been chief, having succeeded to an elder brother's rank upon his death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When Scipio desired to settle the question by a hearing and to calm their anger, they both said they had refused that request to their common relatives, and that they were to have as their judge no other god or man than Mars.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The older man was confident in his strength, the younger in the bloom of his youth, each preferring death in the combat rather than to be subject to the rule of the other. Since they could not be made to give up such madness, they furnished the army a remarkable spectacle, demonstrating how great an evil among mortals is the ambition to rule.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The older man by his skill with arms and by his cunning easily mastered the brute strength of the younger. In addition to this gladiatorial show there were funeral games so far as the resources of the province and camp equipment permitted.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meantime operations were carried on no less actively by the lieutenants. Marcius after crossing the river Baetis, which the inhabitants call Certis,<note>Another local name was Perces; Steph. Byz. 156. 9.</note> accepted the surrender of two rich cities without an <pb id="p.91"/>engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was the city of Astapa,<note>Ostippo in Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 12 and inscriptions; now Estepa, 70 miles east-south-east of Seville. App. <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 33 retells the tale.</note> always<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> on the side of the Carthaginians; and this did not so much justify anger as that they bore a particular hatred against the Romans over and above the exigencies of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor did they have a city secure either by reason of its situation or fortifications to make them over-confident. But their natural delight in brigandage had impelled the inhabitants to make raids into adjoining territory of allies of the Roman people and to capture stray Roman soldiers and sutlers and merchants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even a caravan &mdash;large because there had been too little safety for small numbers &mdash;crossing their territory had been entrapped in an unfavourable spot by an ambuscade and cut to pieces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the army had been brought up to lay siege to this city, the men of the town, prompted by a guilty conscience, because neither surrender to an enemy so incensed seemed safe nor was there any hope of defending their lives by walls and arms, resolved to carry out against themselves and their families a brutal and barbarous act.<note>Cf. XXI. xiv, the similar conduct of the Saguntines, and XXXI. xvii, Abydus; cf. Polybius XVI. xxxi. ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A spot in the marketplace was selected where they were to bring together their most valuable possessions. Having ordered their wives and children to sit down upon that heap they piled up wood all around and threw on bundles of brush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They then instructed fifty armed young men to keep guard at that place, so long as the issue of the battle was uncertain, over their treasures and over persons that were dearer than treasures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If they should see that the battle had gone against them and the city was on the point of being captured, they were to know that all those whom they now saw <pb id="p.93"/>marching out to battle would meet death where they<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> were fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They implored them, they said, by the gods above and below to remember the freedom which must be brought to an end that day either by an honourable death or an infamous slavery, and leave nothing upon which an angry enemy might vent his fury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Sword and firebrand were in their hands; let friendly and loyal hands destroy all that was doomed to perish, rather than have the enemy offer indignities with insolent mockery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To these exhortations they added a dreadful curse, in case hope or weakness of character should turn any one from their purpose.</p> 
				<p>Then at the double they burst out of wide-open gates with a great uproar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And no outpost in sufficient strength had been stationed to face them, since nothing less could be feared than that the besieged should venture to sally out from the walls. A very few troops of cavalry and such light-armed infantry as were suddenly sent out of the camp for that very purpose encountered them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The battle was fierce in courageous onslaught rather than regular in any formation. Accordingly the horsemen who had been the first to confront the enemy were beaten back and brought panic to the light-armed. The fighting would also have been directly outside the earthwork had not the heavy legionary infantry drawn up their line of battle in spite of the very short time given them to form.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Even there for a short time there was some alarm in the front line, while men blinded by frenzy dashed on to meet wounds and steel with mad recklessness. Then the veteran soldiers, steadfast against rash attacks, by slaying the first men checked those who followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <pb id="p.95"/>A little later, venturing to take the offensive, when<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> they saw no one giving way and every man resolutely dying in his tracks, they extended their line, as superior numbers of armed men made it possible for them to do, outflanked the enemy, and as they fought in circular formation slew them to the last man.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such slaughter, however, arose from the attack of a furious enemy, fighting at that moment according to the law of war against armed men resisting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> More horrible was another butchery within the city, when their own citizens were slaying an unarmed, unresisting throng of women and children and throwing bodies, very often only half-dead, upon a pyre they had lighted, and streams of blood were putting out the rising flames. Finally the men, exhausted by the pitiful slaying of their own kin, threw themselves and their arms into the midst of the fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The slaughter was already finished when the victorious Romans arrived. And at the first sight of so terrible a scene they stood for a little while stunned with amazement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, when gold and silver glistened in the heap of other objects and with the eagerness which is natural to man they were trying to snatch them from the flames, some caught fire themselves, others were scorched by the hot blast,<note>Here Polybius' narrative survives in a single sentence about frantic efforts to recover gold and silver, XI. xxiv. 11.</note> since those in front had no way of escape, while the mass of men pressed upon them from the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus was Astapa destroyed by sword and fire without booty for the soldiers. Marcius, having received the <pb id="p.97"/>surrender of all the other tribes of that region owing<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> to their fear, led his victorious army back to Scipio at (New) Carthage.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>About the same time came deserters from Gades promising to betray the city and the Punic garrison in that city and the commander of the garrison together with the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Mago after his flight had halted there, and having assembled ships on the Ocean, he had gathered up a considerable force of auxiliaries both from the African coast across the strait and from the nearest places in Spain with the help of Hanno, the prefect.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Promises were received from the deserters and given them, and Marcius with cohorts lightly equipped and Laelius also with seven triremes and one quinquereme were sent thither, to carry on the campaign by land and sea with a single plan.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio himself fell ill with an alarming malady, but still more alarming as reported, since everyone added something to what he had heard, with the inbred human passion for purposely magnifying rumours. His illness agitated the whole province and especially the distant parts of it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And how serious a situation would have been created if the fatality had been real was evident, since an empty report had stirred up such tempests. Allies did not remain loyal, nor the army mindful of duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Mandonius and Indibilis,<note>Cf. Vol. VII. pp. 279, n. 4; 282, n. 1; below, xxv. 11; XXIX. i. 19 and iii. 1 ff.</note> because they had reckoned upon a kingdom of Spain for themselves when the Carthaginians should be expelled from it, and yet nothing to match their hopes had come to them, stirred up their countrymen &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> they were Lacetani<note>Probably an error for Laeetani; in the north-east corner of Spain around Barc&#x012D;no (Barcelona); xxxiv. 4; XXI. xxiii. 2; XXXIV. xx. 2.</note> &mdash;called <pb id="p.99"/>out the young men of the Celtiberians and ravaged<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> the territory of the Suessetani and Sedetani,<note>Also north of the Ebro and near the coast; xxxi. 7; XXIX. i. 26. So were the Suessetani, enemies in XXV. xxxiv. 6, but now allies, neighbours of the Edetani across the river.</note> allies of the Roman people, in warlike fashion.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>From citizens sprang a different outbreak in the camp near Sucro.<note>The town of the same name on the river (now the J&uacute;car). Near it Pompey fought against Sertorius; Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Sert.</hi> 19; <hi rend="italics">Pomp.</hi> 19; App. <hi rend="italics">B.C.</hi> I. 110. Livy's source for the narrative of this mutiny was Polybius XI. xxv-xxx. Cf. App. <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 34 ff. It remained a mutiny to the end (xxix. 12). The only citizens were (1) Romans in the army, and (2) Italian allies serving with them (xxxii.6). There can be no hint of civil war in <hi rend="italics">civilis furor,</hi> for the theme now to be developed was announced in &sect; 2, <hi rend="italics">non exercitus,</hi> etc.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Eight thousand soldiers were there, posted as a garrison for the tribes dwelling on this side of the Ebro. Their disloyalty, however, was not just beginning when unsubstantiated reports of the general's imminent danger reached them, but existed even before, owing to the usual licence resulting from long inaction. It was also to some extent because men accustomed to live unrestrainedly on plunder in an enemy's territory felt the pinch of peace-time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And at first they merely engaged in secret conversations: If there was a war in the province, what were they doing among people already pacified? If the war was over now and the province set in order, why were they not transported back to Italy?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They made demands also for their pay with more petulance than accorded with the customary self-control of the soldier; and sentries heaped reproaches on tribunes making the rounds of the guard, and at night some men had gone out for plunder into peaceful country all around. Finally by day and openly without permission they would leave their standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Everything was being done in accordance with the whim and fancy of the soldiers, nothing according to the traditions and discipline of the service or the orders of superior officers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The outward appearance, however, of a Roman camp was maintained in this alone, that, believing the <pb id="p.101"/>tribunes, infected with their madness, would not fail<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> to share their mutiny and revolt, they permitted them to hear cases before the headquarters, went to them for the password and did outpost and guard duty in succession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Moreover, though they had robbed their command of power, yet they kept up a show of obedience while actually giving orders themselves.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Then the mutiny broke out after they observed that the tribunes censured and disapproved of what was being done and were endeavouring actively to oppose it, also openly declaring that they would not be partners in their madness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Accordingly, chasing the tribunes out of the space before headquarters and soon after out of the camp, they by common consent bestowed the command upon the leaders of the mutiny, the privates Gaius Albius of Gales and Gaius Atrius, an Umbrian.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> These men, not at all satisfied with the distinguishing marks of tribunes, ventured to pollute the insignia of the very highest command, the fasces and axes. Nor did it occur to them that those rods and axes, which they caused to be carried before them to frighten others, were hanging over their own backs and their own necks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The unfounded belief in Scipio's death was the cause of their blindness and, once rumour of it should presently be spread abroad, they had no doubt that all Spain would be ablaze with war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In that uprising, they thought, money could be exacted from allies, and also neighbouring cities plundered; and in the confusion, when any man would dare anything, what they had themselves done would be less conspicuous. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they waited from moment to moment for fresh news, expecting to hear not only of his death but even of his funeral, and yet none came and the groundless <pb id="p.103"/>report was losing hold, then its first sponsors began<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> to be sought out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And as one after another drew back, that he might be thought to have rashly believed such a thing rather than to have invented it, the deserted leaders were now alarmed at their own insignia and, in place of the empty semblance of command which was theirs, at the real, duly bestowed authority that would presently turn against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thus when the mutiny was at a standstill and credible informants brought the news, first that Scipio was alive, and then that he was even well, seven tribunes of the soldiers arrived, being sent by Scipio himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Upon their arrival there was at first irritation; soon after, as the tribunes themselves by mild words calmed acquaintances whom they had met, the men were less resentful.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For going round at first among the tents, then in the headquarters square and before the general's tent, where they saw groups talking together, they would speak to the men, asking them what was the reason for their anger and their sudden mania, instead of finding fault with them for what they had done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A common complaint was that their pay had not been given them on the proper date; also that, whereas at the time when the men of Iliturgi<note>Cf. xix. i. and n.</note> had committed their crime, after the slaughter of the two commanders-in-chief and the two armies, the Roman name had been defended and the province retained by their own courage, yet, while the Iliturgians now had a due punishment for their crime, there was no one to reward their own good deeds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In reply the tribunes said that those who complained of such matters only were making just pleas, and they would report them to the commander-in-chief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were glad that there was nothing more serious <pb id="p.105"/>nor more incurable; and by favour of the gods<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> Scipio and the republic, they said, were in a position to show gratitude.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Scipio, who was familiar with wars but unacquainted with the gusts of mutinies, was kept in a state of concern lest either the army should go to excess in wrong-doing or he himself in punishing them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For the present he decided to use gentle measures, as he had begun to do, and to bring the hope of pay nearer by sending collectors round the tributary states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Next an edict was posted up that they should assemble at (New) Carthage to get their pay, whether they preferred to do so as separate units or all together. The mutiny, already of itself on the wane, was quelled by sudden peace on the part of the rebellious Spaniards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For Mandonius and Indibilis had abandoned their project and retired to their borders when they had news that Scipio was alive. Nor was there either a fellow-citizen or foreigner any longer with whom the soldiers might share their madness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On surveying all possible plans they had nothing left except a not altogether safe retreat from criminal designs, namely, to give themselves up either to the commander's well-grounded anger or to his mercy, as not beyond their hopes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He had pardoned even enemies, they said, with whom he had fought with the sword; their mutiny had been free from wounds, free from bloodshed, and neither in itself savage nor meriting a savage punishment. So unduly eloquent is human nature in minimizing one's own guilt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <pb id="p.107"/>The only question was whether to go in separate<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> cohorts to get their pay, or all together. Their decision was that all should go together, which they thought safer.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the days on which they were thus deliberating there was a war-council in regard to them at (New) Carthage, and a conflict of opinions as to whether the leaders only of the mutiny &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> they were not more than thirty-five in number &mdash; should be punished, or whether punishment of a larger number was required in penalizing, not a mutiny but rather a rebellion which set so terrible an example.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The milder opinion prevailed, that punishment should be limited to those with whom the breach of discipline had begun, whereas for the mass a reprimand was enough.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After the dismissal of the council, to give the impression that this was the matter discussed, an expedition against Mandonius and Indibilis was announced to the army which was at (New) Carthage, and they were ordered to make ready their rations for several days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The seven tribunes who had already gone to Sucro to repress the mutiny and were now sent to meet the army had each of them the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> names of five leaders of the mutiny assigned him, to have them invited with kindly countenance and words by suitable men to be their guests, lulled to sleep by wine and then bound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The mutineers were now not far from (New) Carthage when the news, heard from those they met, that on the next day the entire army would set out under Marcus Silanus against the Lacetani, not only relieved them of all fear which remained unexpressed in their minds, but caused great rejoicing that they would have the commander alone, rather than be themselves in his <pb id="p.109"/>power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At sunset they entered the city and saw the<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> other army making every preparation for the march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Received with studied words of welcome &mdash;that their coming was a happy and timely thing for the general, in that they had arrived at the very time the other army was leaving &mdash;they took refreshment and rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The tribunes, without causing any commotion, had the promoters of the mutiny brought by suitable persons to their hospitable quarters, then seized and bound. At the fourth watch the baggage of the army which, it was pretended, was to march away began to take the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> By daybreak the standards were in motion, but at the gate the column was halted and guards were sent round to all the gates, that no one should leave the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then the men who had arrived the day before, on being summoned to an assembly, rushed fiercely into the open space<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Polybius' <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign>(VI. xxxi. 1 f.) to the right of the headquarters, not the similar space (also called <hi rend="italics">forum</hi>) in which stood the <hi rend="italics">quaestorium;</hi> XLI. ii. 11.</note> and up to the general's platform, intending actually to intimidate him by their interruptions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At the same moment that the general mounted the platform the armed men brought back from the gates surrounded the unarmed assembly from the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then all their fierceness failed them and, as they afterwards admitted, nothing alarmed them so much as the unexpected strength and healthy colour of the general whom they had believed they would see as an invalid, also an expression of his face such as, they said, they never remembered even in battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He sat in silence for a moment, until the report reached him that the promoters of the mutiny had been <pb id="p.111"/>brought into the open space and that everything was<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> ready. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, when the herald had enforced silence, Scipio began as follows:<note>The following speech has few direct borrowings from the briefer discourse in Polybius XI. xxviii f., <hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> the comparison of a crowd to the sea, &sect; 11, more fully developed in the Greek peroration, xxix. 9-11.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>"Never have I supposed that language with which to address my army would fail me; not that I have ever occupied myself with words rather than deeds, but because, having lived in camps almost from boyhood, I was familiar with the minds of soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But how to speak to <hi rend="italics">you</hi> &mdash;for that both thoughts and language fail me. I do not know even by what name I ought to address you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Citizens? when you have revolted from your country? Or soldiers? when you have rejected the high command and the auspices, have broken the sanctity of your oath? Enemies?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I recognize the bodies, faces, clothing, appearance of citizens, but the deeds, the words, the plans, the spirit of enemies. For what else did you either wish or hope for but the same as the Ilergetes and the Lacetani? And yet they followed Mandonius and Indibilis, men of royal rank, as leaders in their madness. You conferred the auspices and high command upon the Umbrian Atrius and the Calenian Albius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Say that not all of you did that, soldiers, or wished it done; that it was the frenzy and folly of a few; I will gladly accept your denial. For the acts committed were such that, if they were shared by the entire army, they cannot be expiated without atonements on a great scale.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>"Unwillingly do I handle such misdeeds, as if they were wounds. But unless handled and treated they cannot be healed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As for myself, after the Carthaginians were driven out of Spain I did not believe <pb id="p.113"/>there was in the entire province any place, any people,<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> where my life was hated; so had I borne myself not only towards allies, but also towards enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Behold! here in my own camp &mdash;how mistaken I was! &mdash;a rumour of my death was not only believed but even waited for.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Not that I should wish the crime to be shared by all. For my part, if I believed that the whole of my army had desired my death I should die here at once before your eyes, nor would a life hated by my fellow-citizens and my soldiers give me pleasure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But every crowd is in itself motionless, as is the natural state of the sea; rather do winds and breezes ruffle it. So among you there is either calm or sudden storms. And the cause and source of every madness is chargeable to its promoters; your insanity came by contagion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Even today you do not seem to me to know what a pitch of frenzy you have reached, what a crime you have dared to commit against me, against your country and parents and children, against the gods, witnesses of your oath, what a crime as regards the auspices under which: you are serving, or the custom of the service and the discipline of your ancestors, or the dignity of the supreme command!</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>"Of myself I say nothing, granting that you were hasty rather than eager in believing, granting in short that I am a man whose authority irks an army, and no wonder. But the country, what evil had she done you, when you were betraying her by sharing your designs with Mandonius and Indibilis?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What harm had the Roman people done you when you took away <pb id="p.115"/>the command from tribunes elected by vote of the<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> people and conferred it upon private persons, when, not even satisfied with having them as tribunes, you, a Roman army, bestowed the fasces of your commander upon men who had never had a slave to whom they might give orders?
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> In the headquarters were lodged Albius and Atrius; at their tent sounded the trumpet, men came to them for the watchword; they sat on Publius Scipio's tribunal. A lictor attended them; the way was cleared before they proceeded; fasces with their axes were borne before them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Showers of stones and thunderbolts hurled from the sky and animals bringing forth strange offspring you reckon portents; here we have a portent which cannot be expiated by any victims, by any set days of prayer, without the blood of those who have dared so great a crime.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They were being dragged out into the centre stripped, and at the same time everything requisite for punishment was being brought out.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then all the bodies were dragged away from the centre, and after the ground had been cleansed the soldiers, summoned by name, in the presence of the military tribunes, swore allegiance to Publius Scipio; and as each man was called his pay was counted out to him.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time along the Baetis River Hanno, Mago's prefect, who-had been sent from Gades with a small force of Africans, enlisting Spaniards for pay, armed about four thousand young men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then stripped of his camp by Lucius Marcius, while the largest part of his troops were lost in the confusion of its capture, some also lost in the flight, since the cavalry pursued the scattered fugitives, Hanno himself with a small number only escaped.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While these things were going on along the Baetis River, Laelius meantime sailed down the strait into the Ocean and came with his fleet to Carteia.<note>At the north end of the Bay of Gibraltar, about half-way between the Rock, Calpe, and Algeciras. Livy thinks of the Atlantic as beginning immediately beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and thus including nearly the whole of the Strait(Fretum Gaditanum). In <date value="-171">171 B.C.</date> Carteia became a Latin colony; XLIII. iii. 3 f. Cf. also Strabo III. i. 7; Mela II. 96.</note> This city is situated on the coast of the Ocean, where <pb id="p.125"/>the sea begins to open out after the narrow entrance.<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of Gades, as has been said above, he had hoped without a battle to gain possession by betrayal,<note>Cf. above, xxiii. 6.</note> since men actually came into the Roman camp to make such a promise. But the betrayal was prematurely revealed, and Mago arrested all the conspirators and turned them over to Adherbal, the magistrate,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> one of the two <hi rend="italics">suf&#x0115;tes</hi> and at the same time a general. Cf. xxxvii. 2 (at Gades); XXX. vii. 5.</note> to be transported to Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Adherbal placed the conspirators on a quinquereme and after sending it in advance, because it was slower than a trireme, himself followed with eight triremes at no great distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The quinquereme was already entering the strait when Laelius, also on a quinquereme, sailed out from the harbour of Carteia followed by seven triremes, and steered for Adherbal and his triremes, feeling quite sure that the quinquereme, caught in the swift current of the strait, could not reverse its course in the face of the tide. The Carthaginian in the unexpected situation was troubled for the moment and uncertain whether to follow his quinquereme or to turn his prows towards the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That hesitation in itself deprived him of the power to refuse a battle; for they were already within range and the enemy was pressing them from all sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The tide also had deprived them of control of their ships. Nor was the fight like a naval battle; for here there was no initiative, no skill or strategy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The nature of the strait and its tide alone controlled the entire engagement, carrying men, vainly struggling to row in the opposite direction, against their own ships or those of the enemy. And one might have seen a fleeing ship swung about by a swirl <pb id="p.127"/>and borne against the victors, and a pursuing ship,<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> if it chanced upon an opposite current, turning away as if in flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In actual combat now one ship, aiming to ram a ship of the enemy with its beak, turning aslant would itself receive the blow of the other's beak. Another ship, exposing its beam to the enemy, would suddenly be swung and turned bow foremost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While- between the triremes an indecisive battle controlled by chance was in progress, the Roman quinquereme, whether because she was steadier by reason of her weight or more easily steered as her more numerous banks of oars<note>If a quinquereme had but one bank of oars, each oar pulled by five men, as many now incline to believe, it remains unexplained how Livy in comparing a quinquereme in battle with triremes could simply say that the former had more <hi rend="italics">ordines remorum,</hi> unless he thought that to be the case. In XXIV. xxxiv. 7 <hi rend="italics">exteriore ordine remorum</hi> includes all the oars on one side of a ship but does not tell us whether in a single bank or in five.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that the hope in which they had come to him had been frustrated &mdash;he sent messengers to Lucius Marcius, saying that unless they wished to waste time to no purpose in idling before Gades, they must return to the commander-in-chief. As Marcius agreed, they both returned after a few days to (New) Carthage.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There after inveighing at great length against the treachery of the chiefs in rebellion, he declared that in order to punish their crime he was setting out in a very different spirit <pb id="p.131"/>from that in which he recently cured a misunderstanding<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> on the part of citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At that time, he said, with sighing and tears, just as though he were cutting into his own vital organs, he had atoned by the lives of thirty men for the folly, or it might be the guilt, of eight thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But now with joy and exaltation of spirit he was advancing to the slaughter of the Ilergetes. For they had not been born in the same land, nor were they linked by any alliance with himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The only bond which once existed, that of loyalty and friendship, they had themselves broken by their crime. As for his own army, he was stirred on seeing all the men in it citizens or allies and Latins, and also because there was hardly a soldier who had not been brought from Italy either by his uncle Gnaeus Scipio, who was the first of the Romans to come into that province, or by his father as consul, or by himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were all of them accustomed to the name and auspices of the Scipios, being men whom he would like to bring home to their country for a well-earned triumph, men who he hoped would support his canvass for the consulship, just as if an honour shared by all alike were at stake.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So far as concerned the enterprise now impending, he said, any man who considered it a war was forgetting their own achievements. Mago surely, who fled with a few ships beyond the known world to an island surrounded by the Ocean,<note>Cf. p. 141 and note.</note> was a greater concern to him than the Ilergetes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For there it was a Carthaginian general and also a Punic force however small; here there were brigands and brigand chiefs, who might, to be sure, have considerable strength for ravaging the lands of neighbouring tribes and for burning houses and stealing cattle, but none <pb id="p.133"/>at all in battle-line and when standards faced standards.<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> In battle they would rely more upon swiftness in flight than upon arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly it was not because he saw any danger from them or the seed of a greater war, that he had thought the Ilergetes must be overpowered before he left his province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was in the first place in order that so criminal a rebellion might not go unpunished, and then that it might not possibly be said that any enemy had been left in a province which had been thoroughly conquered by such courage combined with such success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Wherefore with the kind aid of the gods let them follow him, not so much to carry on a war &mdash;for it was no conflict with a well-matched enemy &mdash;as to exact punishment from criminals.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Dismissing them after this speech, he ordered them to make ready for the march on the morrow; and setting out he came in ten stages to the river Hiberus. Then crossing the river, he pitched camp on the fourth day in sight of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In front was level ground hemmed in on this side and that by mountains. Into that valley Scipio first ordered men to drive cattle &mdash;mostly booty from the enemy's own farms-to tempt the barbarians' love of pillage, and then sent light &mdash;armed troops to their assistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When these had begun the battle with a charge, he ordered Laelius to make an attack with cavalry from an ambush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A hill conveniently projecting concealed the ambsucade of cavalry, and the battle began without delay. The Spaniards, catching sight of cattle in the distance, dashed upon them, the light-armed upon the Spaniards busy with their plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first they inspired alarm by their missiles; then abandoning their light weapons, which <pb id="p.135"/>could provoke rather than decide the battle, they<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> drew their swords and began fighting at close quarters. And the infantry battle would have remained doubtful if the cavalry had not arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only did they trample down those they met by a frontal attack, but some also rode round along the lowest part of the slope and made an attack in the rear, so that they cut off a good many; and the slaughter was greater than unimportant skirmishes usually cause.</p> 
				<p>This defeat kindled the anger of the barbarians, instead of diminishing their courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Consequently, not to appear daunted, they went out into battle-line at daybreak the next day. The valley being narrow, as stated above, had no room for all the forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> About two-thirds of the infantry and all the cavalry came down into line. The remainder of their infantry they stationed on the slope of the hill. Scipio, who thought the limited space was to his advantage, both because a battle at close range seemed likely to be better
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> suited to the Roman than to the Spanish soldier, also because the enemy's line had been enticed down into a position which did not have room for all of their multitude, turned his attention to a further new plan. He could not place his cavalry on the wings, he thought, in so limited a space, and the enemy would have no use of the cavalry they had brought down with their infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Therefore he ordered Laelius to lead his cavalry about over the hills, taking the road that was best hidden, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> to separate the cavalry battle, so far as he could, from that of the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As for himself, he made all his infantry units face the enemy; four cohorts he placed in the front line, since he was unable to extend his line to a greater length.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He did not delay <pb id="p.137"/>beginning the engagement, in order to divert<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> attention by the battle itself from the sight of the cavalry crossing over the hills; and they were not aware that the horsemen had outflanked them until they heard the din of a cavalry battle in their rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thus there were two distinct battles; two infantry lines, two cavalry forces, were fighting down the length of the level ground, since the narrow space did not permit a battle that combined both arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> On the Spanish side neither did infantry aid cavalry nor cavalry infantry; the foot-soldiers, who in reliance upon the cavalry had been rashly posted on the level ground, were cut to pieces; the cavalry, being outflanked, were neither withstanding Roman infantry in front &mdash;for their own infantry were already overwhelmed &mdash;nor Roman cavalry in the rear. Consequently the horsemen also, after they had formed a circle and with their horses at a standstill had defended themselves for a long time, were all slain to a man; and not one of their foot or horse that fought in the valley survived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Only a third of them, having stood on the hill, to look on in safety rather than to take part in the battle, had both a suitable position and time for flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Among them the princes also fled, having slipped away in the confusion before the entire line should be surrounded.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The camp of the Spaniards was captured the same day, with about three thousand men in addition to other booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of the Romans and allies about twelve hundred fell in that battle; more than three thousand men were wounded. The victory would have been less bloody if the battle had been fought on a more open ground affording an easy escape.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><pb id="p.139"/>
				<p>Indibilis, having discarded his plans for war,<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> thought no refuge safer in his distress than Scipio's honesty and mercy, of which he had had experience, and sent his brother Mandonius to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mandonius, clasping Scipio's knees, laid the blame upon the fateful madness of a time in which some pestilent epidemic had frenzied not merely the Ilergetes and Lacetani but also a Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As for himself, -indeed, and his brother and the rest of their countrymen, such was their situation that they should either give back to Publius Scipio, if he approved, the life they had received also from him, or, if spared twice, they should perpetually devote to him the lives they owed to him alone. Formerly, when they had as yet no experience of his mercy, they had confidence in their cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Now, however, they had no hope, he said, in their cause, but rested it all on the pity of the victor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The old custom of the Romans in establishing peaceful relations with a people neither on the basis of a treaty nor on equal terms had been this: not to exert its authority over that people, as now pacified, until it had surrendered everything divine and human, until hostages had been received, arms taken away and garrisons posted in its cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, however, after inveighing at length against Mandonius, who was present, and the absent Indibilis, said that in consequence of their own misdeeds they had surely deserved to die; that they should live by his kindness and that of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But he would not take away their arms nor demand hostages; for those were the pledges for men who feared a rebellion, whereas he was leaving them their arms without restriction, their minds relieved of fear. And if they <pb id="p.141"/>should revolt his wrath would be directed, not against<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> innocent hostages, but against themselves, and he would exact punishment, not from an unarmed, but from an armed enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As they had known both kinds of fortune, he gave them their choice, whether they preferred to find the Romans kindly disposed or angry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thus Mandonius was dismissed with no other demand than money, that the soldiers might receive their pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> After sending Marcius ahead into Farther Spain and Silanus back to Tarraco, Scipio delayed a few days for the Ilergetes to pay the whole amount demanded, and then with an unencumbered force overtook Marcius as he was now approaching the Ocean.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Dealings which had to do with Masinissa, begun even before this time, had been postponed on one pretext or another because the Numidian desired in any case to meet Scipio in person and to ratify the agreement by clasping his hand. That was Scipio's reason at this time for a march so long and so circuitous.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Masinissa, being at Gades and informed by Marcius of Scipio's approach, pretended that the horses, being shut up on an island,<note>Gades, the oldest Phoenician city in the West (possibly 300 years older than Carthage), was built at first on a very small island at the north-west end of a long narrow island tapering away to the south-south-east. In later times the harbour was closed in that direction by the slow action of Atlantic tides, so that the long island became a peninsula. The city, now Cadiz, is separated from the mainland to the east (at the Trocadero) by a channel three-fourths of a mile wide. Cf. Strabo III. v. 3; Mela III. 46; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> IV. 119 f.; Schulten in <hi rend="italics">Arch. Anzeiger</hi> 1927, pp. 203 ff. (maps).</note> were deteriorating and not only causing a general scarcity for the rest but also themselves suffering from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Adding that the horsemen were losing their vigour from inaction, he prevailed upon Mago to permit him to cross over to the mainland in order to lay waste the nearest lands in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After crossing over he sent three prominent Numidians in advance to fix a time and <pb id="p.143"/>place for a conference. He gave instructions that<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> two were to be kept by Scipio as hostages. When the third had been sent back to conduct Masinissa to the place indicated in the order, they came with a small escort to the conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Numidian had already been filled with admiration for the man in consequence of his reported achievements, and had conjured up in mind an ideal figure, tall and stately.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But greater still was the reverence that possessed him for the man in his presence; and while Scipio had great natural dignity, long hair added charm, as did a general appearance not due to studied elegance, but truly masculine and soldierly;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and his age was exactly at the height of physical strength, amplified and made more dazzling by the youthful bloom which appeared to have been renewed after his illness.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Almost dazed by merely meeting him, the Numidian thanked him for sending home his nephew.<note>Here a brother's son, while according to XXVII. xix. 9, perhaps from a different source, Massiva would be a sister's son.</note> From that time on, he said, he had sought the opportunity which he did not let slip when at last it was. presented him by the favour of the immortal gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He was eager to give such services to Scipio and the Roman people that no individual foreigner would have aided the Roman state with more ardour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That aid, although he had long wished to give it, he had been unable to furnish in Spain, a foreign and unknown land. But in the land in which he had been born and brought up in the hope of inheriting his father's kingdom, he would easily furnish it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If indeed the Romans should send Scipio as commander into Africa as well he was quite confident that Carthage would be very short-lived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio was glad to see and hear him, since he knew that in the entire cavalry of the enemy Masinissa had been the soul <pb id="p.145"/>of everything, and in himself the young man showed<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> clear evidence of his spirit. After giving and receiving promises Scipio set out on the return to Tarraco.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Masinissa by permission of the Romans, that he might not appear to have crossed to the mainland without reason, devastated the nearest lands and returned to Gades.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Just as Mago, who had despaired of success in Spain &mdash;a hope to which first the mutiny of the soldiers and then the rebellion of Indibilis had raised his spirits &mdash;was preparing to cross over to Africa, word reached him from Carthage that the senate commanded him to take the fleet which he had at Gades over to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There he was ordered to hire the greatest possible number of young Gauls and Ligurians, to join Hannibal and not permit a war that had been begun with the greatest vigour and even greater good fortune to decline now.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For that purpose money was brought to Mago from Carthage, and in addition he himself exacted all that he could from the citizens of Gades by plundering not merely their treasury but also the temples,<note>Including the famous temple of Hercules, 12 miles south of the city, on a very small peninsula, now an island (Santipetri). Cf. XXI. xxi. 9; Strabo <hi rend="italics">l.c. sub fin.;</hi> Mela <hi rend="italics">l.c.;</hi> Schulten <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 1922, pp. 38 ff.; 1927, p. 211.</note> and by compelling all private owners to contribute gold and silver to the public funds.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As he was sailing along the coast of Spain he landed soldiers not far from New Carthage and laid waste the nearest farms; then he brought his fleet up to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There after keeping the soldiers on shipboard during the day, he landed them on the shore by night and led them to that part of the wall where (New) Carthage had been stormed by the Romans.<note>Cf. XXVI. xlv. 7 ff.; xlvi. 2.</note> For he thought the city was not held by a garrison of sufficient strength, also that with the <pb id="p.147"/>prospect of changing sides many of the townspeople<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> would take an active part.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But messengers coming in alarm from the country had brought news at the same time of lands laid waste and farmers fleeing and the enemy approaching.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By day the fleet also had been seen, and it was evident that an anchorage before the city had not been chosen without reason.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly the men were kept drawn up under arms inside the gate which faced the lagoon and the sea.<note>Inexact, for the gate at the west end of the city beneath the citadel of Hasdrubal faced neither lagoon nor sea. It merely gave access to a bridge over the canal (outlet of the lagoon) and so by diverging roads to the <hi rend="italics">stagnum</hi> or to the harbour. See plan in Vol. VII; Scullard, 298 f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the enemy pouring out of the ships &mdash;a mob of sailors mingling with the soldiers &mdash;approached the walls with an uproar out of proportion to their power the Romans suddenly opened the gate and burst out with a shout,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> threw the enemy into confusion, routed them at the first charge and the first volley of their missiles and pursued them down to the shore with great slaughter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And if the ships moored to the shore had not received them in their alarm not a man would have survived the flight and the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Even on the ships also there was confusion while, to prevent the enemy from dashing on board along with their own men, they were drawing in the ladders<note>Used in place of gang-planks. Cf. <hi rend="italics">Bell. Alex.</hi> 20. 4; Theocr. 22. 30.</note> and cutting hawsers<note>From stern to shore; XXII. xix.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> 10; Quint. IV. ii. 41. Bows were headed seaward and held by <hi rend="italics">ancoralia</hi> (here <hi rend="italics">ancorae</hi> by the same figure of speech as <quote>shores</quote> for <quote>shore cables</quote>). Cf. 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxx. 10.</note> and cables, to avoid delay in getting away. And many perished miserably while swimming towards the ships, as in the darkness it was not clear what they should make for and what they should avoid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the next day, when the fleet had slipped away, returning towards the Ocean from which it had come, about eight hundred bodies and some two thousand weapons were found between the wall and the shore.</p> <pb id="p.149"/>
				<p>XXXVII. Mago, upon his return to Gades finding<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> himself shut out of the city, put in with his fleet to Cimbii,<note>Mentioned here only.</note> a place not far from Gades. He sent emissaries and complained because the gates had been closed against him, an ally and friend.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Gaditani tried to excuse themselves, saying it was done by a mob enraged on account of some looting committed by the soldiers as they were embarking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He thereupon enticed their <hi rend="italics">suf&#x0115;tes &mdash;the</hi> highest magistrates among the Phoenicians &mdash;together with the treasurer to a conference and ordered them to be scourged and crucified. Then he crossed over on his ships to the island of Pityusa,<note>The larger (now Iviza) separated by a narrow strait from a smaller island also called Ebusus. Cf. XXII. xx. 7; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 76, 78; Strabo III. v. 1; Mela II. 125; Diodorus Sic. V. 16.</note> about a hundred miles from the mainland.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Carthaginians at that time inhabited the island; consequently the fleet was received on friendly terms, and not only were supplies generously furnished but young men to recruit the fleet, and arms also were given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Relying upon these the Carthaginian crossed over to the Balearic Islands, fifty miles away.</p> 
				<p>There are two Balearic Islands,<note>Now Mallorca and Menorca, 30 miles apart, the former with its towns, Palma and Pollentia (Pollenzo); Mela II. 124 and the others just cited.</note> one larger and richer in arms and men. It has a harbour also, where Mago &mdash;and it was now the end of autumn &mdash;believed he could winter comfortably. But an attack was made on the fleet, just as if the inhabitants of the island were Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The sling, now their most used weapon, was then their only one, and not a single man in any other tribe so excels in the art of using it as do all the Balearic Islanders in comparison with other peoples. Accordingly such a volley of stones, <pb id="p.151"/>like the densest hail, was rained upon the fleet now<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> approaching land that, not venturing to enter the harbour, they headed their ships out to sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon they crossed over to the smaller of the Balearic Islands, fertile in its land, not so strong in men and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Disembarking, therefore, they pitched camp in a strong position above the harbour. And having gained possession of the city and its territory without a battle they enlisted two thousand auxiliaries from there, sent them to Carthage and beached their ships to spend the winter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After Mago's retirement from the coast of the Ocean Gades surrendered to the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the results in Spain under the command and auspices of Publius Scipio. Turning over the province to Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, the propraetors,<note>Both had been praetors (in 211 and <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> respectively) but were not technically propraetors, having been sent out as private citizens <hi rend="italics">cum imperio,</hi> thus having the rank and authority of proconsuls. Such was Scipio's own status. Cf. XXIX. xii. 2; xiii. 7; XXXI. xx. 4 (Vol. IX. p. 59 and note).</note> Scipio himself returned to Rome with ten ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And when a session of the senate was granted him in the Temple of Bellona<note>Cf. ix. 5 and note.</note> outside the city, he set forth his achievements in Spain; how many times he had fought pitched battles; how many towns he had taken by force from the enemy; what tribes he had subjected to the sway of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had gone to Spain, he said, against four generals-in-command,<note>Cf. xxviii. 9, note.</note> against four victorious armies; he had left not a Carthaginian in that country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For these achievements he sought the desired triumph but did not make an insistent demand, because it was established that down to that time no one who had commanded without being a magistrate had triumphed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate having <pb id="p.153"/>adjourned, he entered the city on foot,<note>As being a private citizen; of. Vol. VII. p. 80, n. 1; XXXII. vii. 4.</note> and before<note type="margin">B.C. 206</note> him he caused fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-two pounds of silver to be carried to the treasury, and a great number of silver coins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then an election for the choice of consuls was conducted by Lucius Veturius Philo, and all the centuries with great enthusiasm named Publius Cornelius Scipio consul. As his colleague he was given Publius Licinius Crassus, the pontifex maximus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The election was thronged, it is further related, by greater numbers than any other during that war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From every side they had come together, not only to vote but also to get a sight of Publius Scipio, and they flocked in large numbers both to his house<note>It was south of the Forum, just behind the Tabernae Veteres; XLIV. xvi. 10.</note> and to him on the Capitol as he was sacrificing, offering up to Jupiter the hundred oxen he had vowed in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They promised themselves also that, just as Gaius Lutatius had finished the former Punic war, so Publius Cornelius would finish the war that was upon them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and that as he had driven the Carthaginians entirely out of Spain, so he would drive them out of Italy; further assuring themselves that Africa should be his province, just as if the war in Italy were over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then the election of praetors was held. Two who at that time were plebeian aediles were elected, Spurius Lucretius and Gnaeus Octavius, and from private life Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and Lucius Aemilius Papus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>In the fourteenth year of the Punic war, at the<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> time Publius Cornelius Scipio and Publius Licinius Crassus entered upon their consulship, the consuls' provinces were designated, Sicily for Scipio &mdash; <pb id="p.155"/>without casting lots, as his colleague gave way<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> because the charge of religious rites kept a pontifex maximus in Italy &mdash;and the land of the Bruttians for Crassus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then the praetorian assignments were determined by lot. The city praetorship fell to Gnaeus Servilius, Ariminum<note>Cf. ix. 1, note.</note> &mdash;so they used to designate Gaul &mdash;to Spurius Lucretius, Sicily to Lucius Aemilius, Sardinia to Gnaeus Octavius.</p> 
				<p>The senate met on the Capitol.<note>Cf. Vol. VII. p. 2, note; XXIV. x. 1; XXX. xxvii. 1.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There, the question being raised by Publius Scipio, a decree of the senate was passed that the games which he had vowed during the mutiny of the soldiers in Spain should be celebrated by him, drawing upon the money which he had himself brought into the treasury.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereupon he presented the ambassadors from Saguntum. The eldest of these spoke as follows: "Although no calamity exists which goes beyond what we have suffered, conscript fathers, in our desire to keep our faith with you to the very end, nevertheless, such have been your services and those of your generals towards us that we do not regret our disasters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> You undertook the war on our account; having undertaken it you have carried it on with such persistence through thirteen years that often you yourselves reached the extreme of danger and brought the Carthaginian people often to the same pass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Although in Italy you had so terrible a war and Hannibal as your enemy, you sent a consul with his army into Spain, as if to gather up the flotsam of our shipwreck.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Publius Cornelius and Gnaeus Cornelius from the time when they came into the province never ceased doing what was in our favour and against our enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> First of all they restored our city to us; they sent men all over Spain in search of <pb id="p.157"/>our citizens who had been sold and out of slavery<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> restored them to freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When now we had almost attained an enviable lot after the utmost misery, Publius Cornelius and Gnaeus Cornelius, your generals, brought almost more sorrow to us than to you by their death.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>."Then indeed we seemed to ourselves to have been dragged back from distant places to our former abode merely to perish again and to witness a second destruction of our native city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> We were thinking also that there was no need whatever of a Carthaginian general or army for our ruin, that we could be wiped out by the Turduli,<note>The most that we know about this tribe is that they were neighbours of the Turdetani in Baetica, fully 250 miles from Saguntum, which was in the land of the Edetani. Livy and his source (probably Coelius) ignored the impossible distance and made the Turdetani (&sect; 11), or here the Turduli, responsible. App. <hi rend="italics">Hisp.</hi> 10 has <foreign lang="greek">Torbolh=tai,</foreign> and if any Greek source had such a reading as <foreign lang="greek">Tordolh=tai,</foreign> the confusion might perhaps be accounted for. Cf. XXI. vi. 1; XXIV. xlii. 11; Strabo III. i. 6; ii. 11, 15; iii. 5; E. Meyer, <hi rend="italics">Kl. Schr.</hi> II. 408. In Polybius' account no tribe is mentioned (III. xiv. f., xvii).</note> our oldest enemies, who had been responsible for our former destruction as well, when suddenly and unexpectedly you sent us this Publius Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In seeing him declared consul and in reporting, as we intend, to our citizens that we have seen him, our hope, our help, our safety, so elected we deem ourselves the most fortunate of all the Saguntines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On capturing many cities of your enemies in Spain he everywhere separated Saguntines from the number of captives and sent them back to their native city. Finally, as for Turdetania, which was so hostile to us that Saguntum could not stand if that tribe was
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> preserved, he so crushed it in war that not only we, but even our descendants do not need to fear it &mdash;without boasting be it said! We see the ruined city of a people to favour whom Hannibal had destroyed Saguntum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> We receive <pb id="p.159"/>from their territory a revenue which is not more<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> welcome to us as income than as vengeance. For these things &mdash;and we could not hope or pray for greater things from the immortal gods &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> senate and people of Saguntum have sent us, ten ambassadors, to you to express our thanks, at the same time to congratulate you because for these years you have so conducted the war in Spain
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> and in Italy that you hold Spain subdued by arms, not merely so far as the river Hiberus, but even where Ocean sets bounds to the most distant lands, and have left the Carthaginian only so much of Italy as the fortification of his camp encircles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> To Jupiter greatest and best, defender of the Capitoline citadel, we have been bidden not merely to render thanks for all this but with your permission to carry this gift of a golden wreath also to the Capitol on account of your victory. We beg you to permit this, and if it seems best to you, that you ratify and perpetuate by your authority those advantages which your generals have bestowed upon us.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>The senate replied to the Saguntine ambassadors that the destruction and restoration of Saguntum would be to all nations an example of a loyalty which both allies have maintained;

					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Then the rest of the embassies were introduced into the senate and had their hearing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> And upon request of the Saguntines that they might make
					<milestone unit="section" n="21??"/> a tour of Italy so far as they could safely do so, guides were furnished them and letters sent to the different towns, bidding them to receive the Spaniards hospitably.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Thereupon the senate took up matters concerning the state, the enrolment of armies, the assignment of posts.<note>This last had already been done (xxxviii. 12 f.). Popular feeling, however, favoured at least giving Scipio power to cross over from Sicily to Africa if he should deem it best (xlv. 8), or even substituting Africa for Sicily as his assignment.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While it was commonly reported that without casting lots Africa was to be assigned to Publius Scipio as a new province, he himself, no longer satisfied with moderate fame, kept saying that he had been named consul not only to carry on the war but also to finish it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was impossible unless he should himself transport his army to Africa, he said, openly declaring that he would accomplish that result by popular vote if the senate should oppose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This plan being by no means approved by the leading senators, while because of fear or else to curry favour, all the rest failed to speak out, Quintus Fabius Maximus, when asked his opinion, said: "I know that many of you, conscript fathers, hold that we are today debating a closed question, and that whoever expresses an opinion on Africa as a province, just as if it were an open question, will be speaking to no purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For myself, however, in the first place I <pb id="p.163"/>do not understand how Africa is already definitely<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> assigned to that brave and energetic man, the consul, since neither has the senate voted nor the people commanded<note>The people in such a case could act only on request of the senate; XXX. xxvii. 3; xl. 10. Scipio's threat (&sect; 2) would first involve action by the senate.</note> that it be a province for this year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the second place, if it is his, I think that the consul who mocks the senate by pretending to bring before the house business upon which action has been taken is at fault, not a senator who in his proper order states his opinion on the matter under consideration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And I am quite certain that in opposing such haste to cross over into Africa I must expose myself to two charges, first, of an inborn habit of delay,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> which young men are free to call fear and lack of spirit, provided there are as yet no regrets that other men's policies have always appeared at first sight more attractive, mine the better in practice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Secondly, they will accuse me of carping criticism and envy towards the daily increasing fame of a very brave consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From this suspicion if neither my past life and my character nor my dictatorship and five consulships can defend me, together with so much glory won in the field and at home that I tend to be sated rather than to crave it, may my years at least bring exemption. For what rivalry can I have with a man who is not even my son's contemporary?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In my dictatorship, although I was still at the height of my powers and in the stream of great events, no one heard me refuse either in the senate or before the people to have the command of my master of the horse, who was inveighing against me, made equal to mine, a thing which never had been heard of before.<note>Cf. XXII. xxv f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <pb id="p.165"/>By acts rather than words I preferred to gain this<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> result, that one who by the verdict of other men had been made my colleague should presently by his own admission place me above himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Much less would I, who have filled the high offices, set before me competition and rivalry with a young man in the very flower of his youth, with the intention,
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> of course, of having Africa, if it be denied him, awarded as a province to me, who am now worn out by mere living, not only by cares of state. With such glory as has been already earned must I live and die.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> I have prevented Hannibal from conquering, in order that you men whose powers are still strong might even conquer him.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"One thing it will be right, Publius Cornelius, for you to pardon me &mdash;inasmuch as in my own case I have never rated what men say more highly than the state &mdash;namely, if I do not prefer your glory, either, to the welfare of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If, however, there were no war in Italy, or if the enemy were one from whose defeat no glory was to be earned, only then could a man who kept you in Italy, even if he did so with advantage to the state, be thought to have been bent on taking away the war from you and with it your opportunity for fame.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since Hannibal as an enemy with army intact is occupying Italy for the fourteenth year, will <hi rend="italics">you</hi> be dissatisfied with your fame, Publius Cornelius, if in your consulship you shall have driven out of Italy the enemy who has caused us so many losses, so many disasters, and if you shall have the distinction of finishing the present war, just as Gaius Lutatius had that of ending the former Punic war?<note>Cf. <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> 19 <hi rend="italics">fin.;</hi> Polybius I. lix.-lxi for the naval victory off the Aegates Islands, <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date>; XXII. xiv. 13; XXIII. xiii. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Unless Hamilcar is to be rated above Hannibal as a general, or that war above this <pb id="p.167"/>one, or unless that victory was greater and more<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> famous than this one is to be, if only it be our good fortune to win in your consulship.

Here Hamilcar held out until the Roman naval victory brought the First Punic War to an end. Drepana (Trapani), the seaport, was 41 miles away.</note> than have driven the Carthaginians and Hannibal out of Italy?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although you take more delight in glory already won than in glory hoped for, even you would not boast of having rid Spain of the war rather than Italy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>"Not yet has Hannibal reached such a pass that the man who preferred some other war would not seem to have feared rather than despised him. Therefore gird yourself for this war, and not employing your roundabout method &mdash;crossing first to Africa, and then hoping Hannibal will follow you thither &mdash;but
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> rather by a direct march from here aim your campaign at the region where Hannibal is, if you seek your glorious palm for bringing the Punic war to an end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This is also the natural order: first to defend your own possessions, then to proceed to attack those of others. First peace in Italy, then be it war-in Africa! and let our fear abate before we use fear as an offensive weapon against others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If both can be done under your lead and your auspices, after defeating Hannibal here, storm Carthage over there. If one or the other of these two victories must be left to new consuls, the earlier will prove not only greater and more celebrated but the cause as well of the later victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For at the present time, not to mention that the treasury cannot support two widely separated armies, in Italy and in Africa, not to mention that no resources <pb id="p.169"/>remain out of which we may maintain fleets, out of<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> which we may be able to furnish supplies, pray tell me, who does not see how great is the danger involved?

XXVI. viii-xi.</note> from Capua?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What of it that in Africa also the fortune of war will make no distinctions? Let your own house be a warning, your father and uncle, slain with their armies within thirty days, and that in a land where for some years by

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Foreign examples are these that I am recalling and too ancient. Let that same Africa of yours and Marcus Atilius,<note>Regulus; <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> 17 f.; Polybius I. xxv. 7 &mdash;xxxv.; Diodorus Sic. XXIII. 12. 15. Cf. below XXX. xxx. 23.</note> a striking example of good fortune and bad, be a lesson to
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> us. Verily, Publius Cornelius, when you sight Africa from the sea your <pb id="p.171"/>Spanish provinces will seem to you to have been mere<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> child's
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> play. For what is there that is comparable? Over an unmolested sea you sailed along the coast of Italy and Gaul,<note>For this voyage cf. XXVI. xix. 11 ff.</note> and put in with your fleet at Emporiae, a city of our
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> allies. Landing your troops you led them through country everywhere perfectly safe and reached allies and friends of the Roman people at Tarraco. From Tarraco it was then a march from one Roman post to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> another. Along the Hiberus were the armies of your father and uncle, which after losing their generals had gained more spirit even from disaster. Their commander also was the well-known Lucius Marcius,<note>Cf. on xiv. 15.</note> irregularly appointed, to be sure, being chosen for an emergency by vote of the soldiers, but if nobility and the normal magistracies added their distinction, equal to famous generals in all the arts of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> war. (New) Carthage was taken without any interference, since none of the three Punic armies came to the defence of their allies. The rest of your campaign &mdash;and I do not belittle it
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> &mdash;cannot, however, be compared in any way with a war in Africa, where there is no harbour open to our fleet, no subjugated territory, no allied city, no friendly king, no place anywhere to hold your ground, no place to advance, while wherever you look, the country all about you will be hostile and dangerous.</p> 
				<p>"Can it be that you trust Syphax and the Numidians? Let it suffice to have trusted them
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> once. Not always is rashness successful, and treachery seeks in small matters to ensure trustfulness, so that when it becomes worth while, it may deceive with great profit. The enemy did not overpower your father and uncle by force of arms until the Celtiberian allies had done so by
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> treachery. Nor in your own case was <pb id="p.173"/>there as much danger from Mago and Hasdrubal,<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> generals of the enemy, as from Indibilis and Mandonius, who had come under your protection. Can you trust the Numidians after experiencing a mutiny of your own
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> soldiers? Both Syphax and Masinissa prefer that they themselves rather than the Carthaginians should be supreme in Africa, and the Carthaginians rather than anyone else. At present rivalry between them and all possible reasons for contention spur them on because the foreigners whom they fear are far
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> away. Show them Roman arms and a foreign-born army, and now they will rush, as it were, to put out a fire that concerns them
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> all. In one fashion those same Carthaginians have defended Spain; in quite another fashion will they defend the walls of their native city, the temples of the gods, their altars and hearths, when as they go out to battle a frightened wife will escort them and little children will throw themselves in their way.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>"Furthermore, what if the Carthaginians, confidently relying upon the united spirit of Africa, the loyalty of the allied kings, and their own walls, shall take the initiative themselves when they have seen Italy stripped of protection from yourself and your
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> army? What if they either send a new army into Italy from Africa, or order Mago &mdash;and it is known that he has crossed from the Balearic Islands on his fleet and is already sailing along the coast held by the Alpine Ligurians &mdash;to unite with
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Hannibal? Surely we shall be in the same panic as we were recently when Hasdrubal crossed into Italy &mdash;the man whom you, who are about to invest not merely Carthage but all Africa by your army, allowed to slip out of your hands into Italy. He had been defeated by you, <pb id="p.175"/>you will say; all the more do I regret &mdash;and this for<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> your own sake, not merely for that of the state &mdash; that a passage into. Italy was allowed to the

Permit us to attribute to your strategy all that resulted favourably for you and the empire of the Roman people, to ascribe the unfavourable to the uncertainties of war and to fortune. The better and braver man you are the more do your native city and all Italy keep their hold upon so capable a
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> defender. You are unable even yourself to conceal the fact that where Hannibal is, there is the centre and stronghold of this war, since you declare that your reason for crossing over to Africa is in order to draw Hannibal thither. Therefore, be it here, be it there, you will have Hannibal to deal with.</p> 
				<p><quote>Will you, therefore, be stronger, pray, -in Africa when alone, or here, uniting your army with that of your colleague? Do not Claudius also and Livius, the consuls, by a very recent instance prove how great a difference that

					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> person.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of the greatest minds it is true, I am sure, that they compare themselves not only with the living but with eminent men in every age.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> More spirit has an aggressor than a defender. Besides there is greater dread of things unknown; on entering the territory of the enemy you have a near view of their advantages and disadvantages.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If in truth the war were not completed any more promptly by the method which I propose, it would nevertheless conduce to the dignity of the Roman people and its reputation among kings and foreign nations to let it be seen that we have the spirit not only to defend Italy but also to invade Africa.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The tribunes made this decree: <quote>If the<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> consul permits the senate to assign the provinces, we decide that he must stand by the vote of the senate, and we will not allow a bill touching that matter to be brought before the people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If he does not permit, we will come to the defence of a man who refuses to express an opinion on that matter.</quote><note>This decree so fortified the opposition that Scipio was unable to risk a vote referring the question to the people.</note></p> 
				<p>The consul begged for one day to confer with his colleague; on the next day he gave the senate his permission.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The provinces were assigned by decree as follows: to one of the consuls Sicily and the thirty war-ships<note>A small fleet in comparison with the hundred ships assigned to Sicily in <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date>; XXVII. xxii. 9. For an invasion a much larger navy would seem to be required. Add the 30 new ships presently to be built (&sect; 21). But actually only 40 war-ships escorted 400 transports in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>; XXIX. xxvi. 3.</note> which Gius Servilius had commanded in the previous year;<note>Cf. x. 16.</note> and permission to cross over to Africa was given, if he should consider that to be to the advantage of the state; to the other consul the land of the Bruttians and the war with Hannibal, together with the army which he preferred.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> of the two in that region; cf. x. 10; xi. 12; xlvi. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius were to decide between them by lot or by arrangement which of them was to wage war in the Bruttian land with the two legions which the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> consul should leave there, and whichever should have that province assigned to him was to have his command continued for one year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And for the rest who were to command armies and provinces &mdash;apart from consuls and praetors &mdash;their commands were continued. It fell to Quintus Caecilius by lot to wage war together with the consul in the Bruttian land against Hannibal.</p> <pb id="p.193"/>
				<p>Scipio's games were then held with great crowds<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> and great approval on the part of the spectators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As ambassadors Marcus Pomponius Matho and Quintus Catius were sent to Delphi to carry a gift from the spoils of Hasdrubal. They took a golden wreath weighing two hundred pounds and representations of spoils<note>Doubtless in the form of trophies, possibly a pair of them, to flank the golden wreath, presumably to be set up in one of the treasure houses. At XXIII. xi. 3 Apollo had bidden them send a gift when they had preserved their state. So Fabius Pictor, the Roman ambassador, had reported in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date></note> made of a thousand pounds of silver.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Although he had neither gained consent to hold a levy, nor had been especially insistent, Scipio obtained permission to take volunteers and to receive whatever should be given by the allies towards the construction of new ships, &mdash;this because he had stated that the fleet would not be an expense to the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> First the Etruscan communities promised that they would aid the consul, each according to its own resources.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The men of Caere promised grain for the crews and supplies of every kind, the men of Populonium<note>f. XXX. xxxix. 2; now Piombino, the nearest port to Elba. Usually Populonia, but Polybius and Strabo use the neuter (P. at XXXIV. xi. 3; S. at V. ii. 5 f., 8). So also the <hi rend="italics">Itin. Ant.</hi></note> iron, Tarquinii linen for sails, Volaterrae the interior fittings of ships, also grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Arretium promised three thousand shields, an equal number of helmets; and that they would furnish a total of fifty thousand javelins, short spears and lances, with an equal proportion of each type; also axes, shovels, sickles, baskets and hand-mills, as many as were needed for forty war-ships;
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> a hundred and twenty thousand pecks of wheat also; and that they would contribute allowances<note>In addition to their pay.</note> for petty officers and oarsmen. Perusia, Clusium and Rusellae<note>Beyond the Umbro and near Vetulonia; X. iv. 5; xxxvii.</note> promised fir for shipbuilding and a great quantity of grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> He <pb id="p.195"/>used fir also from forests belonging to the state.<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> The communities of Umbria and in addition Nursia and Reate and Amiternum and the whole Sabine district promised soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Marsians, Paelignians and Marrucini in large numbers gave in their names as volunteers for the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Camerinum, although it treated with the Romans on an equal footing, sent an armed cohort of six hundred men.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi>just as if they were allies and hence bound to furnish troops.</note> After thirty keels had been laid down, twenty quinqueremes and ten quadriremes, Scipio so pushed the work that on the forty-fifth day after the timber had been brought from the forests the ships, rigged and equipped, were launched.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He set out for Sicily on thirty war-ships after embarking some seven thousand volunteers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And Publius Licinius came to the two consular armies in the land of the Bruttians. Of these he took the army which Lucius Veturius had commanded as consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He allowed Metellus to command the same legions which he had previously commanded, for he thought Metellus would more easily carry on the war with men accustomed to his authority. The praetors also set out in different directions to their provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And because there was a lack of money for the war the quaestors were ordered to sell a region of Campania extending from the Fossa Graeca<note>Near Cumae and probably dug by that city long before to drain marshy lowlands near the sea; cf. XXII. xvi. 4, Not far away was Liternum, where Scipio Africanus later lived in retirement at his villa, described by Seneca <hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi> 86, 1-12; cf. Val. Max. II. x. 2; and there was his tomb; Seneca <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi></note> to the sea, it being permitted also to give information as to any land which had belonged to a Campanian citizen, so that it might become public land of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the informant one-tenth of the price of the land <pb id="p.197"/>reported was established as a reward.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And to<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> Gnaeus Servilius, the city praetor, was assigned the task of seeing to it that Campanian citizens should dwell only where in accordance with a decree of the senate it was permitted them severally to dwell, and of punishing those who were dwelling elsewhere.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In the same summer Mago the son of Hamilcar embarked upon his fleet picked young men from the smaller of the Balearic Islands, where he had wintered, and brought across to Italy on some thirty war-ships and many transports twelve thousand infantry and about two thousand cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Upon his sudden arrival he also captured Genua,<note>On the Ligurian coast; cf. XXI. xxxii. 5, the first appearance of Genoa in history; XXIX. v. 2. Destroyed by Mago and rebuilt by Spurius Lucretius, XXX. i. 10.</note> since no forces were guarding the sea-coast. Then he put in with his fleet to the coast belonging to the Alpine<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Western; see note on Savo below.</note> Ligurians, in the hope of causing some uprising there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Ingauni,<note>Cf. XXIX. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> Their town was a seaport, Album Ingaunum or Albingaunum, now Albenga; Strabo IV. vi. 1; Mela II. 72; Tacitus <hi rend="italics">Hist.</hi> II. 15 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> The Epanterii were above them on the slopes of the coast range (Alpes Maritimae).</note> a Ligurian tribe, were at that time carrying on a war with the Epanterii Montani.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly the Carthaginian, depositing his plunder at Savo,<note>Now Savona, 27 miles west of Genoa. Though a seaport it is an <hi rend="italics">oppidum Alpinum</hi> as lying at the foot of the Maritime Alps. Eastward of Savona is another coast range; a part of the Apennines. On the dividing line between the two, cf. Strabo <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> and V. i. 3; also Decimus Brutus writing to Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi> XI. xiii. 2.

Ant.</hi> 295.</note> a town at the foot of the Alps, and leaving ten war-ships at anchor to protect it, sent the rest to Carthage to defend the sea-coast, because there was a report that Scipio would cross over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Mago himself made an alliance with the Ingauni, whose friendship he preferred, and set about attacking the Montani. And his army was daily increasing because the Gauls <pb id="p.199"/>on hearing his name flocked together from all sides.<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This fact, when it was made known to the senators through a letter of Spurius Lucretius,<note>Cf. xxxviii. 11, 13; XXX. i. 9 f.</note> kindled great anxiety among them, for fear they had rejoiced in vain two years before over the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, if another equally serious war with only a change of commander should break out from that quarter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> So they ordered Marcus Livius, the proconsul, to bring his army of slave-volunteers from Etruria to Ariminum. Also they assigned to Gnaeus Servilius, the praetor, if he thought it to the advantage of the state, the duty of appointing at his discretion a commander for the two city legions and ordering them to be brought up from the city. Marcus Valerius Laevinus brought these legions to Arretium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Just at that time about eighty Carthaginian transports were captured off Sardinia by Gnaeus Octavius, who was in command of that province. Coelius states that they were laden with grain sent to Hannibal and with provisions, Valerius<note>Antias; cf. Vol. VI. p. 492, n. 2; VII. pp. 24, n. 1 and 187. For Coelius cf. VI. p. 183, n. 2; VII. pp. 41, 323.</note> that they were captured while carrying Etruscan booty and captive Ligurians and Montani to Carthage. In the land of the Bruttians virtually nothing notable was done that year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> An epidemic, equally disastrous to both, had attacked Romans and Carthaginians, with this difference that in addition to disease hunger also weakened the Carthaginian army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Hannibal spent the summer near the temple of Juno Lacinia,<note>Cf. Vol. VI. pp. 115, n., 182 f., notes (especially in reference to the inscription); VII. p. 315. The promontory took its name from <foreign lang="greek">nao/s,</foreign> temple, and is still Capo Nao (or delle Colonne).</note> and there he erected an altar and dedicated it together with a great record of his achievements in a Punic and Greek inscription.</p>

			<div1 type="book" n="28s"><head>Summary of Book XXVIII</head>
				<p>Successes gained in Spain against the Carthaginians
					by Silanus, Scipio's lieutenant, and by his brother Lucius
					Scipio are narrated, and those gained by Publius Sulpicius as
					proconsul with Attalus, King of Asia, as ally against Philip,
					King of the Macedonians, on behalf of the Aetolians.
					When a triumph was awarded by decree to Marcus Livius
					and Claudius Nero, the consuls, Livius, who had commanded in his own province, drove into the city in a four-horse chariot. Nero, who had entered his colleague's
					province to aid him to victory, followed on horseback;
					and in this appearance he earned more fame and respect; for he had done more also than his colleague in the
					war. The fire in Vesta's temple went out owing to the
					carelessness of the virgin who had failed to keep watch
					over it. She was scourged. Publius Scipio brought the
					war with the Carthaginians in Spain to an end in the
					fourteenth year of the war, the fifth year after his arrival;
					and he gained possession of Spain after completely shutting
					the enemy out from occupation of that province. And
					from Tarraco<note>An error for New Carthage; cf. xvii. 12.</note> he crossed over into Africa, to Syphax, King of the Massylians, and made a treaty with him. Hasdrubal son of Gisgo dined with him there, reclining on the
					same couch. Scipio gave a gladiatorial show at New
					Carthage in honour of his father and uncle, not by gladiators
					but by men who went into the arena either to honour the
					general or in accepting a challenge. In that show princes
					who were brothers fought for kingship with the sword.
					During the siege of the city of Gisia<note>Astapa in the text, xxii. 2; xxiii. 5.</note> the citizens slew their children and wives upon a pyre which they had built and threw themselves upon it. Scipio himself, when a
					mutiny broke out in one part of the army while he was
					<pb id="p.203"/>
					seriously ill, upon recovering quelled it and compelled
					the rebellious peoples in Spain to surrender. And he
					made friends with Masinissa, King of the Numidians,
					who promised him assistance if he should cross over to
					Africa. Having made friends with the men of Gades also
					after the departure of Mago, who had received written
					orders from Carthage to cross over to Italy, Scipio returned
					to Rome and was elected consul. When he begged for
					Africa as his province, while Quintus Fabius Maximus
					opposed, Sicily was given to him and he was permitted
					to cross over to Africa if he thought that for the advantage
					of the state. Mago son of Hamilcar crossed over to Italy
					from the smaller of the Balearic Islands, where he had
					wintered.</p>

			<div1 type="book" n="29"><head>Book XXIX</head>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, now that he had reached Sicily, assigned<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> his volunteers to their ranks and centuries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Three hundred of them, young men in the bloom of their youth and conspicuous for their physical strength, he kept about him unarmed and ignorant of the purpose for which they were being reserved without being organized in centuries or furnished with arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then he chose out of the number of the younger men of all Sicily three hundred horsemen, men of high rank and of wealth, to cross over with him into Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He appointed a day also on which they were to present themselves equipped and furnished with horses and arms. Such service far from home seemed to them formidable and likely to bring many hardships and great dangers on land and sea. And concern on this account troubled not merely the men themselves but also their parents and relations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the day which had been appointed came the men displayed their arms and horses. Then Scipio said reports were coming to him that some of the Sicilian horsemen shrank from that service as formidable and difficult.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If any were of that mind he preferred that they should confess it to him at once, rather than complain later and prove spiritless soldiers and useless for the state. Let them declare what was their mind; he would give them a kindly hearing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When one of them ventured to say that <pb id="p.209"/>if he was free to choose whichever he wished he did<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> not wish to serve at all, thereupon Scipio said to him:
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <quote>Accordingly, since you have not concealed what your mind is, young man, I will furnish a substitute for you, and to him you shall hand over your arms and horse and the other equipment for the service, and forthwith shall take him away with you to your home, train him and see that he is taught horsemanship and the use of arms.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As the man gladly accepted the terms Scipio turned over to him one of the three hundred unarmed men that-he had. When the others saw the horseman thus discharged with the consent of the commander, every man excused himself and took a substitute.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus three hundred Sicilians were replaced by Roman horsemen without expense to the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Of their training and drilling the Sicilians were in charge, because the general's order was that any man who failed to do so should himself serve.<note>A similar method of raising cavalry inexpensively was used by the Spartan King Agesil&amacr;us in order to make war upon the Persian King's satrap Tissaphernes near Ephesus, <date value="-395">395 B.C.</date>; Xenophon <hi rend="italics">Hell.</hi> III. iv. 15; <hi rend="italics">Ages.</hi> I. 24; Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Ages. 9.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They say that this cavalry squadron proved excellent and was of value to the state in many battles.</p> 
				<p>Then while mustering the legions he chose out of them soldiers who had served for the greatest number of campaigns, especially those who had done so under Marcellus as commander, believing them to have been schooled by the best training and in particular to be most skilled
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> in besieging cities in consequence of the long siege of Syracuse. For he was planning nothing small, but already the destruction of Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thereupon he distributed his army among the towns, requisitioned grain from the Sicilian cities, spared the grain imported from <pb id="p.211"/>Italy. He repaired the old ships,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> of the previous year at least; of. XXVIII. xlv. 8, where thirty war-ships are mentioned.</note> and with these<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> sent Gaius Laelius to Africa for plunder. The new ships he beached at Panormus, that they might winter out of the water, since they had been built in haste of green timber.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Every preparation for the war having been made, he came to Syracuse, which was not yet quite peaceful after the great unsettlement due to the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Greeks were making their claims to properties granted them by the senate against certain Italians who were holding on with the same use of force with which they had seized the property during the war.<note>Evidently Laevinus' efforts to remedy abuses had not been altogether successful (XXVI. xl. 1). Syracusans (<hi rend="italics">Graeci</hi>) had often been unable to recover landed property still occupied and forcibly held by Italians; of. <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xxx. 10; xxxii. 6 (the latter implying the senate's promise of compensation).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Thinking it of the utmost importance to keep a promise given by the state, Scipio restored their property to the Syracusans, partly by
					<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> an edict, partly also by granting hearings against those who persisted in maintaining an unlawful possession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> This act was acceptable not only to the owners themselves but to all the communities of Sicily as well, and all the more energetically did they render assistance for the war.</p> 
				<p>In the same summer a great war broke out in Spain, instigated by Indibilis<note>Cf. XXVIII. xxiv ff. and note on xxiv. 3. Indibilis was prince of a north-eastern tribe, the Ilergetes; XXVI. xlix. 11; cf. XXVIII. xxvii. 5.</note> of the Ilergetes for no other reason than because contempt for other generals sprang from admiration for Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> He thought that Scipio was the one general left to the Romans, the rest having been killed by Hannibal; that consequently after the slaying of the Scipios they had no one else to send to Spain, and had also, once the war grew more serious in Italy, summoned him to face Hannibal; that, besides <pb id="p.213"/>having merely nominal commanders in Spain, the<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> Romans had taken away the veteran army also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> There was nothing but confusion and an untrained mob of recruits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Never would there be such an opportunity for the liberation of Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Slaves they had been down to that time, either to Carthaginians or to Romans, and not by turns to the one people or the other but at times to both at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> The Carthaginians had been driven out by the Romans; the Spaniards, if they should agree, were able to drive out the Romans, so that, free from all foreign authority, Spain might return permanently to its ancestral customs and usages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> By these and similar utterances he stirred up not only his own countrymen but also the Ausetani,<note>Their territory reached from the Pyrenees south-east to the Mediterranean, Gerunda being their chief town (now Gerona). Cf. XXI. xxiii. 2; lxi. 8 (here and in XXXIX. lvi. 1 they even approach the Ebro; not so in Casear <hi rend="italics">B.C.</hi> I. x. 2); XXVI. xvii. 4 (doubtful reading); XXXIV. xx. 1; below, ii. 5; iii. 3.</note> a neighbouring tribe, and other peoples adjoining his territory and theirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> And thus within a few days thirty thousand infantry and about four thousand horse came together in the territory of the Sedetani,<note>Often confused with the Edetani, and north of the Ebro, but we do not know their exact location. Cf. XXVIII. xxiv. 4; xxxi. 7.</note> in accordance with their instructions.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman commanders on their part, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus,<note>Cornelius Lentulus and Manlius had been praetors in 211 and <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> respectively; XXV. xli. 12; XXVI. xxiii. 1; sent to Spain <hi rend="italics">cum imperio;</hi> cf. XXVIII. xxxviii. 1; styled proconsuls without having held the consulship; below, xiii. 7.</note> for fear
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the war might grow more serious from neglect of the first hostile acts, likewise united their armies, and leading their soldiers through the Ausetanian territory with restraint on an enemy's soil, as though it <pb id="p.215"/>were friendly, they reached the place where their<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> enemies had concentrated and pitched camp three miles away from their camp. At first a vain effort was made through envoys to make them abandon fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then when an attack was suddenly made upon Roman foragers by Spanish horse and from a Roman outpost horsemen were sent to the rescue, there was a cavalry battle with no success for either side worth mentioning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At sunrise on the following day, under arms and drawn up, all of them displayed their battle-line at a distance of about a mile from the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Ausetani were in the centre; of the wings the Ilergetes occupied the right, unimportant Spanish tribes the left. Between the wings and the centre they had made spaces broad enough to send the cavalry through when the time came.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And the Romans, having drawn up their army in the customary fashion, imitated this feature only of the enemy's line, that they likewise left broad spaces between the legions for the passage of cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But Lentulus thought that whichever side should first send its cavalry out into the enemy's line with its gaping intervals would use its cavalry to advantage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He therefore ordered Servius Cornelius, a tribune of the soldiers, to command his cavalry to give their horses free rein through the broad openings in the battle-line of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Lentulus himself, after the infantry battle had begun without success, delayed only long enough to bring up the thirteenth legion from the reserves into the front line to support the twelfth legion, which had been placed on the left wing facing the Ilergetes and was giving way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now that the battle was evenly balanced there, he came up to Lucius Manlius, who <pb id="p.217"/>was in the foremost ranks, encouraging the men<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> and bringing up reserves to such positions as the case required.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He informed him that all was secured on the left wing; that he had already sent Servius Cornelius to surround the enemy with a whirlwind attack of cavalry.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Scarcely had Lentulus said this when the Roman horse, charging into the midst of the enemy, threw the infantry lines into confusion and at the same time closed for the Spanish cavalry the route by which they might launch their attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Accordingly the Spaniards gave up the cavalry battle and dismounted. The Roman generals, on seeing the broken ranks of the enemy, and their fright and alarm and the wavering standards, exhorted and implored their soldiers to attack the discouraged enemy and not allow the line to re-form.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The barbarians would have failed to withstand so impetuous an attack, had not even their prince, Indibilis, exposed himself with the dismounted cavalry in front of the first units of the infantry. At that point a fierce battle continued for some time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Finally, when those who kept on fighting round the prince, who resisted though half-dead, but was pinned to the ground by a javelin, were overwhelmed by missile weapons and fell, at that moment began a flight pell-mell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Greater numbers were slain because the horsemen had left no room to mount their horses, and because the Romans made a spirited attack upon the terrified. And they did not withdraw until they had routed the enemy out of his camp as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Thirteen thousand Spaniards were slain that day, about one thousand eight hundred captured. Of the Romans and their allies little more than two <pb id="p.219"/>hundred fell, mainly on the left wing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Those of the<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> Spaniards who were driven out of their camp or had escaped from the battle scattered at first over the country and then returned to their respective communities.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then they were summoned by Mandonius to a council, and there, after lamenting their heavy losses and berating those who were responsible for the war, they voted that envoys should be sent to arrange for a surrender of arms and a capitulation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the envoys laid the blame upon Indibilis as responsible-for the war and upon the rest of their leading men, most of whom, they said, had fallen in the battle, and offered to deliver their arms and surrender, the answer given them was: that their surrender would be accepted only in case they should deliver Mandonius and the other instigators of the war alive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If not, the generals said they would lead their army into the lands of the Ilergetes and Ausetani and the other tribes one after another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Such was the reply given to the legates and reported by them to the council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thereupon Mandonius and the other leaders were seized and handed over to be punished. For the peoples of Spain peace was restored, a double tribute for that year and grain for six months exacted, also cloaks and togas for the army; and hostages were accepted from about thirty tribes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Thus a rebellious uprising in Spain was incited and suppressed within a few days with no serious consequences, and alarm was completely shifted to Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Gaius Laelius, having reached Hippo Regius<note>Livy or his Roman source must have confused Hippo Diarrhytus (Bizerte) with Hippo Regius (near Bone), which was ten days' journey from Carthage (so Procopius <hi rend="italics">Bell.</hi> IV (<hi rend="italics">Vand.</hi> II.), iv. 26; Mela I. 33; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 22; VI. 212). Laelius would not lay waste land claimed by Masinissa. Cf. p. 334 for the real Hippo Regius.</note> by night, led out his soldiers and marines under their standards at daybreak to lay the country <pb id="p.221"/>waste. Since everybody was free from concern, as<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> if in peace-time, great losses were inflicted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And excited messengers filled Carthage with great alarm, reporting that the Roman fleet and Scipio as commander-in-chief had arrived. In fact it had been previously rumoured that he had already crossed over to Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Lacking exact information also as to how many ships the messengers had seen and how large a force was laying waste the country, they exaggerated every report under the stimulus of fear. Accordingly alarm and panic at first, then dejection came over their spirits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So far, they said, had fortune changed that those who as victors had but lately had their own army before the walls of Rome and, after laying low so many armies of the enemy, had by force or by voluntary action received the surrender of all the peoples of Italy, with the shifting fortune
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> of war were now destined to see the devastation of Africa and a siege of Carthage, when they had no such strength as the Romans had possessed to endure all that.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For them, they said, the Roman populace, for them Latium had always furnished a greater and more numerous body of young men growing up in place of so many armies slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As for their own populace, they were unwarlike in the city, unwarlike in the country. Hireling auxiliaries were being recruited from the Africans,<note>The earlier inhabitants, mostly rustics, many of them mercenary soldiers; cf. XXVIII. xiv. 4, 19; xx. 1, etc.; below, iv. 2.</note> a race shifting with every fickle breath of hope and lacking in loyalty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Of the kings, moreover, Syphax had been alienated after his conference with Scipio,<note>Cf. XXVIII. xviii.</note> they said, and Masinissa by open defection had shown himself their bitterest enemy. Nowhere was there any hope, nowhere any aid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Mago was neither setting in motion any uprising on the part of Gaul, <pb id="p.223"/>nor uniting with Hannibal; and Hannibal himself<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> by this time was on the decline both in repute and in strength.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the laments into which men had fallen in consequence of the recent news when impending alarm roused them again to deliberate how they should meet the dangers of the moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was decided to hold levies speedily in city and country; to send men to hire African auxiliaries; to fortify the city, to bring in grain, to provide arms offensive and defensive, to equip ships and send them to Hippo to face the Roman fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While they were already thus employed the news at last came that Laelius, not Scipio, had sailed across and only sufficient forces to raid the farms; that the bulk of the main army was still in Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So there was a breathing spell, and they set about sending embassies to Syphax and other princes, to cement an alliance. To Philip also envoys were sent to promise him two hundred talents of silver, on condition that he should cross over into Sicily or Italy.<note>Instead of doing so Philip made a treaty with the Romans; below, xii. 14. For a previous effort of the king to form an alliance with Carthage cf. XXIII. xxxiii. f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Men were sent likewise to their own commanders in Italy, that by every sort of alarm they should keep Scipio there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only envoys were sent to Mago but twenty-five war-ships, six thousand infantry, eight hundred horsemen, seven elephants, and in addition a large sum of money to hire auxiliaries. Relying upon these resources he was to advance nearer to the city of Rome with his army and unite with Hannibal.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Such were their plans and deliberations at Carthage <pb id="p.225"/>when Masinissa, aroused by the report of a Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> fleet, came with a few horsemen to Laelius,<note>A different account, followed by Livy in xxxiii. 9, placed Masinissa, at the time of Laelius' landing, in the region of the Emporia, far away to the south-east (cf. xxv. 12 and note).</note> who was carrying off a vast amount of booty from territory that lacked troops and garrisons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Masinissa complained that Scipio was conducting the war without spirit in not having already transported his army to Africa, while the Carthaginians were panic-stricken and Syphax was entangled in wars with neighbours. He was certain, he said, that if Syphax should be given time to settle his affairs to his own satisfaction, there would be no real loyalty in his dealings with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Laelius should exhort and spur Scipio on to avoid delay. For himself, although he had been driven out of his kingdom, he would assist with no inconsiderable forces of infantry and cavalry. Laelius also must not tarry in Africa. A fleet, he believed, had sailed from Carthage, and with that fleet it was unsafe to engage in the absence of Scipio. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Directly after this conversation Laelius sent Masinissa away, and on the following day he weighed anchor at Hippo, his ships booty-laden, and sailing back to Sicily delivered Masinissa's messages to Scipio.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>About the same time the ships which had been sent to Mago from Carthage came into port between Ligurian Albingaunum and Genua.<note>For that coast and its ports cf. XXVIII. xlvi. 8 ff. and notes. Here Savo (Savona), or Vada Sabat(i)a (2 1/2 miles farther west), is evidently meant.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In that region, as it happened, Mago had his fleet at the time. On hearing the words of the envoys, who urged him to get together the largest possible armies, he at once held a council of Gauls and Ligurians; for great numbers of both nations were present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And he told <pb id="p.227"/>them that he had been sent to restore their liberty,<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> and that forces were being sent to him from home, as they themselves saw; but with what resources, with how large an army that war was to be waged depended upon themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were two Roman armies, he said, one in Gaul,<note>Cf. XXVIII. ix. 1 and note.</note> the other in Etruria. He was sure that Spurius Lucretius would unite with Marcus Livius;<note>Cf. <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xlvi. 12 f.; below, xiii. 4.</note> that many thousands must be armed for resistance to two generals, two Roman armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Gauls said that they were entirely willing to do so, but that since they had almost before their eyes one Roman camp within their borders and another in the neighbouring land of Etruria, if it should become known that they had aided the Carthaginian by furnishing auxiliaries, forthwith hostile armies would invade their territory from both directions. From Gauls he should require such support as could be given in secret.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ligurians were free to act, they said, since Roman camps were far from their land and their cities; it was right that <hi rend="italics">they</hi> should arm their young men and take their proper share in the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Ligurians did not refuse, but simply asked for two months' time to hold levies. Meanwhile Mago by sending men secretly through their territory hired Gauls as soldiers. Supplies also of every kind were coming to him in secret from the Gallic nations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Livius led his army of slave-volunteers over from Etruria into Gaul and, having united with Lucretius, prepared to confront Mago, should he move out of Liguria towards the city;<note>It was safe to assume that he would follow Hasdrubal's example in making for the Adriatic coast, to enter Italy at Ariminum. The shorter Riviera route was never practicable until <date value="-109">109 B.C.</date>, when the Via Aurelia was extended to Pisae, Genua, and Vada Sabatia; Strabo V. i. 11; cf.

XXVIII. xii. 6; xlii. 18.</note> at the<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> foot of the Alps, he too would remain where he was, near Ariminum, for the defence of Italy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the return of Gaius Laelius from Africa Scipio was spurred on by Masinissa's encouragement, and the soldiers seeing booty from the land of the enemy being brought ashore from an entire fleet, were likewise fired with a desire to cross over as soon as possible. The greater design, however, was interrupted by a lesser, that of recovering the city of Locri, which in the rebellion of Italy had also gone over to the Carthaginians.<note>As Livy has twice told: in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date>, at XXIII. xxx. 8, and more fully under 215 in XXIV. i.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Bright hopes of accomplishing that purpose, moreover, arose from a petty circumstance. There was brigandage rather than normal war operations in the country of the Bruttii, where a beginning had been made by the Numidians, and the Bruttians fell in with that practice not more on account of their Punic alliance than of their own nature.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Finally the Roman soldiers also from a kind of infection now delighted in plunder, making raids upon the enemy's farms just as far as their commanders permitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They had overpowered certain Locrians straying from the city and had carried them off to Regium. In the number of these captives were some artisans who, as it happened, were in the habit of plying their trade for hire among the Carthaginians in the citadel of Locri.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These men were recognized by leading Locrians who, on being driven out by the opposing party, which had surrendered Locri to Hannibal, had retired to Regium. On being asked the questions usually put by men long absent, the artisans first <pb id="p.231"/>told them what was going on at home, and then<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> inspired the hope that, if ransomed and sent back, they would betray the citadel to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was there, they said, that they dwelt and among the Carthaginians were trusted in everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly the leading men, being tormented by home-sickness and at the same time fired with a desire for vengeance on their enemies, at once ransomed the artisans and sent them back after agreeing upon a plan of action and signals for the display of which in the distance they should be on the watch.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They themselves went to Scipio at Syracuse, with whom were some of the exiles. There they reported the promises of the captives and inspired in the consul a hope which gave good prospect of success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Consequently Marcus Sergius and Publius Matienus, tribunes of the soldiers, were sent with them and ordered to take three thousand soldiers from Regium to Locri. And a written order was sent to the propraetor<note><hi rend="italics">I.e. legatus pro praetore,</hi> representing Scipio. Cf. viii. 5; xvii. 10.</note> Quintus Pleminius to assist in carrying out the project.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Setting out from Regium, carrying ladders constructed for the height of the citadel as reported, about midnight they set a signal<note>Cf. XXVIII. v. 17 and note.</note> for the betrayers of the citadel from the place agreed upon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These men were ready and alert, and after they on their part also had lowered ladders made for that very purpose and at several different places at the same time had admitted scaling parties, before any outcry could arise came the attack upon the Carthaginian guards, who in the absence of any such fear naturally were asleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At first it was the groans of the dying indistinctly heard; then sudden terror on awaking, and confused action, since the reason was unknown; finally greater certainty as they awakened <pb id="p.233"/>one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By this time every man was shouting<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> his loudest <quote>To arms!</quote> that enemies were on the citadel and guards being cut down. And the Romans, who were by no means equal in numbers, would have been overpowered, had not an outcry raised by the men who were outside the citadel made it uncertain from what quarter the sounds came, while everything they imagined was intensified by the uproar in the dark.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Accordingly the Carthaginians, supposing the citadel to be already filled with the enemy, were terrified, gave up fighting and fled to the other citadel; for there are two not far apart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The inhabitants were holding the city, set between combatants as a prize for the victors. From the two citadels came slight engagements every day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Quintus Pleminius commanded the Roman, Hamilcar the Carthaginian garrison. Summoning reinforcements from neighbouring places they kept increasing their numbers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Finally Hannibal himself was on the way, and the Romans would not have held out if the mass of the Locrians, embittered by the arrogance and greed of the Carthaginians, had not taken the side of the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, on being informed that the situation at Locri had become more critical and that Hannibal himself was approaching, was afraid to take risks for the garrison as well, since it was not easy to retire from the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly he too set out from Messana, after leaving his brother Lucius Scipio there in command of the garrison; and as soon as the strait shifted with the tide, he cast off with . . . ships while the current favoured.<note><hi rend="italics">1 I.e.</hi> the so-called <quote>descending</quote> tide, running south into the Ionian Sea; XXIII. xli. 11; Strabo I. iii. 11. This strait has marked tides
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> &mdash;very rare in the Mediterranean. Cf. the Euripus, XXVIII. vi. 10 and note.</note> And Hannibal <pb id="p.235"/>sent a messenger from the river Bulotus &mdash;it is not far<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> from the city of Locri &mdash;ordering his men to engage in battle with the Romans and Locrians with the utmost violence at daybreak, while, when all eyes were turned in the direction of that conflict, he should himself attack the city unawares from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> rear. When he came upon the battle, already begun at daybreak, he did not wish to shut himself in the citadel, where he would have clogged a cramped space by his numbers, and on the other hand he had not brought ladders for scaling city
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> walls. After making a pile of the soldiers' baggage and displaying his line of battle at no great distance from the walls to frighten the enemy, while ladders and other requisites for an assault were being prepared, he rode round the city with his Numidian horsemen, to discover just where to make the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> attack. He had approached the wall when a man who happened to stand nearest to him was struck by a missile from a scorpion. Frightened away by an occurrence so dangerous, he thereupon ordered the recall to be sounded and fortified a camp beyond the range of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> missiles. The Roman fleet sailing from Messana reached Locri while several hours of daylight
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> remained. All were landed from the ships and before sunset they entered the city.</p> 
				<p>On the following day a battle was begun by the Carthaginians from their citadel, and Hannibal, having made ready the ladders and everything else for the assault, was coming close to the walls when suddenly the Romans opened a gate and sallied out against an enemy who feared anything but
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that. In making this surprise attack they slew about two hundred. As for the rest, Hannibal on <pb id="p.237"/>learning that the consul was there withdrew them<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> to his camp, and sending word to the men in the citadel to shift for themselves, he broke camp in the night and marched
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> away. And the men in the citadel set fire to the houses which they were occupying, that the commotion might delay the enemy, and with a speed that resembled flight overtook their own column before nightfall.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, seeing that the citadel had been abandoned by the enemy and the site of the camp deserted, summoned the Locrians to an assembly and stoutly upbraided them for their revolt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He punished those who had prompted it and bestowed their property upon the leaders of the other party in view of their conspicuous loyalty towards the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As regards their state, he said he would neither grant the Locrians anything nor take anything away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They should send envoys to Rome; and whatever lot the senate thought it proper for them to have would be theirs. Even though they had deserved ill of the Roman people, of this he was certain, that they would be in a better position under angry Romans than they were under friendly Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Leaving Pleminius, his lieutenant, to defend the city with the force which had captured the citadel, Scipio crossed over to Messana with the troops with which he had come.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>With such arrogance and cruelty had the Locrians been treated by the Carthaginians after their revolt from the Romans that they could bear minor wrongs not only calmly but almost willingly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In actual fact, however, so far did Pleminius surpass Hamilcar, commandant of the garrison, so far did the Roman soldiers in the garrison surpass the Carthaginians in <pb id="p.239"/>villainy and greed that they seemed to be competing<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> not in arms but in vices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of all the things that make the power of the stronger odious to the helpless man not one was overlooked by commander and soldiers in dealing with the townspeople. Unutterable insults were practised upon their own persons, upon their children, upon their wives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It goes without saying that their avarice did not refrain from despoiling even sacred things. And not only were other temples desecrated, but also the treasure chambers of Proserpina,<note>The chief divinity of Locri was Persephone, her famous temple and rich treasury being just outside the walls and to the north-west. Cf. xviii. 3.</note> untouched in every age except that they were said to have been despoiled by Pyrrhus, who met with a signal punishment and restored the plunder gained by his sacrilege.<note>Cf. xviii. 4-6 and notes.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Consequently, just as formerly the king's ships, battered and wrecked, had landed nothing intact but the goddess' sacred money which they were trying to carry
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> away, so on this occasion also, with a different kind of disaster that same money visited insanity upon all who had shared in that desecration of the temple, and mutually turned commander against commander, soldier against soldier, with the frenzy of enemies.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The chief command belonged to Pleminius. Part of the soldiers whom he had brought from Regium were under him, part under the tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having stolen a silver cup from the house of a citizen, a fleeing soldier of Pleminius was being pursued by the owners when he chanced to meet Sergius and Matienus, tribunes of the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By order of the tribunes the cup was taken away from the man. <pb id="p.241"/>Thereupon angry words followed and shouting,<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> finally a battle between Pleminius' soldiers and those of the tribunes, while numbers and rioting increased in proportion as one side or the other gained a timely arrival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The soldiers of Pleminius were worsted, and when they came running to him displaying bloody wounds, not without angry shouts as they reported insults that had been heaped even upon him in an altercation, he was inflamed with anger, dashed out of his house, summoned the tribunes and ordered them to be stripped and the rods made ready.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While time was being taken to strip them &mdash;for they resisted and called upon the soldiers to help them &mdash; suddenly soldiers, flushed by their recent victory, came running from every quarter, just as if there had been a call to arms against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And when they caught sight of the tribunes' backs already welted by the rods, upon that they were indeed suddenly fired to a much more uncontrollable madness, and after roughly handling the lictors in shameful fashion, without regard even for humanity, not to say for the dignity of his rank,<note>Pleminius represents Scipio and has <hi rend="italics">imperium.</hi></note> they assaulted the legatus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, having separated and cut him off from his men, they slashed him as if an enemy and, mutilating his nose and ears, left him almost lifeless.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>These acts being reported at Messana, Scipio a few days later sailed to Locri on a <hi rend="italics">hex&emacr;ris.</hi><note>This rare type of vessel had been used in the First Punic War for the flag-ships of Regulus and Manlius; Polybius I. xxvi. 11. It was the next grade above the quinquereme. Cf. XXVIII. xxx. 11, note.</note> Then having heard the case of Pleminius and the tribunes, he discharged Pleminius as innocent and left him in command of the same place, while the tribunes were adjudged guilty and put in chains, to be sent to the <pb id="p.243"/>senate at Rome; whereupon he returned to Messana<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> and thence to Syracuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pleminius was beside himself with rage, thinking the wrong done to him had been overlooked by Scipio and treated as too trivial; also that no one else was capable of naming a penalty for the offence except a man who had known its barbarity by suffering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly he ordered the tribunes to be brought before him, and had them mangled by every torture which any human body can endure and then put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not satisfied with a penalty paid by the living either, he threw them out unburied. The like cruelty was used by him against leading men of the Locrians who, he learned, had gone to Publius Scipio to complain of the outrages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then in anger he multiplied the shameful acts which, prompted previously by lust and greed, he had perpetrated upon the allies, and brought infamy and odium not only upon himself but also upon his general.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The time for the elections was already at hand when a letter from Publius Licinius, the consul, reached Rome, reporting that he and his army were suffering from a serious malady, and that they could not have held out if an equally violent or even more serious disease had not been visited upon the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, since he was unable to come in person to the elections, he would name Quintus Caecilius Metellus dictator to hold the elections, if the senators approved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was to the interest of the state, he said, that the army of Quintus Caecilius should be discharged; for at present his army had nothing to do, since Hannibal had already withdrawn his troops into winter quarters; and so violent a malady had befallen Caecilius' camp that, unless the troops were promptly disbanded, not one man, it <pb id="p.245"/>seemed, would survive. The consul was permitted<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> by the senate to do whatever he thought consistent with the public interest and his own conscience.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At that time religious scruples had suddenly assailed the citizens because in the Sibylline books, which were consulted on account of the frequent showers of stones that year, an oracle was found that, if ever a foreign foe should invade the land of
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Italy, he could be driven out of Italy and defeated if the Idaean Mother<note>Kybele (Cybele), the Phrygian Mother of the Gods; Preller, <hi rend="italics">Griechische Mythologie</hi> 14. 643 ff.; Roscher, <hi rend="italics">Lex.</hi> II. i. 1638 if., 1666 ff.; Catullus 63; Lucretius II. 600 ff.; Dio Cass. frag. 57. 61; Strabo XII. v. 3; Appian <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 56; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Harusp.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The discovery of that oracle by the decemvirs impressed the senators all the more because the ambassadors also who had carried a gift to Delphi reported that, when they offered sacrifices themselves to Pythian Apollo, the omens had been favourable, and that likewise from the sanctum there had come a response that a much greater victory was in prospect for the Roman people than that from spoils of which they were bringing gifts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To the facts supporting that same hope the senators added Publius Scipio's state of mind, virtually forecasting the end of the war, in that he demanded Africa as his province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so, that they might the sooner be in possession of the victory which foreshadowed itself in oracles, forecasts<note>Referring mainly to Scipio's confident anticipation, while <quote>oracles</quote> covers the Sibylline prophecy and <quote>responses</quote> that from Delphi (Gronovius).</note> and responses, they planned and discussed what should be the method of transporting the goddess to Rome.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Asia the Roman people had as yet no allied states. They bore in mind, however, that Aesculapius<note>Cf. X. xlvii. 7; <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> 11; Strabo <hi rend="italics">l. c.</hi> (cf. n. 1).</note> also had been summoned once upon a <pb id="p.247"/>time from Greece on account of an epidemic, while<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> there was as yet no treaty of alliance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that at present on account of a joint war against Philip they had already entered into friendly relations with King Attalus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thinking that he would do what he could for the sake of the Roman people, they decided to send ambassadors to him. These were Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had been twice consul<note>Cf. XXX. xxiii. 5. One list of the consuls gives Laevinus a first consulship in <date value="-220">220 B.C.</date>; Chronogr. an. 354 in <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> I. p. 524.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For them they voted five quinqueremes,<note>See XXVIII. xxx. 11 and note. Whatever may have been the arrangement of the oars on a quinquereme, it is clear that these larger vessels were meant to impress all who saw them with the <hi rend="italics">dignitas</hi> of the Roman state.</note> that in keeping with the dignity of the Roman people they might visit lands where the highest respect for the Roman name was to be won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The ambassadors on the voyage to Asia made their way up to Delphi and consulted the oracle, enquiring what hope of accomplishing the task for which they had been sent from home it foresaw for themselves and the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The response, they say, was that they should gain what they sought with the help of King Attalus; that after conveying the goddess to Rome they were then to make sure that the best man at Rome should hospitably welcome her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They came to the king at Pergamum. He courteously received the ambassadors and, escorting them to Pess&#x012D;nus in Phrygia,<note>The region was still held by the Gallic invaders, but the temple was favoured and adorned by the kings at Pergamum.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sent on in advance by the ambassadors, Marcus Valerius Falto brought the news that they were bringing the goddess; they must seek out the best man in the state to receive her with due hospitality.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On hearing of this Philip, fearing some greater disturbance might begin among neighbouring tribes and peoples, hastened by forced marches to Apollonia,<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip laid waste the farms of the Apollonians and, moving his troops up to the city, gave the Roman an opportunity to engage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As soon as he saw that they remained inactive, merely defending the walls, Philip, who had not sufficient confidence in his forces to assault the city and was desirous of peace <pb id="p.253"/>with the Romans also, if possible, just as with the<note type="margin">B.C. 205</note> Aetolians, but if not, of making an armistice, retired to his own kingdom without provoking any further animosities by a fresh conflict.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>About the same time the Epirotes, weary of the protracted war, first sounding the disposition of the Romans, sent ambassadors to Philip in regard to a general peace, asserting their confidence that it
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> would be agreed upon if he should come to a conference with Publius Sempronius, the Roman general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The king was easily prevailed upon to cross over into Epirus, for he himself was not disinclined to peace.

The first to speak was Philip, the magistrate, begging the king and at the same time the Roman general to make an end of the war and grant that favour to the Epirotes.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the consulship of Marcus Cornelius and<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> Publius Sempronius, this being the fifteenth year of the Punic war, the province of Etruria was assigned by decree to Cornelius with the old army, the land of the Bruttii to Sempronius, with orders to enrol new legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As for the praetors, the city jurisdiction fell to Marcus Marcius, that over strangers and also the province of Gaul to Lucius Scribonius Libo, Sicily to Marcus Pomponius Matho, Sardinia to Tiberius Claudius Nero.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Publius Scipio's command was continued for one year with the army and the fleet which he then had. The same was done in the case of Publius Licinius, who was to hold the Bruttian territory with two legions so long as the consul should judge it to the public interest for him to remain in the province with a high command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcus Livius also and Spurius Lucretius had their <pb id="p.257"/>commands continued, with two legions each to defend<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> Gaul against Mago.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As for the command in Spain, the question what two men it wished to send to that province as proconsuls was brought before the people.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls began the conduct of a levy both for the enrolment of new legions for the Bruttian territory and to fill the ranks of the other armies; for so they had been ordered by the senate.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although Africa had not been openly assigned as a province, while the senators kept the matter dark, I believe, for fear the Carthaginians might know in advance, nevertheless the people were aroused to hope that the war would be waged that year in Africa, and that the end of the Punic war was at hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That situation had filled men's <pb id="p.259"/>minds with superstitious fears and they were<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> indined both to report and to believe portents.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In addition they deliberated on the reception of the Idaean Mother,<note>Cf. p. 244, n. 1; George F. Moore, <hi rend="italics">Hist. of Religions</hi> I. 556 f.</note> in regard to whom not only had Marcus Valerius, one of the ambassadors, arriving in advance, reported that she would be in Italy very soon, but also there was recent news that she was already at Tarracina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was no unimportant decision that occupied the senate &mdash; the question who was the best man in the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At any rate every man would have preferred a real victory in that contest to any high commands or magistracies, whether conferred by vote of the senators or of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Publius Scipio, son of the Gnaeus who had fallen in Spain, was the young man not yet of an age to be quaestor,<note>There was still no law fixing a minimum age &mdash;not until 24 years later. Cf. Vol. VI. p. 344, n. 3. In <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date> this Scipio Nasica reached the consulship; XXXV. xxiv. 5; XXXVI. i. 1.</note> whom they judged to be the best of good men among all the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> citizens. If writers who lived nearest in time to men who <pb id="p.261"/>remembered those days had handed down by what<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> virtues the senate was led to make that judgment, I should indeed gladly hand it on to posterity. But I shall not interject my own opinions, reached by conjecture in a matter buried by the lapse of
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> time. Publius Cornelius was ordered to go to Ostia with all the matrons to meet the goddess, and himself to receive her from the ship, and carrying her to land to turn her over to the matrons to
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> carry. After the ship had reached the mouth of the river Tiber, in compliance with the order he sailed out into open water on a ship, received the goddess from her priests<note>A Phrygian man and woman, Dion. Hal. II. xix. 4 f. Romans were excluded by a decree of the senate, but the restriction was later removed (2nd century A.D.). Cf. XXXVII. ix. 9; XXXVIII. xviii. 9.</note> and carried her to
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> land. The foremost matrons in the state, among whom the name of one in particular, that of Claudia Quinta,<note>Her statue was later placed in the temple of the Magna Mater dedicated in <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date>, the consulship of Nasica. Cf. XXXVI. xxxvi. 3 f.; Tacitus <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> IV. 64; Val. Max. I. viii. 11. Between <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> and 191 the black stone remained in the Temple of Victory, &sect; 14</note> is conspicuous, received her. Claudia's repute, previously not unquestioned, as tradition reports it, has made her purity the more celebrated among posterity by a service so
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> devout. The matrons passed the goddess from hand to hand in an unbroken succession to each other, while the entire city poured out to meet her. Censers had been placed before the doors along the route of the bearers, and kindling their incense, people prayed that gracious and benignant she might enter the city of Rome. It was to the Temple of Victory, which is on the Palatine, that they carried the goddess on the day before the Ides of April, and that was a holy
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> day. The people thronged to the <pb id="p.263"/>Palatine bearing gifts for the goddess, and there<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> was a banquet of the gods, and games also, called the Megalesia.<note>Later the festival was shifted to <hi rend="italics">pridie nonas,</hi> the 4th of April in place of the 12th.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they were discussing the men needed to recruit the legions in the provinces, certain senators suggested that, since now by favour of the gods fear had at last been removed, it was time for them no longer to tolerate what had been endured as best they could in critical circumstances.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As the senate was alert and in suspense, they added that the twelve Latin colonies<note>Cf. Vol. VII. pp. 242 f. and notes; below, &sect; 5.</note> which had refused to furnish soldiers in the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Quintus Fulvius had been exempt from service for now
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> about five years, as though it were an honour and a favour bestowed upon them, whereas in the meantime good and obedient allies, in return for their loyalty and submission to the Roman people, had been exhausted by successive levies every year. These words revived the memory of an affair almost obliterated and correspondingly inflamed the anger of the senators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, allowing the consuls to bring up no other question first, they decreed that the consuls should summon to Rome
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the magistrates<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the two <hi rend="italics">duumviri iure dicendo,</hi> two <hi rend="italics">duumviri aediles,</hi> and two quaestors of each colony. The leading citizens are <hi rend="italics">decuriones,</hi> members of a local senate.</note> and ten leading citizens in each case from Nepete, Sutrium, Ardea, Cales, Alba, Carsioli, Sora, Suessa, Setia, Circeii, Narnia, Interamna, for these were the colonies concerned; that they should order them to furnish double the maximum number of infantry that each of those colonies had ever furnished to the Roman people since the enemy was <pb id="p.265"/>in Italy, and also one hundred and twenty horsemen<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> in each case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If any colony should be unable to make up that number of horsemen, it should be permitted to give three foot-soldiers for-one horseman. Men having the largest means should be chosen for infantry and cavalry and sent to any place outside of Italy where supplements were needed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If any delegation should refuse, it was decided that the magistrates and envoys of that colony should be detained, and that if they asked for a hearing in the senate, it should be refused until they had done what was required of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was further ordered that a tax of one <hi rend="italics">as</hi> for each thousand be laid upon those colonies and exacted, every year, and that a census be taken in those colonies on the basis of a census-list<note>To such a statement of property was prefixed a questionnaire to establish identity of the tax-payer. Cf. Caesar's Lex Iulia municipalis 146 f. (Bruns, <hi rend="italics">Fontes</hi>7 p. 109 f.).</note> furnished by the Roman censors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They resolved also that it be the same which was given to the Roman people &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that it be sworn to by the censors of the colonies and brought to Rome before they laid down their office.<note>Complied with in xxxvii. 7.</note></p> 
				<p>In accordance with this decree of the senate the consuls summoned the magistrates and leading citizens of those colonies to Rome and required of them soldiers and the tax.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thereupon they outdid each other in refusing and loudly protesting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They said that such a number of soldiers could not be made up; that even if the normal number were required according to the original compact,<note>A quite different sense of the term <hi rend="italics">formula</hi> from that in &sect; 9. Explained in Vol. VII. p. 245, note.</note> they could hardly reach it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They begged and implored that they be permitted to go before the senate and make their plea. No such offence, they said, had been committed that they deserved to perish. But even if perish they must, neither their crime nor the anger of the Roman people could enable them to <pb id="p.267"/>furnish more soldiers than they had.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consuls,<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> disinclined to yield, ordered the envoys to remain at Rome, the magistrates to go to their homes in order to conduct levies, adding that unless the number of soldiers demanded of them was first brought to Rome, no one would give them a hearing in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Thus, after their hopes of appearing before the senate and of making their plea had been shattered, a levy was carried out in those twelve colonies without difficulty, since owing to long exemption the number of younger men had increased.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In like manner another matter which had been passed over in silence for about the same length of time was broached by Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who said it was proper that the sums contributed<note>Cf. XXVI. xxxvi, including Laevinus' speech on that occasion and the generous response (&sect;&sect; 11 f.). It was in <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date>, a year before the refusal of the colonies named in xv. 5.</note> when he and Marcus Claudius were consuls should at last be repaid to private citizens; and that no one ought to be astonished that a matter in which the credit of the state-was involved should especially concern himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For in addition to the responsibility that in a way belonged peculiarly to a consul of the year in which the moneys had been contributed, he had also been the first to suggest such contribution, since the treasury was empty and the common people unable to pay a tax.<note>Cf. XXVI. xxxv. 4 ff., 9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This reminder was welcomed by the senators, and bidding the consuls to introduce the measure, they decreed that the money should be paid in three instalments; that the consuls who were then in office should pay the first in ready money, that the consuls of the third and fifth years should pay two instalments.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> biennial payments. See Vol. IX. p. 40, note (<date value="-200">200 B.C.</date>). Final settlement, however, was not made until <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date>; XXXIII. xlii. 3.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Thereafter all other concerns yielded place to a single one, when the atrocities suffered by the Locrians<note>Cf. ix, esp. &sect;&sect; 11 f.</note> but up to that time unknown were spread <pb id="p.269"/>abroad by the arrival of their envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And it was<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> not so much the crime of Pleminius that provoked men to anger as Scipio's partiality for him or else indifference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The ten envoys of the Locrians, in soiled and neglected clothing and holding out the woollen bands of suppliants and olive branches, as is the custom of the Greeks, towards the consuls seated in the Comitium, fell to the ground before the tribunal as they raised a mournful plaint.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In answer to the consuls' question they said that they were Locrians who had suffered from Quintus Pleminius, the legatus, and the Roman soldiers such things as the Roman people would not wish even the Carthaginians to suffer; that they begged the consuls to give them permission to go before the senate and complain of their sufferings.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A hearing in the senate being granted, the eldest of them said: "I know, conscript fathers, that in determining what weight is to be given to our complaints in your presence very much depends upon your being well informed both as to how Locri was betrayed to Hannibal, and how by driving out Hannibal's garrison it was restored to your authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For if it prove that no guilt for the revolt attaches to our council of state, and if it be at the same time evident that we returned to your authority not by our consent only but also by our effort and our courage, you will be all the more indignant that good and faithful allies are receiving such outrageous treatment from your legatus and his soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But in my opinion enquiry into our revolts should be put off in both cases to another time for two reasons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The first is in order that the hearing may be in the presence of Publius Scipio, who recovered Locri and <pb id="p.271"/>is our witness for every act, the good and the bad.<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> The second reason is because, whatever our character is, we nevertheless did not deserve to suffer these things that we have suffered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> We cannot conceal the truth, conscript fathers, that when we had a Punic garrison in our citadel we suffered many shameful outrages both at the hands of Hamilcar, commandant of the garrison, and from the Numidians and Africans. But what are they in comparison with the things we are suffering today?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With kind indulgence, conscript fathers, give ear, I pray, to what I shall reluctantly say. The entire human race is now in suspense as to whether it is to see you, or the Carthaginians, lords of the whole world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If one must judge Roman and Carthaginian rule from what we Locrians either have suffered from them, or are at this very moment suffering from your garrison, no one would fail to prefer them rather than you as his masters. And yet observe how the Locrians are disposed towards you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Although from the Carthaginians we were suffering wrongs so much less serious, we sought refuge with your general. Although from your garrison we are suffering acts worse than those of an enemy, we have brought our complaints nowhere else than to you.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>"Quintus Pleminius was sent as legatus with a military force to recover Locri from the Carthaginians, and with that same force he was left there.

					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It is all but impossible to decide <pb id="p.275"/>which of the two is the more revolting lot for a state<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> &mdash;when the enemy have captured the city in war, or when a death-dealing tyrant has overpowered it by force of arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> All things that captured cities suffer we have suffered and at this very moment are suffering, conscript fathers. All the crimes that the most cruel and despotic tyrants inflict upon their helpless citizens Pleminius has inflicted upon us and our children and our wives.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"There is one thing in regard to which conscientious scruples implanted in our minds compel us to complain in particular, and at the same time we would have you, conscript fathers, give us your attention and, if you approve, free your state from impiety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For we have seen with what punctiliousness you worship, not your own gods merely, but even welcome them from abroad.<note>Livy represents the speaker as actually having witnessed the stately ceremonial when the Magna Mater was welcomed; xiv. 5-14.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> We have in our city a sanctuary of Proserpina, a temple of whose sanctity I believe some report reached you in the war with Pyrrhus.<note>Cf. viii. 9 f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When on his return from Sicily he was passing Locri in his fleet, among other shameful acts which he visited upon our state for its loyalty to you, he despoiled the treasury of Proserpina<note>Appian <hi rend="italics">Samn.</hi> 12 tells the story of Pyrrhus' sacrilege. Plutarch omits it. Cf. Diodorus Sic. XXVII. iv. 3; Val. Max. I. i. Ext. 1.</note> as well, which had been untouched down to that time. And, that done, he put the money on shipboard, setting out himself by land. What happened, conscript fathers, in consequence?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the following day the fleet was shattered by a terrible storm, and all the ships which had the sacred money on board were cast upon our shores.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having at last learned from this great disaster that the gods do exist, the haughtiest <pb id="p.277"/>of kings ordered that all the money should be sought<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> out and restored to the treasure-chambers of Proserpina. And yet never thereafter did he meet with any success, and having been driven out of Italy, he rashly entered Argos by night and died an inconspicuous and inglorious death.<note>For Pyrrhus' death v. Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Pyrrhus</hi> 34; Strabo VIII. vi. 18 (before the walls); Justin XXV. 5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although your legatus and the tribunes had heard all this and a thousand other occurrences which were repeated to them, not merely to increase religious feeling but as facts repeatedly confirmed for us and our ancestors by the evident intervention of the goddess, they nevertheless dared to lay sacrilegious hands upon those treasure-chambers that were not to be touched,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and by that unspeakable plunder to bring pollution upon themselves and their homes and upon your soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With such men, conscript fathers, I beg of you for conscience' sake not to undertake any action either in Italy or in Africa until you first atone for their crime, lest for the sacrilege committed they make amends not only by their own blood but also by a disaster to the state.</p> 
				<p>"Even now, however, the wrath of the goddess is not idle, conscript fathers, as regards either your commanders or your men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Several times already have they clashed with each other in actual battle. Pleminius was in command of the one faction, of the other faction two tribunes of the soldiers. They have fought each other with the sword as fiercely as against the Carthaginians, and by their madness would have given Hannibal a chance to regain Locri, had not Scipio forestalled that in answer to our call for help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> True, you may say, the soldiers polluted by sacrilege are indeed frenzied, but the power of the goddess has not been manifest in punishing the <pb id="p.279"/>commanders themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the contrary, it is<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> there that it was most evident. The tribunes were scourged by the legatus;<note>Cf. above, ix. 4 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> whereupon the legatus was isolated by a ruse of the tribunes, and besides receiving wounds in every part of his body, he was left half-dead after even his nose and ears had been mutilated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then when the legatus had recovered from his wounds and the tribunes of the soldiers had been thrown into chains, then, after scourging them and racking them with all the torments applied to slaves, he put them to death, then forbade burial of the dead.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>"Such are the penalties the goddess has exacted of those who despoil her temple, nor will she cease to drive them on by every form of madness until the consecrated money has been replaced in her treasury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Our ancestors once in a serious war with the Crotonians<note>For Croton cf. XXIV. iii. 1 ff., and for the disastrous battle at the Sagra river (near Caulonia) v. Strabo VI. i. 10; Justin XX. 3.</note> desired to bring that money over into the city, since the temple is outside the city. In the night a voice from the sanctuary was heard: let them keep their hands off; the goddess will defend her temples. Since conscientious scruples were raised against moving the treasure away, they planned to surround the temple with a wall of defence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The walls had already been raised to a considerable height when suddenly they fell in ruins. But both at this time and at that, and often on other occasions, the goddess has either defended her abode and her temple, or else has exacted heavy penalties from those who profaned them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> To avenge wrongs done to us, however, no one but you, conscript fathers, <pb id="p.281"/>has the power &mdash;and may no one else have it!
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> To<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> you and your protection we have come for refuge as suppliants. It makes no difference to us whether you allow Locri to remain under that legatus, under that garrison, or surrender it to angry Hannibal and the Carthaginians for punishment. We do not demand that you at once believe us in regard to an absent defendant, his case unheard. Let him come, let him hear in person, in person let him disprove.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> If there is any crime which a man can perpetrate upon human beings that he has failed to commit upon us, we do not refuse to endure all the same wrongs again, if that is possible for us, while he is to be acquitted of every crime against gods and men.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the envoys had thus spoken and Fabius<note>As<hi rend="italics">princeps senatus</hi> he speaks first; cf. XXVII. xi. 12 and below, xxxvii. 1.</note> asked them whether they had carried such complaints to Publius Scipio, they replied that emissaries had been sent, but that he was occupied with preparations for war and had either already crossed over to Africa, or was about to do so within a few days;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and they had learned what partiality for his legatus was felt by the general-in-command when, after hearing the charges of Pleminius and those of the tribunes, he put the tribunes in chains and, though the legatus was equally guilty or even more so, left him in that command.</p> 
				<p>When the envoys had been ordered to retire from the Senate House,<note>The Curia had been inaugurated as a temple, that decrees of the senate might be valid; so Varro in Gellius XIV. vii. 7. Cf. XXVI. xxx. 11; xxxi. 11.</note> not Pleminius only but also Scipio was savagely attacked in the speeches of leading men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> First and foremost Quintus Fabius charged that he was by nature adapted to corrupt his soldiers' discipline.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thus even in Spain, he said, almost more soldiers had been lost in a mutiny than <pb id="p.283"/>by war;<note>An exaggerated statement, of course, for which <hi rend="italics">prope</hi> is half-apologetic. Cf. XXVIII. xxvi. 2.</note> that after the manner of a foreign tyrant he<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> gave free rein to the excesses of his soldiers and was also cruel to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then appended to his speech an equally ruthless resolution: that it was the will of the senate that Pleminius, the legatus, be brought to Rome bound and plead his cause in chains, and if the complaints of the Locrians should prove true, that he be put to death in the prison and his property confiscated;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that Publius Scipio, having left his province without orders of the senate, be recalled, and that the tribunes of the plebs be urged to bring before the people a bill to annul his command; that the senate should make answer to the Locrians face to face that neither the senate nor the Roman people approved of the wrongs which they complained had been inflicted upon them; that they be declared good men and good allies and friends;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that their children, their wives and whatever else had been taken away by violence be restored to them; that all the money removed from the treasure-chambers of Proserpina be sought out and twice that amount be restored to her treasury;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and that expiatory rites be performed, with the provision that the question be first laid before the college of pontiffs, in view of the removal, opening and profanation of the sacred treasure, what expiations they would order to be made, to what divinities, with what victims; that all the soldiers who were at Locri be transported to Sicily;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that four cohorts of Latin allies be brought to Locri as a garrison.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Not all the senators could be asked their opinion on that day owing to the heat of party feeling for <pb id="p.285"/>Scipio and against Scipio. In addition to the crime<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> of Pleminius and the sufferings of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> Locrians, they kept censuring even the personal appearance of the general-in-chief, as not even soldierly, not to say un- Roman; that wearing a Greek mantle and sandals he strolled about in the gymnasium, giving his attention to books in Greek and physical exercise;<note>Plutarch makes Cato, as quaestor to Scipio, complain that the general was extravagant, pampering his troops and giving too much time to palaestra and theatre; <hi rend="italics">Cat. Mai.</hi> iii. 5 ff. Cf. below, p. 307 and note 2. 284</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that with equal indolence and self-indulgence his entire retinue<note>This would include such high officers as legati, as well as friends.</note> was enjoying the charms of Syracuse; that Carthage and Hannibal had been forgotten;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that the entire army, being spoiled by lack of restraint and, like the army formerly at Sucro in Spain, like the troops now at Locri, was more to be feared by allies than by the enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although some of these taunts were true, some half-true and hence plausible, nevertheless the motion of Quintus Metellus<note>Of, x. 2; xi. 9 f. Consul in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>; XXVIII. x. 2, 8.</note> carried the day. In agreement with Maximus on the other points, he disagreed with him so far as concerned Scipio, the man whom the state chose not long before, he said, in spite of his youth as sole general to recover Spain;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> then, after Spain had been rewon from the enemy, elected him consul to put an end to the Punic war, and counted upon him to draw Hannibal out of Italy and to conquer Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> How then was it logical for him, as if he were a Quintus Pleminius, suddenly to be all but condemned without a hearing, recalled from his province, although the Locrians said that the criminal acts against them of which they complained had been committed when Scipio was not even present, and nothing else could be charged <pb id="p.287"/>against him than slowness to anger, or else reluctance<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> in sparing his legatus?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His proposal, he said, was that Marcus Pomponius, the praetor, to whom Sicily had been allotted as his province, should within three days leave for the province; that the consuls should choose ten legati at their discretion from the senate, to be sent with the praetor, as also two tribunes of the plebs and an aedile;<note>A plebeian aedile (&sect; 11), to carry out the orders of the tribunes.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that with these men as assessors the praetor should conduct an examination; if the offences of which the Locrians complained had been committed by the command or with the consent of Publius Scipio, they should order him to retire from his province;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> if Publius Scipio should have already crossed over into Africa, the tribunes of the plebs and the aedile should go to Africa with two of the legati &mdash;those
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> whom the praetor should judge most competent &mdash;the tribunes and aedile to bring Scipio away, the legati to be in command of the army until anew general-in-command should reach that army;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> if Marcus Pomponius-and the ten legati should find that the acts had been committed neither by order of Publius Scipio nor with his consent, that Scipio should remain with the army and carry on the war as he had planned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A decree of the senate to this effect having been passed, the tribunes of the plebs were requested either to arrange among themselves or to choose by lot which two of them should go with the praetor and legati.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The matter of expiation for all that in the temple of Proserpina at Locri had been touched and profaned and carried away was referred to the college of pontiffs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The tribunes of the plebs, Marcus Claudius <pb id="p.289"/>Marcellus<note>Cf. xi. 13; XXVII. xxvi. 12; xxvii. 7. Consul in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date>; censor <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date>; XXXIII. xxiv. 1; XXXVII. lviii. 2.</note> and Marcus Cincius Alimentus<note>Almost certainly a brother of Lucius, the historian (frequently mentioned in XXVI-XXVII). As tribune in this year he proposed the Lex Cincia to limit gifts; cf. Cicero <hi rend="italics">Cat. Mai.</hi> 10. Livy fails to mention the law until XXXIV. iv. 9, in a speech of Cato as consul, <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date></note> <note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> departed with the praetor and ten legati. A plebeian aedile was added to their number, and either in case Scipio in Sicily should fail to obey the praetor, or if he should have crossed already into Africa, the tribunes were to order the aedile to arrest him, and by virtue of their inviolable authority they were to bring him back. It was their plan to go to Locri first and then to Messana.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But so far as Pleminius is concerned we have two reports. Some authorities relate that, on hearing what had been done at Rome, he was on his way into exile at Neapolis when he happened to encounter Quintus Metellus, one of the legati, and that he was forcibly brought back by him to Regium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Others say that Scipio himself sent a legatus with thirty horsemen of the first order, to throw Quintus Pleminius into chains and with him the leaders of the outbreak.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All of them, whether by Scipio's order earlier or at this time by that of the praetor, were delivered into the custody of the men of Regium.</p> 
				<p>The praetor and legati went to Locri and, as they had been instructed, made religion their first concern.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For they sought out and restored to the treasure-chambers all the sacred money, both what was in the hands of Pleminius and what was in the possession of the soldiers, together with what they had themselves brought with them; and they performed the rite of expiation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the praetor summoned the soldiers to an assembly, ordered their units to march out of the city, and assigned a site in the plain for their camp, with a threatening edict in case any soldier should either remain in the <pb id="p.291"/>city or carry out with him what was not his own.<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> In this he stated that he gave permission to the Locrians to seize any possession a man should recognize as his; and if anything was not produced he should demand its restitution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Above all, he said, he ruled that free persons should be restored to the Locrians without delay; that a heavy penalty would be paid by the man who did not restore them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Thereupon he held an assembly of the Locrians and said that the Roman people and senate restored to them their independence and their own laws; that if anyone desired to bring charges against Pleminius or any other man, let him follow him to Regium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As regarded Publius Scipio, should they wish, he said, to make complaint in the name of their state, claiming that such wicked deeds as had been committed at Locri against gods and men had been done by command of Publius Scipio or with his consent, let them send envoys to Messana; there with his assessors he would conduct the inquiry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Locrians thanked the praetor and his legati, the senate and the Roman people. They would go, they said, to prefer charges against Pleminius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As for Scipio, although he was not sufficiently pained by the wrongs done to their state, he was such a man as they would prefer to have as their friend rather than as an enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They had definitely ascertained that the many unspeakable crimes had not been committed either by order or consent of Publius Scipio; but either he had trusted Pleminius too much and themselves too little; or else for some men it was natural to disapprove of misdoing but to lack sufficient spirit to punish the misdeeds.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Both the praetor and his assessors were relieved of <pb id="p.293"/>the burden &mdash;no slight one either &mdash;of a court of<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> inquiry concerning Scipio. Pleminius and with him some thirty-two men they found guilty<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> at a preliminary hearing; cf. xxii. 7 ff. The charge would be treason, <hi rend="italics">perduellio.</hi></note> and sent in chains to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They themselves went to Scipio with the further intention to see for themselves what had been common talk in regard to the dress and indolent habits of the general and lax discipline of his soldiers, and to report back to Rome.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they were on their way to Syracuse Scipio prepared tangible evidence, not words, in his defence. He ordered the entire army to be concentrated there, and the fleet to be cleared for action, as if on that day he must fight on land and sea with the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the day of their arrival they were hospitably entertained, and the next day he showed them his land and naval forces, not merely drawn up in line, but the soldiers in man&oelig;uvres<note>It is a sham battle, as <hi rend="italics">et ipsam</hi> proves. No parade here; no more than in XXVI. li. 4.</note> and the fleet likewise man&oelig;uvring in mimicry of a naval battle in the harbour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the praetor and the legati were conducted on a tour of inspection of arsenals and magazines and other equipment for war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so much was their admiration aroused for particular things and for the sum total that they fully believed the Carthaginian people could be defeated either by that general and army or by no other, and bade
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> him with the blessing of the gods to cross over, and at the first possible moment to bring to the Roman people the fulfilment of the hope inspired on the day on which all the centuries <pb id="p.295"/>had named him consul first.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So happy also were they<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> on leaving the city, it was if they were to carry to Rome the news of a victory, not of a magnificent preparation for war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Pleminius and those who were involved in the same charge, upon their arrival in Rome, were at once put in the prison. And when first brought before the people by the tribunes, while men's minds were already filled with the sufferings of the Locrians, they found no room left for pity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Later, as they were brought out repeatedly,<note>A defendant charged with <hi rend="italics">perduellio</hi> was brought before a <hi rend="italics">contio</hi> in the Forum three times, not on successive days. At the close of the third <hi rend="italics">contio</hi> the tribunes pronounced judgment, repeating their demand for a penalty or changing it in either direction. Then they announced a final hearing 28 days later(<hi rend="italics">quarta accusatio</hi>). On that date the case would be finally decided by vote of the <hi rend="italics">comitia tribute</hi> (if a fine was demanded), or of the <hi rend="italics">centuriata</hi> (if a death penalty). Cf. XXVI. iii. 9 ff. (Vol. VII. pp. 13 ff. and notes p. 12); Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">Staatsrecht</hi> III. 354 if. Confinement was in the Career, &sect; 7; cf. p. 296, n. 1.</note> men's anger was subsiding as animosity now waned, and even Pleminius' disfigurement and the memory of the absent Scipio won them support among the populace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He died, however, in prison before his trial in the assembly of the people could be completed.</p> 
				<p>Clodius Licinus<note>A younger contemporary of Livy, consul suffectus in A.D. 4. His history must have begun with the end of the Second Punic War. Cf. Suet. <hi rend="italics">de Gram.</hi> 20. Rare in Livy is so precise a reference to any authority.</note> in the third book of his Roman History relates of this Pleminius that during the votive games which Africanus was conducting at Rome in his second consulship,<note><date value="-194">194 B.C.</date>; XXXIV. xliv. 6 if., the same story under a different date and with omission of the source.</note> he made an attempt, with the aid of certain men whom he had bribed, to set fire to the city in a number of places, in order to have a chance to break out of prison and escape;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <pb id="p.297"/>that then, when his crime was revealed, he was<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> consigned to the Tullianum<note>The older underground chamber beneath the Carcer. Mere mention of it implies that Pleminius was executed there, as is explicitly stated <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> xliv. 8. Cf. xix. 5; Val. Max. I. i. 21.</note> in accordance with a decree of the senate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>In regard to Scipio no action was taken anywhere except in the senate, in which both legati and tribunes united in praise of the fleet, army and general. Consequently the senate voted that at the earliest possible moment the crossing to Africa must take place, and that out of the armies then in Sicily Scipio should be permitted to choose for himself what forces he would transport with him to Africa, and what he would leave as a garrison
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> for the province.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these events were in progress among the Romans, the Carthaginians on their part, placing watch-towers on all the promontories, had passed an anxious winter, gathering information and alarmed by each fresh report.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And then, as no small factor in the defence of Africa, they added an alliance of their own with King Syphax, in reliance chiefly upon whom the Roman, they had believed, intended to cross over to Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hasdrubal the son of Gisgo had not merely a guest-friendship with the king, of which mention has been made above<note>The formal bond of a <hi rend="italics">hospitium</hi> with Hasdrubal was implied in XXVIII. xviii but not exactly mentioned. As for Scipio, cf. below, xxiv. 3.</note> &mdash;when Scipio and Hasdrubal coming from Spain arrived, as it happened, at the same time &mdash;but also the first proposal of a marriage tie was made, in which the king was to marry Hasdrubal's daughter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To carry the matter through and to fix a time for the wedding, Hasdrubal went to him; for the maiden was already of marriageable age. On perceiving that he was <pb id="p.299"/>fired with passion &mdash;and more than all barbarians<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> the Numidians are prone to sensuality &mdash;he summoned the maiden from Carthage and hastened the wedding.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And in the midst of congratulations on other grounds, in order that a public compact might be added to the private, an alliance between the Carthaginian people and the king was cemented by an oath, while a pledge was given by both sides that they would have the same friends and enemies.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Hasdrubal, however, remembered not only the alliance with Scipio into which the king had entered, but also how naturally characterless and fickle are barbarians. He feared that if Scipio should cross over to Africa this marriage would be a slender bond. Consequently while the Numidian, fired by his newfound love, was in his power, with the help also of the young woman's allurements, Hasdrubal prevailed upon him to send ambassadors to Scipio in Sicily, and through these men he was to warn Scipio not to cross over to Africa in reliance upon his previous promises.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were to say that he was
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> linked with the Carthaginian people both by his marriage to a citizen of Carthage, daughter of the Hasdrubal whom Scipio had seen received as a guest in his own house, and by a public treaty as well;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that in the first place he wished that the Romans would carry on war with the Carthaginians, as they had done hitherto, far from Africa, making it unnecessary for him to be involved in their conflicts and to follow the arms of this side or that, rejecting alliance with the other side;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that if Scipio did not keep away from Africa and moved his army up to Carthage, it would be necessary for him to fight both for the land of Africa, in which he too had <pb id="p.301"/>been born, and for the native city of his wife and for<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> her father and her home.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With these instructions ambassadors were sent to Scipio by the king, and they met him at Syracuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio had lost, to be sure, an important factor for the campaign in Africa and a high hope; nevertheless, sending the messengers back to Africa promptly, before the matter should be widely reported, he gave them a letter to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this he insistently admonished him not to prove false to the claims of a guest-friendship entered into with himself, nor to those of an alliance contracted with the Roman people, nor to divine law, to honour, to the clasped hands, to the gods as witnesses and arbiters of compacts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the arrival of the Numidians could not be kept secret, for they had roamed about the city and had showed themselves at headquarters;<note>Formerly the palace of King Hiero II; Cicero <hi rend="italics">in Verr.</hi> IV. 118; V. 80.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and if the object of their mission was passed over in silence there would be danger that the facts might of themselves transpire, all the more from the very attempt to conceal them, and that the fear of having to fight at the same time with the king and the Carthaginians might overtake the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For that reason Scipio diverted men's attention from the truth by preoccupation with false statements, and summoning the soldiers to an assembly, he told them that there must be no further delay; that the kings, their allies, were insisting that he cross over to Africa as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Masinissa, he said, had previously come in person to Gaius Laelius complaining because they were wasting time in hesitation; and now Syphax was sending ambassadors, stating that he also was at a loss to explain what was the reason for a delay so protracted, and <pb id="p.303"/>demanding either that the army be at last<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> transported
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> to Africa, or, if their plans had been changed, that he be informed, so that he on his part might take measures for himself and his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly, since now everything had been duly fitted out and made ready and the situation admitted of no further delay, Scipio said
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> it was his intention to shift his fleet to Lilybaeum and concentrate there all his infantry and cavalry forces, then on the first day that offered a passage to his ships to cross over with the blessing of the gods to Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He sent a letter to Marcus Pomponius,<note>Cf. xx. 4, 8; xiii. 2, 6: XXVIII. xlv. 12 (his mission to Delphi).</note> requesting him, if he approved, to come to Lilybaeum, so that they might jointly decide which particular legions to transport to Africa and how large a number of men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He likewise sent orders round the entire coastline to have all merchantmen pressed into the service and concentrated at Lilybaeum.</p> 
				<p>When all the soldiers and ships in Sicily had been brought together at Lilybaeum and the city could not contain the multitude of men nor the harbour the ships, such was the ardour of every man
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> for the passage to Africa that it seemed as though they were being led, not to a war but to assured rewards of victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Especially the soldiers who were left of the army at Cannae believed that under that general and no other, by active duty for the state they could bring their ignominious service to an end.<note>Their appeals, such as that in 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>vi. 2-23 (eight years before), had been of no avail. They saw no service as combat troops in Sicily, not even in the long siege of Syracuse.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And Scipio did not in the least scorn soldiers of that kind, <pb id="p.305"/>as he knew that the disaster at Cannae had not been<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> incurred by their cowardice,<note>Here Scipio had personal knowledge, having been a tribune of the soldiers at Cannae; XXII. liii. 2; Val. Max. V. vi. 7.</note> and that there were no soldiers in the Roman army who were such veterans and as highly trained not only in battles of different kinds but also in besieging cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The fifth and sixth legions were those from Cannae. Having said he would transport these legions to Africa, he inspected the soldiers one by one, and leaving those whom he believed to be unfit, he substituted for them men whom he had brought with him from Italy, and recruited the legions to such an extent that each had six thousand two hundred infantry<note>This is the maximum known for a legion.</note> and three hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In like manner he chose foot-soldiers and horse from the Latin allies out of the army which fought at Cannae.</p> 
				<p>XXV. As to the number of soldiers transported to Africa the authorities differ by no small figure. In some I find that ten thousand infantry, two thousand two hundred cavalry were embarked; in others sixteen thousand infantry, sixteen hundred cavalry; in others the total is more than doubled &mdash;thirty-five thousand infantry and cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some authorities have not introduced the figures, and it is among these that I should myself prefer to be counted in view of the uncertainty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Coelius, while he gives no figures, nevertheless immensely increases the impression of great numbers.<note>Another example of Coelius' rhetorical exaggeration is found in xxvii. 14 f.</note> He says that birds fell to the ground owing to the shouts of the soldiers, and that such a multitude boarded the ships that not a human being seemed to be left either in Italy or Sicily.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.307"/>
				<p>That the soldiers should board the ships in good<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> order and without confusion the general took upon himself. As for the crews, Gaius Laelius, who was admiral of the fleet, ordered them to go on board first, and kept them there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The duty of loading supplies was assigned to Marcus Pomponius, the praetor. Rations for forty-five days &mdash;of these cooked rations for fifteen days &mdash;were placed on board.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When now they had all embarked, Scipio sent ships' boats round with orders that pilots and masters from all the ships and two soldiers from each should assemble before the headquarters to receive commands. When they were assembled he first asked them if they had put on board water for men and beasts for just as many days as they had grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they replied that there was water for forty-five days on board, he thereupon gave orders to the soldiers to remain quiet and ensure silence in proper obedience to the seamen and without interference, that these might perform their duties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> With twenty warships, he said, he and Lucius Scipio<note>He had been with his older brother in Spain (XXVIII. iii. 2 ff.; iv. 2 ff.; xvii. 1) and in Sicily (above, vii. 2); consul in <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date> with Laelius; XXXVI. xlv. 9.</note> on the right wing would protect the transports; on the left wing the same number of war-ships and Gaius Laelius, admiral of the fleet, with Marcus Porcius Cato, who was at that time quaestor;<note>His quaestorship in this year is attested by Cicero <hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> <hi rend="italics">Mai.</hi> 10; <hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi> 60; not in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date>, as Nepos <hi rend="italics">Cato</hi> i. 3. Plutarch has him return in protest from Sicily to Rome, iii. 7.</note> that war-ships should have one lantern for each ship, transports two for each; that on the flagship the designation at night <pb id="p.309"/>would be three lanterns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He ordered the pilots to<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> steer for the Emporia.<note>Trading centres (<hi rend="italics">emporia)</hi> along the western shore of the Gulf of Gab&egrave;s (Syrtis Minor) gave this name to an entire region. It extended southward from Leptis Minor (100 miles from Carthage) and Thapsus. Cf. xxxiii. 9; XXXIV. lxii. 3; Polybius III. xxiii. 2; XXXI. xxi; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 25. So public an announcement of a distant beachhead forces us to suspect that Scipio really intended to land near Utica, after misleading the enemy. Before the great convoy reached Africa spies could easily bring to Carthage news of the order. Cf. note on xxvii. 9; Gsell, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> III. 213; Zielinski in <hi rend="italics">Riv. di storia antica</hi> III. 74 f.</note> There the soil is very fertile and for that reason the region supplies everything in abundance; and the natives are unwarlike, as is usually the case in a fertile country, and it seemed that they could be overpowered before aid could be sent from Carthage.<note>But remoteness from Carthage would mean a greatly increased distance from Sicily, and on the long passage south-ward Roman ships would be in constant danger of attack, with few ports in which they might seek even a temporary refuge. The <hi rend="italics">fertilissimus ager</hi> was little more than a strip
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash;one more reason to believe that no Roman general would seriously propose to launch a campaign against Carthage from such a coast.</note> After he had issued these commands they were ordered to return to their ships and on the following day, with the blessing of the gods, to cast off at the given signal.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many Roman fleets had sailed from Sicily and out of that very harbour. Yet not only during that war was there never a sailing so spectacular and no wonder, since most of the fleets had sailed out merely to plunder-but there had been nothing similar even in the previous war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And yet if one had based his comparison upon the size of the fleet, more than once<note>Exactly twice: in <date value="-256">256 B.C.</date> L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus (xxviii. 5) with 330 war-ships (Polybius I. xxv. 7; xxix. 1); in <date value="-255">255 B.C.</date> M. Aemilius Paulus and Ser. Fulvius Nobilior with 350, but no army, and shipwrecked on their return; <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xxxvi. 10 ff.</note> before had two consuls with two armies made the passage, and there had been almost as many war-ships in those fleets as now transports with which Scipio was crossing over. For in addition to forty war-ships only, he carried his army across on about four hundred transports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the second war was made to appear to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> Romans more terrible <pb id="p.311"/>than the first both by being carried on in Italy and<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> by the immense losses which befell so many armies, with the death of their generals at the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Furthermore Scipio, whom men praised as a general partly because of his brave deeds, partly because of a good fortune peculiarly his own &mdash;a matter of the greatest importance to his growing celebrity &mdash;had commanded attention, as had also the very thought, not hazarded by any previous general in this war, of crossing the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For he had spread the report that he was making the passage in order to draw Hannibal out of Italy and, shifting its scene, to bring the war to an end in Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To see that sight there had flocked to the harbour a crowd made up, not only of all the inhabitants of Lilybaeum, but of all the delegations from Sicily which had arrived to show their respect as an escort to Scipio, and of those that had followed the praetor of the province, Marcus Pomponius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In addition the legions that were being left behind in Sicily had turned out to escort their fellow-soldiers. And not only was the fleet a spectacle for those who viewed it from the shore, but also the whole densely crowded shore on this side and that was a sight for those who were sailing.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the day dawned Scipio on his flagship, after silence had been secured by a herald, prayed:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Ye gods and goddesses who inhabit seas and lands, I pray and beseech you that whatever under my authority has been done, is being done, and shall henceforth be done, may prosper for me, for the Roman people and the commons, for allies and Latins who by land, by sea, and by rivers follow the <pb id="p.313"/>lead, authority and auspices of the Roman people<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> and of myself; and that ye lend your kind aid to all those acts and make them bear good fruit;
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that when the foe has been vanquished, ye bring the victors home with me safe and sound, adorned with spoils, laden with booty, and in triumph;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that ye grant power to punish opponents and enemies; and that ye bestow upon the Roman people and upon me the power to visit upon the state of the Carthaginians the fate that the people of Carthage have endeavoured to visit upon our state.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Immediately after this prayer a victim was slain and Scipio threw the organs raw into the sea, as is customary,<note>For this practice when ships were setting sail with ceremony v. Cicero <hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> III. 51 <hi rend="italics">fin.;</hi> cf. Servius on <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi> V. 238; Macrobius <hi rend="italics">Sat.</hi> III. ii. 2 ff.</note> and by a trumpet gave the signal to sail. A favouring wind sufficiently strong quickly carried them out of sight of land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And after mid-day they encountered a fog, so that with difficulty could they avoid collisions between the ships. In the open sea the wind was gentler.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Through the following night the same fog held; and when the sun was up, it was dispersed and the wind increased in force. Already they were in sight of land. Not very long afterwards the pilot told Scipio that Africa was not more than five miles away; that they sighted the Promontory of Mercury;<note>This headland, now Cap Bon (Ras Adar), marks the eastern entrance to the Bay of Tunis. It is 45 miles from Carthage, and is the nearest point to Sicily. Cf. Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 23 f.; Strabo XVII. iii, 13, 16; Mela I. 34.</note> if he should order him to steer for that, the entire fleet would soon be in port.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, now that the land was visible, after a prayer to the gods that
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> his sight of Africa might be a <pb id="p.315"/>blessing to the state and to himself, gave orders to<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> make sail and to seek another landing-place for the ships farther down.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> farther along the coast. Cf. Caesar <hi rend="italics">B.G.</hi> IV. 36 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> He meant <hi rend="italics">-inside</hi> the Bay (not towards the Emporia), there being no harbour on either side of the Cape. His order to the helmsmen (at Lilybaeum, xxv. 12) to steer for the Emporia was probably a ruse (cf. note there); or it merely named a rendezvous in case the convoy should be scattered. A complete change in his plan for the campaign could not be made suddenly.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were running before the same wind; but at about the same time as on the preceding day a fog appeared cutting off the sight of land, and under the weight of fog the wind dropped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then night added to all their uncertainties; so they cast anchor, that the ships might not collide or drift onto the shore. When day dawned the same wind sprang up and by dispelling the fog revealed the whole African coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio inquired what the nearest promontory was, and upon being told it was called Cape of the Fair God,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> of Apollo, translating Polybius' <foreign lang="greek">ton= Kalon= a)kroth/rion</foreign> (III. xxii. 5), who in the same passage has <foreign lang="greek">to\ Kalo\n a)kroth/rion</foreign>(xxiii. 1). Cf.<hi rend="italics">Apollinis,</hi> XXX. xxiv. 8; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H. l.c.;</hi> Mela I. 34; <foreign lang="greek">)Apollw/nion,</foreign> Dio Cass.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>That the passage was successful and free from alarm and disorder I have accepted on the authority of many Greek and Latin writers. Coelius<note>Cf. xxv. 3. We may, however, suspect a slip of Livy's memory, or an error in verification of a source. See p. 316, n. 1.</note> alone describes all the terrors of weather and waves &mdash;everything short of saying that the ships were overwhelmed by the seas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He relates that finally the fleet was swept by the storm away from Africa to the island of Aegimurus<note>North-west of the Prom. Mercurii (Hermaeum) and about 30 miles north-east of Carthage, now el Djamur (also called Zembra); XXX. xxiv. 9, 11 f.; Strabo II. v. 19 <hi rend="italics">fin.;</hi> VI. ii. 11 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> Pliny has two Aegimoeroe, V. 42.</note> and that from there the proper <pb id="p.317"/>course was regained with difficulty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and that as the<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> ships were all but sinking the soldiers, without waiting for an order from the general, made their way to the shore in small boats, as though they had been shipwrecked, with no arms and in the greatest disorder.<note>This entire statement about storm and wreck is disproved by a fragment (41) of Coelius' Book VI preserved by Nonius <hi rend="italics">s.v. metari,</hi> p. 199 L. The fragment unquestionably refers to this landing. Cf. H. Peter, <hi rend="italics">Hist. Rom. Rell.</hi> I. 159; Gsell <hi rend="italics">op.</hi> <hi rend="italics">cit.</hi> 212.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After landing their troops the Romans laid out a camp on the nearest heights.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By this time, first from the sight of the fleet, and then from the commotion produced as they were disembarking, apprehension and panic had reached not only the farms near the coast but even into the cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For it was not merely the massed humanity that, interspersed with columns of women and children, had filled all the roads in every direction, but cattle also driven before them by the farmers, so that one would have said Africa was suddenly being deserted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But even in the cities they inspired greater alarm than that which they had brought with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Especially at Carthage the uproar was almost like that of a captured city. For since the consulship of Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius, for almost fifty years<note><hi rend="italics">In</hi> reality just 52 years (256-<date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>); cf. xxvi. 2, note.</note> they had seen no Roman forces except only predatory fleets, by means of which descents had been made on farms near the sea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and seizing whatever chance had put in their way, the men had always raced back to their ships before the outcry should arouse the farmers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All the greater at this time was the flight and alarm in the city. They lacked also, to be sure, both a strong army at home and a general to confront the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Hasdrubal the son of Gisgo was far the foremost man of the state in family, reputation, wealth, and at that time also by reason <pb id="p.319"/>of his relationship to a king. But they recalled that<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> in a number of battles in Spain he had been routed and beaten by the self-same Scipio, and that the one general was no more a match for the other than was their own irregular army for the Roman army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly they sounded the alarm, as if Scipio were intending forthwith to attack the city. The gates were hastily closed also and armed men posted on the walls, sentries and outposts stationed, while the following night no one slept.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Next day five hundred horsemen, sent to the coast to reconnoitre and to break up the disembarkation, encountered Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For already Scipio, after sending the fleet towards Utica, had himself advanced not very far from the sea and taken the nearest heights. He had stationed cavalry on outpost duty in suitable positions and had sent others to plunder the countryside.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These horsemen, having engaged in battle with the Carthaginian cavalry, slew a few in the actual engagement, many more as they pursued them in flight, among the number Hanno<note>Cf. xxxiv. 14 ff., where this engagement may appear to be repeated with the same result for a commander of the same name, a common name, however, at Carthage. But v. p. 343 and notes.</note> also, the commander, a young man of rank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Scipio not only laid waste the farms all around but also captured the nearest city of the Africans, quite a prosperous place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, in addition to the other spoils which had been at once loaded on transports and sent to Sicily, eight thousand free persons and slaves were taken captive.</p> 
				<p>What brought the greatest joy, however, to the Romans at the beginning of the campaign was the <pb id="p.321"/>arrival of Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some authorities relate that<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> he came with no more than two hundred horsemen, the majority say with two thousand cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But since he was far the greatest of all the kings of his time and gave the greatest aid to the Roman state, it seems worth while to digress a little to tell how checkered was the fortune he met with in losing and recovering his father's kingdom.<note>The long digression (4 1/2 chapters) is probably from a lost portion of Polybius, who had a personal acquaintance with Masinissa; for in his IX. xxv. 4 a conversation with him is reported.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>While he was serving on the side of the Carthaginians in Spain his father died; Gala was his name. The kingdom came to the king's brother, Oezalces, a very aged man, such being the custom among the Numidians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Not long after, upon the death of Oezalces also, the elder of his two sons, Capussa, succeeded to his father's throne, the other son being a mere boy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But inasmuch as he held the kingship more by customary law of his people than by prestige among his countrymen or by his might, a man came forward named Mazaetullus, not unconnected by blood with the royal house and member of a family that had always been hostile and had contested the throne with different results against the house which was then in possession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After rousing his countrymen, among whom he had great influence because of the unpopularity of the royal family, and openly pitching his camp, he compelled the king to go out into battle-line and fight for his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In that battle Capussa fell with many of the leading men. The entire tribe of the Maesulii submitted to the sway and authority of Mazaetullus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nevertheless he refrained from using the kingly title and, contented with the modest style of guardian, he gave the royal title to the boy Lacumazes, who also belonged to the royal line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He married a noble Carthaginian lady, <pb id="p.323"/>daughter of Hannibal's sister and lately wedded to<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> King Oezalces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He did so in the hope of an alliance with the Carthaginians, and with Syphax he renewed a guest-friendship of long standing, sending envoys for the purpose. All these advantages he was preparing against Masinissa.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And Masinissa having heard of the death of his uncle, and then that his cousin had fallen, crossed over from Spain into Mauretania, Baga being at that time king of the Mauri.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From Baga with the most abject entreaties as a suppliant he obtained four thousand Mauri as an escort on his journey, being unable to obtain aid for the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When with that escort, after first sending word to his father's friends and his own, he had reached the frontier of the kingdom, about five hundred Numidians joined him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Therefore from that point he sent back the Mauri to their king, as it had been agreed, and although the numbers that had joined him were considerably smaller than he had hoped for, and not such that he quite dared to attempt so great a venture with them, he thought that by vigorous action he would also gather up the forces needed for some success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hence as Lacumazes, the prince, was on his way to Syphax, Masinissa encountered him near Thapsus.<note>Unknown; probably a corruption of the name. Not to be confused with the distant city famous for Julius Caesar's victory, on the coast south of Hadrumetum (Sousse).</note> When the frightened column had sought refuge in the city, Masinissa not only took the city by the first assault but received the surrender of some of the royal escort and slew others attempting resistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The majority together with the boy himself in the midst of the commotion made <pb id="p.325"/>their way to Syphax, towards whom they had<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> originally directed their march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The report of this modest success at the beginning of the campaign brought the Numidians over to Masinissa, and from farms and villages on all sides old soldiers of Gala flocked to him; and they spurred the young man on to recover the kingdom of his father.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In the number of his soldiers Mazaetullus was considerably superior; for not only did he himself have the army with which he had defeated Capussa, and a number of men whom he had taken over after the slaying of the king, but also the young Lacumazes had brought up very large auxiliary forces from Syphax.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Fifteen thousand infantry Mazaetullus had and ten thousand cavalry; and with these he engaged in battle with Masinissa, who was far from having so great a number of infantry or cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless victory was won by the courage of the veteran soldiers and the sagacity of a general who had been trained in the war between Roman and Carthaginian armies. The prince with his guardian and a very small band of Masaesulians sought refuge in the territory of Carthage. So, having recovered his father's kingdom, Masinissa, seeing that his remaining conflict against Syphax would be considerably more serious, thought it best to be reconciled with his cousin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly he sent men to encourage the boy to hope that, if he should put himself in the hands of Masinissa, he would be held in the same honour as Oezalces had formerly been in the house of Gala.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To Mazaetullus also they were to pledge, besides impunity, the faithful restoration of all his property.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By this means, as they preferred a modest fortune at home to exile, Masinissa won <pb id="p.327"/>them both over, although the Carthaginians purposely<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> did everything to prevent it.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal happened to be with Syphax<note>For a previous visit, presumably at Siga (west of Oran), cf. XXVIII. xvii <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> and xviii.</note> all the time that these events were in progress. And when the Numidian said he believed it was of no great importance to him whether the kingdom of the Maesulians was in the hands of Lacumazes or of Masinissa, Hasdrubal said he was very much mistaken if he believed that Masinissa would be content with what had satisfied his father Gala or his uncle Oezalces;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that he had in him a far greater gift of spirit and talent than had ever been found in any man of his tribe; that often in Spain he had given allies and enemies alike evidence of a courage rare among men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He added that unless Syphax and the Carthaginians should put out that incipient flame, they would be consumed later by a mighty conflagration when they could no longer cope with it; that Masinissa's strength was still slight and frail, while he was nursing a kingdom whose wounds had barely begun to heal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By insisting and goading him on Hasdrubal brought him to the point of advancing his army to the frontier of the Maesulians and pitching his camp as though upon soil to which he was unquestionably entitled &mdash;land concerning which he had not only argued with Gala repeatedly but had contended also in arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If anyone should try to drive him away he would fight a regular battle, which would be greatly to his advantage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But if Masinissa in fear should withdraw from that region they must advance into the interior of the kingdom. Either the Maesulians would submit without resistance to the rule of Syphax, or they would be no match for him in arms.</p> <pb id="p.329"/>
				<p>Aroused by these words Syphax made war upon<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> Masinissa and in the first engagement routed the Maesulians and put them to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Masinissa with a few horsemen fled from the battle-field to a mountain called Bellus by the natives.<note>No Mount Bellus is known.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A considerable number of households followed the king with their portable huts<note>Thatched huts that were portable, often resembling an overturned ship, as Sallust describes them; <hi rend="italics">Jug.</hi> xviii. 8. Cf. <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xlvi. 5; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 22 (carried on wagons); Vergil <hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> III. 340.</note> and their flocks, the latter being their only wealth. But the rest, the mass of the Maesulians, submitted to the rule of Syphax.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The mountain which the fugitives had occupied is well supplied with grass and water and being suitable for the support of cattle, it was quite capable of sustaining men also who lived on flesh and milk. From it they rendered all the surrounding country unsafe, first by stealthy raids in the night and later by open brigandage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Most of all it was Carthaginian territory that was ravaged, because there was more plunder than among the Numidians, and also brigandage was safer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> By this time they played their game so openly as to bring their booty down to the sea and sell it to traders who put in with their vessels for that very purpose; and more Carthaginians fell or were captured than occurred often in regular warfare.</p> 
				<p>The Carthaginians complained of all this to Syphax and, as he also was enraged, they spurred him on to complete what was left of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But it seemed hardly becoming for a king to pursue a nomad bandit in the mountains. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>One of the king's officers, Bucar, a man of spirit and energy, was chosen for the purpose. Four thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry were given to him; and he <pb id="p.331"/>was laden with immense rewards in anticipation, if<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> he should bring back the head of Masinissa, or &mdash;and this would be a joy beyond price &mdash;should capture him alive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While they were scattered and off their guard Bucar unexpectedly attacked them, and separating the great number of cattle and men from their armed escort, he drove Masinissa himself with a few of his men up to the top of the mountain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, just as though the war had been already finished, he sent not only the booty in cattle and captives to the king but returned his troops also, as much too many for the remainder of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With not more than five hundred foot-soldiers and two hundred horsemen he pursued Masinissa (who had come down from the heights), and penned him in a gorge with both entrances blocked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There a great slaughter of the Maesulians took place; but Masinissa with no more than fifty horsemen following him through the unknown recesses of the mountain made his escape.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Bucar, however, kept on the trail and overtaking him in an open plain near the city of Clupea<note>Unknown, the name perhaps confused with that of the city on Cap Bon (XXVII. xxix. 7), now Kelibia. The place meant here was probably in north-western Tunisia or north-eastern Algeria.</note> so overwhelmed him that he slew every one of his horsemen except four. With these men, in the midst of the uproar he let the wounded Masinissa himself slip away when almost in his hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fugitives were insight; a squadron of cavalry, scattering over the breadth of the plain, while some, in order to head them off, pushed on obliquely, was pursuing five enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A broad stream<note>Probably the Bagradas (Medjerda), as streams of size are rare in the region.</note> was the refuge of the <pb id="p.333"/>fleeing; for without hesitation, under the pressure<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> of a greater fear, they put their horses into it; and swept by the whirling current, they were borne obliquely past the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When two of them had been drowned in the swiftly whirling waters before the eyes of the enemy, Masinissa himself, whom they believed to have perished, and the two remaining horsemen with him made their way out among the bushes of the farther bank. That was the end of pursuit for Bucar, as he did not dare enter the river and believed he had no one left to pursue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then he returned to the king, falsely reporting that Masinissa had been drowned; and messengers were sent to bring tidings of great joy to Carthage. And all Africa was filled with the story of Masinissa's death, producing different emotions.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>While Masinissa in a hidden cave was nursing his wound with herbs, he lived for some days on booty brought in by the two horsemen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As soon as the wound had closed and it seemed possible for him to endure jolting, with great audacity he set out to reclaim his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And after picking up not more than forty horsemen as he rode along, he came among the Maesulians, openly announcing now who he was; thereupon he caused a great stir, owing to their old-time favour and especially to their unexpected joy because they saw a man safe and sound whom they had believed to have perished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The results were that within a few days six thousand armed foot-soldiers and four thousand horsemen flocked to him, and that now he was not merely in possession of his father's kingdom but was even laying waste lands of allies of the Carthaginians and those of the Masaesulians, the kingdom, that is, of <pb id="p.335"/>Syphax. Consequently, having provoked Syphax to<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> war, he established himself between Cirta<note>This was Syphax' capital; XXX. xii. 3, 7 f. Given to Masinissa, <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xliv. 12. Formidably defended by great cliffs. Later it was the city of Fronto, teacher of Marcus Aurelius. Rebuilt by Constantine, whose name it still bears. Cf. Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 27; Strabo XVII. iii. 13.</note> and Hippo<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Hippo Regius (B&ocirc;ne), not the Hippo meant on p. 218.</note> on a mountain range that in every way was favourable.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Therefore Syphax, thinking the affair was now too serious to be conducted by his officers, sent a part of the army under his young son, Vermina by name, with orders to lead his column round and attack the rear of the enemy, whose eyes would be upon the king himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Vermina, who was to make a secret attack, set out by night. But Syphax broke camp and marched by day along an open road, since he intended to engage in battle formation, standards against standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the interval seemed to be such that the flanking party might be thought to have reached their objective already, the king on his part, relying both on numbers and on the ambuscade prepared in the rear, led his line up along the face of the mountain over a gentle slope leading in the direction of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Masinissa also, relying chiefly upon the much more favourable ground on which he was to fight, led his men out into line. The battle was fierce and long indecisive, while position and the courage of his soldiers aided Masinissa and numbers that were far superior favoured Syphax.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That great army in its two sections &mdash;since the one pressed the enemy hard in front, while the other had accomplished its flanking movement in the rear &mdash;gave no uncertain victory to Syphax; and there was not even a way of escape open to men enclosed both in front and in the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly the rest, infantry and cavalry, were slain or captured; but some two hundred horsemen were ordered by Masinissa to mass about him, divide into <pb id="p.337"/>three troops, and so to break their way through, a<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> place being assigned in advance at which they should meet after their flight in different directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He himself escaped in the direction he had chosen through the midst of the enemies' weapons. Two of the squadrons were held fast; one in fear surrendered to the enemy, while the other, offering a more stubborn resistance, was overwhelmed by missiles and slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Vermina, who was almost at his heels, Masinissa evaded by turning now into this road and now into that, and compelled him at last to abandon pursuit when he was weary and had given up hope. He himself made his way with sixty horsemen to the Lesser Syrtis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There, with the proud consciousness of having repeatedly made claim to his father's kingdom, in the region between the Punic Emporia<note>Cf. xxv. 12 and notes.</note> and the tribe of the Garamantes<note>Their land, south of modern Tripolitania, is now Fezzan, reaching back into the Sahara; Herodotus IV. 174, 183; Strabo II. v. 33; XVII. iii. 19, 23; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 36; VI. 209; Mela I. 23, 45; Tacitus <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> III. 74.</note> he spent the whole time until the arrival in Africa of Gaius Laelius and the Roman fleet. These circumstances incline me to believe that Masinissa came to Scipio also later with a small force<note>In agreement with Polybius XXI. xxi. 2.</note> of cavalry rather than with a large one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For such great numbers are suited to a monarch, while my small figures match the plight of an exile.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Carthaginians, having lost a squadron of cavalry with its commander<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the Hanno named in xxix. 1 without further description than <hi rend="italics">nobilem iuvenem.</hi></note> and acquired other horse by a fresh levy, placed Hanno the son of Hamilcar<note>According to Dio Cassius this Hanno was the son of Hasdrubal son of Gisgo; frag. 57. 65 f. See below, p. 343, n. 2.</note> in command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Again and again they summoned Hasdrubal and Syphax by letters and messengers, finally even by envoys. They bade <pb id="p.339"/>Hasdrubal bring aid to his native city, now almost<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> invested; they entreated Syphax to come to the rescue of Carthage, to the rescue of all Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Scipio at that time had his camp near Utica, about a mile from the city,<note>Evidently south-west of Utica and on the same long ridge. Not the same situation as that in xxxv. 7. Cf. Veith, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 579 f.</note> having shifted it from the seashore, where for a few days the camp had been established close to the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hanno, who had received a cavalry force not strong enough even to prevent the devastation of farms, to say nothing of attacking the enemy, made it his very first task to increase the number of his horsemen by recruiting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And though he did not reject men from other tribes, it was nevertheless especially Numidians that he hired, they being easily the foremost type of cavalry in Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Already he had about four thousand horsemen when he seized a city named Salaeca,<note>Mentioned only here and xxxv. 4. Possibly Henchir el Bey, west-south-west of Utica. Appian names a large town called Locha; <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 15.</note> some fifteen miles from the Roman camp. When this was reported to Scipio, he said <quote>Cavalry summering under roofs!
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let them be even more numerous, provided they have that kind of a commander!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thinking that the more spiritless they were the less must he delay, he sent Masinissa forward with cavalry, ordering him to ride up to the gates and draw the enemy out into battle. When the whole multitude should have sallied out and in battle should then prove too powerful for them to withstand easily, he was gradually to retire. He would himself come into the battle at the right moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After delaying only long enough to give time, as it seemed, for Masinissa, who had preceded him, to draw out the enemy, Scipio followed with the <pb id="p.341"/>Roman cavalry and advanced unseen under cover of<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> the hills, which were most conveniently placed on both sides of a winding road.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Masinissa according to plan, now as inspirer of terror, now as the terror-stricken, would either ride up to the very gates, or retiring would tempt them to reckless pursuit whenever his pretence of fear added to the enemy's boldness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not yet had all sallied out, and the commander was exerting himself in various ways, as he compelled some men heavy with wine and sleep to take up their arms and bridle their horses, and stood in the way of others, to prevent their dashing out of all the gates, scattering and unformed, with no order, no standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At first, as they rashly charged, Masinissa would meet their attack. Later larger numbers, dashing out of a gate in a mass, had made it an even combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Finally, when all their cavalry was engaged, they could no longer be withstood. Yet Masinissa did not flee in disorder, but retiring gradually would meet their attacks until he drew them to the hills which concealed the Roman cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thereupon the horsemen dashing out, themselves with undiminished strength and their horses fresh, surrounded Hanno and the Africans, who were exhausted by fighting and pursuit; and Masinissa, suddenly turning his horses about, went into battle again.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> About a thousand men who had been at the head of the column, finding retreat difficult, were cut off and slain along with Hanno himself, their commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> As for the rest, who were terrified especially by the death of their commander, the victors pursuing them in headlong flight for thirty miles either captured or slew about two thousand more <pb id="p.343"/>horsemen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Among these it was well established that<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> there were not less than two hundred Carthaginian horsemen, some of them distinguished both for wealth and noble blood.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the same day on which these events took place the ships which had carried booty to Sicily happened to return with supplies, as though with a presentiment that they had come for booty a second time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not all the historians vouch for the slaying of two Carthaginian commanders of the same name in two cavalry battles, fearing, I suppose, unwittingly to tell the same story twice.<note>Livy appears to have followed a lost part of Polybius. Two annalists only are mentioned (next sentence) who accepted but one encounter with cavalry commanded by a Hanno. Cf. Appian <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> 14; Dio Cass. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>( = Zonaras IX. xii. 4 f.). These tell the story quite differently. Modern historians are divided, some insisting that one of the battles is a doublet, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> De Sanctis III. 2. 581 f.; <hi rend="italics">C.A.H.</hi> VIII. 100, n. 2. Not so Gsell, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 216, n. 4; Neumann, <hi rend="italics">Das Zeitalter der punischen Kriege</hi> 522; Karstedt, <hi rend="italics">Gesch. der Karthager</hi> III. 337 f., 545.</note> Coelius and Valerius, to be sure, relate that Hanno too was captured.<note>This is the statement of Appian also and Dio Cass. (Zon.), who add (<hi rend="italics">ll. cc.</hi>) that the prisoner was exchanged for Masinissa's own mother. So much detail seems to establish the historicity of the second engagement reported. As for the first (xxix. 1), something more than identity of a name (especially of a common name) is needed to stamp it as necessarily fictitious.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Scipio bestowed conspicuous rewards upon the commanders and the horsemen according to the service each had rendered, and above all on Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And having posted a strong garrison at Salaeca, he set out himself with the rest of the army. Laying waste not merely the farms wherever he went, but storming certain cities also and villages, while the alarm of the war was spread far and wide, on the seventh day after his departure he returned to camp bringing a great number of men and cattle and much booty of every kind; and again he sent away the ships loaded down with spoils of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, giving up small raids and petty pillaging, he applied <pb id="p.345"/>all his military
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> resources to the siege of Utica, with<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> the intention of having that city, if captured, as a base henceforth for all remaining operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From the fleet marines were brought up to the city on the side where it is washed by the sea,<note>At the north-east end of a long ridge. Just beyond there was a small island on which lay the oldest quarter of the city, at least 200 years older than Carthage (cf. Gades, p. 141, n. 1). The Medjerda (Bagradas) has since changed its winding course far to the west, and coming within less than half a mile of the ridge, has brought down alluvial deposits so extensive that the ruins of Utica are now about 7 miles from the nearest coast-line. Cf. Caesar <hi rend="italics">B.C.</hi> II. xxiv. 1, 3; Polybius I. lxxv. 5; XV. ii. 8 (his name for the river is Macaras); Strabo XVII. iii. 13 <hi rend="italics">fin.;</hi> Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 24. Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 75 errs as to the distance from Carthage, which was 27 miles (<hi rend="italics">Itin. Ant.</hi> 22).</note> and at the same time land forces on the side where a height almost overhung the very walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Artillery and engines he had not only brought with him but they had also been sent from Sicily with the supplies, and new ones were being made in an arsenal where many makers of such devices had been interned for the purpose.<note>The artisans as captives had become public slaves of the Roman people. Cf. those taken at New Carthage, XXVI. xlvii. 2; Polybius X. xvii. 6, 9.</note></p> 
				<p>For the people of Utica, completely beset by so great a force, all their hope was in the Carthaginian people; for the Carthaginians it was in Hasdrubal, provided he should prevail upon Syphax. But everything was moving more slowly than people in need of help desired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Although Hasdrubal by most intensive recruiting had made up a
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> total of about thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry, it was not before the arrival of Syphax, however, that he dared to move his camp nearer to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Syphax came with fifty thousand foot-soldiers and ten thousand horsemen, whereupon Hasdrubal, at once moving his camp away from Carthage, established himself not far from Utica and the Roman fortifications.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Their arrival had this effect at any <pb id="p.347"/>rate, that Scipio, after besieging Utica for about<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> forty days to no purpose in spite of all his attempts, retired from the place, having failed in his undertaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And as winter was now at hand, he fortified a winter camp on a promontory which is connected with the mainland by a narrow ridge, but extends for a considerable distance into the sea.<note>Caesar describes the site, still called Castra Corneli(an)a in his time and much later; <hi rend="italics">B.C.</hi> II. xxiv; cf. Appian <hi rend="italics">B.C.</hi> II. 44; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> V. 29; Ptolemy IV. 3. It was at the north-east end of a long ridge projecting into the sea (a cape Polybius calls it, XIV. vi. 7), and parallel to the ridge on which lay Utica, nearly two miles farther west, with a broad marsh between them. Caesar's text gives half the actual distance.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> By a single earthwork he enclosed the naval camp as well. The camp of the legions being placed on the middle of the ridge, its northern side was occupied by the beached ships and the men to man them, its southern slope, descending to the other shore, by the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such were the events in Africa down to the end of autumn.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Besides the grain brought in on all sides from ravaged farms of the whole region and supplies transported from Sicily and Italy, Gnaeus Octavius, the propraetor, brought a large amount of grain sent from Sardinia by Tiberius Claudius, the praetor in charge of that province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And not only were the granaries filled which had been built already, but also new granaries were built. Clothing was insufficient for the army. Octavius was ordered to obtain from the praetor whatever could be assembled and sent from that province. This charge also was carried out without delay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Twelve hundred togas were sent in a short time and twelve thousand tunics.</p> <pb id="p.349"/>
				<p>In the summer in which these events occurred in<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> Africa Publius Sempronius, the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> consul who had the land of the Bruttii as his province, engaged with Hannibal in the territory of Croton in an unorganized battle while actually on the march. They fought in columns rather than in battle-line. The Romans were worsted, and in what was in fact a confused struggle rather than a battle about twelve hundred of the consul's army were slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was a panic-stricken retreat to the camp, and yet the enemy did not venture to attack it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But in the silence of the following night the consul set out, and after despatching a messenger to Publius Licinius, the proconsul, urging him to bring up his legions, he united their forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus two generals and two armies once more confronted Hannibal, and there was no delay in engaging, since doubled forces emboldened the consul, as his recent victory did the Carthaginian. Sempronius led his legions into the first line, while Publius Licinius' legions were posted in reserve.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the beginning of the battle the consul vowed a temple to Fortuna Primigenia,<note>The temple, dedicated in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date>, stood on the Quirinal inside the Porta Collina; cf. XXXIV. liii. 5 f. The worship of this goddess came from Praeneste (Palestrina). She was so named as Jupiter's first-born daughter.</note> if he should rout the enemy that day; and he had his wish. The Carthaginians were routed and put to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Over four thousand armed men were slain, a little less than three hundred were captured alive, and forty horses and eleven military standards taken. Discouraged by defeat, Hannibal led his army back to Croton.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>At the same time Marcus Cornelius, the consul, in <pb id="p.351"/>the north of Italy held Etruria in check not so much<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> by arms as by the alarm produced by the trials,<note>Begun in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date> under M. Livius Salinator for the punishment of Etruscan and Umbrian disloyalty; p. 43 <hi rend="italics">med.</hi> Fugitives who escaped execution suffered confiscation of property (&sect; 12).</note> while almost the whole land was inclined towards Mago and through him to the hope of a political change.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In accordance with a decree of the senate he conducted these cases with no respect of persons. And at first many noble Etruscans who either had gone in person to Mago or had sent others to him reporting on the disloyalty of their communities, had appeared and had been condemned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Later on men who from a guilty conscience went into voluntary exile, on being condemned in absence, eluded bodily punishment, merely exposing their property instead to possible confiscation.<note>Begun in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date> under M.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consuls were thus employed in opposite regions, the censors Marcus Livius and Gaius Claudius at Rome meanwhile publicly read the list of senators. Quintus Fabius Maximus was chosen <hi rend="italics">princes</hi> for the second time.<note>Cf. XXVII. xi. 12.</note> Seven men received their <quote>mark,</quote><note>The <hi rend="italics">nota</hi> of the censors was a mark or stigma affixed (in the revised list of citizens) to the names of such men as had been degraded by the censors, who added the reason in each case. Cf. XXIV. xviii. 2 ff., esp. 9.</note> but no one who had occupied a curule chair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Repairs to public buildings and their roofs they enforced strictly and with the greatest fidelity. They let the contract for the making of a street leading out of the Cattle Market, on both sides of the spectators' stands, as far as the Temple of Venus,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Venus Obsequens. Built <date value="-295">295 B.C.</date>, near the east end of the Circus Maximus, and on the side toward the Aventine; X. xxxi. 9.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They also established a new revenue from the yearly production of salt. Both at Rome and throughout Italy salt was then sold at one-sixth of an <hi rend="italics">as.</hi>The censors let <pb id="p.353"/>contracts for the sale of salt at the same price at<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> Rome, at a higher price even in market-towns and local centres,<note>On these petty localities v. - Vol. VI. p. 356, n. 1. In the Lex Iulia municipalis (<date value="-45">45 B.C.</date>) they are repeatedly mentioned as the lowest grades of communities, inferior to <hi rend="italics">municipia, coloniae</hi> and <hi rend="italics">praefecturae,</hi> which are implied here in <hi rend="italics">alibi,</hi> as we cannot believe that any towns however small escaped the higher price. In Rome alone was the previous <quote>ceiling</quote> continued.</note> and at prices which varied from place to place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This source of revenue was generally believed to have been devised by only one of the censors, who was angry with the people because he had formerly been condemned by an unjust verdict;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and that in the price of salt those tribes by whose efforts he had been condemned were most heavily burdened.<note>How to reconcile this statement with the status of Livius' own Maecia (&sect; 13) as one of the rustic tribes and hence bound to pay the higher price is a futile question, since the whole story bears the stamp of fiction. The state owned all salt works, but they were operated by contractors, who with prices raised could now pay more for their concessions. This amounted to putting a tax on salt except in Rome. Cf. Dio Cassius frag. 57. 70.</note> Hence the cognomen Salinator was bestowed upon Livius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The ceremony of purification was completed later than usual because the censors had sent men to the various provinces to report the number of Roman citizens in each of the armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Including these, 214,000 men<note>Compared with 137,108 four years before; Vol. VII. p. 355, n. 3.</note> were listed. Gaius Claudius Nero concluded the rite of purification. Then they received the census lists of the twelve colonies<note>Cf. xv. 5 ff., esp. 10.</note> presented by their own censors, as had never been done before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The purpose was that documents, to show what was their strength in the number of soldiers and what in money, might be found in the public records. Then they began to take the census of the knights; and it happened that both of the censors had horses from the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they had reached the Pollia tribe, in which stood the name of <pb id="p.355"/>Marcus Livius, and while the herald was hesitating<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> to summon the censor himself, Nero said, <quote>Summon Marcus Livius!</quote> And whether as still nursing their ancient quarrel, or priding himself on an ill-timed display of strictness because he had been condemned by a verdict of the people, he ordered Marcus Livius to sell his horse.<note>The horse had been bought out of an allowance (<hi rend="italics">aes equestre</hi>) from the state, but was not public property; Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">Staatsrecht</hi> III. 256, n. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Likewise Marcus Livius, when they had reached the Arniensis tribe and the name of his colleague, ordered Gaius Claudius to sell his horse for two reasons: one because he had given false testimony<note>In the trial before the popular assembly, cf. Vol. VII. p. 347 and note 1.</note> against Livius, the other that he had not honestly been reconciled with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Equally shameful at the close of their censorship was their contest in besmirching each the other's reputation to the detriment of his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When Gaius Claudius had taken the oath that he had complied with the laws, upon going up into the Treasury and giving the names of those whom he was leaving as mere tax-payers,<note>Cf. Vol. VI. p. 231. Any action taken by a censor without approval of his colleague was void; Mommsen <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> II.3 358; cf. <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XLV. xv. 8.</note> he gave the name of his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then Marcus Livius came into the Treasury, and except for the Maecia tribe, which had neither condemned him nor after his condemnation voted for him either for consul or for censor, he left the entire Roman people, thirty-four tribes, as mere tax-payers, alleging that they had
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> both condemned him, an innocent man, and after his condemnation had made him consul and censor, and could not deny that they had erred either once in their verdict or twice in the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He said that among the thirty-four tribes Gaius Claudius also would be a mere tax-payer; and that if he had a precedent <pb id="p.357"/>for twice leaving the same man a mere tax-payer,<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> he would have left Gaius Claudius among them with express mention of his name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> A perverted contest between the censors in regard to their <quote>marks</quote>; but to the fickleness of the people it was a rebuke worthy of a censor and in keeping with the earnestness of those times.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Since the censors were unpopular, Gnaeus Baebius, a tribune of the plebs,<note>Baebius Tamphilus reached the consulship in <date value="-182">182 B.C.</date>; XXXIX. lvi. 4.</note> thinking it an opportunity to advance himself at their expense, named a day for both to appear before the people. That procedure was quashed by unanimity among the senators, lest the censorship should be subject thereafter to the caprice of the populace.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same summer in the land of the Bruttii Clampetia was taken by storm by the consul. Consentia<note>Chief town of the Bruttii, modern Cosenza, captured by the Carthaginians in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date> It returned to the Romans in 213, but had changed sides once more; cf. XXIII. xxx. 5; XXV. i. 2; XXX. xix. 10 (a repetition). Later an important point on the great inland road, Via Popilia, from Capua to Reggio (Regium); <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> X. 6950 (= I. ii, ed. 2, 638). Clampetia was on the coast south-west of Consentia.</note> together with Pandosia and other cities of no importance voluntarily submitted to his authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And since the time for elections was now at hand, it was decided to summon Cornelius to Rome from Etruria, where there was no war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He announced the election of Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and Gaius Servilius Geminus as consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then elections for the praetorships were held. Elected were Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Publius Quinctilius Varus, Publius Aelius Paetus, Publius Villius Tappulus, the last two being made praetors while they were plebeian aediles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul after the elections were over returned to the army in Etruria.</p> 
				<p>Priests who died that year and successors appointed <pb id="p.359"/>in their places were:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Tiberius Veturius Philo,<note type="margin">B.C. 204</note> elected and installed flamen of Mars in place of Marcus Aemilius Regillus, who had died in the preceding year;<note>Immediately correcting the opening words of the paragraph. Cf. xi. 14 for Regillus' death in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> in succession to Marcus Pomponius Matho, augur and decemvir,<note>Pomponius, probably praetor in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date>, had held two priesthoods concurrently, as did Otacilius in XXVII. vi. 15.</note> were elected Marcus Aurelius Cotta as decemvir, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus as augur, being a mere youth, which was then a very unusual thing in the assignment of priesthoods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A gilded four-horse chariot was set up in that year on the Capitol by the curule aediles Gaius Livius and Marcus Servilius Geminus. And the Roman Games were repeated for two days, as were the Plebeian Games also for two days by the aediles Publius Aelius and Publius Villius; and on account of the festival there was a banquet for Jupiter.</p>

				<p>GAIUS LAELIUS, having been sent by Scipio from Sicily
					to Africa, brought back immense booty and delivered to
					Scipio Masinissa's messages, complaining because he had
					not yet transported his army to Africa. The war which
					Indibilis had stirred up in Spain was brought to an end with
					the Roman as victor. He himself was slain in battle;
					Mandonius was surrendered by his own people to the
					Romans in response to their demand. To Mago, who was
					at Albingaunum, among the Ligurians, a large contingent
					was sent from Africa and also funds with which to hire
					auxiliaries; and he was ordered to unite with Hannibal.
					Scipio crossed over from Syracuse into the Bruttian territory and recovered Locri by defeating the Punic garrison
					and putting Hannibal to flight. Peace was made with
					Philip. The Idaean Mother was brought to Rome from
					Pessinus, a town in Phrygia, since in the Sibylline books
					verses had been found, saying that a foreign enemy could
					be driven out of Italy if the Idaean Mother should be
					brought to Rome. And she was delivered to the Romans
					by Attalus, King of Asia. It was a stone which the natives
					said was the Mother of the gods. She was received by
					Publius Scipio Nasica, son of that Gnaeus who had perished
					in Spain. He was adjudged the best man by the senate,
					because, although he was a young man who had not yet
					been quaestor, the oracle commanded that that divinity
					should be received and consecrated by the best man.
					The Locrians sent envoys to Rome to complain of the
					lawless conduct of Pleminius, the legatus, who had carried
					off the money of Proserpina and had outraged their
					children and their wives. He was taken in chains to Rome
					and died in the prison.<note>Cf. pp. 283 (xix. 5) and 296, n. 1.</note> When an unfounded report
					<pb id="p.363"/>
					had been brought to the city in regard to Publius Scipio,
					the proconsul, who was in Sicily, alleging that he was
					leading a life of indulgence there, representatives were
					for this reason sent by the senate to discover whether the
					charges were true. Being cleared of evil repute Scipio
					crossed over to Africa by permission of the senate. Syphax,
					having received in marriage the daughter of Hasdrubal
					son of Gisgo, renounced the friendship which he had made
					with Scipio. Masinissa, King of the Massylians, while
					serving in Spain for the Carthaginians, after losing his
					father Gala, had been excluded from the kingship. When
					he repeatedly sought to regain it by war, he was defeated
					by Syphax, King of the Numidians, in a number of battles
					and was completely dispossessed. And as an exile with
					two hundred horsemen he joined Scipio and with him
					at the very beginning of the campaign he slew Hanno son
					of Hamilcar, together with his large force. Scipio, on the
					arrival of Hasdrubal and Syphax, who had come with
					almost a hundred thousand armed men, was forced to
					raise the siege of Utica and fortified a winter camp.
					Sempronius, the consul, fought successfully against
					Hannibal in the territory of Croton. Between the censors,
					Marcus Livius and Claudius Nero, there was a memorable
					quarrel. For Claudius took away his colleague Livius'
					horse because he had been condemned by the people and
					driven into exile, and Livius did the same for Claudius
					because the latter had borne false witness against him
					and because he had not been sincere in being reconciled
					with him. Likewise Livius left all the tribes but one mere
					tax-payers, because they had both condemned him,
					though innocent, and had later made him consul and censor.
					The rite of purification was completed by the censors.
					The number of citizens listed was 214,000.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>GNAEUS SERVILIUS and Gaius Servilius,<note>Omission of cognomina at the beginning of a new book would be striking if their full names had not just been given in XXIX. xxxviii. 3; cf. below, &sect; 8 (cognomina only).</note> the<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> consuls, whose year was the sixteenth of the Punic war, having laid before the senate the condition of the state and the war and the assignments, the senators voted that the consuls
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> should arrange between them, or determine by lot, which of them should have as his assignment the land of the Bruttii, confronting Hannibal, and which of them Etruria and Liguria;<note>This addition to Etruria as one consul's province (and for the first time) was in view of Mago's activity on the Ligurian coast; cf. &sect; 10; XXIX. v.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that the consul to whom the Bruttii should fall was to take over an army from Publius Sempronius; that Publius Sempronius &mdash;for he also had his command prolonged for one year as proconsul &mdash;should succeed Publius Licinius;<note>The first Crassus to be called Dives; Dio Cass. frag. 57. 52. Before his consulship in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> he had been censor in 210; XXVII. vi. 17.</note> that the latter should return to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In war also Licinius was now highly rated, in addition to the other fields in which no citizen was at that time considered more fully equipped, since all the advantages possible to man had been heaped upon him by nature and fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Of noble birth he was at the same time wealthy. Conspicuous for a handsome figure and physical strength, he was considered a very eloquent speaker, whether a legal case was to be conducted, or when there was occasion in the senate and before the people <pb id="p.369"/>to persuade or dissuade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the pontifical law he was<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> accounted a master; and now, to crown these distinctions, his consulship had brought him military laurels as well.<note>No important victory of Crassus is known. Elected pontifex maximus in <date value="-212">212 B.C.</date> (XXV. v. 3 f.), he held that office for 29 years down to his death in <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date> His funeral was marked by many gladiatorial combats, games and a public feast in the Forum; XXXIX. xlvi. 2 ff. Livy's portrait reads like a <hi rend="italics">laudatio funebris,</hi> and it would seem more in place in Book XXXIX than here. Cf. Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Orat.</hi> III. 134.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The decision taken in regard to the land of the Bruttii as a province was repeated in the case of Etruria and Liguria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Marcus Cornelius was ordered to turn over his army to the new consul, and himself, with his command continued, to hold Gaul as his assignment, having the legions which Lucius Scribonius had held the year before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thereupon they drew their assignments by lot, the Bruttian country falling to Caepio, Etruria to Geminus. Lots were then cast for the praetors' assignments. Aelius Paetus<note>Elected at XXIX. xxxviii. 4; consul in <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date>; below, xl. 5; censor with Scipio Africanus in <date value="-199">199 B.C.</date>; XXXII. vii. 2.</note> drew the city praetorship, Publius Lentulus Sardinia, Publius Villius Sicily, Quinctilius Varus Ariminum with two legions which had been under the command of Spurius Lucretius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Lucretius' command also was continued, that he might build up the town of Genua,<note>Cf. XXVIII. xlvi. 8 and note.</note> destroyed by Mago the Carthaginian. Publius Scipio's command was prolonged, not for a fixed time but to the completion of his task, until the war in Africa should be over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And it was decreed that there should be a season of prayer that his crossing over to Africa as his province might be beneficial to the Roman people and to the commander himself and his army.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For Sicily three thousand soldiers were enrolled because all the best troops that province used to have <pb id="p.371"/>had been transported to Africa. Furthermore,<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> because it had been decided to defend the sea-coast of Sicily with forty ships, in order to prevent any fleet from crossing over from Africa, Villius took with him thirteen new ships to Sicily, while the rest in Sicily were old ships repaired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Placed in charge of this fleet, with his command continued, was Marcus Pomponius, praetor
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> in the preceding year, who provided the ships with new soldiers brought from Italy. The same number of ships were by decree of the senate assigned, with the same
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> extension of his command, to Gnaeus Octavius, who likewise had been praetor<note>Octavius was really propraetor in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>, having been praetor in 205; XXVIII. xxxviii. 11, 13; XXIX. xiii. 5.</note> in the preceding year, in order to defend the coast of Sardinia. Lentulus, the praetor, was ordered to furnish two thousand soldiers for the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As for the defence of the coast of Italy, since it was not known to what point the Carthaginians would send their fleet &mdash;while they seemed likely to attack any part of it that was left unguarded &mdash;that task with the same number of ships was entrusted to Marcus Marcius, praetor in the previous year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Three thousand soldiers were enrolled by the consuls for that fleet in accordance with a decree of the senate, and two city legions for emergency duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Spanish provinces were assigned by a decree of the senate to their veteran commanders, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus with the armies and military authority. The Roman state was administered that year with a total of twenty legions and a hundred and sixty war-ships.<note>Including another fleet of 40 ships which sailed with Scipio to Africa; XXIX. xxvi. 3; below, xli. 7.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The praetors were ordered to go to their provinces, while the consuls were bidden, before their departure <pb id="p.373"/>from the city, to conduct the great games which Titus<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> Manlius Torquatus<note>Torquatus had made the vow <date value="-208">208 B.C.</date>, after presiding at the games vowed by Marcus Aemilius, praetor in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date>; XXVII. xxxiii. 8. They were actually postponed until <date value="-202">202 B.C.</date>; below, xxvii. 11 f. Inclusive reckoning accounts for <hi rend="italics">quintum.</hi></note> as dictator had vowed for the fourth year, if the state should remain as it was before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And new religious fears were aroused in men's minds by portents reported from a number of places. On the Capitol ravens were believed not only to have torn away gilding with their beaks but even to have eaten it. At Antium mice gnawed a golden wreath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The whole region around Capua was covered by an immense number of locusts, while there was no agreement as to whence they had come. At Reate a colt with five feet was foaled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At Anagnia there were at first shooting-stars at intervals and then a great meteor blazed out.<note>For meteors see p. 258, n. 2. Cf. also <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi> II. 694 ff.; Lucretius II. 206 ff.; Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> II. 96.</note>

At Arpinum in an open meadow the earth settled into a huge depression. One of the consuls on sacrificing his first victim found the <quote>head</quote> of the liver lacking.<note>In divination the liver, being variable in form, was considered of great importance, particularly a protuberance known as the <quote>head.</quote> If the <hi rend="italics">caput</hi> was large the omen was favourable (XXVII. xxvi. 14), if small or misshapen, unfavourable. Nothing was accounted more ominous than its absence (<hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> &sect; 13); cf. Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> II. 32 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi> and Pease's notes; VIII. ix. 1; George F. Moore, <hi rend="italics">History of Religions</hi> I. 559.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These prodigies were expiated by full-grown victims; the gods to whom sacrifices should be offered were announced by the college of the pontiffs.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having completed these tasks the consuls and praetors set out for their provinces. All of them, however, turned their attention to Africa, just as though that had been allotted to them, either because they saw it was there that the main issue and the <pb id="p.375"/>outcome of the war were centred, or in order to show<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> Scipio favour, on whom the eyes of all the citizens were then fixed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly not only from Sardinia, as has been said above, but also from Sicily and Spain clothing and grain were being transported thither, and arms as well and supplies of every kind from Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And at no time in the winter had Scipio lessened his military operations, which were many and all around him at the same time. He was besieging Utica;<note>Resuming early in the spring (iv. 10) the siege abandoned in the previous autumn; XXIX. xxxv. 12.</note> the camp of Hasdrubal could be seen; the Carthaginians had launched their ships; they kept their fleet ready and equipped, in order to intercept supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the midst of all this he had also not forgotten his effort to recover the support of Syphax, in case by that time, after much indulgence, satiety might have overtaken him in his love for his wife.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From Syphax came rather terms of peace with the Carthaginians under which the Romans should withdraw from Africa, the Carthaginians from Italy, than any hope that in the event of war he would change sides.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> would denounce his agreement with Carthage and renew previous relations with Scipio.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That these dealings went on through messengers<note>Cf. Polybius XIV. i. 6, who also seems to think Scipio began by sending messengers (i.e. envoys, below, iv. 2, 4) to Syphax. Others represent Syphax as beginning the negotiations; Zonaras IX. xii. 2; Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 17, representing him as pretending friendship for both sides.</note> I am more inclined to believe &mdash;and for this a majority of the historians vouch &mdash;than that Syphax came in person into the Roman camp for a conference, as Valerius Antias relates. At first the Roman general scarcely listened to such terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Later, that his men might have a plausible reason for visiting the enemy's camp, he was less firm in rejecting the same offers, and encouraged <pb id="p.377"/>the hope that, if they repeatedly discussed the matter<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> from both sides, agreement would be reached.</p> 
				<p>The winter quarters of the Carthaginians, being constructed of building material gathered at random from the farms, were almost entirely of wood.<note>Cf. Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> &sect;&sect; 6 f.; Zonaras &sect; 8. Not that Roman <hi rend="italics">hibernacula</hi> were always much less inflammable; XXVII. iii. 3 (outside the walls of Capua); Hirtius <hi rend="italics">B.G.</hi> VIII. v. 2; <hi rend="italics">Bell. Hisp.</hi> xvi. 2. No representations of them are known.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In particular the Numidians were dwelling in huts of plaited reeds,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> most of them under thatched roofs, and scattered without a plan, some of their number even outside the fosse and earthwork &mdash;the natural result of seizing upon a site without waiting for orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This was reported to Scipio and had inspired the hope of setting fire to the camp of the enemy when opportunity should offer.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With the legates whom he kept sending to Syphax he would send some first centurions of attested courage and discretion as servants and garbed as slaves, that while the legates were in
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> conference they might roam about the camp in different directions and take note of all entrances and exits, the situation and plan both of the camp as a whole and of its divisions, where the Carthaginians and where the Numidians had their quarters. They were to discover what was the distance between Hasdrubal's camp and that of the king, also to learn their practice as regards outposts and sentries, whether they were more exposed to an unexpected attack by night or by day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And in the course of numerous conferences other men and again others were purposely sent, that a larger number might acquaint themselves with everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When repeated discussions were giving Syphax, and through him the Carthaginians, a daily surer hope of peace, the Roman legates announced that they were forbidden to return to their general unless a definite <pb id="p.379"/>answer was made to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore, if his own<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> decision was already made, &lt;let him declare it&gt;; if on the other hand Hasdrubal and the Carthaginians had to be conferred with, let him confer with them. It was time, they said, either to agree upon peace or to wage war in earnest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While Hasdrubal was being conferred with by Syphax, and the Carthaginians by Hasdrubal, the spies had time to observe everything, as had Scipio to get together whatever was needful.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And out of the talk of peace and the hope of it, as usually happens, there sprang a neglect on the part of the Carthaginians and the Numidian to guard against any attack which might be made upon them in the meantime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At last the answer was returned, including certain unreasonable terms adroitly added just because the Roman seemed extremely desirous of peace. These furnished Scipio, who was eager to denounce the truce, a very timely pretext.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And after stating to the king's messenger that he would lay the matter before his council, on the next day he reported that, while he alone strove in vain to bring about peace, no one else had favoured it.<note>Cf. Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> ii. 11.</note> The messenger therefore, he said, should report that Syphax had no other hope of peace with the Romans except by abandoning the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His purpose in denouncing the truce was that, being no longer bound by promises, he might carry out his undertaking.. And launching his ships &mdash;it was now the beginning of spring &mdash;he mounted engines of war and artillery upon them, as though intending to attack Utica from the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He also sent two thousand soldiers to seize the hill he had. previously held,<note>See XXIX. xxxv. 7; Polybius &sect;&sect; 3 f.</note> looking down upon Utica, both <pb id="p.381"/>in order to divert the attention of the enemy from his<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> real purpose to anxiety about a
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> different attack, and at the same time that, when he should himself set out to meet Syphax and Hasdrubal, there should be no sally from the city and no attack upon his camp when left with only a small garrison.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After these preparations, summoning the council, he ordered the spies<note>Obviously some of the centurions of iv. 1-3 appeared before the <hi rend="italics">consilium.</hi></note> to set forth what information they had to report, and Masinissa as well, who knew everything about the enemy. Finally he laid before them his plan for the following night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the tribunes he gave orders that, when the council had been dismissed and the trumpets had sounded, they should at once lead their legions out of the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In accordance with the orders he had given the standards were first set in motion just before sunset; at about the first watch the column was deployed. At midnight &mdash;for it was a march of seven miles &mdash;proceeding at a moderate speed they reached the enemy's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There Scipio assigned to Laelius a part<note>One-half according to Polybius iv. 2, to which Livy's <hi rend="italics">partem</hi> is not meant as a correction. The whole passage should be read, being more detailed than in the Latin version.</note> of the forces and Masinissa with his Numidians, and bade them burst into the camp of Syphax and set fire to it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then led Laelius and Masinissa aside separately and implored each of them to make up by
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> their diligence and alertness for all the foresight of which night deprived them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was about to attack Hasdrubal, he said, and the Carthaginian camp; but he would not begin until he should see fire in the king's camp. Nor did that delay him long; for as soon as fire was thrown upon the first huts it caught, and then at once laying hold of everything <pb id="p.383"/>that was near, and so on in unbroken succession, it<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> spread hither and thither through the entire camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Great was the alarm, to be sure, as was inevitable in a fire so widespread in the night; but they thought the blaze accidental, not due to an enemy and war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pouring out without arms to extinguish the flames, they encountered armed enemies, particularly Numidians posted in suitable places at the ends of the streets by Masinissa, familiar as he was with the king's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Many even in their beds and half-asleep were burned to death; many rushing pell-mell in headlong flight were trodden down in the narrow gateways.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the light of the fire had been seen, first by sentries of the Carthaginians and then by others whom the uproar in the night aroused, they likewise made the same mistake in believing the fire to be spontaneous.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And outcries raised in the midst of slaughter and wounds made men unable to grasp the real situation, being half-inclined to think it due to a disturbance in the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, having no suspicion of any attack, they outdid one another in dashing out of all the gates unarmed, each taking the nearest way, carrying only what would be of use to extinguish the fire, and suddenly encountered the Roman column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they had all been slain, not only because of an enemy's hatred, but also that no man might escape to tell the tale, Scipio at once burst into the gates, naturally unguarded in such a commotion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And then as firebrands were thrown upon the nearest roofs, the flames pouring out at first seemed to blaze at a number of scattered points; and then creeping along without a break they promptly consumed <pb id="p.385"/>everything in one conflagration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Men and beasts<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> of burden that had suffered burns blocked streets leading to the gates, at first by their panic-stricken flight and then by their fallen bodies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those whom the fire had not overtaken were destroyed by the sword, and two camps were wiped out in a single disaster.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Slain or burned to death were some forty thousand men, more than five thousand captured, many Carthaginian nobles, eleven senators.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal after fleeing had made his way with a few men to the nearest city<note>Anda according to Appian <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> 24; not elsewhere mentioned. In Polybius the town appears to have been named in the lacuna before ch. vi.</note> of the Africans; and to it had come all the survivors, following the trail of their general. Then for fear that it might surrender to Scipio he left the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Soon after the gates were opened and the Romans admitted to the same city. And since they had voluntarily submitted no hostile step was taken. Thereafter two cities were captured and plundered. Their booty and what had been rescued from the flames when the camps <pb id="p.387"/>were burned was granted to the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Syphax<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> established himself in a fortified place<note>The town of Abba in Polybius &sect; 12; vii. 5. Obba, below, &sect; 10, cannot be the same. Cf. p. 389, n. 2; 550 f.</note> at a distance of about eight miles. Hasdrubal hastened to Carthage, that no weak action might be taken in the fear induced by the recent disaster.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first the news brought such alarm to the city that they believed Scipio would leave Utica to itself and forthwith besiege Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate was accordingly convened by the <hi rend="italics">suf&#x0115;tes,</hi> whose authority corresponded to that of consuls.<note>For the two <hi rend="italics">suf&#x0115;tes</hi> cf. XXVIII. xxxvii. 2; XXXIV. lxi. 15.</note> There it was a conflict between three proposals:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> one favoured peace envoys to Scipio; the second was for recalling Hannibal to defend their city from a war which meant destruction; the third showed a Roman steadfastness in adversity. This proposal was that they should repair the losses to the army and urge Syphax not to give up the war.<note>The three proposals are from Polybius vi. 10 ff. Not so the following reference to Hasdrubal and the party of Hannibal. In one version Hasdrubal's loss of an army was to be punished by execution; Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 24, 36; cf. 38.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This motion was carried because Hasdrubal in person and all of the Barcine party supported the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then they began to conduct a levy in the city and in the country, and emissaries were sent to Syphax, who on his part also was making every effort to renew the war, since his wife had influenced him &mdash;no longer, as before, by caresses, effectual enough for the temper of a lover &mdash;but
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> by prayers and moving entreaty, imploring him, as her eyes filled with tears, not to betray her father and her city and allow Carthage to be destroyed by the same flames with which the camps had been consumed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hope also at the right moment was brought by the emissaries in the news that four thousand <pb id="p.389"/>Celtiberians, the flower of their youth, had met them near<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> a city named Obba, having been hired in Spain by their own recruiting-officers; and Hasdrubal, they said, would soon arrive with a force by no means to be despised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In consequence he not only gave a favourable answer to the legates but also showed them a large number of Numidian rustics to whom he had just been furnishing arms and horses, and assured them that he would call out all the young men from his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He was aware, he said, that the disaster had been due to fire, not to battle; that a war is lost only by the man who is defeated in battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Such was his answer to the legates, and after a few days Hasdrubal and Syphax again united their forces. The total strength of that army was about thirty thousand armed men.<note>Polybius' figures, including Numidians and the Celtiberian mercenaries; <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> vii. 9.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, as though the war was already over so far as concerned Syphax and the Carthaginians, was intent upon the siege of Utica and already bringing up his engines to the walls when news of renewed hostilities turned his attention in another direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And leaving sufficient land and sea forces merely to keep up the appearance of a blockade, he himself at once advanced with the main body of his army against the enemy.<note>This and the next sentence would lead us to suppose the advance to have been for a short distance only. But Livy, condensing Polybius, omits to mention a five-days' march. The battle-field then will be some 80 miles south-west of Utica. Syphax and Hasdrubal had removed to that distance in order to gain time and to receive reinforcements from Numidia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first he established himself upon a hill about four miles from the king's camp. On the following day with his cavalry he <pb id="p.391"/>went down into the so-called Great Plain,<note>La Dakhla, the broad central valley of the Medjerda (Bagradas), the granary of Tunisia.. In geological times a broad lake 25 miles long. Spaces so ample make it impossible to identify the field of battle. Ennius in a fragment represents Scipio as addressing the <hi rend="italics">patria:</hi> she, has no reason for fear in view of his Victories: <hi rend="italics">Testes sunt Campi Magni;</hi> Vahlen3 p. 213; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Orat.</hi> III, 11.67; Warmington, <hi rend="italics">Remains of Old Latin</hi> I. p. 398; cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And on the next two days by irregular charges, now from one side and now from the other by turns, they accomplished nothing worthy of mention. On the fourth day both went down into battle-line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman placed his <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> behind the front line maniples, made up of the <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> and as reserves the <hi rend="italics">tiarii.</hi><note>This was the customary formation, as Polybius observes; viii. 5; cf below, xxxii. 11; XXII v. 7.</note> The Italic cavalry he posted on the right wing, on the left the Numidians and Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Syphax and Hasdrubal opposed the Numidians to the Italic cavalry, the Carthaginians to Masinissa, and then placed the Celtiberians in the centre of the battle-line facing the maniples<note>For Polybius' terms for the maniple cf. p. 62, n. 2. In the passage used by Livy here both <foreign lang="greek">shmai/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">spei=ra</foreign> occur; viii. 5, 7; cf. XV. ix. 7.</note> of the legions. In this formation they clashed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By the first attack both wings, Numidians and Carthaginians alike, were beaten back at the same time. For neither could the Numidians, most of them rustics, withstand the Roman cavalry, nor could the Carthaginians, who were likewise raw recruits, hold out against Masinissa, a foe to be feared for other reasons and also on account of his recent victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Stripped of both wings the line of the Celtiberians made a stand because they could see no safety in flight since they did not know the country, and they had no hope of pardon from Scipio since they had come to Africa <pb id="p.393"/>as mercenaries to attack him in spite of his kind<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> treatment of them and their tribe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Therefore when the enemy had completely encircled them, falling one above another they were resolute in dying. And while all the enemy were intent upon them Syphax and Hasdrubal took advantage of a considerable interval for flight. Nightfall surprised the victors exhausted by a slaughter outlasting the battle.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day Scipio sent Laelius and Masinissa with all the Roman and Numidian cavalry and light-armed soldiers to pursue Syphax and Hasdrubal.<note>Hasdrubal fled to Carthage. In the hope of overtaking Syphax the pursuit was mainly to the west; Polybius &sect; 14.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He himself with the main body of the army, partly by inspiring hope, partly by arousing fear, partly by the use of force, gained possession of neighbouring cities, all of which were subject to the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Carthage there was a veritable panic, and they believed that Scipio, whose forces were circling about them, after swiftly vanquishing all their neighbours would suddenly assail Carthage itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly they were repairing the walls and providing them with battlements; and men also each for himself brought in from the country what was needed in order to endure a long siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Seldom was mention made of peace, more frequently they spoke of sending messengers to summon Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The majority urged that they should take the fleet, which had been made ready to intercept supplies, and send it to surprise the ships at anchor before Utica while off their guard. Perhaps, men said, they would surprise the naval camp<note>A part of the Castra Corneli(an)a, as it was later named, on the promontory; XXIX, xxxv. 13 and note.</note> as well, which had been left with a small garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To this <pb id="p.395"/>plan they were particularly inclined, but voted to<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> send messengers to Hannibal.<note>The scene in the Carthaginian senate is repainted after Polybius ix. 6-11.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For, they said, even supposing a great victory gained by the fleet, the siege of Utica would indeed be partially relieved; but for the defence of Carthage itself there remained no other general than Hannibal, no other army than that of Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Consequently ships were launched next day and at the same time the messengers sailed for Italy. There was also haste in all that they did under the goad of misfortune, while every one felt that if he should relax any effort he would be betraying the safety of all.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Scipio, who was slowly leading an army laden -now with the spoils of many cities, sent captives and the rest of the spoils to the old camp<note>Cf. note on &sect; 6.</note> before Utica, and being now intent upon Carthage, took possession of Tynes,<note>Tunis, on a narrow tongue of land, nowhere higher than 190 feet, between the Lac de Tunis and the lagoon, now a salt lake. Cf. Strabo XVII. iii. 16. The distance from Carthage agrees with Polybius (120 stades; x. 5), but it is in fact 10 miles.</note> abandoned by a fleeing garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The place is about fifteen miles from Carthage and defended by fortifications and particularly by its natural situation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It can also be seen from Carthage, at the same time itself affording a view both towards that city and towards the sea around the city. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From that point, just as they were throwing up an earthwork, the Romans sighted the enemy's fleet making towards Utica from Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly work was dropped, marching orders given and the standards hastily set in motion, that the ships, headed towards land and. the besieged city, also in no condition for a naval battle, might not be taken by <pb id="p.397"/>surprise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For how could an easily man&oelig;uvred fleet,<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> properly rigged with ship's gear and armed, have been resisted by ships carrying artillery and engines, and either converted now into transports or lying so close to the walls as to make scaling possible as if from an embankment and drawbridges?</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently Scipio, on reaching the place, gave those war-ships<note>Not mentioned again in the account of the battle. They would be perfectly helpless if the barrier of transports should be broken through. No figures are given here by Polybius, whose text breaks off abruptly after XIV. x. Appian, recording a different attack upon Scipio's naval base, has 100 Carthaginian war-ships against 20 Roman triremes; <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 24 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi></note> which might have defended the others a place in the rear line near the land, contrary to the usual practice in a naval battle. On the other hand he placed four lines of transports as a bulwark against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To prevent the lines from being broken in the confusion of the battle he also held these transports together by placing masts and yards crosswise from ship to ship and lashing them with stout ropes as if by a single cable. In addition he laid down planks above to make a gangway the whole length of the line of ships; and beneath these bridges he left openings where scouting vessels could dash out against the enemy and return in safety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These preparations having been hastily completed as best the circumstances permitted, about a thousand picked fighting men were placed on board the transports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A vast number of weapons, chiefly missiles, were assembled, that they might be sufficient for a battle no matter how long-continued. Thus equipped and alert they were awaiting the approach of the enemy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><pb id="p.399"/>
				<p>The Carthaginians, whose first attack, had they<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> made it in good time, would have been overpowering when everything was confused by the mass of men dashing about, were discouraged by their disastrous defeats on the land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And having in consequence no sufficient confidence on the sea either, where lay their own superiority, after spending the day in sailing slowly, they put in with their fleet about sunset into a harbour called Rusucmon<note>West of the Promontory of Apollo, it was inside the bay but had no real harbour. Its modern successor is Porto Farina.</note> by the Africans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the next day about sunrise they drew up their ships in the open sea, as if for a regular naval battle and anticipating that the Romans would come out against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After keeping their position for a long time and observing no movement on the part of the enemy, then only did they attack the transports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was not in the least like a naval battle, but had almost the appearance of ships attacking the walls of a city. The transports were considerably higher.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> From their war-ships the Carthaginians generally hurled their weapons to no purpose against a higher position, since they did so leaning backwards, while a hit from the transports above was heavier and from its mere weight had more force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Scouting vessels and other light craft, which kept dashing out through openings underneath the bridges, were at first themselves sunk by the mere momentum and mass of the war-ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Later they interfered with the fighting men as well because, as they mingled with the enemy's vessels, they often compelled the soldiers to withhold their missiles for fear in their uncertain aim they might hit their own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Finally poles with an iron hook <pb id="p.401"/>at the end &mdash;grappling-irons<note>Exaggerated boathooks. Cf. Vol. VII. p. 149 and note; Caesar <hi rend="italics">B.G.</hi> VII. lxxxi. 1; <hi rend="italics">Bell. Hisp.</hi> xvi. 2; Curtius IV. ii. 12; Vegetius II. 25; IV. 44 (in the navy); Zonaras IX. xii. 10.</note> the soldiers call them<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> &mdash;began to be thrown from the Carthaginian ships upon the Roman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Since the crews were unable either to cut off these poles or the chains by which they were hanging when thrown, whenever a warship was propelled astern, dragging a transport grappled by the hook, one might have seen men breaking up
					<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> the links by which it had been bound to others, and even several of the vessels being towed away together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Much after this fashion the bridges in the first line were broken down and hardly enough time was given the fighting men to spring across to the second line of ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> About sixty transports<note>On the voyage across from Lilybaeum he had 400 transports; XXIX. xxvi. 3. Their number by this time may have been considerably increased.</note> were towed away by the stern to Carthage. Rejoicing for that was excessive, but all the more acceptable because, in the midst of uninterrupted defeats and sorrows, one ray of joy however small had unexpectedly beamed upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> In addition it was clear to them that the Roman fleet had narrowly escaped destruction, and would have been destroyed if the captains<note>Cf. XXI. lxi. 4; XXXVI. xliv. 1; <hi rend="italics">magistri navium</hi> in XXIX. xxv. 7. The admiral was a Hamilcar according to Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 24. Cf. Laelius as <hi rend="italics">praefectus classis,</hi> XXVI. xlviii. 7; XXIX. xxv. 10.</note> of their own ships had not loitered, and if Scipio had not come to its aid in the nick of time.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time, as it happened, after <pb id="p.403"/>Laelius and Masinissa had reached Numidia in about<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> fifteen days, the Maesulians, that is, the kingdom of Masinissa's father, joyfully submitted to his rule, as that of a long-wished-for king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Syphax, when his commanders and garrisons had been driven out, confined himself to his old kingdom with no intention of remaining inactive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Love-sick, he was spurred on by his wife and father-in-law, and he had men and horses in such abundance that, when the forces of a kingdom that had flourished for many years were before his eyes, they could have roused a spirit that was even less barbarous and uncontrollable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Therefore, concentrating all the men fit for war, he assigned them horses, arms and missile weapons. He organized cavalry in troops, infantry in cohorts, in the manner he had formerly<note>Ten years before; XXIV. xlviii. 11 f.</note> learned from Roman centurions. With an army no smaller than that which he had had before, but almost entirely raw and untrained, he at once advanced against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And after a camp had been pitched not far away, at first a few horsemen rode forth from the outposts, scouting from a safe distance; then being driven away by lances they dashed back- to their own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Next in order came attacks made from both sides and, as men beaten back were inflamed by anger, more and more came to help them &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> usual provocation in cavalry engagements, when either hope adds reinforcements to the successful or anger to those who have been repulsed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So on this occasion, the battle having been begun by a few, all the cavalry of both sides in the end were sent pouring out by their zest for the fray. And so long as it was purely a cavalry battle, the great <pb id="p.405"/>numbers of the Masaesulians,<note>Cf. XXVIII. xvii. 5; XXIX. xxx. 10; xxxii. 14.</note> while Syphax was<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> sending out huge columns, could hardly be withstood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then when Roman infantry<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> only the light-armed (<hi rend="italics">velites).</hi> The legionaries enter first in &sect; 11.</note> by a sudden movement into the openings made for them by troops of their own cavalry had steadied the battle-line and checked the wild charge of the enemy, the barbarians at first gave their horses less rein, then were at a standstill and all but confounded by the strange tactics.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Finally they not only gave way before the infantry but did not withstand the cavalry either, who were emboldened by the protection of infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And now the units of legionaries<note>Doubtless detachments, since in ix. 1 no mention was made of an entire legion.</note> also were approaching. Then indeed the Masaesulians failed to sustain not only the first attack but even the sight of the standards and arms. Such was the effect either of remembering former defeats or of their present alarm.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then Syphax, while riding up to the enemy's troops of cavalry in the hope that by putting his men to shame, by exposing himself, he might be able to stem their flight, was thrown from a horse which had been seriously wounded, was overpowered, captured and brought alive to Laelius, a welcome sight presently to Masinissa above all others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The slaughter in that battle was not in proportion to the scale of the victory, since only a cavalry battle had been fought.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Not more than five thousand men were slain; less than half of that number were captured in an attack upon the camp, to which very many men, losing heart with the loss of their king, had retreated.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><pb id="p.407"/>
				<p>Cirta<note>Cf. XXIX. xxxii. 14 and note.</note> was the capital of the kingdom of Syphax,<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> and to that city came a vast number of men from the rout. Masinissa said that, while for himself nothing was at that moment more attractive than to visit as victor his ancestral kingdom, recovered after so long an interval, nevertheless in success as well as in misfortune no time is allowed for loitering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If Laelius should permit him to go on in advance to Cirta with the cavalry and with Syphax in chains, he would surprise everybody in the excitement due to alarm. Laelius, he said, could follow with the infantry in short marches.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With Laelius' assent he went to Cirta in advance and ordered that the leading Cirtensians be called out of the city to a conference. But with men who were unaware of the king's misadventure he accomplished nothing by revealing what had taken place, nor by threats nor by persuasion, until the king was placed before their eyes in chains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then before a sight so grievous wailing began, and in alarm some deserted the walls, others with the sudden agreement of men who curry favour with the victor threw open the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And Masinissa, first sending detachments to all the gates and to favourable points on the walls, that no one might have a way of escape open to him, rode at full speed to take possession of the palace.</p> 
				<p>As he was entering the forecourt<note>Crossing the open court Masinissa and his men approach the door. Cf. the <hi rend="italics">vestibulum curiae</hi> below, xxi. 4 and (at Carthage) xxiv. 10.</note> Sophoniba,<note>Probably married to Syphax in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And <pb id="p.409"/>when in the midst of the column of armed men she<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> caught sight of Masinissa, conspicuous both by his arms and the rest of his dress, thinking it was the king, as was the fact, she clasped his knees and said: <quote>All power over us has indeed been given you by the gods and by your courage and good fortune.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But if a captive is permitted in the house of the master of her life and death to lift the
						<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> voice of a suppliant, if she may touch his knees, his victorious right hand, I pray and entreat you by the royal state in which we too have lived a short time ago, by the name of the Numidian race, which you have shared with Syphax, by the gods of this palace here &mdash;and may they receive you under better auspices than those under which they sent Syphax away!
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> &mdash;I beg you to grant this favour to a suppliant, that, whatever your inclination, you yourself decide in regard to your captive and do not suffer me to be subjected to the haughty and cruel decision of any Roman.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> If I had been nothing else than the wife of Syphax, still I should have preferred to trust the word of a Numidian and a man born in the same Africa as myself rather than that of a foreigner by birth and nationality.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> What a Carthaginian woman, what a daughter of Hasdrubal has to fear from a Roman you see. If by no other means you are able to do so, I beg and implore you to save me by death from the decision of Romans.</quote> Her beauty was conspicuous and her age at full bloom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Consequently while she was clasping now his knees and now his right hand, begging for his promise not to surrender her to any Roman, and her words were now more nearly those of a charmer than of a
					<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> suppliant, the heart of the victor was quickly moved not to pity only, but with the amorous <pb id="p.411"/>susceptibility of the Numidian race the victor was<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> captivated by love of the captive. He gave her his right hand as a pledge for the fulfilment of her request and withdrew into the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Then he began by himself to consider how he could guarantee that the promise would be kept. As he was unable to solve that problem he borrowed from love a plan that was reckless and unbecoming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> He promptly ordered preparations to be made for a wedding the very same day, in order not to leave any decision open either to Laelius or to Scipio himself in regard to her as a captive when she should be already married to Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> After the wedding Laelius arrived, and so far was he from concealing his disapproval of the act that at first he even attempted to tear her away from the marriage couch and send her to Scipio with Syphax and the rest of the captives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> He was then persuaded by the entreaties of Masinissa, who begged him to refer to Scipio the decision which of the two kings was to have Sophoniba share his lot. Whereupon, after sending Syphax and the captives away, he with Masinissa's aid subdued the remaining cities of Numidia which were held by the king's garrisons.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> while Hasdrubal, a general of the Carthaginians, not only came himself to him in his kingdom but also gave him his daughter in marriage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They said that he had at the same time had two generals,<note><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> xviii. 1 ff.</note> a Carthaginian and a Roman, in his power; that just as both sides had sought the favour of the immortal gods by offering sacrifices, so had his friendship been sought at the same time by both sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Moreover, so great, they said, had been his power that when Masinissa had been driven out of his kingdom, Syphax brought him so low that his life was protected only by the report of his death and by hiding-places where he lived in the forest like wild animals on what they caught.<note>Cf. XXIX. xxxii. 10 f.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Honoured by such utterances of the bystanders the king was brought before Scipio at headquarters. Even Scipio was moved by the comparison of the man's former estate with his present condition, but especially by the memory of their guest-friendship and the clasp of hands, and of the compact made for the state and of that made in his own name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The same considerations gave Syphax also spirit in addressing the victor. For when Scipio repeatedly asked him what he had meant by not only rejecting a Roman alliance but also taking the aggressive in war, he would admit that he had indeed done wrong and lost his reason, but not then for the first time when he had taken up arms against the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That had been the culmination, not the beginning, <pb id="p.415"/>of his madness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The time when he lost his reason,<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> when he put out of his head all private guest-friendships and public treaties, was when he admitted a noble Carthaginian lady to his house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> From those nuptial torches his palace had taken fire; that baneful fury by all her blandishments had unbalanced and unhinged his mind, and she had never rested until with her own hands she had herself put on him guilt-stained arms against a guest-friend and a personal friend.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Yet for himself, ruined and crushed, there was this consolation in his misfortunes, to see that the same baneful fury had passed into the house and home of the greatest enemy he had in the world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Masinissa was neither wiser, he said, nor more steadfast than Syphax; he was even more imprudent owing to his youth. Certainly there had been -more folly and lack of self-control in Masinissa's marriage to her than in his own.<note>This indirect speech is probably based upon a lost passage in Polybius, whose narrative fails us here; for the conclusion of his XIVth book has been lost (beginning after x. 14 above). Cf. Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 27.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By speaking thus, not only out of hatred as an enemy but also under the goad of jealousy, as he saw his beloved in the possession of his rival, he aroused no slight anxiety in the mind of Scipio.<note>Who had reason to fear that Sophoniba would persuade Masinissa to go over to the Carthaginian side.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The charges against her were substantiated both by the marriage hastily celebrated, almost on the battlefield, without either seeking the advice of Laelius or waiting for his arrival, and by such precipitate haste that on the very day on which he saw her as a captured enemy he took her to wife and performed <pb id="p.417"/>the nuptial rites before the household gods of his<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Again, all this seemed the more repulsive to Scipio because in Spain, in spite of his youth, he had himself never been smitten by the beauty of any captive.<note>Cf. XXVI. xlix. 11 ff. and chap. 1.</note> Such thoughts were in his mind when Laelius and Masinissa arrived.<note>Some time has elapsed during which Numidian cities were recovered; xii. 22.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Scipio welcomed them both alike with kindly expression and lauded them in distinguished terms before a crowded council, and then leading Masinissa to a place apart thus addressed him: <quote>Some good qualities you saw in me, I suppose, Masinissa, and so came to me first in Spain, to cement a friendship with me, and later in Africa entrusted yourself and all your hopes to my protection.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But of those virtues on account of which my friendship might seem to you desirable there is none on which I might have prided myself so much as on self-restraint and continence. This virtue I would have you also, Masinissa, add to your other remarkable excellences.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There is no danger &mdash;believe me, there is none &mdash;so great to our time of life from armed enemies as from pleasures all about us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whoever has checked and mastered them by his self-control has gained for himself a far greater distinction and a greater victory than is ours by the defeat of Syphax. All that you in my absence have done with energy and courage I was glad to mention and gladly remember.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Upon the rest of your acts I prefer to have you reflect inwardly yourself, rather than blush at my recital. Syphax has been defeated and captured under the auspices of the Roman people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In consequence he himself, his wife, his kingdom, territory, towns, the people who inhabit <pb id="p.419"/>them, in short whatever has belonged to Syphax, is<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> booty of the Roman people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And as for the king and his wife, even if she were not a Carthaginian citizen, even if we did not see in her father a high commander of the enemy, they would have to be sent to Rome, and the senate and the Roman people would properly have the right to judge and decide the case of her who is alleged to have estranged from us an allied king and driven him headlong into war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Conquer yourself; do not disfigure many good qualities by one defect and forfeit the favour earned by so many services through a fault out of all proportion to its cause.</quote></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On hearing these words not only did Masinissa blush, but tears also came. And after saying that he on his part would be under the orders of the general and imploring him to have such regard as the case permitted for the promise
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> he had rashly given, namely that he would not hand her over to any man's power, he withdrew from headquarters to his own tent a distracted man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, with no witnesses present, he spent considerable time, with frequent sighs and groans, so that they could easily be heard by those who stood about the tent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then at last, after one very loud groan, he called the faithful slave in whose keeping was the poison, against the uncertainties of fortune, as usual with kings, and bade him mix. it and carry it in a cup to Sophoniba.<note>Livy understands her to have been brought to Scipio's camp; so Diodorus Sic. XXVII. 7. Other authorities laid the scene at Cirta and made Masinissa hurry back from the camp; cf. Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 28; Zonaras IX. xiii. 2 ff. A pertinent passage in Polybius is lacking.</note> He also ordered him at the same time to tell her that Masinissa would gladly have fulfilled the most <pb id="p.421"/>important promise which as husband he was bound<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> to keep for a wife;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that since the freedom to do so was taken away by those who had the power, he was keeping the promise next to it in importance, namely, that she should not come into the Romans' power alive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Mindful of her father the general, and of her native city, and of the two kings to whom she had been married, she was to decide for herself.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the slave bearing this message together with the poison had reached Sophoniba she said, <quote>I receive the wedding gift, and it is not unwelcome if my husband has been able to bestow nothing better upon his wife. But tell him this, that it would have been easier for me to die if I had not married at my funeral.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No less high-spirited than her words was her acceptance of the cup, fearlessly drained without a sign of wavering.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>As soon as this was reported to Scipio he at once summoned Masinissa, for fear the high-spirited young man in his distress of mind might do something desperate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He offered now consolation, now gentle rebuke because he atoned for one reckless act by another and made the matter more deplorable than was necessary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the following day, in order to divert Masinissa's thoughts from the emotion of the moment, Scipio mounted the tribune and ordered that an assembly be called. There for the first time he addressed Masinissa as king, bestowing upon him the highest terms of praise, and presented him with a golden wreath, a golden <hi rend="italics">patera,</hi> a curule chair and ivory sceptre, an embroidered toga and a tunic adorned with palms.<note>All of these were worn or used by a general in his triumph except the <hi rend="italics">patera,</hi> or bowl. Cf. X. vii. 9. Similar gifts to kings in XXVII. iv. 8-10 (Vol. VII. p. 214, n. 2).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He added this tribute: that there was no higher distinction among the Romans than a triumph, and that those who triumphed had <pb id="p.423"/>no more magnificent array than that of which<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> Masinissa alone of all foreigners was accounted worthy by the Roman people. He then warmly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> praised Laelius also and presented him with a golden wreath. Other officers also and men were rewarded, each according to the service he had performed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> By these distinctions the king was appeased and roused to the hope, soon to be fulfilled, that with Syphax removed he would gain possession of all Numidia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio, having sent Gaius Laelius with Syphax and other captives to Rome, while with these went Masinissa's legates also, himself moved his camp back again to Tynes and completed the fortifications he had already begun.<note>For previous fortifications cf. ix. 11.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Carthaginians, on account of their attack upon the fleet with considerable success for the moment, had been filled with a joy not only short-lived but almost unfounded. But on hearing of the capture of Syphax, on whom they had rested their hopes almost more than on Hasdrubal and their own army, they were discouraged. No longer listening to any advocate of war, they sent their thirty elder statesmen to plead for peace. This was their privy council,<note>Cf. below, xxxvi. 9. They formed a separate body, the <foreign lang="greek">gerousi/a;</foreign>Polybius I. lxxxvii. 3; X. xviii. 1 (this at New Carthage).</note> and it had great influence even in guiding the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they reached the Roman camp and headquarters they fell to the ground after the custom of courtiers, having derived that ceremony, I suppose, from the region from which they sprang.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> as being of Phoenician (Tyrian) origin. Cf. XLII. xxiii. 10; Polybius XV. i. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Such humble obeisance was matched by their discourse, as they did not try to clear themselves of blame, but shifted the original blame to Hannibal and to those who <pb id="p.425"/>supported his power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They craved pardon for a<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> state now twice overthrown by the rashness of its citizens, to
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> be saved a second time by the favour of its foes. It was power, they said, that the Roman people sought from vanquished enemies, not their destruction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were ready to be obedient servants; let him give them whatever commands he pleased.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Scipio said he had come to Africa in the hope that he would carry home a victory, not a treaty of peace; that his hope had been also confirmed by a successful issue of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nevertheless, although he had victory almost within his grasp, he was not rejecting a peace, in order that all nations might know that the Roman people acted fairly both in beginning and ending wars.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He said that he announced the following terms of peace: that they restore captives and deserters and fugitive slaves; that they withdraw their armies from Italy and Gaul;<note>Cisalpine Gaul; cf. xviii. 1. Mago was to abandon the Ligurian coast as well; cf. xix. 2, 4,12; and for his death at sea off Sardinia cf. <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi>&sect; 5.</note> that they have nothing to do with Spain; that they give up ownership of all the islands lying between Italy and Africa;<note>Since the large islands in these waters were already held by the Romans, the Baleares, Pityusae and Malta are probably meant here, possibly Pantelleria and Lampedusa also.</note> that they deliver all their war-ships except twenty, and 500,000 pecks of wheat, 300,000 pecks of barley.<note>This would be for the use of the Roman army during an armistice lasting until the treaty of peace was ratified. Double pay for the army (below) would be for the same length of time.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> &mdash;As for money, there is no agreement as to the sum which he imposed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In one source I find that 5,000 talents<note>So Polybius XV. viii. 7; 1600 talents, Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 32. Cf. Dio Cass. frag. 57. 74 (no figures); Zonaras IX. xiii. 8 (do.). These were not the final terms, for which see xxxvii. 1 ff.; Polybius xviii. <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi></note> were imposed, in another 5,000 pounds of silver, in another double the pay of his soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash; <pb id="p.427"/><quote>Whether on these terms,</quote> said he, <quote>you are disposed<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> to make peace, on that point three days will be given you for deliberation.

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Dismissed with these words, the Carthaginians agreed that no peace terms should be rejected, since they were seeking to gain time for Hannibal to cross over to Africa.<note>They had previously voted to recall him; ix. 7 f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Accordingly they sent one embassy to Scipio to arrange an armistice and another to Rome to sue for peace,<note>In Polybius, Scipio's terms had been embodied in a treaty which was duly ratified by the Roman senate and people after Hannibal was out of Italy; XV. i. 3, 9, 11; iv. 8; viii. 9.

See De Sanctis III. ii. 544.</note> taking with them a few captives and deserters and fugitive slaves for appearance' sake, that they might more readily obtain peace.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many days before this, together with Syphax and the leading Numidian captives, Laelius reached Rome and set forth to the senate in order everything that had been done in Africa, in the midst of great rejoicing for the present and high hopes for the future.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon the senate after deliberation voted that the king should be sent to Alba<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Alba Fucens; pp. 262,538. A Roman colony since <date value="-304">304 B.C.</date>, it was on the Via Valeria, 47 miles beyond Tibur (Tivoli), 67 from Rome. Cf. Vol. VII. p. 41, note; Appian <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 39. Here Perseus of Macedon was later interned; XLV. xlii. 4.</note> to be interned; that Laelius should be detained until the Carthaginian embassy arrived.<note>This conflicts with xxi. 11.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A thanksgiving for four days was decreed. Publius Aelius, the praetor, having dismissed the senate, then summoned an assembly and with Gaius Laelius mounted the Rostra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon, hearing that the Carthaginian armies had been routed, a famous king conquered and captured, all Numidia overrun in a series of extraordinary victories, they were unable to keep their joy to themselves,
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> but expressed their unbounded delight by shouting and such other means as the multitude commonly employs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly the <pb id="p.429"/>praetor at once gave orders that the temple wardens<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> should open all the shrines throughout the city, and that people should have all day long the opportunity to make the rounds and pay their respects to the gods and return thanks to them.</p> 
				<p>On the next day he introduced Masinissa's envoys into the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They began by congratulating the senate on Publius Scipio's successful campaign in Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They then thanked the senators because he had not only saluted Masinissa as king but had made him king in restoring him to his father's kingdom, in which he would reign without fear and without contest since the removal of Syphax, if that should be the mind of the senators;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> also because, after warmly praising him before an assembly, he had conferred upon him the highest decorations, of which Masinissa had striven and would continue to strive to be not unworthy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He begged the senate, they said, by a decree to confirm the kingly title and the rest of Scipio's favours and gifts; and unless objection was made, another request of Masinissa's was this, that they return the Numidian captives who were interned at Rome. That would bring him great credit, he felt, among his countrymen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The response to these words of the envoys was that the senators reciprocated the king's congratulations on successes in Africa;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that Scipio in their opinion had been entirely correct in saluting him as king, and that they approved and commended all else that he had done which gave pleasure to Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In addition gifts were decreed, <pb id="p.431"/>to be carried to the king by the envoys: two purple<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> military cloaks, each with a golden brooch, and tunics having the broad stripe, two horses with their trappings, two sets of arms with cuirasses for a horseman, and tents and field furniture such as were customarily furnished to a consul. These things the praetor was ordered to send to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For the envoys gifts were decreed, not less than five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> for each of them, for their attendants one thousand each; and two garments apiece for the envoys, one each for their attendants, and for the Numidians who were ordered to be released from internment and restored to the king. In addition dwellings were ordered to be placed at the envoys' disposal, and places of honour,<note>Special seats in the Circus and at theatrical performances were reserved for them.</note> and hospitable entertainment<note>Cf. p.160, n. 1.</note> were provided.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same summer in which these measures were taken at Rome and these operations carried on in Africa, Publius Quinctilius Varus, a praetor, and Marcus Cornelius, the proconsul, fought a pitched battle with Mago the Carthaginian in the territory of the Insubrian Gauls.<note>The battle which follows is evidently taken from one of the Roman annalists and can be accepted only with reservations. To reject the whole passage as unhistorical, as has been done, is virtually to claim that Mago could remain on the Ligurian coast for three summers without ever penetrating to the plains of the Po. He may not have advanced so far as Mediolan(i)um (Milan), chief town of the Insubrians (V. xxxiv. 9; XXXIV. xlvi.).. <hi rend="italics">C.A.H.</hi> VIII. 102 f.; De Sanctis 540 f. and note; Neumann 536 f.; but also Ehrenberg in Pauly-Wissowa <hi rend="italics">s.v.</hi> Mago 503; Kahrstedt 555 f.; G. Hesselbarth, <hi rend="italics">Unter-</hi> <hi rend="italics">suchungen z. dritten Dekade d. Livius</hi> 572 f.</note> The praetor's legions were in the first line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Cornelius kept his legions in reserve while he himself rode up to the front. And from in front of the two wings praetor and proconsul kept urging the soldiers to advance their ranks against the enemy with all their strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they failed to drive the enemy back, Quinctilius then said to Cornelius: <quote>The battle is slowing down, <pb id="p.433"/>as you see, and their unexpected resistance is hardening<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> the enemy against fright, and the danger is that fear may turn into daring. We must rouse our cavalry to a sudden charge if we wish to confuse and dislodge them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, either do you in the front line keep up the fight, and I will lead the cavalry into the fray. Or I will command here at the front, and you shall send out the horse of four legions into the enemy.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As the proconsul was ready to accept whichever part of the task the praetor wished him to take, Quinctilius, the praetor, with his son, an active youth whose praenomen was Marcus, made his way to the cavalry and ordering them to mount suddenly sent them out against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The confusion wrought by the cavalry was heightened also by the shouting of the legions, and the enemy's line would not have kept its position if Mago at the first movement of the cavalry had not at once led the elephants, which were kept in readiness, into battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Terrified by their roar and odour and by the sight of them the horses made the assistance of the cavalry useless. And although, so long as they were in the thick of the fight, where they could make use of the lance and, at close quarters, of the sword, the Roman horsemen were the stronger, still when they were carried to a distance by frightened horses, the Numidians were the more successful in hurling javelins from a longer range.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of the infantry also the twelfth legion at the same time was largely cut to pieces and holding its ground more from a sense of honour than by its strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And it would not have held on long if the thirteenth legion, brought up from the reserves into the front line, had not taken over the indecisive battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Mago likewise <pb id="p.435"/>brought up Gauls from his reserves to face the fresh<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> legion. After these had been routed with no great effort, the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi> of the eleventh legion massed together and attacked the elephants, which by this time were bringing disorder even to the-infantry line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the legionaries had hurled javelins against them in their close order, scarcely one missile being without effect, they drove all the elephants back into their own battle-line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Four of them, hampered by wounds, fell to the ground. Then for the first time the enemy's line was driven back, since all the cavalry, on seeing the elephants in flight, dashed out to increase the panic and confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But so long as Mago stood before the standards, his men as they slowly retired kept their ranks and continued to fight. After they saw him falling with his thigh pierced, and then borne almost lifeless from the battlefield, at once they all took to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> About five thousand of the enemy were slain that day and twenty-two military standards were captured. Nor was it a bloodless victory for the Romans. Two thousand three hundred were lost from the army of the praetor, much the larger part of them from the twelfth legion; from it also two tribunes of the soldiers, Marcus Cosconius and Marcus Maevius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Of the thirteenth legion also, which had taken part in the last phase of the battle, Gaius Helvius, tribune of the soldiers, fell while rallying the men. And about twenty-two knights of the upper class were trampled by the elephants and perished together with a number of centurions. Also the engagement would have lasted even longer, had not victory been conceded because of the general's wound.</p> <pb id="p.437"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mago set out in the stillness of the following<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> night and, lengthening the day's marches as much as he could endure by reason of his wound, he reached the sea in the country of the Ligurian Ingauni.<note>Presumably he followed a road leading down to Vada Sabat(i)a, which belonged to the Ingauni, as did Savo (Savona). Cf. pp. 197, n. 3 f.; 225, n. 2. The wounded Mago may have been carried on an elephant. Cf. Hannibal in the Arno valley, XXII. ii. 10 f. Nothing is said of any Roman pursuit.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There envoys from Carthage came to him, having put in a few days before into the Gallic Gulf,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Gulf of Genoa.</note> bringing him orders to cross over to Africa as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His brother Hannibal, they said, would do the same; for to him also envoys had gone bearing the same command; that the Carthaginian state was in no position to hold Gaul and Italy by armed forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mago was not only swayed by the command from the senate and the danger of his city, but also feared that if he delayed the victorious enemy might be upon him, and the Ligurians themselves, seeing that the Carthaginians were abandoning Italy, might go over to the side of those in whose power they would presently be.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hoping at the same time that motion would be less painful to his wound on shipboard than on the road and everything more convenient for treatment, he embarked his troops and sailed, but had hardly passed Sardinia when he died of his wound.<note>No further authority for this statement can be cited. Other sources vary so much that their statements are of no value: that Mago was still in Liguria after Zama (Appian<hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 49; cf. 59); that after reaching Africa. he was sent back to Italy (Zonaras IX. xiii. 10); that <hi rend="italics">ten</hi> years later he perished either in a shipwreck or by the hands of his slaves (Nepos <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> viii. 1 f.).</note> In addition a considerable number of the Carthaginian ships, being scattered in the open sea, were captured by the Roman fleet which was off Sardinia.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The consul Gaius Servilius, who had accomplished nothing that deserves mention in his province of Etruria and in Gaul &mdash;for he had advanced into that <pb id="p.439"/>country as well-rescued from slavery after fifteen<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> years his father Gaius Servilius and Gaius Lutatius,<note>Son of the victor in 242, he had been consul in <date value="-220">220 B.C.</date>; Zonaras VIII. xx. 10.</note> who had been captured near the village of Tannetum<note>They were seized, as Livy himself has it, near Mutina (Modena), but their Gallic captors were unsuccessfully pursued northwestward as far as Tannetum (half-way between Parma and Reggio Emilia).

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Upon that he returned to Rome escorted by his father on one side and Catulus on the other, gaining distinction for an act that was personal rather than official.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A bill was brought before the people that it should not be a ground for charges against Gaius Servilius that while his father, who had occupied a curule chair,<note>He had held the praetorship; Polybius <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> &sect; 9.</note> was still alive-a fact of which he was unaware-he had been tribune of the plebs and plebeian aedile, contrary to provisions of the laws.<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The same consul engaged in battle with Hannibal in the territory of Croton. The story of that battle is not clear. Valerius Antias<note>Cf. XXVIII. xlvi. 14 and note; XXIX. xxxv. 2; above, iii. 6; below, xxix, 7; xliii. 12 n.</note> says five thousand of the enemy were slain-a victory on such a scale as to have been either shamelessly fabricated or else carelessly passed over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> What is certain is that nothing further was accomplished by Hannibal in Italy. For to him also came emissaries from Carthage to recall him to Africa just at the time, it <pb id="p.441"/>chanced, that others came to Mago.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Already foreboding this very thing he had previously put his ships in readiness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, after distributing the mass of useless troops, nominally as garrisons, among the few Bruttian towns that were being held rather

					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> his army to Africa. Many men of Italic race
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> refusing to follow him to Africa had retired to the shrine of Juno Lacinia,<note>Cf. p. 441, n. 3.</note> never desecrated until that

					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> had<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> not led his soldiers blood-stained from the victory of Cannae to Rome.<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> man who in his
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> consulship had not seen a Carthaginian enemy in Italy &mdash;whereas
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he himself, after a hundred thousand armed
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> men<note>Cf. Mago's summary in 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xi. 8 f.</note> had been slain at Trasumennus, at Cannae, had grown old round Casilinum and Cumae and Nola. Such were his accusations and laments as he was dragged away from his long occupation of Italy.</p> 
				<p>XXI. At Rome the news of Mago's departure and that of Hannibal were received about the same time. Rejoicing over this two-fold ground for congratulation was tempered by two circumstances: that men thought the generals had lacked either the spirit or the strength to detain them, although this had been ordered by the senate; and that they were concerned for the outcome, now that the whole burden of the war came down upon one army and one commander. About the same time envoys arrived from Saguntum bringing Carthaginians alleged to have crossed over into Spain to hire auxiliaries, having been seized together with the money.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They set down two hundred and fifty pounds of gold and eight hundred pounds of silver in the forecourt<note>For <hi rend="italics">vestibulum curiae</hi> cf. I. xlviii. 1; II. xlviii. 10; xlix. 3; at Carthage, below, xxiv. 10.</note> of the Senate House. After accepting the captives, remanding them to prison and returning the gold and silver, the senate thanked the envoys; and in addition presents were made to them and ships furnished for their return to Spain.</p> 
				<p>The older members thereupon observed that men are slower to recognize blessings than evils; that <pb id="p.445"/>upon Hannibal's passage into Italy they remembered<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> what alarm and panic there had been. Since that time what disasters, what sorrows had befallen them! The enemy's camp had been visible from the walls of the city; what prayers had been said by individuals and by the entire people! How often in their deliberations had men been heard to say, as they lifted their hands to heaven, Would the day ever come when they should see Italy cleared of the enemy and prospering in a blessed peace!
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At last, they said, but not before the sixteenth year, the gods had granted that prayer; and yet there was no one to propose a vote of thanks to the gods; so true was it that men did not gratefully receive a blessing upon its coming, much less duly remember it when past. Upon that shouts came from every part of the Senate House that Publius Aelius, the praetor, should bring up the question. And it was voted that for five days thanks should be offered at all the <hi rend="italics">pulvinaria,</hi><note>On festal couches in temples cf. Vol. VI. p. 208, n. 1; VII. p. 217, n. 3; Book V. xiii. 6 (the first at Rome).</note> also that a hundred and twenty full-grown victims should be sacrificed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After Laelius and the envoys of Masinissa had been dismissed, word came that the Carthaginian envoys, on their way to the senate to sue for peace, had been seen at Puteoli and would proceed thence by land. Whereupon it was decided that Gaius Laelius should be recalled,<note>This, taken from a different source, conflicts with xvii. 2.</note> in order that the discussion of peace might be in his presence. Quintus Fulvius Gillo, Scipio's lieutenant, conducted the Carthaginians to Rome. Being forbidden to enter the city, they were entertained in the Villa Publica and a hearing in the senate was granted them in the Temple of Bellona.<note>Temple and Villa Publica were in the Campus Martius, near the Flaminian Circus; X. xix. 17; XXVI. xxi. 1; XXVIII. ix. 5; xxxviii. 2; below, xl. 1; and for the Villa, IV. xxii. 7; XXXIII. xxiv. 5; XXXIV. xliv. 5.</note></p> <pb id="p.447"/>
				<p>XXII. They made substantially the same plea<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> as they had done before Scipio, shifting all blame for the war from public responsibility to Hannibal: that he had crossed not merely the Alps but even the Ebro without orders from the senate, and on his own responsibility had waged war not only on the Romans but before that upon the Saguntines also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate and the Carthaginian people, they claimed, had a treaty with the Romans which in any fair judgment was to that day unbroken; consequently they had no other instructions than to beg permission to abide by the last peace-treaty, made with Gaius Lutatius.<note>As in XXI. xix. 2 f. Livy connects the treaty of <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date>, ratified in the consulship of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, logically with the naval victory won by his brother Gaius Lutatius Catulus at the very end of his year of office (242). Polybius does the same, I. lxii. 7. Below, xliv. 1 is more exact. The brothers shared in the organization of this first province; Zonaras VIII. xvii. 7.</note> When the praetor, following traditional practice, had given the senators permission to ask any question of the envoys if any one was so disposed, and older members, who had been present when action was taken on the treaties, were asking various questions, the envoys kept saying that on account of their age they did not remember &mdash;nearly all of them being young men. Upon that there were shouts from every part of the house that Punic trickery had led them to choose men who did not themselves remember it, to ask that the old treaty should be revived.</p> 
				<p>XXIII. Then after the envoys had been ushered out of the house,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the temple serving as a curia for this occasion.</note> opinions began to be called for.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Marcus Livius<note>Consul in 219 and <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>, and lately censor (<date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>). Fabius Maximus, <hi rend="italics">princeps senatus,</hi> was probably ill, or had already died; xxvi. 7.</note> moved that Gaius Servilius, the consul, being the nearer, should be summoned, in order that discussion of peace might be in his presence. Since there could be no more important <pb id="p.449"/>subject for deliberation than that, it did not seem to<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> him, he said, that debate on the question in the absence of one or both of the consuls was quite in keeping with the dignity of the Roman people. Quintus Metellus, who had been consul three years before and also dictator, said that, whereas Publius Scipio by slaying their armies and ravaging their lands had reduced the enemy to such straits that as suppliants they were suing for peace, and whereas no man in the world could more correctly judge of the spirit in which they were seeking that peace than he who was conducting a war at the gates of Carthage, peace must be accepted or rejected according to the advice of none other than Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had twice been consul,<note>Cf. p. 246, n. 1.</note> contended that spies, not envoys, had come to them, and that they should be ordered to depart from Italy, and guards sent with them all the way to their ships, and that a written order should be sent to Scipio not to relax effort in the war. Laelius and Fulvius added that Scipio also had based his hope of peace only upon the supposition that Hannibal and Mago were not to be recalled from Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But while waiting for those generals and their armies, they said, the Carthaginians would use every pretence, and then, forgetful of treaties however recent and of all the gods, would carry on the war. Consequently a still larger number voted for Laevinus' motion. The envoys were sent away without securing peace and almost without an answer.<note>This conflicts with Polybius' positive statement that the treaty was duly ratified at Rome, and that the three envoys named in xxv. 2 had so notified the Carthaginians; XV. i. 3, 9. Livy's view is repeated in xxx. 28; xxxi. 9; cf. xvi. 15 and note.</note></p> <pb id="p.451"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About that time Gnaeus Servilius, the<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> consul, who had no doubt that to him belonged the glory of giving peace to Italy, as if in pursuit of a Hannibal whom he had driven out himself, crossed over to Sicily, intending to cross from there to Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When this was noised abroad at Rome, at first the senators had voted that the praetor<note>The city praetor Aelius Paetus (i. 9), presiding in the senate. But he lacked authority to give orders to a consul. Hence the resort to a dictator, whose <hi rend="italics">maius imperium</hi> must be respected by the consul.</note> should write to the consul that the senate thought it proper for him to return to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, as the praetor said that Servilius would disregard his letter, Publius Sulpicius<note>Consul in 211 and <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date></note> was made dictator for that very purpose; and by virtue of his higher authority he recalled the consul to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The rest of the year he spent with his master of the horse, Marcus Servilius,<note>Brother of the consul Gaius Servilius Geminus and himself consul in the following year; xxvi. 1; xxvii. 1.</note> in making the rounds of such cities in Italy as had been estranged by the war and in hearing their cases one after another.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>During the armistice a hundred transports sent from Sardinia by the praetor Publius Lentulus<note>Cf. i. 9; ii. 4; xxxvi. 2 f.</note> with supplies and convoyed by twenty war-ships crossed to Africa over a sea safe from the enemy and safe from storms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Gnaeus Octavius, crossing over from Sicily with two hundred transports and thirty war-ships, was not so fortunate. When he had almost come in sight of Africa after a favourable passage, the wind at first failed him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> then shifting into a southwester, it damaged and scattered the ships far and wide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He himself with the war-ships battled against head seas by great efforts on the part of the oarsmen and reached the Promontory of Apollo.<note>See p. 315, n. 2.</note> Most of the transports were carried to the island of <pb id="p.453"/>Aegimurus<note>Zembra (Djamur); cf. p. 315, n. 5.</note> &mdash;which
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> on the seaward side closes the<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> bay upon which lies Carthage, about thirty miles from the city &mdash;the rest of them to Aquae Calidae,<note>Across the bay from Carthage and to the south-east (near Carpis), now Hammam Kourbes. The hot springs are mentioned by Strabo XVII. iii. 16, and the Tabula Peutingeriana. They are still frequented by the people of Tunis.</note> opposite the city itself. Everything could be seen from Carthage; and so from all parts of the city people ran to the market-place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The magistrates summoned the senate; the people before the entrance of the Senate House protested against letting go so much booty out of their sight and reach.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While some objected, pleading the sanctity of peace negotiations, others that of the armistice &mdash;for its term had not yet expired &mdash;the meeting of the senate was all but merged with that of the people. It was agreed that Hasdrubal should sail over to Aegimurus with his fleet of fifty ships, and then gather up the Roman ships scattered along the shore and in the harbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Deserted by the flight of their crews the transports were towed by the stern to Carthage, first from Aegimurus and then from Aquae.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not yet had the envoys returned from Rome, nor was it known what had been the decision of the Roman senate in regard to war or peace;<note>Cf. xvi. 15 and note; also Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 34; Dio Cass. frag. 57. 74 f.; Zonaras IX. xiii. 8. All these place ratification of the treaty after Hannibal had left Italy. Cf. Gsell III. 248.</note> not yet had the term of the armistice expired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For that reason Scipio thought it an even more shameful outrage that both the hope of peace and the sanctity of an armistice had been treated with disrespect by men who had sued for peace and an armistice. At once he sent Lucius Baebius, Lucius Sergius and Lucius Fabius as envoys to Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.455"/>These narrowly escaped injury at the hands of a<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> mob and foresaw that their return would be no safer. Accordingly they begged the magistrates whose help had prevented violence to send ships to escort them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Two triremes were furnished, and having reached the river Bagradas,<note>Now the Medjerda, principal river of Tunisia, 300 miles long but not navigable. See p. 344, n. 1 for the great changes in its lower course as the bay has silted up. The ancient mouth was half-way between Carthage and Utica.</note> from which the Roman camp was visible, they returned to Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Carthaginian fleet was lying at anchor near Utica. Three quadriremes from that fleet, just as the Roman quinquereme was rounding the promontory,<note>At the north-east end of the long ridge upon which lay the camp, later called Castra Cornelia. Cf. p. 347, n. 1. Perhaps Livy is wrong in thinking the ship was beached on the less favourable west side; Gsell III. 250, n. 1. The Punic fleet was no farther away than Rusucmon (Porto Farina; x. 9); Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 34.</note> suddenly attacked her from the seaward side, perhaps because a secret order to do so had been sent from Carthage, possibly because Hasdrubal, who was in command of the fleet, made bold to act without complicity on the part of the government.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But they were unable to ram her as she eluded them by her speed, and the marines could not spring across from the lower vessels to the higher one. Also she was brilliantly defended so long as their missiles held out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When these failed them there was nothing else which could protect the ship but nearness to the land and the great numbers that poured out to the shore from the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For propelled at full speed by the oars, they ran her on the shore with all possible momentum. Consequently the ship only was lost, and the men themselves<note>Primarily the envoys, but also some of the crew; Polybius XV. ii. 15; of. Appian <hi rend="italics">l.c. fin.</hi></note> escaped.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Thus the armistice beyond doubt had been broken by one crime after another when Laelius and Fulvius arrived from Rome with the Carthaginian <pb id="p.457"/>envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Scipio informed these men that, although<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> not only the sanctity of an armistice had been violated by the Carthaginians, but also the law of nations in regard to his envoys, nevertheless he would not in their case do anything unworthy of the established usages of the Roman people or of his own character. Whereupon he dismissed the envoys<note>In Polybius iv. 9 Scipio was absent, and Baebius, being left in command, carried out orders from the general.</note> and made preparations for war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>As Hannibal was already nearing land, one of the sailors was ordered to go aloft, in order to make out what region they were approaching.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When he reported that the bow was headed toward a ruined tomb, Hannibal with a prayer to avert such an omen ordered the pilot to sail on, brought his fleet in at Leptis,<note>On the east coast of Tunisia; Leptis Minor (or Lepti Minus) to distinguish it from Leptis Magna in Tripolitania. Cf. p. 308, n. 1. It was now probably autumn.</note> and there disembarked his troops.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the events of that year in Africa. What follows runs over into the year in which Marcus Servilius Geminus, who at that time was master of the horse, and Tiberius Claudius Nero<note>A first cousin of Gaius, consul in <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date></note> became consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But at the end of the previous year envoys from Greece representing allied cities had complained that their territories had been ravaged by the king's forces, and that envoys who had gone into Macedonia to claim damages were not admitted to King Philip's presence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had at the same time brought word that four thousand soldiers under the command of Sopater were alleged to have crossed over to Africa to defend the Carthaginians, and that a considerable sum of money was said to have been sent with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Consequently the senate voted to send envoys to the king to report that in the opinion <pb id="p.459"/>of the senators these acts had violated the treaty.<note type="margin">B.C. 203</note> The men sent were Gaius Terentius Varro,<note>Consul in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date>; XXII. xxxv. 2; escaped from Cannae, XXII. xlix. 14; lxi. 13 ff. Mamilius Atellus had been praetor, Aurelius Cotta an aedile. Cf. xlii. 2, 5, 10.</note> Gaius Mamilius, Marcus Aurelius; three quinqueremes were furnished them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The year was marked by a great conflagration in which the Clivus Publicius<note>See Vol. VII. p. 36, n. 3.</note> was burned to the ground, and by floods, but also by the low price of grain, because not only was all Italy open by reason of peace, but also a great quantity of grain had been sent from Spain;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and Marcus Valerius Falto and Marcus Fabius Buteo, the curule aediles, distributed this to the populace by precincts at four <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> one sesterce. Cf. XXXI. 1. 1 (grain even cheaper).</note> a peck.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In the same year Quintus Fabius Maximus died at a very advanced age, if indeed it is true that he had been an augur for sixty-two years, as some authorities say.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He certainly was a man who deserved such a surname, even if it had been first applied to him. He surpassed the number of magistracies held by his father<note>Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, three times consul, last in <date value="-265">265 B.C.</date></note> and equalled those of his grandfather.<note>Quintus Fabius Maximus Rull(ian)us, five times, last in <date value="-295">295 B.C.</date> Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Fab.</hi> 1. makes him great-grandfather of Delayer.</note> A larger number of victories and greater battles made the fame of his grandfather Rullus; but all of them can be balanced by a single enemy, Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nevertheless Fabius has been accounted a man of caution rather than of action. And while one may question whether he was the <quote>Delayer</quote> by nature, or because that was especially suited to the war then in progress, still nothing is more certain than that one man by delaying restored our state,<note>A famous line of the <hi rend="italics">Annales</hi> (Vahlen3 v. 370; Warmington, <hi rend="italics">Remains of Old Latin</hi> I. p. 132), so often cited or imitated that it became proverbial; e.g. Cicero <hi rend="italics">Cato Mai.</hi> 10; Virgil <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> VI. 846.</note> as Ennius says.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The Roman Games were repeated for a single day, the entire Plebeian Games three times over by the aediles Marcus Sextius Sabinus and Gnaeus Tremelius Flaccus. Both of them were made praetors, and with them Gaius Livius Salinator<note>Son of the consul of <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> Cf. XXIX. xxxviii. 8.</note> and Gaius Aurelius Cotta.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As for the elections of that year, conflicting authorities make it uncertain whether Gaius Servilius as consul conducted them or Publius Sulpicius as dictator, appointed by Servilius because business detained him in Etruria, where in accordance with a decree of the senate he was conducting trials for conspiracy among the leading citizens.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the following year<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> Marcus Servilius and Tiberius Claudius summoned the senate to the Capitol and raised the question of the provinces. They wished that lots should be cast for Italy and Africa, both of them being eager to have Africa.<note>Scipio's command had been given him for the duration; i. 10. That, however, would not prevent the assignment of a colleague; cf. &sect; 5 <hi rend="italics">sub fin.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But chiefly owing to the efforts of Quintus Metellus<note>Cf. xxiii. 3.</note> Africa was not refused nor yet given them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls were instructed to arrange with the tribunes of the plebs that, with their approval, they should bring before the people the question whom they wished for the conduct of the war in Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All the tribes voted for Publius Scipio.<note>This of course settled any controversy as to the term of his command, until contention was renewed a year later. Cf. p. 518, &sect; 12, where the province of one consul for <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date> is defined as command of the fleet, while the other was to have Italy.</note> In spite of that the consuls cast lots for Africa as a <pb id="p.463"/>province, for so the senate had decreed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Africa fell<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> to Tiberius Claudius, with the provision that he should take a fleet of fifty ships, all of them quinqueremes, over to Africa, and that he should be commanding general with an authority equal to that of Scipio.<note>But not to command an army in addition to his fleet; probably not to sail over to Africa except in an emergency. In fact Claudius never reached African waters; xxxix. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Marcus Servilius received Etruria by lot. In the same province Gaius Servilius' command was also continued, in case the senate decided that the consul should remain near the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of the praetors Marcus Sextius received Gaul by lot, with the understanding that Publius Quinctilius Varus should turn over to him the two legions with the province;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Gaius Livius received the land of the Bruttii with the two legions which Publius Sempronius had commanded in the previous year as proconsul; Gnaeus Tremelius was allotted Sicily, to take over the province from Publius Villius Tappulus, praetor of the previous year, and the two legions. Villius as propraetor was to defend the coast of Sicily with twenty war-ships and a thousand soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Pomponius with the remaining twenty ships was to transport fifteen hundred soldiers back to Rome. The city praetorship fell to Gaius Aurelius Cotta. For the rest of the praetors<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Lucretius at Genua, in Sardinia Publius Lentulus, in Spain Lucius Lentulus and Manlius Acidinus (these two as proconsuls); cf. i. 9 f.; ii. 7; XXIX. xiii. 7.</note> their commands were continued just as they then held their several provinces and armies.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The games were celebrated in the Circus for four days, and victims were sacrificed to the gods to whom they had been vowed.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile hope and anxiety alike were increasing from day to day, and men could not quite make up their minds whether it was a fit subject for rejoicing that Hannibal, retiring from Italy after sixteen years, had left the Roman people free to take possession<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> to recover that title to Italian soil which Hannibal had in a way acquired by occupying it for more years than were needed to acquire a title by <hi rend="italics">usucapio.</hi> Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The place doubtless had been changed, they thought, not the danger. Foretelling that mighty conflict Quintus Fabius, recently deceased, had often predicted, not without reason, that in his own land Hannibal would be a more terrible enemy than in a foreign country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And Scipio would have to deal neither with Syphax, king of a land of untrained barbarians, for whom Statorius,<note>Cf. XXIV. xlviii. 9, 11 f.</note> who was little more than a sutler, commonly commanded his armies, nor with the father-in-law of Syphax, Hasdrubal, a general very swift in flight, nor with irregular armies suddenly raised from a half-armed mob of rustics.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Rather <pb id="p.467"/>would he have to do with Hannibal, who had been<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> born, one might almost say, at the headquarters of his father, the bravest of generals, had been reared and brought up in the midst of arms;<note>Cf. XXI. xliii. 15.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> who even in boyhood was a soldier, in earliest manhood a general; who, ageing<note>Slightly exaggerated, as in xxx. 10, but for the sake of a climax. He was only 45 (<hi rend="italics">senior</hi> strictly, rather than <hi rend="italics">senex</hi>); xxxvii. 9; over 45 says Polybius, XV. xix. 3.</note> as a victor, had filled the Spanish and Gallic lands and Italy from the Alps to the Straits with the evidence of his mighty deeds. He was in command of an army whose campaigns equalled his own in number; was toughened by enduring such hardships as one could scarcely believe human beings had endured; had been spattered with Roman blood a thousand times and carried the spoils, not of soldiers only but also of generals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Many men who would encounter Scipio in battle had with their own hands slain Roman praetors, generals-in-command, consuls; had been decorated with crowns for bravery in scaling city-walls and camp defences;<note>For the <hi rend="italics">corona muralis</hi> cf. Vol. VI. p. 60, n. 2; XXVI. xlviii. 5. The <hi rend="italics">corona vallaris</hi> (or <hi rend="italics">castrensis</hi>) represented earthworks of a camp. Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All the magistrates of the Roman people did not at that time have so many fasces as Hannibal was able to have borne before him, having captured them from fallen generals.<note>Coelius pretended to know the exact number of fasces captured by Hannibal, viz. 72; Nonius X. p. 818 L.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>By brooding over such terrifying thoughts men were adding to their own anxieties and fears, for another reason too: whereas year after year it had been their habit to carry on a war before their eyes in one part and then in another of Italy, with hope deferred and looking to no immediate end of the conflict, all men's interest
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> was now intensified by Scipio and Hannibal, as it were, pitted against each <pb id="p.469"/>other for the final combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Even in the case of those<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> who had great confidence in Scipio and high hope of victory, the more their minds were bent upon immediate victory the more intense were their anxieties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not unlike were the feelings of the Carthaginians, who at one moment, when they thought of Hannibal and the greatness of his achievements, regretted having sued for peace, at another moment, on reflecting that they had been twice defeated in battle,<note>One defeat was obviously that on the Campi Magni; viii. 3-9; the other may be that of Hanno's cavalry in

The surprise attack on two camps (v. 7 &mdash;vi. 9) made no use of an <hi rend="italics">acies.</hi></note> that Syphax had been captured, that they had been driven out of Spain, driven out of Italy, and all this accomplished by the courage and strategy of Scipio alone, they dreaded him as a predestined commander, born to work their destruction.</p> 
				<p>XXIX. By this time Hannibal had reached Hadrumetum.<note>A Tyrian colony and the most important town in the region, now Sousse, 20 miles north-west of Leptis Minor (Lemta), where Hannibal had landed. But he immediately established his winter camp at Hadrumetum. Polybius cannot have failed to give the time and place of Hannibal's landing in lost chapters from the beginning of Book XV.; for he is in Africa already at iii. 5, if not at i. 10 f. It was now autumn, <date value="-203">203 B.C.</date> He would not have risked a winter passage. Cf. De Sanctis 545 ff., 586 f.; Scullard 326 f.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From there, after he had spent a few days that his soldiers might recuperate from sea-sickness, he was called away by alarming news brought by men who reported that all the country round Carthage was occupied by armed forces, and he hastened<note>If we could follow Livy here we should place the final battle within an incredibly short time after Hannibal's landing. That this was the case no one can believe after comparing the passage Livy must have had before him, or tried to recall, as he wrote our sentence. For Polybius' <quote>after a few days</quote> (v. 3) makes no connection with the landing, but merely with the receipt of an urgent message from Carthage. That may have come to him many months &mdash;even a year &mdash;after disembarkation. Hannibal would be the last to shorten the long preparation indispensable to the making of an army out of his heterogeneous forces.</note> to Zama by forced marches. Zama<note>Probably Zama Regia, ca. 90 m.p. due west of Hadrumetum (Sousse). An old Numidian city, it is now Seba Biar, on the edge of a plain just west of the long dorsal ridge extending from Cap Bon south-west some distance beyond Kasserine and Tebessa. Lying north of Maktar this city was a residence of Jugurtha (Sallust 56-61); strongly fortified by King Juba I.; <hi rend="italics">Bell.

XLVIII. xxiii. 4), it long lay desolate (Strabo XVII. iii. 9, 12). Absence of ruins from the Empire shows that the city was not rebuilt. Polybius plainly indicates that the battle was considerably farther inland than Hannibal's first position at Zama (v. 14; vi. 2). Cf. p. 472, n. 1. For modern works and the controverted questions see Appendix.</note> <pb id="p.471"/>is distant five day's marches
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> from Carthage. Scouts<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> who had been sent in advance from that position were captured and brought before Scipio by their
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Roman guards. Thereupon he turned them over to a tribune of the soldiers, and bidding them go and see everything without fear, he ordered them to be led about the camp wherever they wished to go; and after questioning them as to whether they had examined everything quite at their leisure, he sent them back to Hannibal, furnishing men to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> escort them.<note>The story of the scouts is from Polybius XV. v. 4-7, as also the following figures for Masinissa's forces (&sect; 12).</note> Hannibal did not indeed hear with joy any of the reports of his scouts, for they reported that Masinissa had also arrived that very day, as it happened, with six thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry. But he was particularly dismayed by the enemy's confidence, which surely seemed to be not
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> without foundation. Consequently, although he was himself at once the cause of the war and by his coming the breaker of a truce already arranged and of a prospective treaty as well, nevertheless, thinking that fairer terms could be obtained if he should sue for peace while his army was intact, rather than after defeat, he sent a messenger to Scipio, requesting that he grant the privilege of a conference
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> with him. Whether he did so on his own responsibility or that of the state, I have no means of deciding either this way
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> or that. Valerius Antias<note>Cf. xix. 11.</note> relates <pb id="p.473"/>that he was defeated by Scipio in their first engagement,<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> in which twelve thousand soldiers were slain in battle and seventeen hundred captured; and that as an envoy with ten other envoys Hannibal came to Scipio in his camp.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>To resume, once Scipio had assented to the conference, both generals by agreement advanced the position of their camps, so that their meeting might be at a short distance. Scipio established himself not far from the city of Naraggara,<note>Polybius' name for the place is Margaron, occurring nowhere else. It is accordingly altered by his editors to correspond with the better class of Livy MSS. &mdash;a bold correction, it must be admitted. The site of Naraggara is thought to be occupied by Sidi Youssef, on the boundary between Tunisia and Algeria. It was ca. 52 Roman miles west of Zama Regia. Cf. Appendix, esp. p. 547.</note> in a situation otherwise favourable, but particularly because water was to be had within the range
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of a javelin. Hannibal occupied a hill four miles away, safe and convenient otherwise, except that one had to go far for water. Half-way between them a spot was chosen which was visible from all sides, that there might be no ambuscades.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Keeping their armed men at the same distance the generals, each attended by one interpreter, met, being not only the greatest of their own age, but equal to any of the kings or commanders of all nations in all history before their time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For a moment they remained silent, looking at each other and almost dumbfounded by mutual admiration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Hannibal was the first to speak: "If it was foreordained by fate that I, who was the first to make war upon the Roman people and who have so often had the victory almost in my grasp, should come forward to sue for peace, I rejoice that destiny has given me you, and no one else, to whom I should bring my suit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For you also, among your many distinctions, it will prove not the least of your honours <pb id="p.475"/>that Hannibal, to whom the gods have given the<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> victory over so many Roman generals, has submitted to you, and that you have made an end of this war, which was memorable at first for your disasters and then for ours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This also may prove to be Fortune's mocking sport, that having taken up arms when your father was consul, and having fought with him my first battle with a Roman general, I come to his son unarmed to sue for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It would indeed have been best if the gods had given our fathers the disposition to be contented, you with rule over Italy and us in turn with ruling Africa.<note>With this thought begins the speech in Polybius vi. 4. What precedes in Livy is his exordium, designed to produce a favourable impression according to rhetorical rule.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For even for you Sicily and Sardinia have been no adequate compensation for the loss of so many fleets, so many armies, so many remarkable generals. But the past is sooner disapproved than changed for the better.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In grasping at what was not ours we fell to fighting for our own; and for us Carthaginians it came to be a war not in Italy alone, nor for you entirely in Africa. On the contrary you have seen the enemy's standards and arms almost at your gates and walls, just as we can hear from Carthage the noise of a Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Consequently we discuss terms of peace while Fortune is favouring you &mdash;a situation most ominous for us, while you could pray for nothing better. We who are treating have the most to gain by peace, and furthermore, whatever terms we are to make our states will ratify. We need only a temper not averse to measures calmly considered.</p> 
				<p>"As for myself, age has at last taught me, returning as an old man to my native city, from <pb id="p.477"/>which I set out as a boy, success and failure have at<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> last so schooled me that I prefer to follow reason rather than chance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In your case I am apprehensive alike of your youth and of your unbroken success, both of them too refractory for the demands of calmly considered measures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It is not easy for a man whom fortune has never deceived to weigh uncertain chances.<note>Similar is Polybius vii. 1.</note> What I was at Trasumennus, at Cannae, that you are today.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Although you had received a command when hardly of an age to serve,<note>Cf. XXVI. xix. 9.</note> and undertook everything with the greatest boldness, nowhere has fortune deluded you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By avenging the death of your father and uncle you won from the disaster to your family signal honour for courage and extraordinary devotion. You recovered the lost Spanish provinces by driving out of them four Punic armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Elected consul, while the rest lacked courage to defend Italy, you crossed over to Africa; and by destroying two armies here, by taking and at the same time burning two camps in the same hour, by capturing Syphax, a most powerful king, by seizing so many cities of his kingdom, so many in our domain, you dragged me away when now for sixteen years I had clung to the possession of Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It is possible for the heart to prefer victory to a peace. I know those aspirations that soar but are ineffectual; on me too such fortune as yours once shone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> But if in prosperity the gods blessed us with sound reason also, we should be reflecting not merely upon what has happened but also upon what can happen. Though you forget everything else, I am a sufficient warning against all that may chance. For it was I that, pitching my camp not long ago<note>In <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>; three miles from the city; XXVI. x. 3.</note> between the Anio and your city, was advancing my standards <pb id="p.479"/>and now almost scaling the walls of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But here<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> bereft of my two brothers, the bravest of men, the most eminent of generals, you see me before the walls of my native city, already almost invested, and I am praying that she may be spared the terrors which I brought to yours.</p> 
				<p>"The greatest good fortune is always the least to be trusted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> In your favourable circumstances, in our uncertain situation, peace, if you grant it, will bring you honour and glory;<note>Cf. the closing words of Hannibal in Polybius vii. 9.</note> for us who sue it is necessary rather than honourable. Better and safer is an assured peace than a victory hoped for. The one is in your own power, the other in the hands of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Do not commit the success of so many years to the test of a single hour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Bear in mind not only your own resources but also the might of Fortune and the impartial god of war. On both sides will be the sword, on both sides human bodies. Nowhere less than in war do results match men's hopes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> You will not add so much glory, if victorious in battle, to what you can now have by granting peace, as you will lose in case of any reverse.<note>The thought of Polybius vii. 6.</note> The fortune of a single hour can lay low honours already won, and with them those in prospect. In making peace, Publius Cornelius, you have everything in your own power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> In the other case you will have to bear the lot which the gods may give.
					<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Among the foremost examples of success and courage would have been Marcus Atilius<note>Regulus had been used as an <hi rend="italics">exemplum deterrens</hi> in a speech by Fabius in XXVIII. xlii. 1; cf. <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xliii. 17 in Scipio's reply.</note> formerly in this same land, if as victor he had granted the peace which our fathers <pb id="p.481"/>requested. But by setting no limit to his success<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> and not reining in an unruly fortune, the higher he had climbed the more terribly did he fall.</p> 
				<p>"It belongs, to be sure, to the giver of peace, not to the suitor, to name the terms. But possibly we may not be unworthy to impose a penalty upon ourselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> We do not reject the condition that all the possessions for which we went to war shall be yours &mdash;Sicily,
					<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> Sardinia,<note>Sicily had been lost by Carthage in the peace of <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date>, Sardinia three years later.

					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Let us Carthaginians, confined by the coasts of Africa, behold you ruling under your authority even foreign countries by land and sea,<note>Nothing is said of Scipio's other demands in xvi. 10 ff., including a heavy indemnity.</note> since that has been the will of the gods. I would not deny that, on account of a lack of sincerity in
					<milestone unit="section" n="27??"/> our recent suit for peace, and because we did not wait for it, Punic honour for you Romans is now tainted with suspicion. For the faithful observance of a peace much depends, Scipio, on the persons by whom the suit is presented.
					<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> Your senators also have refused the peace,<note>See p. 449 and n. 2.</note> I hear, partly for the reason that the embassy was lacking in dignity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> I, Hannibal, am suing for peace, I who should not be so doing if I did not think it an advantageous peace; and I shall uphold it because of the same advantage on account of which I have sued for it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> And just as I, having begun the war, therefore made sure &mdash;until the gods themselves became envious &mdash;that no one should regret it, so will I strive to prevent any man from regretting the peace obtained through me.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To these pleas the Roman general replied <pb id="p.483"/>somewhat to this effect: "I was not unaware,<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> Hannibal, that the Carthaginians, anticipating your arrival, showed no respect either for present obligations to the armistice or for the peace in prospect;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and you surely make no concealment of that fact when you omit from the earlier terms of peace everything except what has long been in our possession.<note>Cf. xvi. 10.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But just as you are concerned to have your citizens appreciate how great is the burden of which they are relieved by you, so I must exert myself that they do not have as the reward of perfidy any relaxation of the terms of peace to which they at that time agreed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Unworthy to have the same terms open to you as before, you Carthaginians are asking to have your dishonesty profit you. Our fathers were not aggressors in making war for Sicily; no more were we for Spain. In the former case the peril of our allies, the Mamertines, as in the latter instance the destruction of Saguntum, armed us with the weapons of duty and justice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That your people were the aggressors you yourself admit, and the gods as well are our witnesses, who gave for that war and are giving and will give for this one an outcome in accordance with justice and the right.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><quote>So far as I am concerned, I am mindful of human weakness, and I reflect upon the might of Fortune and know that everything that we do is exposed to a thousand chances.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, just as I should admit that I were acting with arrogance and violence if, before I had crossed over to Africa, I were to reject you when you were voluntarily withdrawing from Italy and, while your army was already on shipboard, you were coming in person to sue for peace, so now, <pb id="p.485"/>when I have dragged you to Africa, resisting
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> shifting ground as we almost came to blows, I am under no obligation to respect you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Therefore, if to the terms upon which peace was formerly about to be made,<note>Cf. xxx. 28.</note> as it seemed, you are adding some kind of compensation for the ships loaded with supplies that were taken by force during the armistice, and for violence done to my envoys, I have reason to bring it before the council. But if that addition also seems too severe, prepare for war, since you have been unable to endure a peace.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Accordingly without making peace they returned from the conference to their armies, reporting that words had been of no avail; that arms must decide the issue and they must accept whatever lot the gods should give them. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Arrived at their camps, they both ordered their soldiers to have arms and their spirits in readiness for the final conflict to make them victors, if success attended them, not for one day but forever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whether Rome or Carthage should give laws to the nations they would know the next day before nightfall. For not Africa, they said, or Italy but the whole world would be the reward of victory<note>So Polybius ix. 5 and again x. 2, in a later speech of Scipio to his troops. The suspense of a great historical moment deeply impressed both historians. Cf. &sect;&sect; 4 f.</note> &mdash;a reward matched by the danger for those whom the fortune of battle should not favour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In fact the Romans had no way of escape open in a foreign and an unknown land,<note>This statement added by Livy reflects what Scipio says to his men in Polybius x. 4.

				<p>For this decision on the following day<note>Even the month is much debated.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Consequently a wavering between hope and fear confused their spirits; and as they surveyed now their own battle-line, now that of the enemy, while weighing their strength more by the eye than by calculation, the bright side and at the same time the dark was before their minds. What did not occur to the men themselves of their own accord the generals would suggest in admonition and exhortation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Carthaginian kept recalling to their minds the achievements of sixteen years in the land of Italy, so many Roman generals, so many armies wiped out completely, and brave deeds of individuals, whenever he came to a soldier distinguished in the record of some battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Scipio would recall the Spanish provinces and recent battles in Africa and the enemy's admission, in that on account of fear they could but sue for peace, and yet had been unable to abide by the peace on account of their ingrained perfidy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Furthermore, as his conference with Hannibal had been in private and could be freely altered, he gave it the direction he desired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He divined that as the Carthaginians went out into battle-line, the gods had given them the same omens as when their fathers fought at the Aegates Islands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The end of the war and hardship was at hand, he said, the spoils of Carthage within reach, and the return home to their native city, to parents, children, <pb id="p.489"/>wives and household gods. So erect did he stand<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> as he spoke these words, and with so happy a look on his face that one would have believed him already the victor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Thereupon he drew up in the first line the <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> behind them the <hi rend="italics">principes,</hi> in the rear the <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> closing the formation. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However, he did not form cohorts<note>This is confused. Polybius does not mention cohorts, but is merely using both of his terms for maniple in the same sentence, ix. 7; cf. pp. 62 f., n. 2. Novel was the formation with <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> directly behind <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> instead of behind the normal intervals between front line maniples.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hannibal in order to create a panic drew up his elephants in front, and there were eighty of them, a number he had never before had in any battle.

Not mentioned by Polybius, but by Frontinus; doubted or rejected by modern historians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, leaving a moderate interval,<note>More than a furlong in Polybius xi. 2.</note> he drew up a reserve line of Italic soldiers, most of these Bruttians, more of whom
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> had followed him under compulsion and of necessity than of their own consent as he retired from Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As for the cavalry, he also placed them on the wings; the Carthaginians held the right wing, the Numidians the left.</p> 
				<p>In an army made up of so many men who had no language, no custom, no law, no arms, no clothing and general appearance in common,<note>Cf. XXVIII. xii. 3 f. and note.</note> nor the same reason for serving, exhortation took various forms.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ligurians were offered as an incentive to victory the rich plains of Italy, once they were brought down from their rugged mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Mauretanians and Numidians were frightened by Hannibal with the prospect of Masinissa's tyrannical rule. To different nations different hopes and fears were displayed. The Carthaginians' attention was called to the walls of their city, to household gods, tombs of ancestors, children and parents and terror-stricken wives, to destruction and servitude on the one hand, on the other to rule over the world, to the absence of any ground between the extremes of fear and hope.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Just as the general was thus speaking among the Carthaginians, and the national leaders among their countrymen, mainly through interpreters, since foreigners were intermingled, trumpets
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> and horns <pb id="p.493"/>sounded on the Roman side, and such shouts were<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> raised that the elephants turned against their own men, especially against the left wing, the Mauretanians and Numidians.<note>The account of the battle should be compared throughout with that of Polybius XV. xii.-xvi. Cf. Frontinus II. iii. 16; Zonaras IX. xiv. 7 ff. Appian's narrative includes much fiction, with single combats in the epic manner; <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 45. Cf. Scullard 237 ff.; Veith 645 ff.; Kahrstedt 564 ff.; De Sanctis 552 ff., 604 ff.; <hi rend="italics">C.A.H.</hi> VIII. 105 ff.</note> Masinissa easily increased their panic and stripped that end of the line of its cavalry support.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> A few of the beasts, however, being fearlessly driven into the enemy, caused great losses among the ranks of the light-armed, though suffering many wounds themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For springing back to the maniples the light-armed made way for the elephants, to avoid being trampled down, and then would hurl their lances from both sides against the beasts doubly exposed to missiles. Nor was there any slackening in the javelins of the men in the front lines until these elephants also, driven out of the Roman line and into their own men by missiles showered upon them from all sides, put the right wing, even the Carthaginian cavalry, to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Laelius, on seeing the enemy in confusion, increased their panic.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On both sides the Punic battle-line had been stripped of its cavalry when the infantry clashed, now no longer matched either in their hopes or in their strength. In addition there were what seem small things to mention, but at the same time were highly important in the battle: a harmony in the shouting of the Romans, which consequently was greater in volume and more terrifying;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> on the other side discordant voices, as was natural from many nations with a confusion of tongues; for the Romans a battle of little movement, as they pressed on into the <pb id="p.495"/>enemy by their own weight and that of their arms; on<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> the other side repeated charges at high speed but with less power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Consequently by the first attack the Romans at once dislodged the enemy's line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then beating them back with their shoulders and the bosses of their shields,<note>Livy here departs from Polybius' statements (xiii. 1), which probably had already suffered a text corruption still remaining in our MSS. and some editions. If the enemy were at once dislodged there would seem to be no need of pushing, instead of continuing to use their weapons. Cf. Meyer <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> 408 f.; De Sanctis 607.</note> being now in close contact with men forced from their position, they made considerable progress, as no one offered any resistance, while as soon as they saw that the enemy's line had given way, even the rear line pressed upon the first, a circumstance which of itself gave them great force in repulsing the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Among the enemy so far was their second line, the Africans and Carthaginians, from supporting the auxiliaries as they gave way, that on the contrary they even drew back for fear the enemy, by slaying the men of the first line if these stoutly resisted, should reach themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly the auxiliaries suddenly retreated and facing their own men, some found refuge in the second line, others, having been refused aid shortly before, and also admission now to the ranks, slashed at those who would not make place for them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And by this time there were almost two battles in one, since the Carthaginians were forced to engage with the enemy and at the same time with their own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless even so they did not admit the panic-stricken, angry men into the line, but closing up their ranks, they forced them out upon the wings and into the empty plain on this side and that outside of the battle, in order not to contaminate their own line, still intact and fresh, with soldiers alarmed by the flight and their wounds.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><pb id="p.497"/>
				<p>But such heaps of bodies and arms had covered the<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> place where the auxiliaries had stood shortly before that to make their way across was almost more difficult than it had been through the dense mass of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly the men of the front line, the <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> pursuing the enemy wherever they could over heaps of bodies and arms and through pools of blood, broke up both their own maniples and their ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The maniples of the <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> also began to waver, as they saw the unsteady line in front of them. When Scipio saw this he ordered the recall to be sounded at once for the <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> and after withdrawing the wounded to the rear line, he led the <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> and <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> to the wings, in order that the centre, composed of <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> might be safer and steadier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus began an entirely new battle.<note>After a pause, while Hannibal also was reforming his lines, in what manner we are not told. For Scipio's reorganization of his front &mdash;a notable feat &mdash;see Polybius xiv. 3 ff.</note> For they had reached the real enemy,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the Carthaginians in the second line, together with the Libyan and Macedonian mercenaries; xxxiii. 5. In Polybius xiv. 6 the new battle begins when Hannibal's third line (Italians so far held in reserve) is at last engaged. Of these troops as veterans Polybius had a much higher opinion than Livy and Frontinus <hi rend="italics">l.c.;</hi> cf. xxxiii. 6 and xxxv. 9 <hi rend="italics">fin.</hi></note> their equals in the character of their weapons and their experience in war and the celebrity of their deeds and the greatness whether of their hopes or of
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> their danger. But the Roman was superior both in numbers and in spirit, because he had already routed the cavalry, had already routed the elephants, and was already fighting against the second line, having repulsed the first.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the right moment Laelius and Masinissa, who had pursued the routed cavalry for a considerable distance, returned and dashed into the rear of the enemy's line. That charge of the cavalry finally worsted the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Many were overpowered <pb id="p.499"/>and slain in the battle-line, many were scattered in<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> flight over the open plain all around, and as the cavalry were in complete possession, they perished everywhere. Over twenty thousand of the Carthaginians and their allies were slain on that day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the same number were captured, together with one hundred and thirty-two military standards and eleven elephants. Of the victors about fifteen hundred fell.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hannibal, escaping with a few horsemen in the midst of the confusion, fled to Hadrumetum,<note>His base (Sousse), xxix. 1. His ships were there. The distance from Zama is greatly exaggerated by Nepos <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 6. 3 (300 miles, he says), while Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 47 makes it even 375. Both claim that he covered the distance in two days and two nights. In reality Zama Regia is about 90 miles due west of Hadrumetum. Naraggara would be ca. 170 Roman miles from that seaport, if the shorter and less rugged southerly route was taken. Every probability, however, favours the supposition that the battle was fought much nearer to Sicca Veneria, and not more than 120 miles from Hadrumetum; cf. p. 547 ff.</note> having tried every expedient both before the battle and during the engagement before he withdrew from the fray.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And even by Scipio's admission and that of all the military experts he had achieved this distinction, that he had drawn up his line that day with extraordinary skill:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the elephants in the very front, that their haphazard charge and irresistible strength might prevent the Romans from following their standards and keeping their ranks, upon which tactics they based most of their hopes;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> then the auxiliaries in front of the line of Carthaginians, that men who were brought together from the offscouring of all nations and held not by loyalty but by their pay might have no way of escape open to them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that at the same time, as they met the first fiery attack of the enemy, they might exhaust them, and if they could do no more, might blunt the enemy's swords <pb id="p.501"/>by their own wounds;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> next in order the soldiers in<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> whom lay all his hopes, the Carthaginians and Africans, that being equal to the Romans in everything else, they might have the advantage in fighting with strength undiminished against the weary and the wounded; then, removed to the last line and separated by an open space as well, the Italic troops, of whom it was uncertain whether they were allies or enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having produced this as his last masterpiece Hannibal after his flight to Hadrumetum was called away, returning to Carthage in the thirty-sixth year after he had left it as a boy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thereupon in the Senate House he admitted that he had been defeated not only in a battle but also in the war, and that there was no hope of safety except in successfully suing for peace.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio immediately after the battle stormed and plundered the enemy's camp and with immense booty returned to the sea and his ships, having received
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> word that Publius Lentulus,<note>Cf. ii. 4; xxiv. 5; xxvii. 9. The same passages apply to Octavius, &sect; 3, commanding a fleet.</note> in command of fifty war-ships and a hundred transports with supplies of every kind, had arrived near Utica.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thinking therefore that he must bring terror to bear from every side against disheartened Carthage, after sending Laelius to Rome with a report of the victory, he ordered Gnaeus Octavius to bring the legions to Carthage by land. He himself went to his old fleet, now enlarged by the new fleet of Lentulus, and then sailed from Utica towards the harbour of Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He was not far away when a Carthaginian ship bedecked with fillets and olive branches met him. There were ten envoys, leading <pb id="p.503"/>citizens, sent at the instance of Hannibal to sue for<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they approached the stern of the flagship, holding out the symbols of suppliants, begging and beseeching the help and pity of Scipio, no other answer was given them than that they should come to Tynes;<note>Cf. ix. 10; xvi. 1.</note> that thither he would move his camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Scipio sailed near in order to view the situation of Carthage, not so much for the purpose of an immediate reconnaissance as to humiliate the enemy, and returned to Utica, recalling Octavius also to the same place.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>While proceeding from there to Tynes they received news that Vermina,<note>Cf. XXIX. xxxiii. 1 f., 8. Still ruling a large part of his father's kingdom; Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 33.</note> the son of Syphax, commanding more cavalry than infantry was coming to the help of the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Part of the infantry and all the cavalry attacked the column of the Numidians on the first day<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> a.d. XIV Kal. Ian., or 17th December. Uncommon is so exact a date for a minor event. It suggests one of the annalists as a source; hence rejected by those who place the greater battle in spring or summer. Other examples, however, are: XLI. xxii. 1; XLIV. xx. 1; XLV. ii. 3. See Macrobius <hi rend="italics">Sat.</hi> I. x. 1 ff. Cf. Appendix, p. 552 f.</note> of the Saturnalia, and routed it after a slight engagement. As even the way of escape was cut off, with the cavalry surrounding them on all sides, fifteen thousand men were slain, twelve hundred captured alive, fifteen hundred Numidian horses taken and seventy-two military standards. The prince himself in the midst of the confusion escaped with a few men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then camp was pitched near Tynes on the same site as before, and thirty envoys from Carthage came to Scipio.</p> <pb id="p.505"/>
				<p>Their pleading was, to be sure, much more piteous<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> than before, in proportion as misfortune was more compelling; but they were heard with much less pity owing to the memory, still fresh, of their treachery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the council, although righteous indignation spurred them all to the destruction of Carthage, nevertheless they reflected how serious a matter and how protracted also was the siege of a city so well fortified and so strong.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Scipio himself was also troubled as he looked forward to a successor<note>But the consul (Claudius Nero) who aspired to succeed Scipio never reached Africa. Cf. xxvii. 1 f.; xxxviii ff.; xxxix. 1-3; xliv. 3.</note> who would come into what had been won by the hardship and danger of another &mdash;the glory of finishing the war. Consequently they all were inclined to peace.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day the envoys were recalled and with repeated upbraiding for their treachery<note>Condensing Polybius xvii. 3. The following peace terms (with minor differences) are taken from his ch. xviii. Cf. above xvi. 10 ff. for terms previously proposed. See Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 54; Dio Cass. frag. 57. 82; De Sanctis 616 ff.; Scullard 254 ff.</note> were advised that, being taught at last by so many disasters, they should believe that the gods and an oath mean something.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whereupon the peace terms were stated to them: they were to live as free men under their own laws; to hold the cities and territories<note>In Africa, that is, as Livy's source (xviii. 1) takes care to make clear.</note> which they had held before the war, with the same boundaries; and the Roman was on that day to make an end of devastation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were to deliver all deserters and runaway slaves and captives to the Romans, and to surrender their war-ships except ten triremes, and the trained elephants<note>The most were sent to Rome, the rest given to Masinissa; Zonaras IX. xiv. 11. Some of them were used by the Romans (first instance) in Macedonia, <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date>; XXXI. xxxvi. 4.</note> in their possession, and not to train <pb id="p.507"/>others;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> to wage war neither in Africa nor outside of<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> Africa without consent of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were to make restitution to Masinissa and frame a treaty with him; to furnish grain and pay to the auxiliaries<note>In Polybius xviii. 6 grain for the entire army for three months and pay until a reply from Rome came.</note> until the envoys should return from Rome; to pay ten thousand silver talents,<note>Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> XXXIII. 51 (16,000 lbs. of silver a year for 50 years).</note> divided into equal payments for fifty years; to give a hundred hostages selected by Scipio, not younger than fourteen nor older than thirty years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He would grant an armistice, he said, provided the transports captured during the previous armistice and whatever was on board the ships should be returned; otherwise there would be no armistice nor any hope of a peace.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Such terms the envoys were bidden to carry home, and as they announced them in the assembly Gisgo<note>Unknown, Polybius is here the main source, but he mentions no name; xix. 2 ff.</note> came forward to oppose the peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While the multitude was listening, equally incapable of keeping a peace and of carrying on a war, Hannibal, indignant that such things should be said and heard at so critical a moment, seized Gisgo and with his own hand dragged him down from the platform.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When this novelty for a free state called forth protests from the people, the man of arms, confounded by freedom in the city, said <quote>At nine years of age I left you, and after thirty-six years I have returned. With the soldier's arts, in which from boyhood first my own lot, and then a public exigency gave me training, I may pass as well acquainted. In the rights, laws, usages of the city and the marketplace it is you who should train me.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having apologized for his ignorance, he discoursed at length <pb id="p.509"/>upon the peace, showing how far from unjust it was<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> and how inevitable.<note>Livy condenses Hannibal's plea for a treaty of peace; Polyb. xix. 5-7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The most troublesome point of all was that of the ships captured during the armistice nothing was to be seen except the ships themselves, and investigation was not easy since the accused were opponents of the peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was decided that the ships should be returned and the men at all costs traced; that appraisal of whatever else was lacking be committed to Scipio, and that thus the Carthaginians should pay the amount in cash.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash;There are some historians<note>Unknown. For his escape, <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date>, to Tyre, and so to Antiochus at Ephesus cf. XXXIII. xlviii f.</note> who relate that Hannibal leaving the battle made his way to the sea and then on a ship prepared for him at once sailed to King Antiochus; and that when Scipio demanded above all things that Hannibal be surrendered to him, the answer was that Hannibal was not in Africa.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After his envoys had returned to Scipio the quaestors were ordered from entries in the public accounts to make a declaration of what public property had been on the ships, and owners were to do the same for private property.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In place of that sum total twenty-five thousand pounds of silver were exacted in immediate payment.<note>It must have been quite impossible to complete a list of individual claims.</note> And an armistice for three months was granted the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In addition they were not to send envoys during the period of the armistice to any other place than to Rome, and in case any envoys should come to Carthage they were not to let them go until they informed the Roman commander who they were and <pb id="p.511"/>for what purpose they had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With the Carthaginian<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> envoys Lucius Veturius Philo and Marcus Marcius Ralla and Lucius Scipio, brother of the general-in-command, were sent to Rome.<note>Veturius had been consul in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>(XXVIII. x.); Marcius, city praetor in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xiii. 2). Lucius Scipio reached the consulship with Laelius in <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. i.).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> About that time supplies from Sicily and Sardinia lowered the price of grain so much that the merchant would leave his grain to the mariners to cover the freight.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>At Rome upon the first news of the Carthaginians' renewed hostilities there had been alarm, and Tiberius Claudius had been ordered to take his fleet promptly to Sicily and then to cross to Africa, and the other consul, Marcus Servilius, to remain near the city until it should be known what was the state of affairs in Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Everything in the assembling and launching of his fleet had been carried on without spirit by Tiberius Claudius, the consul, because the senate had voted that authority over the terms on which peace should be granted belonged to Scipio rather than to the consul.<note>Cf. xxiii. 3 f.; xxvii. 1-4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Reports of prodigies also at the very time when there were rumours of fresh hostilities had inspired alarm. At Cumae the sun was partially eclipsed and it rained stones, and in the district of Velitrae<note>Now Velletri, just beyond the Alban Hills and 8 miles from Aricia.</note> the ground settled in huge cavities and trees were swallowed in the depths.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At Aricia the forum and shops round it, at Frusino<note>Now Frosinone; on the Via Latina, while Aricia lay on the Appia, 16 m.p. from Rome.</note> the city wall at a number of places and a gate were struck by lightning; and on the Palatine there was a shower of stones. That portent was atoned for by nine days of rites according to ancestral custom,<note>Cf. Vol. VII. p. 90, note.</note> <pb id="p.513"/>the rest by full-grown victims.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Meanwhile the<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> unusual height of rivers was also interpreted as a portent. For the Tiber so far overflowed that, as the Circus was flooded, preparations for the Games of Apollo were made outside the Porta Collina, near the Temple of Venus of Eryx.<note>On the Via Salaria outside (but near) the Porta Collina. Not built until <date value="-181">181 B.C.</date> Livy uses it here merely as a landmark; XL. xxxiv. 4; Strabo VI. ii. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the very day of the games, however, after a sudden clearing the procession, already on its way to Porta Collina, was recalled and directed into the Circus when word was received that the water had retired from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Restoration of its normal scene to the customary spectacle also added to the delight of the people and to the throngs who attended the games.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Claudius, the consul, had at last left the city when a very violent storm, which he encountered between the harbour of Cosa<note>Mentioned in XXII. xi. 6; cf. XXVII. x. 8. Portus Loretanus is unknown.</note> and the Portus Loretanus, caused him great alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then after reaching Populonium<note>Now Piombino; cf. XXVIII. xlv. 15.</note> and lying at anchor there until the rest of the storm should abate, he crossed over to the Island of Elba and from Elba to Corsica, from Corsica to Sardinia. There as he was passing the Raving Mountains, a much more savage storm, descending upon him in a much more dangerous situation, scattered the fleet. Many of the ships were leaking and had lost their rigging, some were wrecked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this storm-tossed, damaged condition the fleet reached Carales.<note>Cagliari; several times in XXIII. x. f.; of. Vol. VII. p. 226, note.</note> There, while the beached ships were undergoing repairs, winter overtook him, and as the turn of the year came while no one sought to prolong his command, it was as a private citizen that Tiberius Claudius brought the fleet back to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcus Servilius, to avoid being recalled to <pb id="p.515"/>the city to hold the elections, named Gaius Servilius<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> Geminus<note>Consul in <date value="-203">203 B.C.</date>; xix. 6 ff.; XXIX. xxxviii. 3.</note> dictator and went to his province. The dictator named Publius Aelius Paetus master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Repeatedly a date for the elections was announced, but storms prevented them from taking place. Consequently, since the old magistrates had left office on the eve of the Ides of March and new men had not been elected in their places, the state had no curule magistrates.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Titus Manlius Torquatus,<note>The stem defender of every ancient custom; cf. especially XXII. lx ff., after Cannae, 19 years after his first consulship; XXIII. xxii. 7; above, ii. 8.</note> the pontiff, died that year and Gaius Sulpicius Galba was named in his place. The Roman Games were repeated three times throughout by Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Quintus Fulvius, the curule aediles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For having secretly abstracted money from the Treasury, clerks and messengers of the aediles were condemned on evidence of an informer, not without disgrace for Lucullus as aedile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Publius Aelius Tubero and Lucius Laetorius, owing to a defect in their election as plebeian aediles, abdicated their office after they had conducted the games and in connexion with them a banquet for Jupiter, and had placed on the Capitol three statues of which the cost was met by money paid in fines. The festival of Ceres was under the direction of the dictator and master of the horse by decree of the senate.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon the arrival at Rome of the envoys from Africa, the Roman and the Carthaginian at the same time, the senate sat in the Temple of Bellona.<note>Cf. xxi. 12 and note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Lucius Veturius Philo<note>Cf. xxxviii. 4.</note> to the great joy of the senators set forth how they had fought with Hannibal in a battle that was for the Carthaginians their last, <pb id="p.517"/>and that at length an end had been made of a war<note type="margin">B.C. 202</note> of grievous losses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then added that Vermina also, the son of Syphax, had been defeated &mdash;a small supplement to a victorious campaign. Upon that he was bidden to go out into the assembly and share the joyful news with the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then all the temples in the city were opened for the offering of thanks, and three days of thanksgiving were ordered. When the Carthaginian envoys and those of King Philip &mdash;for these also had arrived &mdash;requested that a hearing in the senate be granted them, by order of the senate the dictator replied that the new consuls would grant them a hearing in the senate.<note>An embassy had been sent to Philip the year before; xxvi. 4. Cf. xlii. 1 ff.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thereupon the elections were held. As consuls Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Aelius Paetus were elected, as praetors Marcus Iunius Pennus, to whom fell the city praetorship, Marcus Valerius Falto, to whom the land of the Bruttii, Marcus Fabius Buteo, to whom Sardinia, Publius Aelius Tubero, to whom Sicily was allotted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As for the consuls' provinces, the senators were not disposed to take up the matter until the envoys of King Philip and those of the Carthaginians had been heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They foresaw the end of one war, the beginning of another.</p> 
				<p>Gnaeus Lentulus, the consul, was fired with the<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> desire to have Africa as his province, aspiring to an easy victory if the war continued, or if it were already ending, to the glory of having so great a war end in his consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly he declared that he would allow nothing to be taken up before Africa had been assigned him by decree as his province. <pb id="p.519"/>He had the consent of his colleague, a moderate<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> man and wise who saw that a contest with Scipio for that glory not only was unfair but also would prove unequal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Quintus Minucius Thermus and Manius Acilius Glabrio, tribunes of the plebs, declared that Gnaeus Cornelius was attempting what had been vainly attempted in the preceding year by Tiberius Claudius, the consul;<note>Cf. xxvii. 2 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that by authority of the senators the question whom they wished to have the high command in Africa had been brought before the people; that all thirty-five tribes had awarded that command to Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After many disputes, while the matter was before the senate and the people as well, the decision was ultimately left to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The senators therefore under oath<note>An exceptional practice; XXVI. xxxiii. 14; XLII. xxi. 5.</note> &mdash; for such had been the agreement &mdash;decided that the consuls should determine their provinces by mutual agreement or by lot, which of them was to have Italy and which the fleet of fifty ships;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that he to whom the fleet fell should sail to Sicily, and if peace could not be arranged with the Carthaginians, he should cross over to Africa; that the consul should conduct operations on the sea and Scipio on the land, with the same authority to command as heretofore;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> that if the peace terms should be agreed upon, the tribunes of the plebs should bring before the people the question whether to order the consul or Publius Scipio to grant peace, and, if the victorious army was to be brought back from Africa, who was to bring it back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> If the people should order that peace be granted through Publius Scipio, and that the army should be brought back by him as well, the consul should not cross over from Sicily to Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The other <pb id="p.521"/>consul, to whom Italy should fall, was to receive two<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> legions from Marcus Sextius, the praetor.<note>Cf. xxvii. 7.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Scipio's command in his province of Africa was continued with the armies which he already had. Of the praetors Marcus Valerius Falto was assigned in the land of the Bruttians two legions which Gaius Livius had commanded in the preceding year;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Aelius was to receive two legions in Sicily from Gnaeus Tremelius; Marcus Fabius was assigned for Sardinia the one legion which Publius Lentulus had held as propraetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For Marcus Servilius, consul in the previous year, his command in Etruria was continued, likewise with his own two legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the Spanish provinces, they said that for some years already Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus had been there;<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> since <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>(late in the year); XXVIII. xxxviii. 1; XXIX. xiii. 7; above, ii. 7.</note> that the consuls should urge the tribunes, if it met with their approval, to bring before the people the question who by their decree should be commander in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Out of the two armies the general was to enrol Roman soldiers in a single legion and Latin allies in fifteen cohorts, in order that with these he might hold the province. As for the veterans, Lucius Cornelius and Lucius Manlius were to bring them back to Italy.<note>Lentulus returned to Rome in <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date>, Manlius in 199; XXXI. xx.1 and XXXII. vii. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul<note>Cf. xl. 12 ff.; here also the same absence of a name, since the allotment of provinces was still to be made; see xliii. 1.</note> was assigned a fleet of fifty ships, made up from two fleets, that of Gnaeus Octavius, which was in African waters, and <pb id="p.523"/>that of Publius Villius, which was defending the coast<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> of Sicily, the consul being free to select such ships as he pleased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Publius Scipio was to have the forty war-ships which he had before,<note>For Scipio's original fleet (30 ships) cf. XXVIII. xlv. 21; then 40, XXIX. xxvi. 3. Fifty more from Sardinia (above, xxxvi. 2 f.), now under the command of Octavius.</note> and if he desired that Gnaeus Octavius should command them, as he had done, Octavius was to have military authority as propraetor for that year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If he should name Laelius commander, Octavius was to leave the province for Rome and to bring back such ships as the consul did not need. Ten war-ships also were assigned to Marcus Fabius for Sardinia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And the consuls were ordered to enrol two city legions, so that in that year the state was carried on with fourteen legions<note>Including the two in Gaul; xl. 16; xxvii. 7.</note> and a hundred war-ships.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the senate deliberated concerning the embassies of Philip and the Carthaginians. It was decided that the Macedonians should be brought in first.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their speeches were in different veins, as some of them tried to excuse acts of which envoys who were sent from Rome to the king in regard to the ravaging of allied territory had complained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Others actually turned accuser, attacking allies of the Roman people, to be sure, but Marcus Aurelius with much more violence, alleging that, being one of three envoys<note>Cf. xxvi. 4.</note> sent to them, he had conducted a levy, had remained and made war upon them in violation of the treaty, and had repeatedly engaged in regular battles with their commanders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Still others demanded that the Macedonians and their general, Sopater, who as mercenaries had <pb id="p.525"/>served with Hannibal and at the time were captives<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> in chains, be restored to them.<note>As being mercenaries, not really belligerents.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In reply Marcus Furius, who had been sent for the very purpose from Macedonia by Aurelius, maintained that Aurelius had been left behind in order to prevent allies of the Roman people from being exhausted by raids and forced by acts of violence to go over to the king's side; that he had not gone beyond the boundaries<note>No doubt still disputed, so that <hi rend="italics">ex Macedonia</hi> just above is only an apparent conflict.</note> of the allies; that he had exerted himself that raiders should not come over into the allies' lands with impunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He said that Sopater was one of the king's high officials and of his kin; that he had been sent recently to Africa with four thousand Macedonians<note>Cf. xxxii. 5.</note> and money to bring aid to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Inasmuch as the Macedonians, when questioned in regard to these matters, gave ambiguous answers, they in turn received an answer of a very different sort:
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that the king was looking for war and if he kept on would soon find it; that he had twice violated the treaty, in that he wronged allies of the Roman people and harried them with war and arms, and in that he aided the enemy by reinforcements and money;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that not only had Scipio acted and was now acting in their opinion with perfect propriety in keeping in chains as enemies men who had been captured while bearing arms against the Roman people, but also that Marcus Aurelius was acting in conformity
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> with the interest of the state, and that the senate was grateful that he was defending allies of the Roman people by arms, since he was unable to do so by the obligations of a treaty.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>With so stern an answer as this the Macedonians <pb id="p.527"/>were dismissed and the Carthaginian ambassadors<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> summoned. When the senators observed the age and high station of each-for these were the very first of the citizens-thereupon all agreed that they were really treating for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Most conspicuous among them, however, was Hasdrubal surnamed Haedus<note>Cf. xliv. 5; Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 49 <hi rend="italics">fin.,</hi> 63, but the occasion is different.</note> among his people, always a supporter of peace and an opponent of the Barcine party.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Hence he had all the more weight then, as he shifted the blame for the war from the state to the greed of the few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> His speech was in different keys, now excusing what was charged, now making some admissions, lest pardon should be harder to obtain if they shamelessly denied known facts, and now even admonishing the conscript fathers to make a moderate and restrained use of their good fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He said that if the Carthaginians had listened to him and to Hanno<note>See p. 440, n. 1.</note> and had been minded to take advantage of the right moment, the Romans would have given the terms of peace which they were at that time seeking; that seldom were men given good fortune and good judgment at the same time;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> that the Roman people was invincible for the reason that in its good fortune it remembered to be wise and to take counsel. And certainly, he said, it would have been wonderful if its practice were different.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Men whose good fortune was new because of its strangeness went wild, unable to control their rejoicing; for the Roman people the joys of victory were familiar and now all but threadbare, and they had enlarged their empire almost more by sparing the vanquished than by conquest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The rest of the speakers employed more pathos as they stated from what wealth the Carthaginians' situation had fallen to what depths; that men who <pb id="p.529"/>recently held almost the whole world by their<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> arms had nothing left but the walls of Carthage. Shut up within these walls, they said, they saw nothing on land or sea subject to their rule.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Even the city itself and their homes they would hold only in case the Roman people did not choose to vent its animosity upon those possessions also, the last possible step.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> When it was clear that the senators were inclining to pity, one of their number,<note>A relative of Lentulus the consul according to Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 62.</note> outraged by the perfidy of the Carthaginians, is said to have called out to them, asking who were the gods in whose name they were to make the treaty, inasmuch as they had proved false to the gods in whose name the former treaty had been made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> <quote>The same</quote> said Hasdrubal, since they are so hostile to treaty-breakers."</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When all were now disposed to make peace the consul Gnaeus Lentulus, to whom the fleet had been assigned,<note>Cf. xl. 12 f.; xli. 6. Consuls rarely exercised their right of veto. They could not veto a plebiscite.</note> vetoed a decree of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon Manius Acilius and Quintus Minucius, tribunes of the plebs,<note>Supporting Scipio, as in xl. 9 ff.</note> brought before the people the question whether it was their will and command that the senate should decree that peace be made with the Carthaginians; and whom they should command to grant that peace, and whom to bring the army back from Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In regard to the peace all the tribes voted affirmatively: that Publius Scipio should grant the peace, that he also should bring back the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In accordance with this enactment the senate decreed that Publius Scipio on the advice of ten envoys should make peace with the Carthaginian <pb id="p.531"/>people upon such terms as he saw fit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> Carthaginians thereupon thanked the senators and begged permission to enter the city and to converse with fellow-citizens who as captives were in prison, saying that among them some were their own relatives and friends,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> men of rank, and others men for whom they had messages from their relatives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this was arranged and they made a further request that they might have the opportunity of ransoming such of them as they desired, they were bidden to furnish the names.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And when they furnished some two hundred names a decree of the senate was passed that the Roman envoys should carry to Publius Cornelius in Africa two hundred selected by the Carthaginians from the number of the captives, and should report to him that, if the peace should be agreed to, he was to deliver the captives to the Carthaginians without ransom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When orders were being given to the fetial priests<note>For the fetials and their ceremonial see I. xxiv. 4 ff.; xxxii. 5 ff.; Servius on <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> IX. 52; X. 14; Varro <hi rend="italics">L.L</hi> V. 86; Festus 424 f. L.; Polybius III. 25.</note> to go to Africa in order to make the treaty, at their own request a decree of the senate was passed in these terms: that they should each take one flint knife and one tuft of foliage with them, in order that when the Roman general<note>Conservative religious usage retained this older meaning of <hi rend="italics">praetor.</hi></note> ordered them to make the treaty they should demand of the general the sacred tufts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is customary to gather foliage of this kind from the Citadel and give it to the fetials.</p> 
				<p>Under these circumstances the Carthaginians were sent away from Rome, and having presented themselves to Scipio in Africa, they made peace upon the <pb id="p.533"/>terms above mentioned.<note>With all the traditional formalities, these (and nothing else) being in the hands of the fetials.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They surrendered<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> warships, elephants, deserters, runaway slaves, and four thousand captives, among whom was Quintus Terentius Culleo,<note>He had been captured in Africa. Cf. xlv. 5. In <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> he returned to Carthage on an embassy; XXXIII. xlvii. 7; again in <date value="-171">171 B.C.</date>; XLII. xxxv. 7.</note> a senator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The ships Scipio ordered to be put to sea and to be burned. Some historians<note>Chiefly Valerius, as we may infer from the large figures. Livy expressly condemns his exaggerations, e.g. at XXVI. xlix. 3. Cf. above, xix. 11 and XXXIII. x. 8.</note> relate that there were five hundred of them &mdash;every type of vessel propelled by oars;<note>The annalists wished to include not only <hi rend="italics">rostratae</hi> or <hi rend="italics">longae</hi> of our extant sources, but also smaller vessels such as pentekontors (cargo vessels with 50 oars) and lesser craft.</note> and that when the Carthaginians suddenly caught sight of the fire it was as doleful for them as if Carthage itself were in flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The deserters were more severely treated than the runaway slaves, Latin citizens being beheaded, Romans crucified.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Forty years before, in the consulship of Quintus Lutatius<note>Not to be confused with his brother Gaius, victor off the Aegates Islands shortly before. See p. 446 and n. 1.</note> and Aulus Manlius, peace had last been made with the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war which began twenty-three years later, in the consulship of Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius, was brought to an end in the seventeenth year, the consulship of Gnaeus Cornelius and Publius Aelius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Later Scipio often stated, so they say, that first Tiberius Claudius' thirst for fame,<note>Cf. xxvii. 4 f.; and for Cornelius Lentulus xl. 7 ff.</note> and then that of Gnaeus Cornelius had hindered him from ending that war with the destruction of Carthage.<note>Cf. xxxvi. 10. According to Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 65 Cato in his speech for the Rhodians declared that Scipio wished Carthage to remain as a stimulus to Roman discipline.

				<p>At Carthage when raising money for the first<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> payment seemed difficult to men whose resources were drained by the long war, and in the Senate House there was mourning and weeping, they say that Hannibal was seen laughing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Hasdrubal Haedus<note>Cf. xlii. 12.</note> upbraided him for laughing while the people wept, he being himself the cause of their tears, he said: <quote>If the mind within us could be seen, just as expression of face is seen by our eyes, it would readily be clear to you that this laughter which you upbraid is not that of a happy spirit but of one almost beside itself through misfortunes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless it is by no means so untimely as are those senseless, misplaced tears of yours.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The time for us to weep was when our arms were taken from us, our ships burned, foreign wars forbidden; for that wound was fatal to us. And you have no reason to believe that the Romans had regard for your domestic peace. No great state can long be in peace.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If it lacks an enemy abroad it finds one at home, just as powerful bodies seem protected against infection from without, but are of themselves weighed down by their very strength.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Of course we feel only so much of the public misfortunes as bears upon our private concerns, and in these nothing has so painful a sting as the loss of money.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hence when the spoils were being stripped from vanquished Carthage, although you saw her placed, now unarmed and naked, in the midst of so many armed tribes of Africa, no one moaned, <pb id="p.537"/>while now because tribute must be raised from private<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> property you are mourners, as it were, at a public funeral.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> How much I fear you will very soon be aware that today you have wept over a very slight misfortune!</quote> So spoke Hannibal to the Carthaginians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Scipio summoned an assembly and assigning to him his father's kingdom, presented Masinissa with the city of Cirta<note>See p. 334, n. 1.</note> in addition and the rest of the cities and lands which, he said, had passed from the kingdom of Syphax into the power of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He ordered Gnaeus Octavius to take the fleet to Sicily and turn it over to Gnaeus Cornelius, the consul; also the Carthaginian envoys to go to Rome, in order that all his acts on the advice of his ten legati might be confirmed by the authority of the senate and command of the people.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When peace had been secured by land and sea, Scipio embarked his army and crossed over to Lilybaeum in Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then after sending a large part of the army by sea, he himself, making his way through Italy,<note>He may have landed at Puteoli. The time is probably the autumn of <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date></note> which was exulting in peace no less than in the victory, while not cities only poured out to do him honour, but crowds of rustics also were blocking the roads, reached Rome and rode into the city in the most distinguished of all triumphs.<note>No details are furnished by Polybius either; XVI. xxiii (one exception below, &sect; 5). For picturesque descriptions see Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 66; Silius Ital. XVII. 625-654, at the very end of the poem.

The death of Syphax withdrew him rather from the eyes of spectators than from the glory of the triumphing general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had died not long before at Tibur, to which he had been transferred from Alba.<note>Alba Fucens; xvii. 2 and note.</note> Nevertheless his death attracted attention because he was given a state funeral.<note>So Val.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Following Scipio as he triumphed was Quintus Terentius Culleo<note>Cf. p. 533 and n. 2.</note> wearing the liberty cap; and for all the rest of his life, as was fitting, he honoured in Scipio the giver of his freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As for the surname Africanus, whether his popularity among the soldiers, or fickle favour of the people first gave it currency I am unable to state, or whether it began with the flattery of his intimates, as did the surname Felix for Sulla and Magnus for Pompey in the time of our fathers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What is certain is that he was the first general to be distinguished by the name of a nation conquered by him.

				<p>Scipio in Africa defeated the Carthaginians and the
					same Syphax, King of Numidia, and Hasdrubal in a
					number of battles with the aid of Masinissa. He took by
					assault two camps of the enemy, in which forty thousand
					men were wiped out by sword and fire. He captured
					Syphax by the help of Gaius Laelius and Masinissa.
					Masinissa, having captured Sophoniba, wife of Syphax
					and daughter of Hasdrubal, at once fell in love and
					after marrying her had her to wife. When rebuked by
					Scipio he sent her poison, and upon drinking it she died.
					The consequence of Scipio's many victories was that the
					Carthaginians, driven to despair, recalled Hannibal to the
					defence of the state. And he, withdrawing from Italy
					in the sixteenth year, crossed over to Africa and endeavoured by a conference to make peace with Scipio;
					and as there was no agreement on the peace terms, he was
					vanquished in battle. The Carthaginians sued for peace
					and it was granted them. When Gisgo argued against a
					peace, Hannibal with his own hand dragged him down.
					Then after apologizing for the rashness of his act, he himself argued in favour of peace. Masinissa's kingdom was
					restored to him. Returning to the city Scipio celebrated
					a most splendid and distinguished triumph, followed by
					Quintus Terentius Culleo, a senator, wearing a liberty
					cap. Whether Scipio Africanus received that cognomen
					first from his popularity with the soldiers or from fickle
					favour of the people is not known. Certainly he was the
					first commander-in-chief to be distinguished by the name
					of a nation he had conquered. Mago was wounded in a
					war in which he had come in conflict with Romans in the
					land of the Insubrians, and while returning to Africa,
					having been recalled by envoys, he died of his wound.</p>

					the Zama Problem</head>
					<p>THE so-called battle of Zama is unique in that
						efforts to localize its field have ranged between two
						points more than eighty miles apart.<note>Now that the eastern Zama (No. 2 below) is no longer considered, the span of controversy is reduced to about fifty miles.</note> Today historical
						and military critics in all their disagreements are
						convinced that Hannibal was defeated neither in the
						vicinity of Zama to the east nor in that of Naraggara
						to the west.</p>
					<p>For the former we have only the authority of Cornelius Nepos, who in his brief sketch of Hannibal says
						the battle was fought at Zama; <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 6. Annalists
						whom the biographer presumably consulted must have
						rested content to mention the first place named in
						their sources. Polybius, for example, names Zama
						merely as a town near to which Hannibal placed his
						camp after removing from the coast at Hadrumetum
						(Sousse); XV. v. 3. He adds that it was five day's
						journeys from Carthage, an item which Livy repeats without attaching to it any special importance;
						XXX. xxix. 2. Both have other names for a town
						which to their minds was near the field of the final
						battle; v. 14 and xxix. 9 respectively (p. 472, n. 1).
						Appian also mentions Zama only in connection with
						a cavalry engagement several days beforehand;
						<pb id="p.544"/>
						<hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi>36. None of these three intimates that
						Hannibal's camp remained near Zama.</p>
					<p>Merely as marking a first stage on Hannibal's
						westward march to meet Scipio Zama would claim
						our attention, even if tradition had not clung to that
						name for the field of his defeat.</p>
					<p>We have first to weigh the claims of two different
						Zamas some thirty miles apart and separated by
						mountain ridges:</p>
					<p>(1) The city later called Zama Regia, on a site now
						occupied by Seba Biar, west of the long dorsal
						range running north-east and south-west; see p. 469,
						n. 4, and authorities there cited. It was a royal
						residence for this part of Numidia in the time of
						Jugurtha. Juba I. provided his capital, on the edge
						of a plain and devoid of natural defences, with stout
						walls which made it necessary for Titus Sextius to
						starve Zama out after a long siege in <date value="-41">41 B.C.</date> Much
						building material must have been available for the
						subsequent restoration years afterward on a different
						site. The extant remains of Zama Regia are therefore
						wholly Numidian, for under Roman rule no attempt
						seems ever to have been made to rebuild on the same
						spot. The distance from Carthage was less than 100
						m. p. Cf. Kromayer-Veith, <hi rend="italics">Antike Schlachtfelder</hi> III.
						626; IV. 630; Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">Roman History</hi> I. and
						<hi rend="italics">Historische Schriften</hi> I. 36 ff.; Gsell, <hi rend="italics">Histoire ancienne</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">de l'Afrique du Nord</hi> III. 255 ff.; De Sanctis, <hi rend="italics">Storia</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">dei Romani</hi> III. ii. 549 ff.; 589 ff.; Scullard, <hi rend="italics">Scipio</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Africanus</hi> 310 if.; Pais, <hi rend="italics">Guerre puniche</hi>2II. 523 f.,

						Biar); Poinssot in <hi rend="italics">Rev. Africaine</hi> 1928, 163 ff. (map)</p>
					<pb id="p.545"/>
					<p>It is probable that long after the abandonment of
						the desolate site of this Zama a new city on a much
						smaller scale was built in a far stronger situation
						nine miles to the north-east of what is now Seba
						Biar. At that distance the modern village of Jama<note>Cagnat, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> No. XXV.</note> preserves essentially the ancient name, and there
						an inscription was discovered which has since ceased
						to be quite legible, if it is indeed still extant. This
						(<hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> VIII. 16442; Dessau 7689) identifies the place
						as Zama M(aior), probably Ptolemy's <foreign lang="greek">Za/ma mei/zwn</foreign>
						(IV. 3). The site is commanding and the remains
						are of the time of the Empire, none earlier. Obviously it did not exist in the age of Hannibal. The
						new city, which was much smaller, assumed the style
						of Zama from its predecessor, but was also called
						Zama Maior presumably to distinguish it from the
						following city.</p>
					<p>(2) Another Zama, later known as Colonia
						Zamensis, identified with Sidi Abd-el-Djedidi.<note><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> No. XXXI (upper left corner).</note> Upon this site has been found an inscription not
						earlier than the time of Antoninus Pius and in

					<p>The site is about 33 miles to the east of Seba Biar
						(Zama Regia), in a region where there are no plains.
						It is some 35 miles north-west of Kairouan and only
						about 55 miles from the coast at Sousse (Hadrumetum). Some have held this eastern Zama to be
						the city in question, <hi rend="italics">e.g. J.</hi> Schmidt in <hi rend="italics">Rhein. Museum</hi>
						<pb id="p.546"/>
						XLIV. 397 ff. and in <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> VIII. pp. 210, 1240;
						and Meltzer-Kahrstedt, <hi rend="italics">Geschichte der Karthager</hi>
						III. 562. But that view no longer finds a supporter.
						No one now believes that this eastern Zama was
						meant by any of our sources; cf. Veith III. 628 ff.;
						Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">Hist. Schr.</hi> I. 46 ff. Proof that it was
						called Zama as early as the Second Punic War has
						not been furnished.</p>
					<p>Historians who located the battle near Zama could
						not possibly have meant this town if they paid the
						least attention to the dorsal range which played so
						important a part in the strategy of the Tunisian
						campaign of 1943. The place lay on the eastern
						side of the first range and in a strong situation where
						cavalry would be useless. It is unthinkable that
						Scipio should risk his connections with Utica, his
						distant base, by crossing over mountain ridges.
						On the other hand if the battle took place somewhere between Zama Regia and Naraggara, or anywhere west of the same chain, even a Nepos would
						not have localized the scene by naming a town on
						the eastern slopes.</p>
					<p>Which of two Zamas existing under the Empire
						became a colony in the time of Hadrian cannot be
						determined from the oft-quoted inscription found at
						Rome, in which stands the official name <hi rend="italics">Colonia</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Aelia Hadriana Augusta Zama Regia; C.I.L.</hi> VI.
						1686; Dessau 6111 c. In Pliny's time there was
						an <hi rend="italics">oppidum Zamense,</hi> last in his alphabetical list of
						thirty such <hi rend="italics">oppida libera</hi> (<hi rend="italics">N.H.V.</hi> 30), but whether
						he meant what is now Jama, or what today is Sidi
						Abd-el-Djedidi, we have no means of deciding.
						Probably Jama was intended, since a third century
						inscription has the <hi rend="italics">coloni</hi> of Zama Regia under the
						<pb id="p.547"/>
						same <hi rend="italics">curator</hi> as those of Mactaris (Maktar),<note>Cf. Cagnat, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> No. XXX.</note> which is only 20 miles from Jama. This justifies the inference that the latter was meant in the words
						<hi rend="italics">curatori reip. col. Mactaritanorum Zamensium regiorum.</hi>
						The inscription, dating from the first half of the third
						century A.D., was found a few miles south of Maktar,
						the stone having evidently been carried from the ruins
						of that town; <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> VIII. 23601; P. Gauckler in
						<hi rend="italics">Comptes rendus de l'Acad. Inscr.</hi> 1898, pp. 275 ff. It is
						not to be connected with the old Numidian Zama
						of Jugurtha and Juba (No. 1, above), for that site
						shows no trace of occupation under the Empire.
						Possibly there were special reasons why Hadrian's
						<hi rend="italics">coloni</hi> should be established in both of the Zamas
						then in existence.</p>
					<p>As for the final battle-field, we have the conflicting
						statements of our two leading authorities. Livy
						names Naraggara, over fifty miles west of Zama
						Regia, as the nearest town; XXX. xxix. 9. Sidi
						Youssef, on the western boundary of Tunisia, has
						been generally accepted as its modern successor.
						Unimportant in Livy's time, Naraggara became a city
						of some consequence on one of the roads connecting
						Hippo Regius (B&ocirc;ne) with Carthage; <hi rend="italics">Itin. Anton.</hi>
						44; cf. Ptolemy IV. 3. The distance from Hadrumetum (Sousse), to which Hannibal fled post haste,
						would be ca. 170 to 180 Roman miles according to the
						route taken.<note>Veith thought the southerly route via modem Maktar and Kairouan was chosen (III. 600 ff., 645). Appian <hi rend="italics">Pun.</hi> 47 fin. and Nepos <hi rend="italics">Hannibal</hi> 6 agree that escape to Hadrumetum was accomplished within 48 hours, but in giving the distance they wildly exaggerate, the former making it 3,000 stades (375 Roman miles). Even Nepos' 300 miles would carry us well to the west of Lambb&egrave;se and Timgad. If the field of battle is to be placed not far from Sicca Veneria the distance covered by Hannibal in flight would be about 120 miles. Cf. p. 498, n -1.</note> Modern authorities, however, who find
						<pb id="p.548"/>
						no plain suitable for this battle near that site, accept
						Naraggara as merely a rough indication of the
						general region, and place the battlefield as much as
						20-25 miles farther to the east or south-east; cf.
						De Sanctis <hi rend="italics">.c.</hi>588 ff.</p>
					<p>Pareti in <hi rend="italics">Atti Accad. di Torino</hi> XLVI. 302 ff. (1911,
						with map) put the battle five miles south of Sicca
						Veneria (Le Kef) and east of the river Muthul (modern
						Mell&egrave;gue), between its tributary, the Remel, and a
						branch of the latter, the Tine.<note>See a large scale map also <hi rend="italics">in</hi> <hi rend="italics">Atlas arch&eacute;ol.,</hi> 1st series No. 57, <hi rend="italics">Environs du Kef.</hi></note> But Sicca was an
						important centre already in <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date> (Polybius I.
						lxvi f.), and if the victory of Scipio was won on a field
						so near a well-known place the battle would surely
						have been named from that town, and not from
						Naraggara, insignificant as it then was and distant
						some 30 miles by road from Sicca; <hi rend="italics">Itin. Anton. 41.</hi></p>
					<p>Kromayer, revising his collaborator's opinion,
						follows Pareti in general, but avoiding so close a
						proximity to Sicca Veneria, puts the field about ten
						miles south of that town, south also of the Remel,
						in a plain known as Draa-el-Meinan. That would
						be some 20 miles south-east of Naraggara, about
						30 miles west of Zama Regia (Seba Biar). See <hi rend="italics">Antike</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Schlachtfelder</hi> IV. 626 if.; cf. III. 637 and map 11a;
						also the <hi rend="italics">Schlachtenatlas, R&ouml;m. Abt.</hi> No. 8, 6 and text
						cols. 38 ff.; Liddell Hart, <hi rend="italics">A Greater than Napoleon</hi>
						176 (plan).</p>
					<p>The site finally accepted by Kromayer is particularly
						<pb id="p.549"/>
						commended by the presence of two elevations suitable for the camps, one having a spring and abundance
						of water, the other waterless, just as Polybius XV.
						vi. 2 and Livy XXX. xxix. 9-10 require, while the
						distance between them (51/2 km.) agrees substantially with the statements of the same passages (30
						stades and 4 m.p. respectively). This possible field,
						chosen by a leading military expert as meeting all
						the requirements, has more recently been visited
						and found suitable by Scullard; <hi rend="italics">History of the</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Roman World,</hi> Appendix 461 ff.</p>
					<p>Turning to Polybius, Livy's prime source and ours
						as well, we find that his best MSS. name Margaron
						as the town near which Scipio encamped just before
						the battle; v. 14. No place so named is elsewhere
						mentioned. Hence a presumption that the name may
						have been corrupted by copyists. Accordingly
						Schweigh&auml;user (1790) boldly substituted <foreign lang="greek">Nara/gara</foreign>
						<quote>ex eodem Livio .. . pro mendoso <foreign lang="greek">Ma/rgaron.</foreign></quote>
						So generally was this brilliant, but now far from convincing, emendation adopted that most recent editors
						and translators of Polybius give no intimation that
						their reading is in fact an XVIIIth century correction.
						A geographical proper name, however, especially
						in a region almost unknown to the outside world, is
						not necessarily corrupt because it occurs but once.
						Polybius' strange name otherwise unsupported may
						after all stem from Africanus himself, with whose
						adoptive grandson, the Younger Scipio, this particular
						writer lived on intimate terms. We may well
						imagine a family tradition in protest against the
						absurdity of naming the victory from either Zama
						or Naraggara, as current misnomers calling for
						correction in view of distance from the scene of
						<pb id="p.550"/>
						Hannibal's defeat. It is quite possible that they insistently reiterated their Margaron to any who used
						a different name.</p>
					<p>Naraggara may have been mentioned in early
						sources merely as a temporary position from which
						Scipio and Masinissa advanced eastward to confront
						Hannibal moving westward from Zama. In that
						case Livy must be as culpable in fixing the actual
						field of battle there as was Nepos in naming Zama,
						and by a similar carelessness in omitting the marches
						which brought the combatants face to face. Masinissa may well have objected to linking the victory
						itself with the name of Naraggara, as implying that
						his Numidians and his Roman allies were hesitating
						to advance farther east to meet Hannibal in open
						country. In any case Polybius had conceivably
						heard from the lips of the aged king the name used
						by him in alluding to the battle. We know at least
						that the historian had actually conversed with
						Masinissa (cf. p. 320, n. 1).</p>
					<p>It is certainly unsafe to assume that in his text of
						Polybius Livy found Naraggara or something closely
						similar. For Livy's handling of foreign place names,
						particularly in the Spanish campaigns of the Second
						Punic War, is most untrustworthy. The reprehensible
						habit of substituting for unfamiliar names in his
						best sources others presumably better known to his
						readers from the annalists has been the subject of
						pointed comment by recent critics, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Eduard
						Meyer, to whom Livy's Naraggara in place of
						Polybius' Margaron is a senseless correction; <hi rend="italics">Kleine</hi>
						Schriften II. 407 f.</p>
					<p>An African example cited by Meyer is Obba in
						XXX. vii. 10 for Polybius' Abba in XIV. vi. 12, a
						<pb id="p.551"/>
						town which he says was near, while Livy makes
						Syphax retreat after the burning of his camp to a
						quite different town far away in the interior, a
						dozen miles south of Sicca and in Carthaginian
						territory at that. Cf. p. 387 and n. 1; 389, n. 2.</p>
					<p>From such arbitrary substitutions we return to the
						text of Polybius and find that his best MSS. give only
						Margaron as the name of a town near the scene
						of the final conflict. Until further light shall some
						day make a real solution possible we need not hesitate
						to speak of the Battle of Margaron, or to use Zama-
						Margaron as a concession to practical convenience.</p>
					<p>Slight as is available evidence for the location of
						the battle, its date has long remained even more
						unsettled.<note>Cf. p. 469, n. 3 and p. 486, n. 1.</note> Every season from early spring to late autumn has been named by one or more of our
						modern authorities. A total eclipse of the sun
						alleged by Dio Cassius (Zonaras IX. xiv. 7) to have
						occurred on the very day of the battle seemed at
						first likely to solve the problem in favour of 19th
						October, <date value="-202">202 B.C.</date>, when astronomers over sixty years
						ago proved that there actually was an eclipse on that
						date, but that it was total only in Senegambia and
						Central Africa; that in North Africa on that day it
						was very partial, incapable of exciting alarm among
						the combatants, as described by Dio.<note>Another partial eclipse on the 25th April of the same year was visible only in Central Africa and at sunset.</note> Calculations in fact have disclosed that in the October eclipse less
						than one-tenth of the sun's disc was obscured for
						possible observers in Numidian and Carthaginian
						territory; further, that the time was two hours
						before noon, the sun 32 degrees above the horizon.
						<pb id="p.552"/>
						Consequently it is safe to assert positively that in
						the midst of the fray no one could conceivably have
						noticed a diminution of sunlight so immaterial. The
						astronomers report also that in <date value="-202">202 B.C.</date> there was no
						total eclipse visible in North Africa. (Cf. Oppolzer
						in <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi> XX. 318 ff. (1885) and Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">Hist.</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Schr.</hi> I. 45, n. 5; Ginzel, <hi rend="italics">Spezieller Kanon,</hi> etc. 189;
						Bruhns in Zielinski, <hi rend="italics">Die letzten Jahre des</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">ten punischen</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Krieges</hi> 73 ff., 1880).</p>
					<p>Accordingly Dio's alleged total eclipse has been
						reduced to pure fiction, of no value in determining a
						date which historians have sought to obtain approximately by weighing plausibilities in a more or less
						conjectural succession of events leading up to Scipio's
						victory. At the very earliest the battle has been
						placed in the spring of <date value="-202">202 B.C.</date> As it is known,
						however, that the peace was not made until the spring
						of 201, this theory puts an entire year between the
						decisive battle and the granting of peace, an improbable interval for that age.</p>
					<p>Objection to any part of the summer is raised on
						account of the heat both for elephants in action and
						for troops brought over from a less torrid climate.
						Yet not a few historians have ventured to decide
						upon that season. Autumn is commended to others
						especially by the brief interval between Zama-
						Margaron and the lesser victory over Vermina the
						son of Syphax.</p>
					<p>For this, the last engagement in a war which had
						lasted sixteen years, Livy saw fit to give an exact
						date, viz. 17th December, the first day of the Saturnalia (XXX. xxxvi. 8). So rarely, however, does he
						give a precise date for an event relatively insignificant
						that <hi rend="italics">Saturnalibus primis</hi> has been rejected by many
						<pb id="p.553"/>
						editors from Aldus down to Madvig and Riemann,
						as by Mommsen and other historians. On the other
						hand the MSS. reading is defended by Conway and
						Johnson. Rejection of an exact date for that event,
						of small importance in itself yet marking the end of
						all resistance, was certainly hasty, since similar
						instances in Livy are cited.</p>
					<p>Thus in <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date> Roman emissaries return from
						Carthage on the Nones of June, with nothing to
						account for such precision, unless the historian found
						it so in his source, presumably an annalist (XLI. xxii.
						1). In <date value="-168">168 B.C.</date>, more than five months before the
						victory at Pydna, Roman ambassadors returned from
						Macedonia on the last day of the festival of Quinquatrus (23rd March)&mdash;again a minor event exactly
						dated (XLIV. xx. 1). Similarly, 21 days after Pydna,
						and nine days after a courier had brought the good
						news, the arrival of the legati of Paulus is mentioned
						with the day (25th September) and even the hour of
						their entry into the city (XLV. ii. 3). There remains
						therefore no sufficient reason to dispute a precise
						date for Vermina's defeat.</p>
					<p>Accepting the 17th December as its date, we first
						apply a necessary correction due to the disordered
						Roman calendar, a month at least in advance of the
						actual season at the time. Thus we are brought
						back to mid-November, while the date of the
						demonstrably partial eclipse has been fixed by
						modern astronomers as 19th October (corrected
						calendar). Not that this can at once be set down
						as the actual day of the battle. For in dealing with
						a wild exaggeration, which made a terrifying total
						eclipse out of one so partial that in the excitement
						of battle no one could possibly have noticed anything
						<pb id="p.554"/>
						ominous, identification with the precise date of
						Hannibal's disaster would be palpably unsound
						procedure. It is quite possible, however, that about
						the date of the battle someone at a safe distance
						from the field may have noted the partial eclipse,
						perhaps employing the method described by Seneca
						(<hi rend="italics">Nat. Quaest.</hi> I. xii. 1). In such actual observation,
						possibly some days before or after the fatal day, we
						may find a plausible origin for a popular report which
						by repetition spread the myth of totality, arbitrarily
						fixed the date, and added a consequent panic in the
						Carthaginian ranks.</p>
					<p>Adopted by local narrators of the downfall of
						Carthage as a dressing for her wounded pride, the
						story passed, apparently, into the work of a Roman
						annalist. If Valerius of Antium gave an exact date
						for Zama-Margaron, as was still customary even for
						minor events, Dio or his abridger Zonaras neglected
						to include its mention. Had not Polybius and Livy
						done the same? The latter not unreasonably contented himself with a date that marked the cessation
						of all hostilities, not long after the historic victory,
						which recent opinion now inclines to place in October.
