					<p>THE Latin text of Vol. IV. (comprising Books
						VIII.-X.) has been set up from the fifth edition<note>The sixth edition of Books VI.-VIII. did not reach me until my own text was in type.</note> of
						the Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller text with German notes,
						except that the <hi rend="italics">Periochae</hi> have been reprinted from
						the text of Rossbach (1910). But the spelling is
						that adopted by Professors Conway and Walters in
						their critical edition of Books VI.-X. (Oxford, 1919),
						which is also the source of most of the rather
						numerous readings which differ from those of the
						Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller text, and has furnished besides
						the materials from which the textual notes have
						been drawn up. I have aimed to record every
						instance where the reading printed does not rest
						on the authority of one or more of the good MSS.,
						and to indicate the source of the emendation.</p>
					<p>In addition to the symbols used by the Oxford
						editors, I have employed <foreign lang="greek">W</foreign> to designate such of the
						good MSS. as are not cited specifically for some
						<pb n="viii"/>
						other reading, and <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> to designate one or more of the
						late MSS. or early printed texts.</p>
					<p>Besides the translations mentioned in the preface
						to Vol. I. (those of Philemon Holland, George
						Baker, and Canon Roberts), I have had by me the
						anonymous version printed in London in 1686, in
						folio, <quote>for Aunsham Churchill at the Black Swan in
							Ave-Mary Lane, near Paternoster Row.</quote></p>
					<p>I am also indebted to the editions of Book IX.
						by W. B. Anderson, Cambridge, 1909, and by

						Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller and Luterbacher have, of course,
						been constantly consulted, and the latter has been
						especially serviceable in helping to identify the
						various members of the same family in the preparation of the index.</p>

					THE consuls were now Gaius Plautius (for the<note type="margin">B.C. 341</note> second time) and Lucius Aemilius Mamercus, when the men of Setium and Norba brought tidings to Rome that the Privernates were in revolt, with complaints of a defeat suffered at their hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>it</reg> was also reported that a Volscian army, conducted by the Antiates, had encamped at Satricum. <reg>both</reg> wars were by lot assigned to Plautius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>he</reg> marched first on Privernum and at once gave battle. <reg>without</reg> much ado he overcame the enemy, captured Privernum, and putting in it a strong garrison, restored it to the inhabitants, but deprived them of two &mdash;thirds of their territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>thence</reg> he led his victorious army towards Satricum, to oppose the Antiates. <name>The</name> battle there, which was desperately fought, with heavy losses on both sides, was interrupted by a storm before victory had inclined to either army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Romans, not a whit discouraged by so indecisive a struggle, prepared to do battle on the morrow; but the Volsci, when they reckoned up the men they had lost in the fighting, were by no means so eager to incur the danger a second time, and in the night marched off like beaten men <pb id="p.5"/>for Antium, with fear and trembling, abandoning<note type="margin">B.C. 341</note> their wounded and a part of their baggage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>a</reg> great quantity of arms was found, not only amongst the slain but also in the enemy's camp. <reg>declaring</reg><note><hi rend="italics">i. C.</hi> as he burnt them; captured arms were sometimes burnt as an offering to Vulcan (I. xxxvii. 5), or to Jupiter Victor (x. xxix. 18). Lua Mater, wife of Saturn, was a goddess of atonement; at XLV. xxxiii. 1 she is associated in this rite with Mars and Minerva.</note> that he gave these arms to Lua Mater, the consul proceeded to lay waste the enemy's country as far as the coast.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><name>The</name> other consul, Aemilius, having entered the Sabellian<note><hi rend="italics"><reg>sabellus</reg> ager</hi> usually includes the territories in Central Italy inhabited by the Samnites, Sabines, Picentines, Vestini, Marsi, Paeligni, and Marrucini. <name>Livy</name> uses it here in a restricted sense of the country of the Samnites.</note> territory, nowhere encountered a Samnite camp or levies. <reg>as</reg> he was ravaging their fields with fire and sword, he was approached by Samnite envoys, who begged for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>being</reg> referred by Aemilius to the senate, they obtained an audience, and giving over their air of arrogance, besought the Romans to grant them peace and the right to war against the Sidicini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>These</name> requests, they said, were the more justifiable, inasmuch as they had become friends of the Roman People when their state was flourishing and not, like the Campanians, in their adversity;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> moreover, it was against the Sidicini that they were drawing the sword, a people always their enemies and never friendly to the Romans, of whom they had never, like the Samnites, sought friendship in time of peace, nor assistance, like the Campanians, in time of war; neither were they under the protection of the Roman People, nor yet their subjects.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<name>Titus</name> Aemilius the praetor laid the petition of the Samnites before the senate, and the Fathers voted to renew the treaty with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> praetor then replied to the ambassadors that the Roman People had not been to blame for the interruption of the friendship, and that, since the Samnites were themselves grown weary of a war contracted through <pb id="p.7"/>their own fault, they had no objection to renewing<note type="margin">B.C. 341</note> the covenant;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> as for the Sidicini, the Romans would not interfere with the free judgment of the Samnite People regarding peace and war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> the ratification of the treaty, the ambassadors went home, and the Roman army was at once recalled, after receiving a year's pay and rations for three months, which the consul had stipulated should be the price of a truce, to last until the envoys should return.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><name>The</name> Samnites marched against the Sidicini with the same forces which they had employed in the war with Rome, and were confidently hoping to capture the city of their enemies in a little while, when the Sidicini attempted to anticipate them by surrendering to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>then</reg>, after the Fathers had rejected their offer, on the ground that it came too late and had been wrung from them only by the direst necessity, they carried it to the Latins, who had already risen in arms on their own account.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>even</reg> the Campanians &mdash;so much more vivid was their recollection of the injury done them by the Samnites than of the kindness of the Romans &mdash;could not refrain from joining in this expedition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>one</reg> great army, gathered out of all these nations, invaded the borders of the Samnites, under a Latin general, but wrought more havoc by pillage than in battle; and although the Latins came off best in all encounters, they were not unwilling to retire from the enemy's country, that they might not have to fight so often.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> Samnites thus had time to send ambassadors to Rome. <reg>appearing</reg> before the senate, they complained that they were suffering the same treatment as allies that they had experienced while enemies, and besought the Romans, with the utmost humility, <pb id="p.9"/>that they
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> would be satisfied to have snatched from<note type="margin">B.C. 341</note> the grasp of the Samnites a victory over their Campanian and Sidicinian foes, and not suffer them actually to be conquered by the most cowardly of nations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>if</reg> the Latins and Campanians were subject to the Roman People, let the Romans use their authority and keep them from invading Samnium; but if they rejected that authority, let them hold them in check by force of arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>to</reg> this plea the Romans returned an ambiguous reply, since they were loath to confess that the Latins were no longer under their control, and feared to estrange them if they censured them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> Campanians, they said, were upon a different footing, having come under their protection not by treaty but by surrender; accordingly the Campanians, whether willing or not, should keep the peace; but there was nothing in their treaty with the Latins which entitled them to prevent their going to war with whom they chose.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<reg>this</reg> answer, as it left the Samnites quite at<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> a loss to forecast the Roman policy, so it alienated the Campanians with fear, while it persuaded the Latins that there was no longer any concession the Romans would not make them, and rendered them yet more audacious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>accordingly</reg> their leaders, under colour of forwarding the war against the Samnites, appointed numerous councils, and in all their deliberations secretly concocted war with Rome. <reg>in</reg> this war, too, the Campanians took part, against their preservers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> though all their measures were sedulously concealed &mdash;for they wished to shake off the Samnite foe behind them before the Romans should take the alarm &mdash;yet through certain persons connected by private ties of hospitality and kinship, <pb id="p.11"/>information of the conspiracy leaked out and was<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> brought to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> consuls were commanded, before their time was up, to resign their office, in order that new consuls might the sooner be chosen to confront so momentous an invasion; but a scruple arose at allowing the election to be held by those whose authority had been abridged, and so they had an interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>there</reg> were two interreges, Marcus Valerius and Marcus Fabius: the latter announced the election to the consulship of Titus Manlius Torquatus (for the third time) and Publius Decius Mus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>it</reg> is believed to have been in this year that Alexander, king of Epirus, sailed with a fleet to Italy &mdash;a war which, had it prospered in its beginning, would doubtless have extended to the Romans.<note>Alexander the Epirot's expedition is here placed too early by some ten years. <name>The</name> story of his death is told in chap. xxiv.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> was also the era of the exploits of Alexander the Great, who was the son of this man's sister,<note>Olympias, daughter of Neoptolemus.</note> and was doomed to be cut off by sickness while a young man, in another quarter of the world, after proving himself to be invincible in war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><reg>but</reg> the Romans, though quite certain that the allies and all the Latins were going to revolt, nevertheless, as if concerned not for themselves but for the Samnites, summoned to Rome the ten chief men of the Latins, that they might give them such commands as they might wish.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Latium</name> at that time had two praetors, Lucius Annius Setinus and Lucius Numisius Circeiensis, both from Roman colonies, through whose contrivance, besides Signia and Velitrae &mdash;likewise Roman colonies &mdash;even the Volsci had been induced to draw the sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>it</reg> was determined to summon these men by name. <reg>nobody</reg> could be in doubt why they were sent for; <pb id="p.13"/>accordingly, before setting out for Rome the praetors held<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> a council, and explaining how they had been summoned by the Roman senate, asked instructions touching the answers they should give to the questions which they supposed would be put to them.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<reg>while</reg> one was suggesting this thing and another that, Annius arose. <quote><reg>notwithstanding</reg> I have myself referred to you,</quote> said he, <quote>the question as to what our reply should be, nevertheless I consider that what we are to do is of more importance to the welfare of our nation than what we are to say.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>it</reg> will be easy, when we have straightened out our plans, to frame words suitable to our conduct. <reg>for</reg> if we are able even now to endure slavery under a shadowy pretence of equal treaty &mdash;rights, what is left for us but to give up the Sidicini, and obeying the behest not of the Romans only but also of the Samnites, make answer to the Romans that we are ready to lay down our arms at their beck and call?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> if our hearts are pricked at last with a longing for liberty; if treaties, if alliances, mean equality of rights; if we may now glory in the kinship of the Romans, of which we were formerly ashamed; if they mean by <quote>allied army</quote> one which added to their own doubles its numbers, one which they would not wish to make its own war and peace, apart from them; &mdash;if
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> these things are so, I say, why are not <hi rend="italics">all</hi> things equalized?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>why</reg> is not one consul furnished by the Latins? <reg>where</reg> a portion of the strength is, there, too, should be a portion of the authority.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>for</reg> us, indeed, this is not in itself any too great an honour, since we suffer Rome to be the capital of Latium; but we have made it seem an <pb id="p.15"/>honour by our prolonged submissiveness.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>and</reg> yet,<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> if ever at any time you have desired to share in the government and to use your freedom, behold, now is your opportunity, bestowed on you by your valour and by Heaven's favour!
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>you</reg> have tried their patience by denying them troops; who can doubt that they were enraged when we broke the tradition of two hundred years? <reg>yet</reg> they swallowed their resentment. <reg>we</reg> waged war on our own account with the Paeligni; those who aforetime withheld from us even the right to defend our own borders by ourselves, never interposed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>they</reg> have heard how we received the Sidicini into our protection, how the Campanians have left them and joined us, how we are raising armies against the Samnites, their confederates, &mdash;and have not stirred from the City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>whence</reg> comes this great restraint on their part, if it come not from the consciousness of our strength &mdash;and their own? <name>I</name>have good authority for saying that when the Samnites were complaining of us, the Roman senate answered in such wise that it might readily appear that even the Romans themselves no longer demanded that Latium should be under their authority.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>do</reg> but take up in your demands what they tacitly concede to you. <reg>if</reg> there is any man whom fear prevents from saying this, lo, I declare that I myself will say it, in the hearing not of the Roman People only and their senate, but of Jupiter himself, who dwells in the Capitol; that if they wish us to observe the treaty of alliance, they must receive from us one consul and a moiety of the senate.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>These</name> bold encouragements, and even promises, were received with a general shout of approval, and Annius was empowered to act and speak as might seem <pb id="p.17"/>conducive to the welfare of the Latin state and befitting<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> his own honour.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<reg>on</reg> the arrival of the Latins in Rome, they were given audience of the senate in the Capitol. <reg>there</reg>, after Titus Manlius the consul had pleaded with them, as directed by the senate, to make no war upon the Samnites,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> united as they were by treaty with the Romans, Annius held forth like some conqueror who had taken the Capitol by storm, not like an envoy protected by the law of nations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote><reg>it</reg> was high time, Titus Manlius,</quote> he said, <quote>and you, Conscript Fathers, that you should cease at length to deal with us as in any sort our rulers, perceiving, as you have, that Latium, by Heaven's blessing, is flourishing exceedingly in arms and men, after vanquishing the Samnites in war and receiving as allies the Sidicini and Campanians, and now even the Volsci besides, and that your own colonies as well have preferred the Latin to the Roman sway.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>but</reg>, since you cannot make up your minds to bring your impotent sovereignty to a close, we &mdash;though able by force of arms to give Latium her freedom &mdash;will
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> nevertheless concede so much to kinship as to offer terms of peace fair and equal to both sides, since the immortal gods have willed that we should be of equal strength.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>one</reg> consul should be chosen from Rome, the other from Latium, the senate should be drawn in equal proportions from both nations, there should be one people and one state; and that we may have the same seat of empire and the same name for all, by all means let this rather be our city, since one side must make concessions, &mdash;and may good come of it to both peoples!
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> &mdash;and let us all be known as Romans.</quote></p> <pb id="p.19"/>
				<p><reg>it</reg> so happened that the Romans had, in their consul<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> Titus Manlius, a man who was a match for Annius in boldness. <reg>so</reg> far was he from controlling his indignation, that he openly declared that if the Fathers were so demented as to receive terms from a Setine, he would gird on his sword, and entering the senate would slay with his own hand any Latin he might see within the Curia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>and</reg> turning to the statue of the god, <quote><reg>hear</reg>, Jupiter,</quote> he cried, <quote>these wicked words! <reg>hear</reg> ye, Law and Right!
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>shalt</reg> thou behold, O Jupiter, alien consuls and an alien senate in thy consecrated temple, thyself overpowered and taken captive?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>are</reg> these the covenants, Latins, that Tullus, the Roman king, made with your Alban forefathers, that Lucius Tarquinius afterwards made with you?<note>See Book I., chap. xxiv and chap. lii.</note> <reg>remember</reg> you not the battle at Lake Regillus? <reg>have</reg> you so forgot your old disasters. and our goodness to you?</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<name>The</name> consul's speech having been warmly seconded by the indignant senators, it is recorded that in answer to the numerous supplications of the gods, whom the consuls repeatedly invoked as the witnesses of treaties, the voice of Annius was heard spurning the power of the Roman Jupiter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>at</reg> all events, as he hurried, beside himself with rage, from the entrance of the temple, he slipped on the stairs, and struck his head so hard on the lowest stone that he lost consciousness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>that</reg> he was killed is not asserted by all writers, wherefore I, too, may leave the question undecided, as also the tradition that while men were calling on the gods to witness the breaking of the treaty, there was a loud crash in the heavens, and a hurricane burst forth; for these things may be true, or they may be apt inventions to express in a <pb id="p.21"/>lively manner the wrath of Heaven.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Torquatus</name>, who<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> had been sent by the senate to dismiss the envoys, saw Annius lying there, and exclaimed in a voice that was heard alike by the people and the senators: <quote><reg>it</reg> is well; the gods have begun a righteous war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>there</reg> <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a heavenly power; thou <hi rend="italics">dost</hi> exist, great Jupiter; not in vain have we established thee in this holy seat, the Father of gods and men.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>why</reg> do you hesitate to arm, Quirites, and you Conscript Fathers, with the gods to lead you? <reg>as</reg> you behold their ambassador brought low, even so will I cast down the Latin legions.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> consul's words were received with approval by the people, and so enraged them, that the envoys, at their setting out, owed their protection from men's wrath and fury more to the care of the magistrates &mdash;who attended them at the consul's bidding &mdash;than to the law of nations.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><name>The</name> senate also agreed on war; and the consuls, enrolling two armies, marched out through the country of the Marsi and Paeligni, and having added to their forces the army of the Samnites, went into camp near Capua, where the Latins and their allies had already assembled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>there</reg> in the stillness of the night both consuls are said to have been visited by the same apparition, a man of greater than human stature and more majestic, who declared
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> that the commander of one side, and the army of the other, must be offered up to the Manes and to Mother Earth; and that in whichever host the general should devote to death the enemy's legions, and himself with them, that nation and that side would have the victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>when</reg> the consuls had compared these visions of the night, they resolved that victims should be slain to tum away the wrath of Heaven; <pb id="p.23"/>and, at the same time, that if the warning of the<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> entrails should coincide with what thay had seen in their dream, one or other of the consuls should fulfil the decrees of fate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> report of the soothsayers agreed with the secret conviction which had already found lodgment in their breasts;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> whereupon they sent for their lieutenants and the tribunes, and having openly declared the pleasure of the gods, that so the consul's voluntary death might not terrify the soldiers in the fray, they agreed with one another that on whichever flank the Roman army should begin to yield, there the consul should devote himself in behalf of the Roman People and Quirites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>it</reg> was also urged in the council that if ever any war had been conducted with stern authority, now was the occasion of all others for recalling military descipline to its ancient courses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>their</reg> anxiety was sharpened by the fact that they must fight against the Latins, who were like themselves in language, customs, fashion of arms, and above all in military institutions; soldiers had mingled with soldiers, centurions with centurions, tribunes with tribunes, as equals and colleagues in the same garrisons and often in the same maniples.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>lest</reg> this might betray the soldiers into some blunder, the consuls proclaimed that no man should quit his place to attack the foe.</p> 
				<p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> youth's bold heart was stirred, whether by anger, or by shame at the thought of refusing the combat, or by the irresistible force of destiny. <reg>and</reg> so, forgetting the commands of his father and the edict of the consuls, he allowed himself to be swept headlong into an encounter where it would make little difference to him whether he won or lost.

					<reg>nevertheless</reg> the brutality of the punishment made the soldiers more obedient to their general; and not only were guard &mdash;duties, watches, and the ordering of outposts, everywhere more carefully observed, but in the final struggle, as well, when the troops had gone down into battle, that stern act did much good.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>now</reg> the battle was exceedingly like the battles in a civil war, so little <pb id="p.31"/>did the Latins differ from the Romans in anything<note type="margin">B.C. 340</note> but courage.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> first line, or <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> comprised fifteen maniples, stationed a short distance apart; the maniple had twenty light &mdash;armed soldiers, the rest of their number carried oblong shields; moreover those were called <quote>light &mdash;armed</quote> who carried only a spear and javelins.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> body of thirty maniples they called <hi rend="italics">antepilani,</hi> because behind the standards there were again stationed other fifteen companies, each of which had three sections, the first section in every company being known as <hi rend="italics">pilus.</hi>

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> knelt beneath their banners, with the left leg advanced, having their shields leaning against their shoulders and their spears thrust into the ground and pointing obliquely upwards, as if their battle &mdash;line were fortified with a bristling palisade.

					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>this</reg> was a thing exeedingly disheartening to the enemy, who, pursuing those whom they supposed they had conquered, all at once beheld a new line rising up, with augmented numbers.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>this</reg> was most clearly seen in that, wherever he rode, men cowered as though blasted by some baleful star; but when he fell beneath a rain of missiles, from that instant there was no more doubt of the consternation of the Latin cohorts, which everywhere abandoned the field in flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>at</reg> the same time the Romans &mdash;their spirits relieved of religious fears &mdash;pressed on as though the signal had just then for the first time been given, and delivered a fresh attack;

					<reg>while</reg> the struggle continued, and in some parts of the field the Latins were prevailing by reason of their numbers, the consul Manlius learned of his colleague's end, and having paid to so memorable a death &mdash;as justice and piety demanded &mdash;its well &mdash;merited

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>These</name> men had no such opportunities, and were, besides, more concerned for their own or their party's interests than for the country. <name>The</name> Latins took up arms again, being incensed at the confiscation of their land, and suffered a defeat and the loss of their camp, in the Fenectane Plains.<note>Named presumably from some unknown town in Latium.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>while</reg> Publilius, under whose command and <pb id="p.51"/>auspices the campaign had been conducted, was receiving<note type="margin">B.C. 339</note> the surrender of the Latin peoples whose soldiers had fallen there, Aemilius led his army against Pedum. <name>The</name> Pedani were supported by the people of Tibur, Praeneste, and Velitrae, and auxiliaries had also come from Lanuvium and Antium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>though</reg> the Romans proved superior in certain engagements, yet the town of Pedum and the camp
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> of the allied nations, which adjoined it, still remained intact to be dealt with, when suddenly the consul, hearing that his colleague had been decreed a triumph, left the war unfinished
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> and returned to Rome to demand a triumph for himself as well, without staying to obtain a victory. <reg>this</reg> self &mdash;seeking disgusted the Fathers, who denied him a triumph, unless he should capture Pedum or receive its surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>estranged</reg> from the senate by this rebuff, Aemilius thereafter administered his consulship in the spirit of a seditious tribune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>for</reg>, all the time that he was consul, he ceased not to accuse the senators to the people, while his colleague. since he too was of the plebs, offered not the smallest opposition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> ground of his accusations was the niggardly apportionment of land to the plebeians in the Latin and Falernian districts. <reg>and</reg> when the senate, desiring to put an end to the authority of the consuls, ordered that a dictator should be appointed to oppose the rebellious Latins, Aemilius, who then had

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>Publilius</name> was a popular dictator, both because of his denunciation of the senate and because he carried through three laws very advantageous to the plebs and prejudicial to the nobles:
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> one, that the decisions of the plebs <pb id="p.53"/>should be binding on all the Quirites; another, that<note type="margin">B.C. 339</note> the Fathers should ratify the measures proposed at the centuriate comitia before they were voted on; and a third, that at least one censor should be chosen from the plebs &mdash;since
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> they had gone so far as to make it lawful for both to be plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <name>The</name> harm that was wrought at home in that year by the consuls and the dictator outweighed &mdash;in the belief of the patricians &mdash;the increase in empire that resulted from their victory and their management of the war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<reg>in</reg> the following year, when Lucius Furius<note type="margin">B.C. 338</note> Camillus and Gaius Maenius were consuls, the senators, in order to render more conspicuous the negligence of Aemilius in the year before, insisted angrily that men and arms and every kind of force must be employed to capture Pedum and destroy it; and the new consuls were forced to put aside all other matters and set out for that place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> Latins were now come to such a pass that they could endure neither war nor peace; for war they lacked the means, and they scorned peace, for they still smarted under the confiscation of their land.<note>See chap. xi. &sect; 13.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>it</reg> seemed necessary to adopt a compromise, and keep to their towns &mdash;lest they might provoke the Romans and afford them a pretext for hostilities &mdash;and if tidings were brought that any town was beleaguered, to send in help to the besieged from all the surrounding peoples.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>for</reg> all that, the cities that aided Pedum were very few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Tiburtes and Praenestini, whose territories lay near by, reached Pedum; the Aricini, Lanuvini, and Veliterni, as they were effecting a juncture with the Antiate Volsci at the river Astura,<note>A little river emptying into the Mediterranean south of Antium.</note> were suddenly attacked by Maenius and routed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>Camillus</name> dealt <pb id="p.55"/>with the very powerful army of the Tiburtes<note>Livy means to include with them the Praenestini.</note> in the<note type="margin">B.C. 338</note> vincinity of Pedum; the struggle was harder, but the issue was equally successful.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> greatest confusion was occasioned by a sudden sally of the townsfolk during the battle; but Camillus, sending a part of his army against them, not only drove them back into their city, but having discomfited both them and their allies, even took the place by escalade that very day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> consuls then resolved, with the added energy and courage that came with the capture of one city, to proceed with their victorious army to the thorough conquest of the Latins; nor did they rest until, by storming every city or receiving its surrender, they had brought all Latium under their dominion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>then</reg>, distributing garrisons amongst the recovered towns, they departed for Rome, to enjoy the triumph by general consent awarded them. <reg>in</reg> addition to the triumph, they were granted the honour &mdash;a rare one in those days &mdash;of equestrian statues put up in the Forum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>before</reg> the consular elections for the following year were held, Camillus referred to the senate the disposition of the Latin peoples, and spoke as follows:
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote><name>Conscript</name> Fathers, what was needful to be done in Latium in the way of war and arms has now by Heaven's favour and the valour of our troops been brought to a conclusion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> armies of our enemies have been cut to pieces at Pedum and on the Astura; all the Latin towns, and Antium in the land of the Volsci, have either been carried by storm or have made submission, and are in the keeping of your garrisons.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>it</reg> remains to consider, since they so often occasion us anxiety by a renewal of hostilities, how we may hold them <pb id="p.57"/>quietly to a lasting peace.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> immortal gods have<note type="margin">B.C. 338</note> given you such absolute control of the situation as to leave the decision in your hands whether Latium is henceforward to exist or not. <reg>you</reg> are therefore able to assure yourselves of a permanent peace, in so far as the Latins are concerned, by the exercise of either cruelty or forgiveness, at your discretion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>would</reg> you adopt stern measures against those who have surrendered or been vanquished? <reg>you</reg> may blot out all Latium, and make vast solitudes of those places where you have often raised a splendid army of allies and used it through many a momentous war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>would</reg> you follow the example of your fathers, and augment the Roman state by receiving your conquered enemies as citizens? <reg>you</reg> have at hand the means of waxing great and supremely glorious. <reg>that</reg> government is certainly by far the strongest to which its subjects yield obedience gladly.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>but</reg> whatever it pleases you to do, you must determine promptly; you are holding so many peoples in suspense betwixt hope and fear, that it behoves you both to resolve your own anxiety regarding them as soon as may be, and to be beforehand with them, whether in the way of punishment or kindness, while they are waiting in a dull amazement.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> news <pb id="p.63"/>made the senate angry with the consuls, by whose<note type="margin">B.C. 337</note> tardiness the allies had been betrayed, and they ordered a dictator to be appointed. <name>The</name> nomination fell to Gaius Claudius Inregillensis, who named as his master of horse Gaius Claudius Hortator.

					<name>The</name> following year, being the consulship of<note type="margin">B.C. 336-334</note> Lucius Papirius Crassus and Caeso Duillius, was remarkable for a war more novel than important,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> to wit with the Ausonians, who inhabited the city of Cales.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>they</reg> had joined forces with their neighbours, the Sidicini, and the army of the two peoples having suffered a defeat in one &mdash;by no means memorable &mdash; <pb id="p.65"/>battle, was by the nearness of their cities not only<note type="margin">B.C. 336-334</note> the more disposed to flight, but found in that same flight the readier safety. <name>The</name> senators, however, did not cease to be concerned over this war, so many times before had the Sidicini either drawn the sword themselves, or lent aid to those who were drawing it, or been the occasion of hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>they</reg> accordingly bent every effort to elect to his fourth consulship the greatest soldier of that age, Marcus Valerius Corvus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>to</reg> be his colleague, they gave him Marcus Atilius Regulus; and lest there should by chance be some miscarriage, they requested of the consuls that Corvus be given the command, without the drawing of lots.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>taking</reg> over the victorious army from the previous consuls, he marched on Cales, where the war had originated, and routing the enemy &mdash;who had as yet not even recovered from the panic of the earlier encounter &mdash;at the first cheer and onset, he attacked the town itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> soldiers, for their part, were so eager that they wished to attempt the walls at once with scaling &mdash;ladders, and insisted that they could carry the place; but Corvus, since this would have been an arduous achievement, preferred to accomplish his purpose at the cost of labour rather than of danger to his men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>he</reg> therefore constructed a terrace and brought up mantlets, and moved his towers close to the walls, but a fortunate circumstance made it unnecessary to employ them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>for</reg> Marcus Fabius, a Roman prisoner, being neglected by his guards on a day of merrymaking, broke his bonds, let himself down by the wall, hand over hand, into the Roman works, by a rope which he had made fast to a battlement, and induced the general to attack the enemy while they <pb id="p.67"/>were overcome with feasting and drinking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> result<note type="margin">B.C. 336-334</note> was that the Ausonians and their city were captured with no greater effort than they had been defeated in the field. <reg>huge</reg> spoils were taken, a garrison was established in the town, and the legions were led back to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> consul triumphed,<note>This was the third triumph of Corvus. <reg>see</reg> vii. xxvii. 8, and xxxviii. 3.</note> in pursuance of a senatorial decree, and lest Atilius should go without his meed of glory, both consuls were directed to march against the Sidicini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>but</reg> first &mdash;being so instructed by the senate &mdash;they named a dictator to preside at the elections, their choice falling on Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus, who selected Quintus Publilius Philo to be master of the horse. <reg>under</reg> the presidency of the dictator, Titus Veturius and Spurius Postumius were chosen consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>These</name> men, although a half of the war &mdash;with the Sidicini &mdash;yet remained, nevertheless, in order to anticipate the desires of the plebs by doing them a service, brought in a proposal for sending out a colony to Cales.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> senate resolved that twenty &mdash;five hundred men should be enrolled for it, and appointed Caeso Duillius, Titus Quinctius, and Marcus Fabius a commission of three to conduct the settlers to the land and apportion it amongst them.</p>

					<name>The</name> new consuls then took over the army<note type="margin">B.C. 332</note> from their predecessors, and entering the enemy's territory laid it waste as far as their city walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>at</reg> this juncture, since the Sidicini had themselves raised an enormous army and seemed likely to make a desperate struggle in behalf of their last hope, and since the rumour went that Samnium was arming, the senate authorized the consuls to nominate a dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>they</reg> appointed Publius Cornelius Rufinus, and Marcus Antonius was made master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.69"/><reg>ascruple</reg> was subsequently raised about the regularity<note type="margin">B.C. 332</note> of their appointment, and they resigned their office; and when a pestilence ensued, it was supposed that all the auspices were affected by that irregularity, and the state reverted to an interregnum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>finally</reg> Marcus Valerius Corvus, the fifth interrex from the beginning of the interregnum, achieved the election to the consulship of Aulus Cornelius (for the second time) and Gnaeus Domitius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>coming</reg>, as it did, when all was tranquil, the rumour of a Gallic war worked like an actual rising, and caused the senate to have recourse to a dictator. <name>Marcus</name> Papirius Crassus was the man, and he named Publius Valerius Publicola master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>while</reg> they were conducting their levy, more strenuously than they would have done for a war against a neighbouring state, scouts were sent out, and returned with the report that all was quiet amongst the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Samnium</name> likewise had now for two years been suspected of hatching revolutionary schemes, for which reason the Roman army was not withdrawn from the Sidicine country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>but</reg> an invasion by Alexander of Epirus drew the Samnites off into Lucania, and these two peoples engaged in a pitched battle with the King, as he was marching up from Paestum.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>one</reg> thing, however, I should be glad to believe had been falsely handed down &mdash;and indeed not all the authorities avouch it &mdash;namely, that those whose deaths made the year notorious for pestilence were in reality destroyed by poison; still, I must set forth the story as it comes to us, that I may not deprive any writer of his credit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>when</reg> the leading citizens were falling ill with the same kind of malady, which had, in almost every case the same fatal termination, a certain serving &mdash;woman
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> came to Quintus Fabius Maximus, the curule aedile, and declared that she would reveal the cause of the general calamity, if he would give her a pledge that she should not suffer for her testimony. <name>Fabius</name> at once referred the matter to the consuls, and the consuls
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> to the senate, and a pledge was given to the witness with the unanimous approval of that body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>she</reg> then disclosed the fact that the City was afflicted by the criminal practices of the women; that they who prepared these poisons were matrons, whom, if they would instantly attend her, they might take in the very act.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>they</reg> followed the informer and found certain women brewing poisons, <pb id="p.73"/>and other poisons stored away. <name>These</name> concoctions<note type="margin">B.C. 331</note> were brought into the Forum, and some twenty matrons, in whose houses they had been discovered, were summoned thither by an apparitor. <reg>two</reg> of their number, Cornelia and Sergia, of patrician houses both, asserted that these drugs were salutary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>on</reg> the informer giving them the lie, and bidding them drink and prove her charges false in the sight of all, they took time to confer, and after the crowd had been dismissed they referred the question to the rest, and finding that they, like themselves, would not refuse the draught, they all drank off the poison and perished by their own wicked practices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>their</reg> attendants being instantly arrested informed against a large number of matrons, of whom one hundred and seventy were found guilty;

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>accordingly</reg> when a tradition was revived from the annals how formerly in secessions of the plebs<note>Livy says nothing of the nail in his accounts of the several secessions at II. xxxii, III. 1, and VII. xlii, but in vii. iii describes the practice as having originated in an attempt to relieve a pestilence.</note> a nail had been driven by the dictator, and how men's minds, which had been distracted by dissension, had by virtue of that expiation regained their self &mdash;control, they resolved on the appointment of a dictator to drive the nail.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>as</reg> he crossed the border he was met by the Fundanian senate, who said that they had come to plead, not for Vitruvius and his followers, but for the people of Fundi, whom even Vitruvius himself had cleared of responsibility for the war, when he sought refuge in Privernum and not in his native city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>it</reg> was therefore in Privernum that the Roman People should seek out and punish its enemies, who had fallen away at the same time from Fundi and from Rome, unmindful of either allegiance: the Fundani were peaceful, their sympathies were Roman, and they held in grateful recollection the gift of citizenship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>they</reg> begged the consul to make no war upon an innocent people, and declared that their lands, their city, their persons, and those of their wives and children were subject to the dominion of the Roman People and would so remain.

				<p><name>The</name> war with Privernum was not yet out of the way, when there came an alarming report of a Gallic rising, a warning which the senate almost never disregarded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, without a moment's hesitation, the new consuls, Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus and Gaius Plautius, were directed, on the very day on which they entered office &mdash;the Kalends of July<note>July 1st was the normal day for beginning the official year from <date value="-391">391 B.C.</date> to <date value="-153">153 B.C.</date>, when it was changed to January 1st.</note> &mdash;to divide the commands between them, and Mamercinus, to whom the Gallic war had fallen, was bidden to enlist an army without granting a single exemption;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> indeed it is said that a rabble of craftsmen even, and sedentary mechanics, was called out &mdash;a type the least qualified of all for military service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>An</name> enormous army was brought together at Veii, which was to be the base for the campaign against the Gauls; further afield they would not go, lest the enemy, advancing upon the City, might slip by them on another road. <reg>after</reg> a few days it became quite evident that no disturbance on the part of the Gauls was to be apprehended at that time, whereupon the whole array was directed against Privernum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>from</reg> this point there is a twofold tradition: some say that the city was carried by storm, and that Vitruvius was taken alive; others, that before the final assault was made, the people came out with a flag of truce<note>The <hi rend="italics">caduceus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">khru/keion</foreign>) was actually a herald's staff.</note> to the consul and surrendered, and that Vitruvius was betrayed by his own followers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> senate, being consulted regarding Vitruvius and the Privernates, commanded the <pb id="p.81"/>consul Plautius to raze the walls of Privernum, and<note type="margin">B.C. 329</note> placing a strong garrison in the town, to come to Rome and triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Vitruvius</name> was to be held a prisoner till the consul should return, and then scourged and put to death; his house on the Palatine was to be pulled down, and his goods dedicated to Semo Sangus.<note>Semo Sangus &mdash;or Sancus &mdash;was another name for Dius Fidius, the god of oaths, and was identified with Hercules, who was himself closely associated with Jupiter. <reg>see</reg> Warde Fowler, <hi rend="italics"><name>Roman</name> Festivals of the Republic,</hi> pp. 135-145.</note> <reg>out</reg> of the bronze which his chattels realized were fashioned bronze disks, which were placed in the shrine of Sangus, over against the temple

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> as follows: <quote><reg>since</reg> the authors of rebellion have now received the reward they merited, at the hands of the immortal gods, and at your own hands, Conscript Fathers, what is your pleasure regarding the

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<name>The</name> question was of itself a hard one to decide, and every senator argued, as his own nature <pb id="p.83"/>prompted him, for severity or mercy; but the whole<note type="margin">B.C. 329</note> situation was rendered even more uncertain by one of the deputation from Privernum, who possessed a livelier sense of the condition in which he had been born than of the exigencies of the actual crisis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>this</reg> man, on being asked by a certain advocate of harsher measures what punishment he thought the Privernates merited, replied, <quote><reg>that</reg> punishment which is merited by those who deem themselves worthy to be free.</quote>

				<p><name>The</name> consul himself did the most to bring about<note type="margin">B.C. 329</note> the adoption of these views, by remarking repeatedly to the consulars, who led in the

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> nation, relying in part on its own strength, in part on the faithlessness shown by the Samnites in their alliance with the Romans, or perhaps on the plague which was reported as having assailed the City of Rome, committed many hostile acts against the Romans dwelling in the districts of Campania and Falerii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>when</reg> therefore Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Quintus Publilius Philo (for the second time) were consuls, fetials were dispatched to Palaepolis to demand redress; and on their bringing back a spirited answer from the Greeks &mdash; a race more valiant in words than in deeds &mdash;the people acted upon a resolution of the senate and commanded that war be made upon Palaepolis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>by</reg> the division of the commands between the consuls, the war with the Greeks fell to Publilius; Cornelius, with another army, was ordered to be ready for the Samnites, in case they should take the field;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and since it was rumoured that they were only waiting to bring up their army the moment the Campanians began a revolt, that seemed to be the best place for the permanent encampment of Cornelius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<reg>both</reg> consuls informed the senate that<note type="margin">B.C. 327-326</note> there was very little hope of peace with the Samnites: Publilius reported that two thousand soldiers from Nola and four thousand Samnites had been received into Palaepolis, &mdash;rather under compulsion from the Nolani than by the good &mdash;will
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> of <pb id="p.89"/>the Greeks; Cornelius, that the Samnite magistrates<note type="margin">B.C. 327-326</note> had proclaimed a levy, and that all Samnium was up, while the neighbouring cities of Privernum, Fundi, and Formiae were being openly solicited to join.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> senate having, in view of these facts, voted to send ambassadors to the Samnites before declaring war, received a defiant answer from them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>indeed</reg> they actually accused the Romans of improper conduct, yet without neglecting to clear their own skirts &mdash;if they could &mdash;of the charges brought against them:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the Greeks, they said, were receiving no public counsel or support from them, nor had they asked the Fundani or Formiani to revolt; indeed they were quite strong enough to look out for themselves, if they chose to fight;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> on the other hand, they could not dissemble the chagrin of the Samnite nation that Fregellae, which they had captured from the Volsci and destroyed, should have been restored by the Roman People, and a colony planted in the territory of the Samnites which the Roman settlers called by that name;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> this was an insult and an injury, which, if its authors did not themselves recall it, they proposed to resist with might and main.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>when</reg> the Roman legate invited them to discuss the question with the common allies and friends of both, the Samnite spokesman said, <quote><reg>why</reg> do we beat about the bush? <reg>our</reg> differences, Romans, will be decided, not by the words of envoys nor by any man's arbitration, but by the Campanian plain &mdash;where we must meet in battle, &mdash;by the sword, and by the common chance of war.

				<p><reg>by</reg> taking up a favourable position between Palaepolis and Neapolis, Publilius had already deprived the enemy of that mutual exchange of assistance which they had made use of, as one place after another was hard pressed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, since the time drew near for the elections, and it was not for the advantage of the state that Publilius, who was threatening the enemy's walls, should be called away from the prospective capture of their city, which might happen any day, the senate got

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/><reg>to</reg> Lucius Cornelius, who had already entered Samnium, and whom they were equally unwilling to withdraw from the vigorous prosecution of the war, they sent a letter directing him to name a dictator for conducting the elections.

					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>this</reg> sentence the tribunes by their accusations made suspect and infamous; for the flaw, as they pointed out, could not easily have been discovered, since the consul rose in the night and appointed the dictator in silence, neither had the consul written to anyone <pb id="p.93"/>regarding the transaction, whether officially or<note type="margin">B.C. 327-326</note> privately, nor was there a single mortal living who could say that he had seen or heard a thing that would bring to naught the auspices;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> nor yet could the augurs have divined, as they sat in Rome, what obstacle the consul had met with in the camp. <reg>was</reg> there anyone, they would like to know, who could not see that the plebeian standing of the dictator was the thing which had seemed irregular to the augurs?
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <name>These</name> and other objections were made by the tribunes to no purpose; the state at length reverted to an interregnum, and after the comitia had been again and again postponed, on one pretext or another, at last the fourteenth interrex, Lucius Aemilius, procured the election of consuls, viz. <name>Gaius</name> Poetelius and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus &mdash;in other annals I find the name of Cursor.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<reg>it</reg> is recorded that in that same year<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> Alexandria in Egypt was founded, and that Alexander, king of Epirus, being murdered by a Lucanian exile, fulfilled by his death the oracle of Jupiter at Dodona.<note>The founding of Alexandria and the death of Alexander of Epirus are placed five years too late. <reg>they</reg> occurred in 332 or <date value="-331">331 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>on</reg> his being summoned to Italy by the Tarentines, the oracle had warned him to beware of the Acherusian water and the city Pandosia, for there he was destined to end his days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>on</reg> this account he had passed over with the more speed into Italy, that he might be as far removed as possible from the city of Pandosia in Epirus and from the river Acheron, which, debouching from Molossis into the Infernal Marshes,<note>The name was doubtless due to the association of the Acheron in Epirus with the Acheron of the lower world.</note> discharges its waters into the Thesprotian Gulf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>but</reg>, as generally happens, in seeking to escape his doom he ran full upon it. <reg>having</reg> repeatedly defeated the Bruttian <pb id="p.95"/>and Lucanian levies; having taken Heraclea, a<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> Tarentine colony, from the Lucanians, and Sipontum belonging to the Apulians, and the Bruttian towns Consentia and Terina, and after that other towns of the Messapians and Lucanians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and having sent to Epirus three hundred illustrious families, to be held as hostages, he took up his station not far from the city Pandosia, which looks down upon the borders of Lucania and Bruttium, on three hills that stand some little distance apart from one another, that he might thence make incursions into every quarter of the enemy's country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>he</reg> had about him some two hundred Lucanian exiles, whom he trusted; but their loyalty, like that of most men of that nation, was prone to change with the change of fortune.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><reg>continuous</reg> rains, which flooded all the fields, having isolated the three divisions of the army and cut them off from mutual assistance, the two bodies other than the king's were surprised and overpowered by the enemy, who, after putting them all to the sword, proceeded with their entire strength to blockade Alexander himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>whereupon</reg> the Lucanian exiles sent messengers to their countrymen, and promised that, if assured of restoration, they would give up the king, alive or dead, into their hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>but</reg> Alexander, with a chosen band, made a daring attempt, and broke out through the midst of his foes, cutting down the Lucanian general in a hand &mdash;to &mdash;hand encounter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>then</reg>, rallying his followers, who had become scattered in the flight, he came to a river, where the fresh ruins of a bridge, which the violence of the current had swept away, pointed out the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>as</reg> his company were making <pb id="p.97"/>their way across the stream by a treacherous ford, a<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> discouraged and exhausted soldier cried out, cursing the river's ill &mdash;omened name, <quote><reg>you</reg> are rightly called the Acheros!</quote><note>Acheros is apparently a by &mdash;form of Acheron. <name>The</name> soldier associated the word with <foreign lang="greek">a)/xos,</foreign> <quote>pain.</quote> <name>The</name> stream is thought to have been a small tributary of the Neaethus.</note> When the king heard this, he at once bethought him of the oracle, and stopped, undecided whether he should cross or
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> not. <reg>whereat</reg> Sotimus, one of the young nobles who attended him, asked why he hesitated in so dangerous a crisis, and pointed out the Lucanians, who were looking for a chance to waylay
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> him. <reg>with</reg> a backward glance the king perceived them at a little distance coming towards him in a body, and drawing his sword, urged his horse through the middle of the stream. <reg>he</reg> had already gained the shallow water, when a Lucanian exile cast a javelin that transfixed
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> him. <reg>he</reg> fell with the javelin in his lifeless body, and the current carried him down to the enemy's guard. <reg>by</reg> them his corpse was barbarously mangled, for they cut it in two through the middle, and sending a half to Consentia, kept the other half to make sport for
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> themselves. <reg>they</reg> were standing off and pelting it with javelins and stones, when a solitary woman, exposing herself to the inhuman savagery of the raging crowd, besought them to forbear a little, and with many tears declared that her husband and children were prisoners in the hands of the enemy, and that she hoped that with the body of the king, however much disfigured, she might redeem
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> them. <reg>this</reg> ended the mutilation. <reg>what</reg> was left of the corpse was cremated at Consentia by the care of none other than the woman, and the bones sent back to Metapontum,<note>Apparently Alexander had a garrison there.</note> to the

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>then</reg> the new consuls, having sent fetials, as commanded by the people, to declare war on the Samnites, not only began themselves to make ready for it, on a much greater scale in every respect than they had done against the Greeks, but received new and at that time quite unlooked for help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>for</reg> the Lucanians and Apulians, nations which until then had had no dealings with the Roman People, put themselves under their protection and promised arms and men for the war, and were accordingly received into a treaty of friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>at</reg> the same time, the Romans conducted a successful campaign in Samnium. <reg>three</reg> towns &mdash;Allifae, Callifae, and Rufrium &mdash;fell into their hands, and the rest of the country was devastated far and wide at the first coming of the consuls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>while</reg> this war was beginning in so prosperous a fashion, the other, against the Greeks, was in a fair way to be concluded. <reg>for</reg> not only were a part of the besieged cut off from the rest by the intervening entrenchments of the Romans, but things were going on within their walls much more dreadful than the perils with which the enemy threatened them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and as though the inhabitants had been made prisoners by their own defenders, they were subjected to outrage even in the persons of their <pb id="p.101"/>children and their wives, and suffered all the horrors<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> of captured cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>and</reg> so, on a report that reinforcements were on their way, both from Tarentum and from the Samnites, they felt that they had within their city more Samnites than they wanted, but being Greeks,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> looked forward to the coming of their fellow Greeks, the young men of Tarentum, to enable them to resist the Samnites and the Nolani, no less than their enemies, the Romans. <reg>in</reg> the end it appeared to them that surrender to the Romans was the least intolerable evil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Charilaus</name> and Nymphius, their principal citizens, took counsel together, and arranged the part that each should play in order to bring this about. <reg>one</reg> was to go over to the Roman general, the other to remain behind and make the city ready for the accomplishment of their design.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>it</reg> was Charilaus who went to Publilius Philo, and praying that it might tum out a good and favourable and fortunate thing for Palaepolis and for the Roman People, announced that he had resolved to deliver up the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>it</reg> depended, he said, upon the honour of the Romans whether, having accomplished his intention, he should appear to have betrayed his country or to have saved it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>for</reg> himself in particular he neither stipulated nor requested anything; for his people he requested &mdash; though he did not stipulate &mdash;that if the enterprise succeeded, the Roman People should consider with what eagerness they had resumed the friendship, and the hazard which they ran, rather than the folly and temerity which had led them to forget their duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> general commended him, and gave him three thousand soldiers to seize that part of the city where the Samnites were established, appointing <pb id="p.103"/>Lucius Quinctius, a military tribune, to command<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> the force.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<reg>at</reg> the same time Nymphius for his part had gone craftily to work with the Samnite commander, and pointing out that all the forces of the Romans were either about Palaepolis or in Samnium, got him to consent<note>This shows that the Samnite general was in control in the city.</note> that he should take a fleet and sail round them to the Roman seaboard, where he proposed, so he said, to ravage not only the coastal region, but the vicinity of Rome itself;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> it would however be necessary, in order to slip past the enemy unobserved, to put out at night, and the ships must be drawn down at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>that</reg> this might be accomplished the more expeditiously, all the Samnite soldiers, except the few who were needed to mount guard in the city, were sent down to the shore. <reg>while</reg> Nymphius was killing time there in the darkness, purposely issuing contradictory orders to confuse the throng, which was so large as to get in its own way, Charilaus, having been received into the city, as agreed upon by the conspirators, had occupied the highest part of it with Roman soldiers, whom he now commanded to give a cheer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> hearing this, the Greeks, who had received a signal from their leaders, remained still, but the Nolani fled through the opposite quarter of the city by the road that leads to Nola. <name>The</name> Samnites, being shut out from the town, enjoyed a momentary advantage in the ease with which they fled, but appeared in a more disgraceful light, when the danger had been left behind.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<reg>this</reg> war was immediately followed by the outbreak of another, with the Greeks of the eastern coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> the Tarentines, after sustaining the people of Palaepolis for some time with delusive hopes of succour, when they learned that the Romans had got possession of the city, inveighed against the Palaepolitans, as though, instead of deserting them, they themselves had been deserted, and were raging with hatred and envy against the Romans: the more so, because they learnt that the Lucanians and Apulians had made their submission to the Roman People &mdash;for an alliance was formed that year with both these nations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> Romans, they said, were almost at the gates of Tarentum, and matters would soon be come to such a pass, that they must needs have them for enemies or masters;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> it was clear that their own future hinged on the outcome of the war then being waged by the Samnites;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> this was the only nation that continued to hold out, and indeed that nation was none too strong since the defection <pb id="p.107"/>of the Lucanians; but the latter might even yet be<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> brought back and induced to repudiate the Roman alliance, if a little art were employed in sowing discord.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><name>These</name> counsels having prevailed &mdash;for they were eager to fall in with novel schemes &mdash;they
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> bribed certain young Lucanians, of greater prominence among their countrymen than respectability, who lacerated one another with rods and then exhibited their naked bodies before a concourse of their fellow citizens, crying out that for having dared to enter the Roman camp they had been ordered by the consuls to be scourged, and had narrowly escaped losing their heads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>this</reg> spectacle, so hideous in itself, pointed clearly to injury and not to guile. <reg>in</reg> an uproar of excitement, the people obliged their magistrates to convoke the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>at</reg> the meeting some crowded round and clamoured for war against the Romans, while others hurriedly departed this way and that, to rouse the inhabitants of the countryside to arms, till even the prudent lost their heads in the tumult, and it was voted to renew the alliance with the Samnites; and ambassadors were sent off to arrange it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>this</reg> impulsive action, as it had no cause, so it carried no conviction; they were forced by the Samnites both to give hostages and also to admit garrisons within their strongholds; but, blinded by the cheat and by resentment, they stuck at nothing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>a</reg> little later, when the false witnesses had retired to Tarentum, they began to see through the imposition; but having lost all power of independent action, they could only indulge in vain regrets.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> change in the law was occasioned by the notable lust and cruelty of a single usurer, Lucius Papirius, to whom Gaius Publilius had given himself up for a debt owed by his father. <name>The</name> debtor's youth and beauty, which might well have stirred the creditor's compassion, did but inflame his heart to lust and contumely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>regarding</reg> the lad's youthful prime as additional compensation for the loan, he sought at first to seduce him with lewd conversation; later, finding he turned a deaf ear to the base proposal, he began to threaten him and now and again to remind him of his condition;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> at last, when he saw that the youth had more regard to his honourable birth than to his present plight, he had him stripped and scourged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> boy, all mangled with the stripes, broke forth into the street, crying out upon the money &mdash;lender's lust and cruelty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and a great throng of people, burning with pity for his tender years, and with rage for the shameful wrong he had undergone, and considering, too, their own condition and their children's, rushed down into the Forum, and from there in a solid throng to the Curia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> consuls were forced by the sudden tumult to convene the senate; and as the Fathers entered the Curia, the people threw themselves at the feet of each, and pointed to the young lad's mutilated back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>on</reg> that day, owing to one man's outrageous injury, was broken a strong bond of credit, and the consuls were ordered to carry a proposal to the people that none should be confined in shackles or in the stocks, save those who, having been guilty of some crime, were waiting to pay the penalty; <pb id="p.111"/>and that for money lent, the debtor's goods, but<note type="margin">B.C. 326</note> not his person, should be distrainable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>so</reg> those in confinement were released, and it was forbidden that any should be confined thereafter.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<reg>in</reg> that same year, though the Samnite<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> war and the sudden revolt of the Lucanians, together with the Tarentines their abettors, were enough of themselves to fill the senators with concern, yet the Vestini added to their cares by uniting with the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>this</reg> action was widely discussed in private conversations, without being made the subject, in that year, of any public deliberations; but the consuls of the following year, Lucius Furius Camillus (for the second time) and Junius Brutus Scaeva, deemed it a matter that should take precedence over all other business to come before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>there</reg>, notwithstanding it was no news to them, the situation occasioned the Fathers so great anxiety as to make them equally afraid to deal with it or to let it alone, lest the impunity of the Vestini might inspire the neighbouring tribes with licence and insolence, or a punitive war inflame them with apprehensions of imminent danger and with resentment;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> moreover the race as a whole was fully equal to the Samnites in military power, comprising, as it did, the Marsi, and the Paeligni and Marrucini, &mdash;all of whom must be had for enemies, should the Vestini be molested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> day, however, was carried by that party which might have seemed at the moment to have on its side a greater share of courage than of wisdom; but the sequel showed that Fortune favours the brave.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>being</reg> authorized by the senate, the people voted a war against the Vestini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> command was assigned by lot to <pb id="p.113"/>Brutus, that against the Samnites to Camillus.<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> <reg>armies</reg> were dispatched in both directions, and the enemy, concerned to protect their borders, were kept from joining forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>but</reg> one of the consuls, Lucius Furius, on whom the heavier burden had been laid,<note>Since the Vestini were not supported by their neigh bours, as men had feared they would be.</note> had the misfortune to fall dangerously ill and was compelled to relinquish his command;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> being ordered to nominate a dictator for the purpose of carrying on the war, he named by far the most distinguished soldier of that time, Lucius Papirius Cursor, by whom Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus<note>Also called Rullus (xxiv. ix. 8). He was the grandfather of Fabius Cunctator, who opposed Hannibal.</note> was appointed master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>they</reg> were a pair famous for the victories won while they were magistrates; but their quarrelling, which almost went the length of a mortal feud, made them more famous still.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><name>The</name> other consul, in the country of the Vestini, carried on a war of many phases, but of unvarying success at every point.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>for</reg> he ravaged their farms, and by pillaging and burning their houses and their crops, compelled them against their will to take the field; and then in a single battle wrought such havoc with the Vestinian power &mdash;though his own troops came off by no means scatheless &mdash;that the enemy not only retreated to their camp, but, no longer trusting to their parapet and trenches, slipped away to their several towns, seeking protection in the situation of the places and their walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>finally</reg>, the consul addressed himself to the capture of these towns. <name>The</name> soldiers fought with great fury to revenge their wounds, for hardly a man had come unhurt out of the battle; and first Cutina was carried by escalade, and then Cingilia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> consul gave the booty of both these cities to his men, <pb id="p.115"/>because neither the gates nor the walls of the<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> enemy had held them back.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<name>The</name> expedition into Samnium was attended with ambiguous auspices; but the flaw in them took effect, not in the outcome of the war, which was waged successfully, but in the animosities and madness of the generals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> Papirius, the dictator, as he was setting out for Rome, on the advice of the keeper of the sacred chickens, to take the auspices afresh, warned the master of the horse to remain in his position, and not to engage in battle with the enemy while he himself was absent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>when</reg> Quintus Fabius had ascertained from his scouts &mdash;after the departure of the dictator &mdash;that
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the enemy were in all respects as careless and unguarded as if there had been not a single Roman in Samnium, whether it was that the spirited young man felt aggrieved that all power should seem to be vested in the dictator, or that lie was tempted by the opportunity of striking a successful blow, he put the army in fighting trim, and advancing upon a place they call Imbrinium, engaged in a pitched battle with the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> engagement was so fortunate that no greater success could have been gained, had the dictator been present; the general failed not his men, nor the men their general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> cavalry, too &mdash;at the suggestion of Lucius Cominius, a tribune of the soldiers &mdash;after charging a number of times without being able to break the enemy's lines, pulled the bridles off their horses and spurred them on so hotly that nothing could resist the shock, and arms and men went down before them over a wide front.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> foot soldiers, following up the cavalry charge, advanced on the disordered enemy, <pb id="p.117"/>of whom it is said that twenty thousand were slain<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> that day. <reg>i</reg> find it stated by certain writers that Quintus Fabius twice fought the enemy while the dictator was absent, and twice gained a brilliant victory. <name>The</name> oldest historians give but this one battle, and in certain annals the story is omitted altogether.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><name>The</name> master of the horse found himself, after so great a slaughter, in possession of extensive spoils. <reg>he</reg> piled the enemy's arms in a great heap, applied a torch to them, and burnt them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>this</reg> may have been done in fulfilment of a vow to one of the gods, or &mdash;if one chooses to accept the account of Fabius &mdash;to prevent the dictator reaping the harvest of his glory and inscribing his name on the arms, or having them carried in his triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>a</reg> dispatch, too, reporting the victory, which Fabius sent to the senate and not to the dictator, argues that he had no mind to share the credit with him. <reg>at</reg> all events, the dictator so received the news, that while everyone else was rejoicing at the victory, he showed no uncertain signs of anger and discontent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>and</reg> so, having hastily dismissed the senate, he rushed out of the Curia, repeatedly asserting that in that battle the master of the horse had defeated and overthrown the prestige of the dictatorship and military discipline not less decisively than the Samnite legions, should it end in his having flouted orders with impunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>and</reg> so lie set out for the camp, breathing wrath and menaces; but though he travelled by exceedingly long stages, he was unable to arrive before the report of his being on the way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>for</reg> couriers had hastened from the City, bringing word that the dictator was coming, athirst <pb id="p.119"/>for vengeance and praising with almost every other<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> word the deed of Titus Manlius.<note>See chapter vii.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<name>Fabius</name> at once convened an assembly of the soldiers, and reminding them how their bravery had saved the state from the most determined of enemies, conjured them to be no less brave in defending him &mdash;under whose command and auspices they had gained the victory &mdash;from the ungovernable wrath of the dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>he</reg> was coming, said Fabius, crazed with jealousy, and exasperated that another should have been both brave and fortunate; it enraged him that the state should have won a glorious victory in his absence; he would prefer &mdash;could he effect a change of fortune &mdash;that
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the Samnites and not the Romans had been the victors; he repeatedly declared that his authority had been despised, as though his orders against fighting had not been inspired by the same motive as was his grief over the battle!
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> the former occasion envy had made him wish to thwart the bravery of others; he would have stripped the most willing of soldiers of their arms, that they might be unable to use them in his absence. <reg>at</reg> present his rage and resentment were due to this, that his troops, though lacking the help of Lucius Papirius, had lacked neither swords nor hands to wield them, and that Quintus Fabius had regarded himself as master of the horse, and not as the dictator's orderly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>what</reg> would he have done, had the chances of war and the common lot of armies resulted in defeat? <reg>despite</reg> the conquest of the enemy and a campaign so well directed that not even his own peerless leadership could have bettered it, he was now threatening the master of the horse with punishment, victorious though he was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>for</reg> that <pb id="p.121"/>matter, he was no angrier with the master of the<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> horse than with the tribunes of the soldiers, the centurions, and the men. <reg>had</reg> he been able, he would have vented his rage upon them all: this being imposible, he was pouring it out on one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> truth is that envy, like lightning, seeks out the highest places; he was hurling himself upon the head of their counsels, upon their general; should he succeed in destroying Fabius, and with him the glory of their achievement, he would then follow up his victory &mdash;as though lording it over a captured army &mdash;and would visit upon the soldiers all the cruelty he had been permitted to inflict upon the master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>let</reg> them defend, he cried, the liberty of all by defending him. <reg>if</reg> that same singleness of purpose which the army had displayed in battle should appear in the way they stood up for their victory and made one man's safety the safety of them all, the dictator would incline his heart to a more merciful determination.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>he</reg> ended by committing himself, his life, and his fortunes to their loyalty and valour.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<reg>a</reg> shout arose from the whole concourse, bidding him be of good courage; no one, they cried, should do him violence, while the Roman legions were safe.</p> 
				<p><reg>not</reg> long after came the dictator, and forthwith by sound of trumpet summoned an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>then</reg> a herald, having obtained silence, cited Quintus Fabius the master of the horse, who was no sooner come up from below to the tribunal, than the dictator cried out:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote><reg>i</reg> ask you, Quintus Fabius, seeing that the dictator's authority is paramount, and the consuls obey him, though they possess the might of kings,<note><hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> II. i. 8. All the rights of the kings and all their insignia were possessed by the earliest consuls.</note> and the praetors, too, who have been elected under <pb id="p.123"/>the same auspices with the consuls, whether or no<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> you deem it to be reasonable that the master of the horse should hearken to his word;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and I put this further question to you &mdash;whether, when I knew that I had set out from home with uncertain auspices, it was my duty, in view of our troubled relations with the gods, to jeopardize the public safety, or to seek auspices again, that I might take no steps while the will of Heaven was in doubt;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and I likewise ask whether that which a religious scruple has prevented the dictator from doing can be freely and unrestrainedly undertaken by the master of the horse. <reg>but</reg> why do I put these questions, since, had I gone off without a word, nevertheless your thoughts should have been directed to the interpretation of my will?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>come</reg>, answer me: Did I forbid you to take any measures in my absence? <reg>did</reg> I forbid you to engage the enemy?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>but</reg> you spurned this order; and notwithstanding the uncertainty of the auspices and our uneasy scruples, you had the hardihood, against all military precedent, and the discipline of our fathers, and the divine will of the gods, to encounter with the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>answer</reg> these questions I have put to you; but have a care that you utter no word besides' Stand ready, lictor.</quote></p> 
				<p><reg>to</reg> answer the separate indictments was far from easy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>now</reg> complaining that the same man was his accuser and his judge in a matter of life and death, and again crying out that he could more easily be robbed of his life than of the glory of his deeds, he defended himself
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> and accused the general by turns, until Papirius in a fresh burst of anger bade them strip the master of the horse and make ready rods and axes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>then</reg> Fabius, imploring the protection of <pb id="p.125"/>the soldiers, escaped from the clutches of the lictors<note type="margin">B.C. 355</note> with his clothes in tatters, and sought refuge in the midst of the <hi rend="italics">triarii,</hi> who were stirring up riot in the rear of the assembly.<note>For an assembly the soldiers stood in maniples, drawn up in the same order as for a battle. <reg>see</reg> chapter viii.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/><reg>thence</reg> the outcry spread to the entire host. <reg>in</reg> one place were heard entreaties, in another threats. <reg>those</reg> who chanced to be standing next to the tribunal, and being under the general's eyes were able to be marked by him, implored him to spare the master of the horse, and not condemn the army with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>those</reg> in the outskirts of the meeting, and the crowd that surrounded Fabius, railed at the dictator's cruelty, and were near to mutiny.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>not</reg> even the tribunal itself was quiet; the lieutenants, standing about the dictator's chair, besought him to put the matter off until the morrow and allow time for consideration and for his anger to cool;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> he had sufficiently chastened the youth of Fabius, they said, and discredited his victory; it would not be well to carry out his punishment to the end, nor to fasten such humiliation upon a young man of extraordinary merit, nor on that most distinguished man, his father, and the Fabian family.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>finding</reg> that neither prayers nor arguments did any good, they bade him look at the turmoil in the assembly; when the passions of the soldiers were so overwrought, it was not, they said, for one of his years and discretion to furnish fuel to the flames of mutiny;
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> no one would ascribe the fault to Quintus Fabius &mdash;who was but deprecating his own punishment &mdash;but all would blame the dictator, if, blinded with resentment, he should bring down the angry multitude upon himself by an ill &mdash;judged contention.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>finally</reg>, that he might not suppose that they argued thus out of any <pb id="p.127"/>personal regard for Fabius, they were ready, they<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> said, to take an oath that it appeared to be inconsistent with the interests of the state that Quintus Fabius should then be punished.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<reg>but</reg> the lieutenants by these words rather stirred up the wrath of the dictator against themselves than lessened his rancour against the master of the horse, and he ordered them to go down from the tribunal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>he</reg> then sought by the mouth of a herald to procure silence, but without success, for the din and uproar were so great that it was impossible for the dictator himself or his attendants to be heard;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and it was left for darkness, as though descending on a battle &mdash;field, to end the struggle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/><name>The</name> master of the horse was commanded to appear next day; but since everyone assured him that Papirius would be more violent than ever, aroused as he was and exasperated by the opposition he had met with, he slipped out of the camp and fled to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>there</reg>, with the approval of his father, who had thrice been consul, and dictator to boot, he at once assembled the senate,<note>It was not until <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date> that the senate was a second time convened by a master of the horse (xxiii. xxv. 3).</note> and had reached, in his speech to the senators, the very point where he was complaining of the violence and injury offered him by the dictator, when a sudden noise was heard outside the Curia, as the lictors cleared the way, and Papirius himself, in high dudgeon, appeared before them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for he had learned of the other's departure from the camp, and taking a troop of light horse had pursued him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> dispute was now renewed, and the dictator ordered Fabius to be seized. <reg>both</reg> the leading members and the senate as a body sought to pacify his wrath; but he would not relent, and persisted in his <pb id="p.129"/>purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>then</reg> the father of the young man said:<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> <quote><reg>inasmuch</reg> as neither the senate's authority nor my old age &mdash;which you are going about to bereave &mdash;nor the merits and noble lineage of a master of the horse whom you yourself appointed, are of any weight with you, nor yet entreaties, which have often moved an enemy to mercy, which can persuade the gods to put away their anger, &mdash;I invoke the tribunes of the plebs, and appeal to the people; and since you would shun the judgment of your own army and shun the judgment of the senate, I propose to you a judge that singly has more might and power &mdash;be well assured &mdash;than has your dictatorship.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>leaving</reg> the senate &mdash;house, they repaired to the speaker's platform, which the dictator mounted with only a few attendants, while the master of the horse was accompanied thither by the whole body of the leading men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>then</reg> Papirius bade Fabius be removed from the Rostra to the ground below; and his father followed him, exclaiming, <quote><reg>you</reg> do well to bid us be removed to a place where even as private citizens we can say our say!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>at</reg> first there were not so much set speeches to be heard above the tumult as an interchange of angry words.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>but</reg> presently the strong voice and the indignation of the elder Fabius prevailed over the din, as he inveighed against the pride and cruelty of Papirius. <reg>he</reg> reminded him that he too had been dictator at Rome, and that no man &mdash;not even a plebeian, a centurion, or a common soldier &mdash;had
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> been misused by him; but Papirius was seeking a victory and triumph over a Roman general, as if over <pb id="p.131"/>commanders of the enemy. <reg>how</reg> great was the<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> difference betwixt the moderation of the ancients and this new &mdash;fangled arrogance and ruthlessness!
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>when</reg> Quinctius Cincinnatus had been dictator, and had rescued the consul Lucius Minucius from the toils of the enemy, his anger had gone no further than to leave Minucius in command of the army as his lieutenant, in place of being consul.<note>The story is related at length, III. xxvi.-xxix.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <name>Marcus</name> Furius Camillus, when Lucius Furius, in contempt of his great age and his authority, had fought a battle, with the direst results, not only controlled his indignation at the moment and made no animadversions upon his colleague in writing to the senate or the people, but, on being permitted by the senate, after his return, to choose a partner in command, selected Lucius Furius in preference to all the other consular tribunes, his associates.<note>See vi. xxii.-xxv.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>as</reg> to the people, who had all power in their hands, their indignation against those who by recklessness or lack of skill had lost their armies had never burned so fiercely that they punished them with anything worse than a fine; a capital charge on account of a defeat had never until that day been lodged against a general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>but</reg> now the generals of the Roman People, who even if beaten might not be so dealt with without sin, were, despite their victories and their well &mdash;earned title to a triumph, being threatened with scourging and decapitation.

					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> <reg>in</reg> what spirit would this be taken by the army, which under his conduct and his auspices had gained the victory? <reg>what</reg> grief would there be in the Roman camp, what rejoicings amongst their enemies!</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<reg>on</reg> his side were ranged the countenance of the senate, the favour of the populace, the assistance of the tribunes, the remembrance of the absent army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>his</reg> opponent urged the invincible authority of the Roman People, and military discipline, and the edict of a dictator &mdash;which had ever been revered as the will of Heaven &mdash;and the severity of Manlius,<note>Chap. vii. &sect; 22.</note> who had preferred the general good to the love he bore his son, even as Lucius Brutus,<note>II. v. 5.</note> the founder of Roman liberty, had done before, in the case of his two children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> nowadays &mdash;the dictator proceeded &mdash;fathers were indulgent; and the older generation, little caring if another man's authority were flouted, excused the young for overturning military discipline, as a thing of no importance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>he</reg> should nevertheless persist in his undertaking, nor remit an iota of his due punishment to one who had fought against his orders, while the rites of religion were confused and the <pb id="p.135"/>auspices uncertain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>whether</reg> the majesty of the<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> supreme authority were to endure or not was beyond his power to determine; but Lucius Papirius would do nothing to diminish it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>he</reg> prayed that the tribunes might not employ their power &mdash;itself inviolate &mdash;to violate by their interference the authority of Rome; that the people might not single out the very time of his holding that office to extinguish the lawful might of the dictatorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>should</reg> they do so, it would not be Lucius Papirius, but the tribunes and the crooked judgment of the people, that posterity would censure, and censure without avail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>for</reg> let military discipline be once broken, and soldier would not obey centurion, nor centurion tribune, nor tribune lieutenant, nor lieutenant consul, nor master of the horse dictator &mdash;none would have respect for men, none reverence for the gods;

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the standards would be deserted, the men would not come together at command; they would fight without reference to night or day, to the advantage or disadvantage of the ground, to the orders or prohibition of the general; they would neither wait for the word nor keep to their ranks; blind and haphazard brigandage would supplant the time &mdash;honoured and hallowed ways of war.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<name>The</name> tribunes were dumbfounded, more<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> troubled now on their own account than on his, for whom their help was being solicited; but the Roman People relieved them of their burden of responsibility, when they turned as one man to the dictator, and entreated and adjured him to remit for their sake the punishment of the master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> tribunes, too, fell in with the prevailing mood, and earnestly besought Papirius to allow for human frailty, to allow for the youth of Quintus Fabius, who had suffered punishment enough.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>now</reg> the young man himself, now his father Marcus Fabius, forgetting all contention, threw themselves down at the dictator's knees and attempted to avert his anger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>then</reg> said the dictator, when silence was obtained, <quote><reg>it</reg> is well, Quirites. <name>The</name> discipline of war, the majesty of government, have got the victory, despite the danger that this day would see the end of them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>Quintus</name> Fabius is not found guiltless, seeing that he fought against the orders of his general; but, convicted of that guilt, is granted as a boon to the Roman People, is granted to the authority of the tribunes, who plead for him but can bring him no legal relief.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>live</reg>, Quintus Fabius, more blest in this consent of your fellow citizens to save you, than in the victory over which, a little while ago, you were exulting! <reg>live</reg>, though you dared a deed which not even your sire would have pardoned, had he been in the place of Lucius Papirius!
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>with</reg> me you shall again be on good terms when you will; for the Roman People, to whom you owe your life, you can do nothing greater than to show that you have learned what this day clearly teaches &mdash;to submit in war and in peace <pb id="p.139"/>to lawful authority.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>then</reg>, declaring that the<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> master of the horse was free to depart, he descended from the platform, and the joyful senators and yet more joyful people thronged about them and attended them, congratulating now the master of the horse and now the dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>it</reg> seemed that the peril of Fabius had been not less efficacious than the pitiful punishment of young Manlius in the establishment of military authority.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>it</reg> so fell out that year, that as often as the dictator left the army, there was a rising of the enemy in Samnium. <reg>but</reg> with the example of Quintus Fabius before his eyes, Marcus Valerius, the lieutenant who commanded in the camp, could not fear any violence of the enemy more than the dread displeasure of the dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>and</reg> so when a party of foragers had fallen into an ambush and fighting at a disadvantage had been slain, it was commonly believed that the lieutenant might have rescued them, had he not quailed at the thought of those harsh orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>their</reg> resentment of this still further estranged the soldiers from the dictator, angry as they already were at his unwillingness to pardon Quintus Fabius, and his having granted to the Roman People a boon he had denied to their own entreaties.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<reg>when</reg> the dictator had set Lucius Papirius Crassus over the City and had forbidden Quintus Fabius, the master of the horse, to exercise his magistracy in any way, he returned to the camp, where his arrival occasioned no great satisfaction to the Romans nor the slightest apprehension to their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> on the following day, whether unaware that the dictator was come or caring little <pb id="p.141"/>whether he were there or not, the Samnites formed<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> in order of battle and approached the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>so</reg> great however was the importance of one man, Lucius Papirius, that if the goodwill of the soldiers had seconded the measures taken by their general, it was held as certain that the war with Samnium might that day have been brought to a successful termination &mdash;so
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> skilfully did he dispose his army, so well secure it with every advantage of position and reserves, and with every military art. <reg>but</reg> the men were listless, and, on purpose to discredit their commander, threw away the victory. <reg>there</reg> were more Samnites killed, more Romans wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> experienced general perceived what stood in the way of his success: he must qualify his native disposition, and mingle geniality with his sternness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>so</reg>, calling together his lieutenants, he made the round of his wounded soldiers in person, and putting his head into their tents and asking each how he was doing, he commended them by name to the care of the lieutenants, the tribunes, and the prefects.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> of itself was a popular thing to do, and Papirius managed it with such tact, that in healing their bodies he gained their affections much more rapidly; and indeed there was nothing that more promoted their recovery than the pleasurable feelings with which they accepted these attentions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>when</reg> the army was restored, he met the enemy, with no doubt as to the result, either on his own part or on that of his soldiers, and so routed and dispersed the Samnites that this was the last time they joined battle with the dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> victorious army then marched on where the prospect of booty beckoned them, and traversed the territories of the <pb id="p.143"/>enemy without encountering any armed resistance<note type="margin">B.C. 325</note> whatsoever, either face to face or from an ambush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> dictator had increased the alacrity of his troops by proclaiming that the booty should all be theirs, and private gain did as much as the public resentment to whet their zeal against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>discouraged</reg> by these reverses, the Samnites sought peace of Papirius, and agreed with him to give every soldier a garment and a year's pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>he</reg> directed them to go before the senate, but they replied that they would attend him thither, committing their cause wholly to his honour and integrity. <reg>so</reg> the army was withdrawn from Samnium.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<name>The</name> dictator, having entered the City<note type="margin">B.C. 324-323</note> in triumph, would have laid down his office, but was commanded by the senate first to hold a consular election; he announced that Gaius Sulpicius Longus had been chosen for the second time, together with Quintus Aemilius Cerretanus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> treaty was not completed, owing to a disagreement over terms, and the Samnites left the City with a truce for a year; nor did they scrupulously hold even to that; so encouraged were they to make war, on learning that Papirius had resigned.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><reg>in</reg> the consulship of Gaius Sulpicius and Quintus Aemilius &mdash;some annals have Aulius &mdash;the defection of the Samnites was followed by a new war with Apulia. <reg>armies</reg> were sent out in both directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> lots assigned the Samnites to Sulpicius, the Apulians to Aemilius. <reg>some</reg> say that the war was not waged against the Apulians, but in defence of some of the allies of that people whom the Samnites had wantonly invaded;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but the circumstances of the Samnites, who at that time could hardly ward off <pb id="p.145"/>invasion from themselves, render it more probable that<note type="margin">B.C. 324-333</note> they did not attack the Apulians but that they and the Apulians were at war with Rome simultaneously.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>there</reg> was, however, no memorable engagement. <name>The</name> Romans laid waste Apulia and Samnium, without encountering the enemy in either country.</p> 
				<p><reg>at</reg> Rome a nocturnal alarm awoke the sleeping citizens with such a fright that Capitol and Citadel, walls and gates, were crowded with armed men; and after all the hurrying to posts and crying <quote>to arms!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> in every quarter, day broke and discovered neither author nor occasion of the panic.</p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> the same year, the Tusculans were tried before the people in accordance with the Flavian rogation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Marcus</name> Flavius, a plebeian tribune, had proposed to the people that the Tusculans be punished for having lent their countenance and aid to the Veliterni and Privernates in their war with the Roman People.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> citizens of Tusculum, with their wives and children, came to Rome; and the great throng, putting on the sordid raiment of defendants, went about amongst the tribes and clasped the knees of the citizens in supplication.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>and</reg> so it happened that pity was more effective in gaining them remission of their punishment than were their arguments in clearing away the charges.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>all</reg> the tribes rejected the proposal, save only the Pollian, which voted that the grown men should be scourged and put to death, and their wives and children sold at auction under the laws of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>it</reg> seems that the resentment engendered in the Tusculans by so cruel a proposal lasted down to our fathers' time, and that a candidate of the Pollian tribe almost never got the vote of the Papirian.<note>The Tusculans, upon gaining Roman citizenship, were enrolled in the Papirian tribe, and were so numerous as to control its vote.</note></p> <pb id="p.147"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<reg>in</reg> the following year, when Quintus<note type="margin">B.C. 322</note> Fabius and Lucius Fulvius were consuls, the dread of a serious war with the Samnites &mdash;who were said to have gathered an army of mercenaries from neighbouring tribes &mdash;occasioned the appointment of Aulus Cornelius Arvina as dictator and Marcus Fabius Ambustus as master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>by</reg> a vigorous levy these men raised an excellent army, and marching against the Samnites, went into camp on hostile soil with as little regard to their position as if the enemy had been far away. <reg>suddenly</reg> the Samnite legions appeared, and advancing with great hardihood entrenched themselves close to the Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>night</reg> was now drawing on, which prevented them from assaulting the Roman works; but they made no secret of their intention to do so with the morrow's earliest light.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> dictator saw that the battle was coming sooner than he had anticipated, and feared that the courage of his men would be affected by their cramped position. <reg>so</reg>, leaving behind him numerous fires to deceive the enemy, he silently led the legions out. <reg>but</reg> the camps were so near each other that he could not elude their observation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>their</reg> cavalry at once pursued him, but though they hung upon the fringe of his column, they refrained from attacking until the day began to break; as for the infantry, they did not even leave their stockade before the dawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>finally</reg>, when it was light, the cavalry ventured to charge the Romans, and by harassing their rear and pressing them when they came to places that were difficult to cross, delayed their march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>meanwhile</reg> the foot had caught up with the horse, and the Samnites were throwing all their forces into the assault. <reg>then</reg> the <pb id="p.149"/>dictator, finding that he could make no headway<note type="margin">B.C. 322</note> without great distress, gave orders to lay out a camp on the very spot where he had halted. <reg>but</reg> enveloped, as they were, by the enemy's horse, it was impossible to gather stakes and begin the work.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><reg>and</reg> so, when he saw that he could neither advance nor encamp, he removed the baggage from his column and formed a line of battle. <name>The</name> enemy then formed up against him, being inferior neither in spirit nor in strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>their</reg> encouragement was due chiefly to ignorance that their enemies had retreated from an awkward position, and not from them; for they assumed that their own doughty appearance had driven the Romans before them in a panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>this</reg> held the fighting in balance for a while, though the Samnites had now for some time been unused to abide the battle &mdash;cry of a Roman army. <reg>indeed</reg> it is said that on that day from the third hour to the eighth the outcome was so much in doubt, that there was never a second cheer after that which was once given when the armies rushed together; nor were standards either moved forward or withdrawn; nor did the combatants anywhere give ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>facing</reg> each other with every man squarely in his place, they pressed forward with their shields and fought without stopping to breathe or to look behind. <name>The</name> monotonous din and changeless tenor of the battle made it seem probable that sheer exhaustion or the night would put an end to it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>and</reg> now men's strength was ebbing, and the sword was forgetting its keenness and the generals their strategy; &mdash;when the Samnite horsemen, learning from one of their squadrons that had pushed on ahead how the <pb id="p.151"/>baggage of the Romans lay remote from their fighting<note type="margin">B.C. 322</note> men, without defenders or a rampart to protect it, were seized with the lust of pillaging, and made a sudden dash for it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>but</reg> when a frightened messenger brought word of this to the dictator, he said, <quote><reg>only</reg> let them cumber themselves with spoil!</quote> <reg>after</reg> that came others and still others, crying aloud that the soldiers' possessions were being plundered and carried clean away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>then</reg> Cornelius called the master of the horse and said, <quote><reg>do</reg> you not see, Marcus Fabius, how the enemy's cavalry have ceased to fight?
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>they</reg> are caught fast and entangled in our baggage. <reg>have</reg> at them while they are dispersed, as any body of men will be in pillaging! <reg>you</reg> shall find few in the saddle, few sword in hand; while they are loading themselves and their horses with spoils, cut them down unarmed and make it a bloody booty for them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>i</reg> will see to the legions and the battle of the infantry; be yours the glory of the cavalry fight.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<name>The</name> cavalry, drawn up in the most perfect order, charged their scattered and embarrassed enemies and cut them down on every hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>they</reg> had hastily flung aside their packs &mdash;which lay all about and impeded the terrified horses as they tried to run away &mdash;and, powerless either to resist or to escape, were massacred where they stood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>then</reg> Marcus Fabius, having almost annihilated the enemy's cavalry, fetched a short compass with his squadrons and attacked from behind their line of infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> shouts that were now heard in that quarter struck terror into the hearts of the Samnites; and the dictator, seeing the men in their fighting line glance nervously behind them, and their standards <pb id="p.153"/>become disordered, and their line begin to waver,<note type="margin">B.C. 322</note> then cried out to his men, then urged them on, and called by name on tribunes and company &mdash;commanders to join him in a new attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>with</reg> a fresh cheer the ranks pressed forward, and at each advance perceived the Samnites to be more and more confused.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> horse themselves could now be seen by those in the van; and Cornelius, looking back on the maniples of soldiers, made them understand as best he could with hand and voice that he saw the banners and round shields of their comrades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>on</reg> hearing and at the same time seeing them, they straightway forgot the toil they had endured for well &mdash;nigh the entire day, and forgot their wounds, and, like troops who were but that moment fresh from camp and had received the battle &mdash;signal, they flung themselves upon the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> Samnites could support no longer the fury of the cavalry and the violent onset of the foot; some were slaughtered in the midst, others were scattered abroad in flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> foot &mdash;soldiers surrounded those who resisted and put them to the sword; the cavalry made havoc of the fugitives, amongst whom perished their general himself.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>this</reg> defeat, after all that had gone before, so broke the spirit of the Samnites, that in all their councils they began to murmur that it was no wonder if they met with no success in an impious war, undertaken in violation of a treaty,<note>That of <date value="-341">341 B.C.</date> <reg>see</reg> chap. ii &sect; 4, and (for the violation) chap. xxii. &sect; 7 and chap. xxiii. &sect; 1.</note> for the gods had even more right than men to be incensed with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>they</reg> would have to pay a heavy price to expiate this war and atone for it; the only question was, should they offer atonement with the blood of the guilty few or with that of the innocent <pb id="p.155"/>multitude? <reg>some</reg> ventured at this juncture to name<note type="margin">B.C. 333</note> those who had been responsible for the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>one</reg> name in particular could be distinguished; for all agreed in denouncing Papius Brutulus, a powerful noble who had without question been the breaker of the latest truce.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> praetors were compelled to refer his case to the council, which decreed that Papius Brutulus should be surrendered to the Romans, and that all the Roman booty and all the prisoners should be sent with him to Rome; and further, that all the property which the fetials had sought to recover under the provisions of the treaty should be restored in compliance with law and with religion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> fetials proceeded to Rome, in accordance with this resolution, taking with them the lifeless body of Brutulus, who had escaped the humiliation and punishment by a voluntary death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>it</reg> was voted to surrender his goods also with his body. <reg>but</reg> of all these things the Romans would accept none but the prisoners and such articles of booty as they recognized as theirs; the surrender of all the rest was of no effect.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Romans would not accept the tardy compliance of the Samnites with the old terms, being resolved to impose harder ones.</note> <name>The</name> dictator triumphed by resolution of the senate.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<reg>some</reg> writers hold that this war was waged by the consuls, and that it was they who triumphed over the Samnites; they say that Fabius even advanced into Apulia and thence drove off much booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>but</reg> that Aulus Cornelius was dictator in that year is not disputed, and the doubt is only whether he was appointed to administer the war, or in order that there might be somebody to give the signal to the chariots at the Roman Games<note>Instituted by Tarquinius Priscus (I. xxxv. 9).</note> &mdash;since

					<reg>having</reg> pronounced these words, as prophetic as they were encouraging, he led his army out and encamped with all possible secrecy in the vicinity of Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>thence</reg> he dispatched in the direction of Calatia, where he heard that the Roman consuls were already in camp, ten soldiers in the guise of shepherds, with orders to graze their flocks &mdash;dispersed one here another there &mdash;at no great distance from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>on</reg> encountering pillagers, they were all to tell one story; namely, that the Samnite levies were in Apulia, where they were laying siege with all their forces to Luceria, and were on the <pb id="p.167"/>point of taking it by assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>this</reg> rumour, which<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> had designedly been given out before, had already come to the ears of the Romans, but the prisoners strengthened their belief in it, especially since they all gave the same account.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Romans did not hesitate about helping the Lucerini, their good and faithful allies, and preventing Apulia at the same time from a general defection in the face of instant peril: the only subject of deliberation was by what route they should march.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>there</reg> were two roads to Luceria. <reg>one</reg> skirted the Adriatic, and though open and unobstructed, was long almost in proportion to its safety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> other led through the Caudine Forks, and was shorter, but this is the nature of the place: two deep defiles, narrow and wooded, are connected by an unbroken range of mountains on either hand; shut in between them lies a rather extensive plain, grassy and well &mdash;watered, with the road running through the middle of it;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but before you come to it, you must enter the first defile, and afterwards either retrace the steps by which you made your way into the place, or else &mdash;should you go forward &mdash;pass out by another ravine, which is even narrower and more difficult.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>into</reg> this plain the Romans debouched from the rocky gorge of one of the two passes; and advancing forthwith to the other pass, found it blocked with a barrier of felled trees and huge boulders. <name>The</name> enemy's stratagem now stood revealed, and indeed a body of troops was descried at the head of the defile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> Romans thereupon hastened back to regain the road by which they had come, but found that this was likewise closed with its own <pb id="p.169"/>barricade and armed men. <reg>at</reg> this they came to a<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> halt, without any command, and a stupor came over the minds of all, and a strange kind of numbness over their bodies; and looking at one another &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> every man supposed his neighbour more capable of thinking and planning than himself &mdash;they stood for a long time motionless and silent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>afterwards</reg>, when they saw the tents of the consuls going up and some of the men getting out entrenching tools, although they perceived that in their desperate plight, deprived of every hope, it would be ridiculous for them to entrench

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> meanwhile not only did their enemies insolently scoff at them, but they jested themselves, with pathetic candour, at the futility of their works and the pains they took.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <name>The</name> dejected consuls did not even call a council, for the situation admitted neither of discussion nor of help, but the lieutenants and tribunes assembled of their own accord, and the soldiers, turning to the headquarters tent, called on their generals for help, which the immortal gods could scarce have given them.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>with</reg> such &mdash;like exchange of talk the night wore on, neither was there any thought of food or sleep.</p> 
				<p><reg>even</reg> the Samnites were at a loss what course to follow in such happy circumstances; and accordingly they agreed unanimously to dispatch a letter to Herennius Pontius, the father of their general, asking his advice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> man, bowed down with years, had already withdrawn not only from military but even from civic duties; yet, despite his bodily infirmity, his mind and judgment retained their vigour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>when</reg> he learned that the Roman armies had been hemmed in between two defiles at the Caudine Forks, and was asked by his son's messenger for his opinion, he advised that they should all be dismissed unscathed, at the earliest possible moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> policy having been rejected, and the messenger returning a second time to seek his counsel, he recommended that all, to the last man, be slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>having</reg> received these answers, as inconsistent as the riddling responses of an oracle, the younger Pontius was among the first to conclude that his father's mind had now given way along with his failing body, but yielded to the general desire and sent for him to advise with them in person.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> old man made no objection; he was <pb id="p.173"/>brought to the camp in a waggon &mdash;so the story<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> runs &mdash;and being invited to join the council of war, spoke to such purpose as merely, without changing his opinion, to add thereto his reasons: If, he said, they adopted his first proposal &mdash;which
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> he held to be the best &mdash;they would establish lasting peace and friendship with a very powerful people by conferring an enormous benefit upon them; by adopting the other plan they would postpone the war for many generations, in which time the Roman State, having lost two armies, would not easily regain its strength; there was no third plan.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>when</reg> his son and the other leading men pressed him to say what would happen if they took a middle course, and while letting them go unhurt imposed terms upon them by the rights of war, as upon the vanquished, <quote><reg>that</reg>,</quote> he answered, <quote>is in sooth a policy that neither wins men friends nor rids them of their enemies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>spare</reg>, if you will, those whom you have stung to anger with humiliation; the Roman race is one that knows not how to be still under defeat.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>whatever</reg> shame you brand them with in their present necessity, the wound will ever rankle in their bosoms, nor will it suffer them to rest until they have exacted many times as heavy a penalty of you.</quote> <reg>neither</reg> proposal was accepted, and Herennius was carried home from the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<reg>in</reg> the other camp the Romans, finding themselves now, after many fruitless efforts to break out, in want of everything, were reduced to the necessity of sending envoys;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> who were first to treat for an equal peace, and, if peace could not be had, to provoke the enemy to fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>to</reg> them Pontius made answer, that the war was <pb id="p.175"/>already fought and won; and since they knew<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> not how to admit their plight, even when beaten and made prisoners, he intended to send them unarmed and with a single garment each under the yoke;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> in all else the peace should be one of equal terms to the vanquished and the victors; for if the Romans would evacuate the Samnite territory and withdraw their colonies, Romans and Samnites should thenceforward live by their own laws in an equal alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>on</reg> these terms he was ready to conclude a treaty with the consuls; if they were any of them unacceptable, he forbade the envoys to return to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>when</reg> the upshot of this embassy was made known to the Romans, they all straightway fell to groaning, and so overcome were they with sorrow that it seemed as though they

						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> ' But surrender is shameful and humiliating.' <reg>true</reg>, but our country is so dear that we would save it by enduring shame, as we would, if need were, by our death.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> terms. <reg>a</reg> time was then set for the delivery of the hostages and the dismissal of the army without their arms.</p> 
				<p><reg>fresh</reg> lamentations broke out in the camp when the consuls returned; and the men could hardly keep from laying violent hands on those through whose rashness they had been led into that place, and through whose cowardice they were now to depart more shamefully than they had
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> come. <reg>they</reg> bethought them how they had been unprovided either with guides or with patrols, but had been driven blindly, like wild beasts, into a
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> trap. <reg>they</reg> looked at one another; they gazed on the arms that they must presently surrender, on the right hands that would be helpless and the bodies that would be at the mercy of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> foe. <reg>they</reg> pictured to their mind's eye the hostile yoke, the victor's taunts, <pb id="p.181"/>and fleering countenance; and how they must pass<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> unarmed between the ranks of their armed enemies, and then wend their wretched way, a pitiful band, through the cities of their allies; and finally the return to their own city and their parents, whither they themselves and their ancestors had often returned in
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> triumph. <reg>they</reg> alone had been defeated without a wound, without a weapon, without a battle; to them it had not been granted to draw the sword, nor to join in combat with the enemy; on them in vain had arms, in vain had strength, in vain had bravery been
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> bestowed.</p> 
				<p><reg>as</reg> they uttered these complaints, the fateful hour of their humiliation came, an hour destined to transcend all anticipations in the bitterness of its
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> reality. <reg>to</reg> begin with, they were ordered to pass outside the rampart, clad in their tunics and unarmed, and the hostages were at once handed over and led off into
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> custody. <reg>next</reg>, the lictors were commanded to forsake the consuls, who then were stripped of their generals' cloaks, &mdash;a thing which inspired such compassion in those very men who a little while before had cursed them and had declared that they deserved
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> to be given up and put to torture, that every man, forgetting his own evil case, averted his eyes from that degradation of so majestic an office, as from a spectacle of horror.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<reg>first</reg> the consuls, little better than half &mdash;naked, were sent under the yoke, then their subordinates were humbled, each in the order of his rank; and then, one after another, the several legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> enemy under arms stood on either side, reviling them and mocking them; many they actually threatened with the sword, and some, whose <pb id="p.183"/>resentment of the outrage showing too plainly in their<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> faces gave their conquerors offence, they wounded or slew outright.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><reg>thus</reg> they were sent under the yoke, and, what was almost harder to bear, while their enemies looked on. <reg>on</reg> emerging from the pass, although they seemed like men raised from the dead, who beheld for the first time the light of day, yet the very light itself, which allowed them to see that dismal throng, was gloomier than any death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>and</reg> so, although it was in their power to have made Capua before nightfall, yet, questioning the loyalty of their allies, and withheld also by shame, they threw themselves upon the ground along the roadside, not far from the city, with nothing to supply their wants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>when</reg> tidings of this were brought to Capua, a feeling of pity, natural to allies, overcame the ingrained arrogance of the Campanians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>ungrudgingly</reg>, without an instant's hesitation, they dispatched the insignia of their office to the consuls, together with arms, horses, clothing, and provisions, for the men;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and as they drew near Capua, the whole senate and people going forth to meet them used towards them all the rites of hospitality and every public and private courtesy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>yet</reg> the kindness of their allies and their friendly looks and words were so far from drawing the Romans into talk that they could not even be got to raise their eyes or look their friends and comforters in the face;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> so constrained were they by a kind of humiliation &mdash;over and above their grief &mdash;to
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> avoid the speech and assemblages of men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><reg>on</reg> the following day, when the young nobles sent from Capua to attend them to the borders of Campania had returned, and were called into the <pb id="p.185"/>senatehouse and questioned by the elders, they reported<note type="margin">B.C. 321</note> that they had seemed to be much more sorrowful and dejected than before: their column had marched on in silence and almost as though dumb;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the old Roman spirit was quite dashed; they had lost their courage with their arms; being saluted, they returned not the salutation; they responded to no questions; not a man of them had been able to open his mouth for shame, as if they still bore on their necks the yoke under which they had been sent;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the Samnites had won not only a famous but a lasting victory, for they had conquered, not Rome &mdash;as the Gauls had done before &mdash;but a thing which demanded far greater prowess &mdash;the Roman valour and independence. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<reg>such</reg> were the opinions that were spoken<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> and listened to, and the Roman name had well &mdash;nigh
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> been given up for lost in the council of Rome's faithful allies, when Aulus Calavius, son of Ovius, a man of famous birth and achievements and at that time venerable also for his age, asserted that the case was very different:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that obstinate silence, those eyes fixed on the ground and ears deaf to every consolation, that shame at looking on the light, were signs, he argued, of bosoms bursting with passionate resentment;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> either he knew nothing of the Roman character, or that silence was destined ere long to draw from the Samnites cries and groans of anguish, and the Caudine Peace to become a far more bitter memory to Samnites than to Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for each people would have its own native spirit wherever they might encounter, but the Samnites would not everywhere have a Caudine Pass.</p> 
				<p><reg>by</reg> this time Rome, too, had heard of her shameful <pb id="p.187"/>calamity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> first news was that the army was<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> entrapped; then came a gloomier report, more by reason of the disgraceful peace than because of the peril.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>on</reg> the rumour of a blockade they had begun to hold a levy; but they afterwards gave over their measures for relief, when they learned that there had been so infamous a capitulation, and immediately, without official sanction of any sort, betook themselves with one mind to every form of mourning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> booths round about the Forum were shut up, and ere proclamation could be made, all business was suspended; tunics with the broad stripe of purple were discarded, as were golden rings.<note>The <hi rend="italics">latus clavus,</hi> a broad (purple) stripe in the tunic, marked the senator. <reg>both</reg> senators and knights wore golden rings, though these later became the distinguishing badge of the knights.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> citizens were almost more dejected than the army; and not only were they enraged against their generals and those who had favoured and guaranteed the peace, but they even visited their hate upon the innocent soldiers and proposed to exclude them from the City and from their homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>but</reg> this flurry of resentment was dispelled by the arrival of the army, which even angry men could not but pity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>for</reg> they came not like men returning in safety to their homes, after all hope of them had been abandoned; but entering the City late in the day, with the bearing and looks of prisoners, they slipped away every man to his own house, and on the next and the succeeding days not one of them would look into the Forum or the streets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> consuls shut themselves up in their houses and would transact no public business, except that they were forced by a senatorial decree to name a dictator to preside at the election.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>they</reg> designated Quintus Fabius Ambustus, with Publius Aelius Paetus to be master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>a</reg> flaw in their appointment occasioned the substitution in their <pb id="p.189"/>room of Marcus Aemilius Papus, as dictator, and<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> Lucius Valerius Flaccus, as master of the horse. <reg>however</reg>, even they did not hold an election; and because the people were dissatisfied with all the magistrates of that year, the state reverted to an interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <name>The</name> interreges were Quintus Fabius Maximus and Marcus Valerius Corvus. <name>The</name> latter announced the election to the consulship of Quintus Publilius Philo (for the third time) and Lucius Papirius Cursor (for the second) with the unmistakable approval of the citizens, for there were at that time no leaders more distinguished.</p>

						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>my</reg> motion will bear witness whether it was myself or your legions that I spared, when I bound myself by a base, or, perhaps, <pb id="p.191"/>a necessary pledge, &mdash;by which, however, the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> People is not held, since it was given without the people's authorization; nor by its terms is aught but our own persons due to the Samnites.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>let</reg> us be given up, I propose, by the fetials, stripped and bound; let us release the people from their religious obligation, if in any such we have involved them, that no obstacle, divine or human, may block the way to a just and righteous renewal of the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>meantime</reg> I move that the consuls enroll an army and arm it and lead it forth, yet without crossing the borders of the enemy, until all the ceremonies incident to our surrender shall have been completed.

					<reg>then</reg> said Postumius: "<reg>meanwhile</reg>, surrender us, who are unconsecrate, as you may do without offence to Heaven;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> afterwards you shall surrender also those sacrosanct ones, when once they have retired from their magistracy; but, if you should listen to me, before surrendering them you would have them scourged here in the Comitium, that they might receive in advance this extra punishment, by way of interest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>for</reg> when they deny that the people can be freed of their obligation by surrendering us, who is so unacquainted with the fetial law as not to be aware that they say this, more that they may not be surrendered than because the case is so?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>and</reg> yet, Conscript Fathers, I do not dispute the fact that guarantees as well as treaties are sacred in the eyes of those who cherish honour among men on an equal footing with obligations due to the gods; but I deny that without the people's authorization any sanction can be given which shall be binding on the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>what</reg>! If the Samnites with that same arrogance with which they extorted this capitulation from us had <pb id="p.195"/>compelled us to pronounce the solemn form of words<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> of those who surrender cities, would you tribunes assert that the Roman People had been surrendered, and that this City, with its temples, its holy places, its bounds and waters, was become the property of the Samnites?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>but</reg> enough of <hi rend="italics">surrender;</hi> we are talking of a <hi rend="italics">guarantee.</hi> <reg>how</reg>, pray, if we had guaranteed that the Roman People should forsake this City? that they should burn it?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that it should cease to have magistrates, a senate, laws? that it should be subject to the rule of kings? ' The gods forbid!' you say. <reg>and</reg> yet the unworthiness of the conditions cannot lessen the force of a guarantee; if there is anything for which the people can be bound, it can be bound for everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>nor</reg> does it matter, either, as some are perhaps inclined to think, whether consul or dictator or praetor have given the guarantee. <reg>and</reg> this the very Samnites themselves deemed to be true, for not content with the guarantee of consuls, they obliged the lieutenants, the quaestors, and the tribunes of the soldiers to add theirs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><quote><reg>and</reg> let no man now demand of me why I gave this guarantee, seeing that a consul has no right so to do and that I could not pledge them a peace which was not

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>there</reg> was nothing done at Caudium, Conscript Fathers, by man's wisdom: the immortal gods deprived of understanding both your commanders and the enemy's. We, on our part, took no sufficient precautions in the war: while, as for them, they threw away their ill &mdash;got victory by their ill &mdash;guided conduct, for they hardly trusted the very ground that had given them <pb id="p.197"/>their conquest, in their haste to deprive of arms, on<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> any terms, men born to the use of arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>why</reg>, had they had their wits about them, would it have been hard, while summoning old men from home for consultation, to dispatch envoys to Rome?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> to treat with senate and with people for a peace and covenant? <reg>it</reg> was only three days' journey to those who travel light; meantime hostilities would have been suspended, until their envoys should return from Rome with either certain victory or a peace.<note>Victory, in case the Roman People declined to accept terms for the ransom of their army; peace, if they acceded to those terms.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>then</reg>, and then only, would there have been a guarantee in which our pledge was backed by the mandate of the people. <reg>but</reg> neither would you have voted one, nor should we have given it;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> nor was it Heaven's will that the affair should have any other ending, but that they should be beguiled with a dream too joyful for their comprehension, and that our army should be extricated by the same fortune which had entrapped it; that their idle victory should evaporate in a yet idler peace, and a guarantee be proffered that should bind none but the guarantor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>for</reg> what negotiation, Conscript Fathers, has there been with you or with the Roman People? <reg>who</reg> can appeal to you, who can say that he has been deceived by you? <reg>can</reg> the enemy, can a fellow &mdash;citizen?

					<reg>both</reg> the cause itself and the speaker greatly stirred the Conscript Fathers and the others present, including even the tribunes of the plebs, who declared that they would obey the senate, and having forthwith

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>before</reg> them went the fetials, who, when they had come to the gate, bade the guarantors of peace be stripped and their hands be bound behind their backs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>as</reg> the officer, awed by the dignity of Postumius, would have left him loosely <pb id="p.201"/>bound, <quote><reg>nay</reg>, draw the thong tight,</quote> he exclaimed,<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> <quote>that the surrender may be duly carried out.</quote> <reg>then</reg>, on arriving at the assembly of the Samnites and the tribune of Pontius, Aulus Cornelius Arvina the fetial<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">pater patratus,</hi> see i. xxiv. 6.</note> spoke as follows:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> "<reg>whereas</reg> these men, unbidden by the Roman People of the Quirites, have guaranteed that a treaty should be ratified, and by so doing have committed an injury; to the end that the Roman People may be absolved of heinous guilt, I deliver up these men to you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>as</reg> the fetial spoke these words, Postumius thrust his knee into the other's thigh, with all the force he could summon up, and proclaimed in a loud voice that he was a Samnite citizen, who had maltreated the envoy in violation of the law of nations, whereby the Romans would make war with the better right.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<reg>then</reg> said Pontius, "I will not receive this surrender, nor will the Samnites hold it valid.

					<name>The</name> Samnites now perceived that instead of their domineering peace they were confronted with the renewal of a most bitter war, and not only imagined but almost saw all the consequences which afterwards proceeded from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>too</reg> late and all in vain did they praise the alternative policies suggested by the aged Pontius, between which they had fallen, and exchanged a victory already in their possession for an uncertain peace; they had let slip the opportunity both of doing good and of doing harm, and were going to fight with men whom they might permanently have removed from their path, as enemies, or have made their permanent friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>and</reg> though there had so far been no battle since the Caudine Peace to give an advantage to either side, yet such a change of feeling had come about that Postumius enjoyed more fame among the Romans for his surrender than did Pontius among the Samnites for his bloodless victory;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and while the Romans regarded their being able to make war as certain victory, the Samnites felt that the Romans had at one and the same moment renewed the war and won it.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><pb id="p.207"/>
				<p><reg>meanwhile</reg> the Satricans revolted to the Samnites,<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> and the colony of Fregellae, in a surprise attack by the Samnites &mdash;accompanied, it would seem, by people from Satricum &mdash;was seized during the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>mutual</reg> fear then caused both sides to remain quiet until the morning, when the light ushered in a battle which for a long time was equally sustained &mdash;for the townsfolk were fighting for their hearths and altars and a throng of those unfit for arms gave them assistance from the housetops, &mdash;still,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the people of Fregellae held their own, until presently a ruse decided the victory; for they permitted a herald to be heard, who promised safety to any who laid down his arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> hope of this relaxed the tension of their courage and on every side they began throwing their arms away. <name>The</name> more determined portion of them retained their weapons and burst out by the opposite gate, and their boldness stood them in better stead than did their too credulous timidity the others; for these the Samnites compassed about with fire, and, despite their appeals to Heaven and to the promise of their captors, burnt them alive.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><name>The</name> consuls having divided the provinces between them, Papirius took his way into Apulia towards Luceria, where the Roman knights given up at Caudium for hostages were being guarded, while Publilius stopped behind in Samnium to oppose the Caudine legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>this</reg> plan distracted the minds of the Samnites, since they neither dared move towards Luceria, lest they should bring the enemy down upon their rear, nor remain where they were, for fear that Luceria would meanwhile be lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> best course seemed to be to entrust their cause to <pb id="p.209"/>Fortune and fight it out with Publilius. <reg>they</reg><note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> accordingly formed up in line of battle.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<name>Publilius</name> the consul was ready to engage them, but thinking it best to encourage his soldiers first, he bade summon them to an assembly. <reg>but</reg> though they came running to the praetorium with vast alacrity, yet the outcry of those who demanded battle was so loud that the general's exhortation could not be heard; still, every man's own heart, remembering the late humiliation, was there to exhort him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>so</reg> they went forward into battle, urging on their standard &mdash;bearers; and, that there might be no delay in coming to grips while they were discharging their javelins and drawing their swords, they threw away their javelins, as if a signal had been given them, and, sword
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> in hand, pushed forward at the double against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>no</reg> tactical skill was there employed in ranging centuries or reserves: the wrath of the soldiers swept everything along in its mad rush. <reg>and</reg> so not only were the Samnites routed, but not daring to interrupt their flight even at their camp, they dispersed and struck out for Apulia; yet they afterwards rallied again and came to Luceria in one body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> same fury that took the Romans through their enemy's battle &mdash;line, carried them also into his camp. <reg>there</reg> was more bloodshed and carnage there than in the battle, and the greater part of the booty was destroyed in anger.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><name>The</name> other army, under the consul Papirius, marching along the coast as far as Arpi, had found all peaceably disposed, more because of the wrongs done by the Samnites and the hatred they had engendered than owing to any favour shown by the <pb id="p.211"/>Roman People.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>for</reg> the Samnites, who in those<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> days dwelt in villages among the mountains, used to ravage the regions of the plain and coast, despising their cultivators, who were of a softer character, and one that &mdash;as often happens &mdash;resembled their country, while they themselves were rude highlanders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>if</reg> this district had been faithful to the Samnites, it would either have been impossible for a Roman army to have got as far as Arpi, or the utterly barren nature of the intervening country would have destroyed them, cut off as they would have been from their supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>even</reg> as it was, when they had proceeded to the vicinity of Luceria, besiegers and besieged suffered alike from scarcity of food: everything was carried up from Arpi for the Romans, but so precarious were their supplies, that while the foot &mdash;soldiers were busy with outpost &mdash;duty, guard &mdash;mounting,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and entrenching, the cavalry brought up corn for them from Arpi in leather pouches, and, now and then, encountering the enemy, were forced to throw off the corn from their horses and fight; the besieged, until the arrival of the other consul with his victorious army, had got in their provisions &mdash;and auxiliary forces too &mdash;from the mountains of the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> coming of Publilius tightened up the lines; for, turning the siege over to his colleague, he was free to range the country &mdash;side, where he made things difficult for the supply &mdash;trains of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> Samnites, therefore, who were encamped about Luceria, in despair of being able to endure the scarcity, if the siege continued, were obliged to gather up their forces from every quarter and give battle to Papirius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<reg>at</reg> this juncture, while both sides were <pb id="p.213"/>making ready for the struggle, came ambassadors<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> from Tarentum, admonishing both Samnites and Romans to desist from war. <reg>whichever</reg> party should oppose the cessation of hostilities, against that they proposed to fight in behalf of the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>after</reg> listening to these envoys, Papirius, as though moved by what they said, replied that he would consult his colleague. <reg>having</reg> sent for Publilius, he employed every moment of the interval in making his preparations, and when he had conferred with him about a matter which admitted of no doubt, displayed the battle &mdash;signal.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a red flag hung out in front of the general's tent.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> consuls were busy with matters pertaining to gods and to men, as they are wont to to be on the eve of an engagement, when the envoys from Tarentum approached them to receive their answer;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> to whom Papirius replied, <quote><name>Tarentines</name>, the keeper of the chickens reports that the signs are favourable; the sacrifice too has been exceedingly auspicious;<note>Two kinds of divination are alluded to: (1) by observing the feeding of the sacred chickens, (2) by inspecting the entrails of a victim.</note> as you see, the gods are with us at our going into action.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>he</reg> then commanded to advance the standards, and marshalled his troops, with exclamations on the folly of a nation which, powerless to manage its own affairs, because of domestic strife and discord, presumed to lay down the limits of peace and war for others.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><name>The</name> Samnites, on their side, having dismissed from their minds every anxiety regarding the war, either because they sincerely wished for peace, or because it was expedient for them to pretend that they wished it, in order to gain the support of the Tarentines, when they beheld
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the Romans suddenly arrayed for battle, cried out that they would abide by the will of the Tarentines and would neither take the field nor advance beyond the rampart;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> they had <pb id="p.215"/>been deceived, but they chose rather to endure<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> whatever Fortune might have in store for them than be thought to have spurned the peaceful advice of the Tarentines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> consuls declared that they embraced the omen,<note>The omen lay in the Samnites' expressed purpose to offer no resistance.</note> praying that the enemy might be so minded as not even to defend his rampart. <reg>they</reg> themselves, dividing their troops between them, marched up to the earthworks of the Samnites, and attacked them at once from every side. <reg>some</reg> began to fill the trenches, others to pull up the palings and fling them into the trenches; besides their native courage they were goaded on by anger at the disgrace that rankled in their hearts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>forcing</reg> their way into the camp, while every man repeated that here were no Forks, no Caudium, no trackless passes, where guile had arrogantly triumphed over error, but Roman manhood, which neither rampart nor trenches could keep out, they cut down without distinction those who resisted and those who fled, the armed and the unarmed, slaves and
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> freemen, adults and children, men and beasts;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> nor would anything living have survived, had not the consuls bade sound the recall and expelled the bloodthirsty soldiers from the enemy's camp with commands and threats.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> men were incensed at the interruption of their sweet revenge, and accordingly the consuls at once addressed them and explained that they had neither yielded nor meant to yield to any of the soldiers in hatred of the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> on the contrary, they would have led the way, as in war, so in the exaction of endless vengeance, had their indignation not been checked by thoughts of the six hundred knights who were being held as hostages in Luceria;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> but they feared that the enemy, if they despaired of <pb id="p.217"/>quarter, might be driven blindly to put their<note type="margin">B.C. 320</note> prisoners to death, choosing to slay before they were slain themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <name>These</name> arguments the men applauded, and rejoiced that their wrath had been restrained; they confessed that it was better that they should suffer anything than betray the lives of so many distinguished young Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<name>The</name> assembly was dismissed, and a council of<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> war was held to determine whether they should press the siege with all their forces, or should employ one army and its general to test the dispositions of the Apulians around them &mdash;a people whose sympathies were still in doubt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> consul Publilius set out on a march through Apulia and in a single expedition either subjugated, or by granting terms, received into alliance, a goodly number of states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>Papirius</name>, too, who had remained behind at Luceria to conduct the siege, soon found the outcome answerable to his hopes; for all the roads by which supplies were wont to be brought in from Samnium were blocked, and the Samnite garrison were reduced by hunger to send a deputation to the Roman consul with an offer to release the horsemen who were the cause of the war, on condition that he would raise the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Papirius</name> replied that they ought to have gone to Pontius, the son of Herennius, at whose instance they had sent the Romans under the yoke, to find out what the vanquished deserved to suffer;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> however, since they preferred that their enemies should decide on a just penalty for them, rather than propose one for themselves, he bade them take word to Luceria that they should leave their arms, packs, sumpter animals, and all the noncombatants, within the walls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the soldiers he <pb id="p.219"/>intended to send under the yoke, clad only in their<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> tunics, inflicting on them no new disgrace, but requiting that which had first been put upon the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>they</reg> made no objection, and seven thousand men were sent under the yoke. <reg>huge</reg> spoils were captured in Luceria, and all the standards and arms which had been lost at Caudium were retaken, and, to cap the climax of their joy, the horsemen were recovered whom the Samnites had assigned, as pledges of peace, to be guarded at Luceria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>there</reg> is scarce any other Roman victory more glorious for its sudden reversal of fortune, especially if it is true, as I find in certain annals, that Pontius the son of Herennius, the Samnite general &mdash;in &mdash;chief, was sent with the rest under the yoke, to expiate the humiliation of the consuls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>be</reg> that as it may, I am not greatly surprised that there should be some doubt as to the general of the enemy who was surrendered and disgraced; the amazing thing is the uncertainty whether it was Lucius Cornelius, as dictator &mdash;with Lucius Papirius Cursor, as master of the horse &mdash;who
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> won these victories at Caudium and subsequently at Luceria, and, because of the signal vengeance that he exacted for Rome's shame, enjoyed a triumph which I should be inclined to rate as the best &mdash;deserved of all down to that time, next after that of Furius Camillus; or whether that honour belongs to the consuls &mdash;and particularly to Papirius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>this</reg> doubt is attended with another &mdash;whether at the ensuing election Papirius Cursor was retained in office in recognition of his victory at Luceria, being returned for a third time to the consulship, together with Quintus Aulius Cerretanus &mdash;then chosen for the second time &mdash;or <pb id="p.221"/>whether it was Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, and the<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> mistake was a matter of the surname.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<reg>it</reg> is agreed that from this point onwards the war was brought to a conclusion by the consuls. <name>Aulius</name> finished in one successful battle the campaign against the Ferentani,<note>Their town has been conjecturally identified with Horace's <quote>low &mdash;lying Forentum,</quote> <hi rend="italics"><reg>odes</reg>,</hi> III. iv. 16.</note> and having exacted hostages, received the surrender of the city itself, in which their defeated army had taken
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> refuge. <reg>with</reg> no less good fortune the other consul overcame the Satricans, who &mdash;though Roman citizens &mdash;had revolted, after the Caudine misfortune, to the Samnites, of whom they had admitted a garrison into their

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> assault. <reg>and</reg> so the envoys persisted in demanding of the consul how he supposed that they, being few and weak, could force so strong and well &mdash;armed a
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> garrison. <reg>but</reg> he bade them seek advice from those same men at whose instigation they had received the garrison into their city; and after they had with no small difficulty persuaded him to suffer them to consult their senate in the matter and report to him its decision, they went back to their
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> people. <reg>two</reg> factions kept the senate divided: one of these had for leaders the men who had inspired the revolt from Rome, the other was composed of loyal citizens; both, however, were equally anxious to accommodate the consul, so that they might be granted
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> peace. <reg>one</reg> party, seeing that the Samnite garrison was <pb id="p.223"/>intending to escape on the following night &mdash;for they had<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> made no preparations for enduring a siege &mdash;deemed it sufficient to let the consul know at what hour and by what gate the enemy meant to leave, and what road he planned to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> take. <name>The</name> others, who had opposed going over to the Samnites, that same night also opened a gate to the consul, and without letting the Samnites know, admitted his soldiers into the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> city. <reg>in</reg> consequence of this double betrayal, the Samnite garrison was surprised and overpowered by an ambush laid in the woods about their road, while a shout went up in the city, which was filled with enemies. <reg>thus</reg>, in one crowded hour, the Samnites were slain and the Satricans captured, and all things brought under the power of the consul; who conducted an investigation, and, having ascertained who were responsible for the defection, had the guilty parties scourged and

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><reg>it</reg> appears that in war the factors of chief importance are the numbers and valour of the soldiers, the abilities of the commanders, and Fortune, which, powerful in all the affairs of men, is especially so in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>These</name> factors, whether viewed separately or conjointly, afford a ready assurance, that, even as against other princes and nations, so also against this one the might of Rome would have proved invincible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>first</reg> of all &mdash;to begin by comparing commanders &mdash;I do not deny that Alexander was a remarkable general; still, his fame was enhanced by the fact that he was a sole commander, and the further fact that he died young, in the flood &mdash;tide of success, when as yet he had experienced no other lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>not</reg> to speak of other distinguished kings and generals, illustrious proofs of human vicissitude, what else was it but length of days that exposed Cyrus, whom the Greeks exalt so high in their panegyrics, to the fickleness of Fortune?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>and</reg> the same thing was lately seen in the case of Pompey the Great. <reg>need</reg> I repeat the names of the Roman generals, not all nor of every age, but those very ones with whom, as consuls or as dictators, Alexander would have had to fight &mdash;Marcus
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Valerius Corvus, Gaius Marcius Rutulus, Gaius Sulpicius, Titus Manlius Torquatus, Quintus Publilius Philo, Lucius Papirius Cursor, Quintus Fabius Maximus, <pb id="p.229"/>the two Decii, Lucius Volumnius, Manius Curius?<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>after</reg> these come some extraordinary men, if he had turned his attention to war with Carthage first and later with Rome, and had crossed into Italy when somewhat old.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>any</reg> one of these was as highly endowed with courage and talents as was Alexander; and military training, handed down from the very beginning of the City, had taken on the character of a profession, built up on comprehensive principles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>so</reg> the kings had warred; so after them the expellers of the kings, the Junii and the Valerii, and so in succession the Fabii, Quinctii, Cornelii, and Furius Camillus, whom in his old age those had seen, as youths, who would have had to fight with Alexander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>but</reg> in the performance of a soldier's work in battle &mdash;for which Alexander was no less distinguished &mdash;Manlius Torquatus or Valerius Corvus would, forsooth, have yielded to him, had they met him in a hand &mdash;to &mdash;hand encounter, famous though they were as soldiers before ever they won renown as captains!
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> Decii, of course, would have yielded to him, who hurled their devoted bodies upon the foe! <name>Papirius</name> Cursor would have yielded, with that wondrous strength of body and of spirit!
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> counsels of a single youth would no doubt have got the better of that senate &mdash;not to speak of individual members &mdash;which was called an assembly of kings by him who before all others had a true conception of the Roman Senate!<note>Cineas, the ambassador of King Pyrrhus. <hi rend="italics"><reg>cf</reg>.</hi> <reg>plut</reg>. <hi rend="italics"><name>Pyrrhus</name>,</hi> xix.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>and</reg> I suppose there was the danger that Alexander would display more skill than any of these whom I have named, in selecting a place for a camp, in organizing his service of supply, in guarding against ambuscades, in choosing a time for battle, in <pb id="p.231"/>marshalling his troops, in providing strong reserves!<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>far</reg> different from India, through which he progressed at the head of a rout of drunken revellers, would Italy have appeared to him, as he gazed on the passes of Apulia and the Lucanian mountains, and the still fresh traces of that family disaster wherein his uncle, King Alexander of Epirus, had lost his life.<note>VIII. xxiv.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<reg>and</reg> we are speaking of an Alexander not yet overwhelmed with prosperity, which none has ever been less able to bear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> viewing him in the light of his new fortune and of the new character &mdash;if I may use the expression &mdash;which
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> he had assumed as conqueror, he would evidently have come to Italy more like Darius than like Alexander, at the head of an army that had forgotten Macedonia and was already adopting the degenerate customs of the Persians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>i</reg> am loath, in writing of so great a prince, to remind the reader of the ostentatious alteration in his dress, and of his desire that men should prostrate themselves in adulation, a thing which even conquered Macedonians would have found oppressive, much more then those who had been victorious;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> of his cruel punishments and the murder of his friends as they drank and feasted; of the boastful lie about his origin.<note>Philotas was examined under torture and confessed participation in a plot against Alexander's life. <reg>he</reg> implicated also his father Parmenio, the general, and both were executed. <reg>clitus</reg>, who had saved Alexander's life at the Granicus, was killed by him at a banquet in a fit of drunken rage. <name>The</name> last clause alludes to Alexander's claim that Zeus, not Philip, was his father.</note> <reg>what</reg> if his love of wine had <pb id="p.233"/>every day grown stronger? and his truculent and<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> fiery anger?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>i</reg> mention only things which historians regard as certain. <reg>can</reg> we deem such vices to be no detraction from a general's good qualities? <reg>but</reg> there was forsooth the danger &mdash;as the silliest of the Greeks,<note>This is supposed to refer to Timagenes, an historian of a notoriously anti-Roman bias.</note> who exalt the reputation even of the Parthians against the Romans, are fond of alleging &mdash;that
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the Roman People would have been unable to withstand the majesty of Alexander's name, though I think that they had not so much as heard of him; and that out of all the Roman nobles not one would have dared to lift up his voice against him, although in Athens, a city crushed by the arms of Macedonia, at the very moment when men had before their eyes the reeking ruins of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> neighbouring Thebes, they dared inveigh against him freely, as witness the records of their speeches.<note>An allusion, more rhetorical than exact, to the famous Philippics of Demosthenes, the latest of which was probably delivered some six years before the destruction of Thebes in <date value="-335">335 B.C.</date></note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>however</reg> imposing the greatness of the man may appear to us, still this greatness will be that of one man only, and the fruits of little more than ten years of success. <reg>those</reg> who magnify it for this reason, that the Roman People, albeit never in any war, have yet suffered defeat in a number of battles, whereas Alexander's fortune was never aught but prosperous in any battle, fail to perceive that they are comparing the achievements of a man &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> a young man too &mdash;with those of a people that was now in its four hundredth year of warfare.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>should</reg> it occasion us surprise if, seeing that upon the one side are counted more generations than are years <pb id="p.235"/>upon the other,<note>If we reckon the <hi rend="italics">saeculum</hi> or <quote>generation</quote> at thirtythree years, the Rome of Alexander's time would have endured a little over thirteen <hi rend="italics">saecula.</hi> <name>Livy</name> says that people are really comparing these thirteen generations with the thirteen years of Alexander's (effective) life, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> his reign (336-<date value="-323">323 B.C.</date>).</note> fortune should have varied more<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> in that long time than in a life of thirteen years?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>why</reg> not compare a man's fortune with a man's, and a general's with a general's? How many Roman generals could I name who never suffered a reverse in battle! <reg>in</reg> our annals and lists of magistrates you may run through pages of consuls and dictators of whom it never on any day repented the Roman People, whether of their generalship or fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>and</reg> what makes them more wonderful than Alexander or any king is this: some were dictators of ten or twenty days, and none held the consulship above a year;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> their levies were obstructed by the tribunes of the plebs; they were late in going to war, and were called back early to conduct elections;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> in the midst of their undertakings the year rolled round; now the rashness, now the frowardness of a colleague occasioned them losses or difficulties; they succeeded to affairs which others had mismanaged, they received an army of raw recruits, or one badly disciplined.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>now</reg> consider kings: not only are they free from all impediments, but they are lords of time and circumstance, and in their counsels carry all things with them, instead of following in their train.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>so</reg> then, an undefeated Alexander would have warred against undefeated generals, and would have brought the same pledges of Fortune to the crisis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>nay</reg>, he would have run a greater risk than they, inasmuch as the Macedonians would have had but a single Alexander, not only exposed to many dangers, but <pb id="p.237"/>incurring them voluntarily, while there would have<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> been
					<milestone unit="section" n="19??"/> many Romans a match for Alexander, whether for glory or for the greatness of their deeds, of whom each several one would have lived and died as his own fate commanded, without endangering the State.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<reg>it</reg> remains to compare the forces on both sides, whether for numbers, or types of soldiers, or size of their contingents of auxiliaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> quinquennial enumerations of that period put the population at 250,000.<note>In the last census which Livy had recorded (<date value="-459">459 B.C.</date>) were enrolled 117,321 persons (III. xxiv. 10). Livy seems to have consulted the records of the censors, at least occasionally.</note> And so at the time when all the Latin allies were in revolt<note>Or possibly: at every revolt of the Latin allies.</note> it was the custom to enroll ten legions, by a levy which was virtually limited to the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>in</reg> those years frequently four and five armies at a time would take the field, in Etruria, in Umbria (where they also fought the Gauls), in Samnium, and in Lucania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>later</reg> on Alexander would have found all Latium, with the Sabines, the Volsci and the Aequi, all Campania, and a portion of Umbria and Etruria, the Picentes and the Marsi and Paeligni, the Vestini and the Apulians, together with the whole coast of the Lower Sea, held by the Greeks, from Thurii as far as Naples and Cumae, and thence all the way to Antium and Ostia &mdash;all these, I say, he would have found either powerful friends of the Romans or their defeated enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>he</reg> himself would have crossed the sea with veteran Macedonians to the number of not more than thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse &mdash;mostly Thessalians &mdash;for this was his main strength. <reg>if</reg> to these he had added Persians and Indians and other nations, he would have found them a greater burden to have dragged about than a help.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.239"/>
				<p><reg>add</reg> to this, that the Romans would have had recruits<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> ready to call upon, but Alexander,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> as happened afterwards to Hannibal, would have found his army wear away, while he warred in a foreign land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>his</reg> men would have been armed with targets and spears:<note>The <hi rend="italics">sarisa</hi> was a pike 21 feet long.</note> the Romans with an oblong shield, affording more protection to the body, and the Roman javelin, which strikes, on being thrown, with a much harder impact than the lance.<note>The <hi rend="italics">hasta</hi> was ordinarily used as a pike or lance, but was sometimes thrown, by means of a thong.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>both</reg> armies were formed of heavy troops, keeping to their ranks; but their phalanx was immobile and consisted of soldiers of a single type; the Roman line was opener and comprised more separate units; it was easy to divide, wherever necessary, and easy to unite. <reg>moreover</reg>, what soldier can match the Roman in entrenching? <reg>who</reg> is better at enduring toil?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>Alexander</name> would, if beaten in a single battle, have been beaten in the war; but what battle could have overthrown the Romans, whom Caudium could not overthrow, nor Cannae?
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>nay</reg>, many a time &mdash;however prosperous the outset of his enterprise might have been &mdash;would he have wished for Indians and Persians and unwarlike Asiatics, and would have owned that he had before made war upon women, as Alexander, King of Epirus, is reported to have said,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> when mortally wounded, contrasting the type of war waged by this very youth in Asia, with that which had fallen to his own share.<note>Aulus Gellius, xvii. xxi. 33, says that Alexander, as he was setting sail for Italy, remarked that he was going to the Romans, as it were to the men's quarters (<hi rend="italics">andronitin</hi>); whereas the Macedonian had gone to the Persians, as to the quarters of the women (<hi rend="italics">gynaeconitin).</hi></note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/><reg>indeed</reg> when I remember that we contended against the Carthaginians on the seas for <pb id="p.241"/>four &mdash;andtwenty years, I think that the whole life of Alexander<note type="margin">B.C. 319</note> would hardly have sufficed for this single war; and perchance, inasmuch as the Punic State had been by ancient treaties leagued with the Roman,<note>The earliest treaty was said to have been made in <date value="-509">509 B.C.</date> (Livy does not mention it, but Polybius does, at III. xxii.); and another in 348.

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> Romans have been at war with the Macedonians &mdash;not, to be sure, when Alexander led them or their prosperity was unimpaired, but against Antiochus, Philippus, and Perses &mdash;and not only without ever suffering defeat, but even without incurring any danger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>proud</reg> word I would not speak, but never &mdash;and may civil wars be silent! &mdash; never have we been beaten by infantry, never in open battle, never on even, or at all events on favourable ground:

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> latter, with Lucius Fulvius, his master of the horse, laid siege to Saticula,<note>Saticula was probably on the border between Campania and Samnium, and possibly occupied the same site as the modern S.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> Romans were thus threatened in two quarters: on the one side the Samnites, with a large army which they had mustered to relieve their besieged allies, were encamped at no great distance from the Roman camp; on the other side the Saticulani suddenly threw their gates wide open and charged pell &mdash;mell against the outposts of the Romans.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>however</reg>, he attacked the sallying party with the greater fury, and, encountering no very sharp resistance, drove them back into the town. <reg>he</reg> then directed his entire line against the Samnites.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> the Samnites had not continued before Plistica, but, summoning fresh troops from home and confiding in their numbers, had pitched their camp on the same spot as before, and were trying to provoke the Romans into giving battle, in the endeavour to divert them from the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>this</reg> but intensified the dictator's concentration on the enemy's walls, for he deemed the war to consist solely in the attack upon the city, and treated the Samnites with much indifference, save only that he posted out &mdash;guards to prevent their making any inroad upon his camp.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> against whom, conspicuous amongst his followers as he urged them into battle, the Roman master of the horse rode such a tilt with levelled lance as at one lunge unhorsed and killed <pb id="p.249"/>him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>yet</reg> the rank and file were not more dismayed<note type="margin">B.C. 315</note> by their leader's death &mdash;though it often happens so &mdash;than they were angered; and as Aulius rode recklessly on through the enemy's squadrons, all those about him darted their javelins at him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>but</reg> the glory of avenging the Samnite general was given by Heaven in largest measure to his brother, who, wild with grief and rage, dragged down the victorious Roman from his seat and slew him. <reg>indeed</reg> the Samnites almost got possession of the body, which had fallen in the midst of their troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>but</reg> the Romans at once dismounted, and the Samnites were forced to do the same; and hurriedly forming up their lines, they began a battle on foot around the bodies of their generals, in which the Romans had easily the better. <reg>so</reg> they rescued the body of Aulius, which they bore back victoriously to their camp, with mingled feelings of sorrow and satisfaction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> Samnites, having lost their commander, and having tried what they could do in a cavalry engagement, gave up Saticula, which they felt was holding out in vain, and returned to the siege of Plistica. <reg>within</reg> a few days' time Saticula had surrendered to the Romans and the Samnites had carried Plistica by assault.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>it</reg> was not the losses nor the rout of either army that put a stop to the engagement, but darkness, which left them uncertain if they had lost or won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>i</reg> find in some authorities<note>Whom Diodorus follows (xix. lxxii.).</note> that the Romans were defeated in this battle, and that it was here that the master of the horse, Quintus Aulius, lost his life. <reg>to</reg> fill out the term of Aulius they appointed Gaius Fabius,<note>The <hi rend="italics"><name>Fasti</name> Capitolini</hi> give his name in full as C.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>for</reg> some days after the battle the dictator had kept his soldiers within their works, more like one besieged than a besieger. <reg>then</reg>, suddenly, he displayed the battle &mdash;signal, and thinking it more efficacious for quickening the courage of brave men to leave none of them any hope but in himself, he concealed from his troops the arrival

						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>our</reg> standing camp is sufficiently protected by its rampart, but for lack of provisions is untenable; for every place round about us from which supplies could be brought up has revolted, and even if men wished to help us, the character of the country is against it.

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>inflamed</reg> by the dictator's speech, which pointed to the direst necessity, the soldiers advanced upon the foe; and the mere sight of their blazing camp as they glanced back, though only the nearest tents were set afire &mdash; for so the dictator had commanded &mdash;was no small whet to their resentment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>and</reg> so, charging like madmen, they threw the enemy's ranks into confusion at the first assault; and in the nick of time the master of the horse, who had seen far away the burning camp &mdash;which was the signal they had agreed upon &mdash;assaulted the enemy from behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>being</reg> thus hemmed in, the Samnites fled, as each best might, in different directions; a vast throng huddled up together, in their terror, and blocking each other's way in the confusion, were cut down where they stood.

					<name>The</name> Romans then returned to Sora; and<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> new consuls, Marcus Poetelius and Gaius Sulpicius, <pb id="p.255"/>took over the army from Fabius the dictator, dismissing<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> a great part of the veteran troops and bringing in new cohorts to replace them.<note>The legions had been three years in the field, although some of the soldiers, who had been enlisted to replace those killed or disabled, had not served so long. <name>These</name> latter were retained with the colours and the others were discharged. <name>The</name> word <quote>cohorts</quote> is anachronistic; Livy had perhaps forgotten that the organization by cohorts dated only from the time of Marius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>but</reg> the city lay in a troublesome position, where the Romans could devise no very certain way of getting at it, and it seemed that victory would either be long in coming, or fraught with fearful risks;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> when a Soran deserter stole out of the town, and picking his way to the Roman sentinels, bade them bring him immediately to the consuls. <reg>arrived</reg> in their presence, he offered to betray the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> being questioned how he could accomplish it, he satisfied his interrogators that his plan was not unfeasible, and induced them to withdraw the Roman camp &mdash;which was almost in contact with the city walls &mdash;to a distance of six miles from the town; for so, he said, the sentinels would be less vigilant in guarding the place, whether by night or day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>he</reg> himself on the following night, having directed certain cohorts to seek cover in the woods below the town, took with him ten picked men, whom he conducted over steep and almost impassable ground up to the citadel.<note>Apparently conceived of as merely an unfortified and (for the time being) unoccupied height.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>here</reg> he had brought together a quantity of missiles out of all proportion to the number of men, besides which there were stones &mdash;both those which happened to be lying there, as is usual in rough country, and those which the townsmen had piled up on purpose, for the better protection of the place.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>he</reg> then ran down, making all the noise he could, as he cried <quote><reg>to</reg> arms!</quote> and <quote><reg>help</reg>, help, my countrymen! <name>The</name> citadel has been taken by the enemy! <reg>defend</reg> us!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>These</name> words he shouted as he knocked at the doors of the great, the same to all he met, the same to those who rushed out terrified into the streets. <name>The</name> panic begun by one man was spread by numbers through all the city.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> city was thronged with fugitives, and men who were hardly yet awake and most of them unarmed, began battering down the gates. <reg>through</reg> one of them rushed in the band of Romans, who had started up on hearing the outcry, and now running through the streets, cut down the frightened townsfolk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Sora</name> was already taken, when the consuls arrived at early dawn, and received the surrender of such as Fortune had spared in the rout and slaughter of the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>of</reg> these, two hundred and twenty &mdash;five, who were designated on all hands as the authors of the revolt and the hideous massacre of the colonists, they sent to Rome in chains; the rest they left unharmed in Sora, only setting a garrison over them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>all</reg> those who were taken to Rome were scourged and beheaded in the Forum, to the great joy of the commons, whom it most <pb id="p.259"/>nearly concerned that the people who were sent out<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> here and there to colonies should in every case be protected.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<name>The</name> consuls on leaving Sora conducted a campaign against the lands and cities of the Ausones.<note>Ausones is the Greek name for the Aurunci.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> everything had been disturbed by the coming of the Samnites, when the battle was fought at Lautulae, and conspiracies had been formed all about Campania. <reg>even</reg> Capua itself did not escape accusation; nay, the investigation actually led to Rome and to some of the prominent men there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> the Ausones were brought into subjection by the betrayal of their cities, as had happened in the case of Sora.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>from</reg> Ausona,<note>Site unknown.</note> from Minturnae, and from Vescia, twelve young nobles, having conspired to betray their cities, came to the consuls, and explained to them that their countrymen, after long looking forward to the coming of the Samnites, had no sooner heard of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> battle at Lautulae than they had concluded the Romans vanquished and had aided the Samnites with men and arms;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that since the expulsion of the Samnites from that region, they had been living in an uncertain kind of peace, not closing their gates upon the Romans, lest to do so should invite attack, but determined none the less to close them in case an army should approach; and that in that wavering state of mind they could be surprised and overcome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>by</reg> their advice the camp was moved up nearer and soldiers were simultaneously sent round to the three towns. <reg>some</reg> of these, in armour, were to lie in ambush in places near the walls, while others, wearing the toga and concealing swords under their dress, were to enter the cities, a little before day, by the open gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <pb id="p.261"/><name>These</name> latter fell upon the watchmen, at the same<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> time making a signal to their fellows in armour to rush in from their ambuscade. <reg>thus</reg> the gates were captured, and three towns were taken in one hour and by one device.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>but</reg> because the leaders were not present when the attack was made, there was no limit to the slaughter, and the Ausonian nation was wiped out &mdash;though it was not quite clear that it was guilty of defection &mdash;exactly as if it had contended in an internecine war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<reg>in</reg> the same year Luceria, betraying its Roman garrison to the enemy, passed into the possession of the Samnites; but the traitors did not long go unpunished for their deed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>not</reg> far away there was a Roman army, which captured the city &mdash;situated as it was in a plain &mdash;at the first attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> Lucerini and Samnites were shown no quarter, and resentment ran so high that even in Rome, when the senate was debating the dispatch of colonists to Luceria, there were many who voted to destroy the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>besides</reg> men's hate, which was very bitter against those whom they had twice subdued, there was also the remoteness of the place, which made them shrink from condemning fellow &mdash;citizens to an exile so far from home and surrounded by such hostile tribes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>however</reg>, the proposal to send colonists prevailed, and twenty &mdash;five hundred were sent.</p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> that year also of general disloyalty to the Romans, there were secret conspiracies of the nobles, even at Capua.<note>With this sentence Livy resumes the narrative begun in Chap.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>on</reg> their being reported to the senate, the danger was by no means minimized, but tribunals of enquiry were voted and it was determined to appoint a dictator to conduct the <pb id="p.263"/>investigations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>Gaius</name> Maenius was nominated, and<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> named Marcus Folius master of the horse. <name>Great</name> was the terror inspired by that magistracy; and so, whether from fear or a guilty conscience, the Calavii, Ovius and Novius, who had headed the conspiracy, before informations could be lodged against them with the dictator, avoided trial by a death which was undoubtedly self &mdash;inflicted.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><reg>after</reg> that, the field of enquiry at Capua having been exhausted, the proceedings were transferred to Rome, on the theory that the senate had ordered an investigation, not of specified individuals in Capua, but, in general, of all who had anywhere combined or conspired against the State; and that cabals for obtaining magistracies had been made against the common weal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> enquiry began to take a wider range, in respect both of charges and of persons, and the dictator was nothing loath that there should be no limit to the jurisdiction of his court.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>certain</reg> nobles were accordingly impeached, and on appealing to the tribunes found none to help them by stopping the informations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> nobles then declared &mdash;not those alone at whom the charge was levelled, but all of them conjointly &mdash;that this accusation did not lie against the nobility, to whom, unless fraudulently obstructed, the road to office lay wide open, but rather against upstart politicians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that in fact the dictator and the master of the horse themselves were fitter to be tried on such a charge than to act as judges, and they would find this to be so the moment they resigned their places.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/><reg>then</reg> indeed Maenius, more mindful now of his reputation than of his authority, came forward and addressed the assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <quote><reg>you</reg> are all of you,</quote> he <pb id="p.265"/>said, <quote><name>Quirites</name>, aware of my past life, and this very<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> office which has been conferred upon me is witness to my innocence; for it was necessary to select as dictator for the administration of judicial investigations, not the most distinguished soldier &mdash;as has often been done at other times, when some crisis in the state required it &mdash;but the man who had lived a life most aloof from these cabals.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>but</reg> since certain noblemen &mdash;for what cause it is better that you should form your own opinion than that I as magistrate should affirm anything not fully ascertained &mdash;have in the first place striven with might and main to defeat these very investigations;
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> and then, finding themselves not strong enough to escape pleading their cause in court, have sought refuge, patricians though they are, in the safeguards of their adversaries &mdash;the appeal, I mean, and the help of the tribunes; &mdash;
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and since at last, repulsed in that quarter, they have fallen upon us &mdash;so much safer does any course appear to them than to try to vindicate their innocence and have not blushed, though private citizens, to demand the impeachment of a dictator;
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> &mdash;in order that all gods and men may know that they are attempting even impossibilities to avoid accounting for their lives, whereas I am ready to face their charge and to offer myself to my enemies to be tried, I hereby resign the dictator's authority.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <reg>you</reg>, consuls, I beseech, if the task shall be devolved upon you by the senate, that you begin your investigations with me and with Marcus Folius here, that it may be seen that we are safe from these accusations by reason of our innocence, not by reason of the awe inspired by our office.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> <reg>he</reg> then resigned as dictator, and so at once did Folius as master of the horse. <reg>they</reg> were <pb id="p.267"/>the first to go to trial before the consuls &mdash;for to<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> these the senate had given the matter in charge &mdash; and, against the testimony of the nobles, were gloriously acquitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> <name>Publilius</name> Philo, too, after all his famous achievements at home and in war, and after having repeatedly held the highest offices, had incurred the hate of the nobility, and was brought to trial and acquitted.<note>In <date value="-339">339 B.C.</date> <name>Philo</name> had proposed three democratic laws, which won him the enmity of the patricians. <reg>see</reg> viii. xii. 14-16.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> <reg>but</reg> the inquisition, as often happens, had the vigour to deal with illustrious defendants no longer than while its novelty lasted; after that it began to descend to the baser sort, until it was finally put down by the cabals and factions which it had been instituted to oppose.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<name>The</name> rumour of these events, and still more the hope of a Campanian insurrection, which had been the aim of the conspirators, recalled the Samnites from Apulia, on which their attention had been fixed, to Caudium;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in the hope that, being there so near, they might, if any disturbance should afford the opportunity, seize Capua from the Romans; and to Caudium came the consuls, with a powerful force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>both</reg> armies at first held back, each on its own side of the pass, for either would have been at a disadvantage in advancing against the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>then</reg> the Samnites made a short detour over open ground, and brought their army down to the plain, where the hostile forces were, for the first time, encamped in sight of one another. <reg>some</reg> skirmishing followed, in which both sides made trial more often of their cavalry than their foot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Romans were not dissatisfied either with the outcome of these brushes or with the delays by which the campaign was protracted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>to</reg> the Samnite leaders, on the contrary, it appeared that <pb id="p.269"/>their forces were daily diminishing with petty<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> losses, and were wasting away with the prolongation of the war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><reg>they</reg> accordingly made ready for a general engagement, dividing their cavalry between the wings, with orders to pay more attention to the camp, to prevent any attack upon it, than to the battle; for the infantry would sufficiently safeguard the line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>of</reg> the consuls, Sulpicius took up his post on the right wing, Poetelius on the left. <name>The</name> formation on the right was spread out over a considerable distance, and on that wing the Samnites, too, were drawn up in ranks of little depth, either meaning to tum the Romans' flank, or to keep their own from being turned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> troops on the left, besides being drawn up in closer order, had received an accession to their strength from a plan conceived on the spur of the moment by Poetelius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>for</reg> those subsidiary cohorts which were wont to be kept fresh in reserve, to meet the chance needs of a long engagement, he sent immediately into the fighting line; and by using all his strength at once, he forced the enemy back at the first assault. <reg>as</reg> the Samnite infantry wavered, their cavalry moved up to support them. <reg>but</reg> while they came obliquely onward, in the interval between the armies, the Roman cavalry charged them at the gallop, confounding the ranks and the formations of horse and foot, until they had routed the entire army at that point.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Samnite right.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>on</reg> that wing Sulpicius was present, as well as Poetelius, to animate the soldiers, for when the shouting arose upon the left, he had ridden over there, leaving his own men, who were not yet come to grips with <pb id="p.271"/>the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>but</reg> perceiving his colleague's victory<note type="margin">B.C. 314</note> to be safe, he left him and rode off with twelve hundred men to his own wing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>there</reg> he found affairs in a different posture; the Romans had been driven out of their position, and the victorious enemy were charging their disordered ranks. <reg>but</reg> all was quickly changed by the arrival of the consul. <reg>for</reg> the sight of their general revived the spirits of the soldiers, and the brave men who followed him were a greater succour than their numbers indicated; and the tidings of their comrades' victory, which they soon saw for themselves, restored the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>presently</reg> the Romans had begun to conquer all along the line, while the Samnites, giving up the struggle, were massacred or made prisoners, except those who fled to Maleventum, the city which is now called Beneventum.<note>The city, which was a Greek colony, was called <foreign lang="greek">Malovei/s,</foreign> which meant <quote><reg>sheeptown</reg></quote> (or, perhaps, <quote><reg>appletown</reg></quote>).

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> field. <reg>but</reg> the Etruscans followed the same policy, preparing for war but preventing it from breaking out. <reg>neither</reg> side went beyond their own frontiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>noteworthy</reg>, too, in that year was the censorship of Appius Claudius and Gaius Plautius; but the name of Appius was of happier memory with succeeding generations, because he built a road, and conveyed a stream of water into the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> City.<note>The road was the Via Appia, which ran from Rome to Capua, and was later extended to Beneventum and, finally, to Brundisium. <name>The</name> aqueduct brought water from a point between seven and eight miles out, on the road to Gabii, and supplied the Circus Maximus and other low &mdash;lying parts of the City.</note> <name>These</name> undertakings he carried out by himself, since his colleague had resigned, overcome with shame at the disgraceful and invidious manner in which Appius revised the list
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> of senators; and Appius, exhibiting the obstinacy which had marked his family from the earliest days, exercised the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> censorship alone. <reg>it</reg> was Appius, too, by whose warranty the Potitian clan, with whom the priesthood of Hercules at the Ara Maxima<note>An ancient altar erected in honour of Hercules. <name>The</name> origin of the cult is described at I. vii. 3-15.</note> was hereditary, taught the ritual of that sacrifice to public slaves, <pb id="p.277"/>in order to devolve the service
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> upon them. <reg>tradition</reg><note type="margin">B.C. 312</note> relates that after this a strange thing happened, and one that might well give men pause ere they disturb the established order of religious ceremonies. <reg>for</reg> whereas at that time there were twelve families of the Potitii, and grown men to the number of thirty, within the year they had perished, every man, and the stock had
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> become extinct; and not only did the name of the Potitii die out, but even the censor, by the unforgetting ire of the gods, was a few years later stricken blind.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<reg>and</reg> so the consuls of the following year,<note type="margin">B.C. 311</note> Gaius Junius Bubulcus (for the third time) and Quintus Aemilius Barbula (for the second), complained to the people, at the outset of their administration, that the senatorial order had been depraved by the improper choice of members, in which better men had been passed over than some that had been appointed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>they</reg> then gave notice that they should ignore that list, which had been drawn up with no distinction of right and wrong, in a spirit of favouritism and caprice; and proceeded to call the roll of the senate in the order which had been in use before Appius Claudius and Gaius Plautius were censors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>in</reg> that year, also, two commands &mdash;both military &mdash;began to be conferred by the people; for it was enacted, first, that sixteen tribunes of the soldiers should be chosen by popular vote for the four legions, whereas previously these places had been for the most part in the gift of dictators and consuls, very few being left to popular suffrage<note>For an instance of the popular election of <hi rend="italics">tribuni militum</hi> <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> vii. v. 9. he plan adopted in 311 seems to have given the people the right to elect four of the six tribunes assigned to each legion, or sixteen in all. <reg>soon</reg> after Livy wrote these words another change was made and the emperor thenceforth appointed all military tribunes.</note> ; secondly, that the people should likewise elect two naval commissioners to have charge of equipping and refitting the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> former of <pb id="p.279"/>these measures was proposed by the tribunes of the<note type="margin">B.C. 311</note> plebs Lucius Atilius and Gaius Marcius; the latter by Marcus Decius, another tribune of the plebs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>i</reg> should omit, as an incident hardly worth narrating, a little thing that happened in that same year, but that it seemed to concern religion. <name>The</name> flute &mdash;players, angry at having been forbidden by the last censors to hold their feast, according to old custom, in the temple of Jupiter, went off to Tibur in a body, so that there was no one in the City to pipe at sacrifices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>troubled</reg> by the religious aspect of the case, the senate dispatched representatives to the Tiburtines, requesting them to use their best endeavours to restore these men to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> Tiburtines courteously undertook to do so; and sending for the pipers to their senate &mdash;house, urged them to return. <reg>when</reg> they found it impossible to persuade them, they employed a ruse, not ill &mdash;adapted to the nature of the men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>on</reg> a holiday various citizens invited parties of the pipers to their houses, on the pretext of celebrating the feast with music. <reg>there</reg> they plied them with wine, which people of that profession are generally greedy of, until they got them stupefied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>in</reg> this condition they threw them, fast asleep, into waggons and carried them away to Rome; nor did the pipers perceive what had taken place until daylight found them &mdash;still suffering from the debauch &mdash;in the waggons, which had been left standing in the Forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> people then flocked about them and prevailed with them to remain. <reg>they</reg> were permitted on three days in every year to roam the City in festal robes, making music and enjoying the licence that is now customary, and to such <pb id="p.281"/>as should play at sacrifices was given again the<note type="margin">B.C. 311</note> privilege of banqueting in the temple.<note>The story of the secession of the flute &mdash;players is found also in Ovid, <hi rend="italics"><name>Fasti</name>,</hi> vi. 651 ff., and Plutarch, <hi rend="italics"><reg>quaestiones</reg> Romanae,</hi> 55.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<name>The</name> consuls divided the commands between them: to Junius the lot assigned the Samnites, to Aemilius the new war with Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>in</reg> Samnium the Roman garrison at Cluviae,<note>The site of Cluviae is not known.</note> which had defended itself successfully against assault, was starved into submission. <name>The</name> Samnites, having scourged their prisoners in brutal fashion, put them to death, although they had surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>incensed</reg> by this act of cruelty, Junius felt that nothing should take precedence over an attack on Cluviae. <reg>he</reg> carried the place by storm on the day he arrived before it, and slew all the grown &mdash;up males.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>from</reg> there he led his victorious army to Bovianum. <reg>this</reg> was the capital of the Pentrian Samnites, a very wealthy city and very rich in arms and men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>against</reg> this town the soldiers were not so exasperated, but the hope of plunder spurred them on to capture it. <reg>and</reg> so there was less severity shown to the enemy, but there was almost more booty carried out than was ever collected from all the rest of Samnium, and the whole of it was generously made over to the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>when</reg> the conquering arms of the Romans might now no longer be withstood by any embattled host or camp or city, the leaders of the Samnites all eagerly directed their attention to the seeking out a place for an ambush, on the chance that the army might somehow be permitted to disperse for plundering, and so be surprised and surrounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>certain</reg> rustic deserters and prisoners, some falling into the consul's hands by accident and some on purpose, <pb id="p.283"/>by giving all the same account &mdash;and a true one,<note type="margin">B.C. 311</note> too &mdash;of enormous flocks that had been brought together in an inaccessible mountain meadow, persuaded him to lead thither his legions in light marching order to seize the booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>there</reg> a great army of the enemy had secretly beset the ways, and seeing that the Romans had entered the pass, rose up suddenly with much din and shouting and fell upon them unawares.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>at</reg> first the unexpectedness of the attack occasioned some trepidation, while the soldiers were putting on their armour and piling their packs in the midst. <reg>afterwards</reg>, when everyone had got rid of his encumbrance and had armed himself, they began to assemble from every side about their standards. <reg>in</reg> the course of a long training in the army they had become familiar with their places, and formed a line of their own accord, without anyone's direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> consul, riding up to the place where the fighting was most critical, leaped down from his horse, and called on Jupiter and Mars and the other gods to witness that he had come there seeking no glory for himself, but only booty for his soldiers:
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> his sole fault, he said, was a too great desire to enrich his men; from this disgrace nothing could save him but their courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>only</reg> let them all unite in singleness of purpose to assail an enemy conquered in battle, stripped of his camp, deprived of his cities, and pinning his last hopes to the treachery of an ambuscade, were his trust was in his position, not in arms. <reg>but</reg> what position was there now, he demanded, too strong for Roman valour to overwhelm?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>he</reg> reminded them of Fregellae's citadel and Sora's, and all the places where they had triumphed over disadvantage of ground.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><pb id="p.285"/>
				<p><reg>roused</reg> by these words, the soldiers disregarded<note type="margin">B.C. 311</note> every obstacle and advanced against the battle &mdash;line which their enemies had formed above them. <reg>there</reg> was a little hard fighting there, while the column was mounting the slope;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> but as soon as the foremost companies had reached the plateau at the top, and the soldiers perceived that their line was now established on level ground, the panic was straightway turned upon the waylayers, who fled, dispersing and throwing down their arms, in search of those very lurking &mdash;places where a little while before they had concealed themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>but</reg> the ground which they had sought out for the difficulties it presented to an enemy caught the Samnites themselves in a trap of their own devising. <reg>and</reg> so, very few were able to get off; about twenty thousand men were slain; and the victorious Romans struck out this way and that to collect the booty of cattle which the enemy had thrown in their way.<note>The <hi rend="italics"><name>Fasti</name> Capitolini</hi> record that Junius triumphed over the Samnites on August 5th (<hi rend="italics">C.I.

					<reg>while</reg> these events were taking place in Samnium, all the peoples of Etruria, except the Arretini, had already armed, and beginning with the siege of Sutrium, a city in alliance with the Romans, and forming as it were the key to Etruria, had set on foot a tremendous war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>thither</reg> the other consul, Aemilius, came with an army, to relieve the blockade of the allies. <reg>as</reg> the Romans came up, the Sutrini obligingly brought provisions to their camp, which was formed before the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> Etruscans spent the first day in deliberating whether to accelerate the war or to draw it out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> the following day, their generals having decided on the swifter plan in preference to the safer, the <pb id="p.287"/>signal for battle was displayed at sunrise and their<note type="margin">B.C. 311</note> men in fighting array marched out upon the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>when</reg> this was reported to the consul, he at once commanded the word to be passed round that the men should breakfast, and having recruited their strength with food, should then arm. <name>The</name> order was obeyed; and the consul, seeing them equipped and ready, bade advance the standards beyond the rampart, and drew up his troops a little way off from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>for</reg> some time both sides stood fast, observing one another closely, each waiting for the other to give a cheer and begin to fight, and the sun had begun his downward course in the heavens ere a missile was hurled on either side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>then</reg> the Etruscans, that they might not withdraw without accomplishing their purpose, set up a shout, and with sound of trumpets advanced their ensigns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> Romans were equally prompt to begin the battle. <name>The</name> two armies rushed together with great fury, the enemy having a superiority in numbers, the Romans in bravery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Victory</name> hung in the balance and many perished on both sides, including all the bravest, and the event was not decided until the Roman second line came up with undiminished vigour to relieve their exhausted comrades in the first; and the Etruscans, whose fighting line was supported by no fresh reserves, all fell in front of their standards and around them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>there</reg> would never in any battle have been more bloodshed or less running away, but when the Etruscans were resolved to die, the darkness shielded them, so that the victors gave over fighting before the vanquished.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><reg>for</reg> a great many years now there had been no contests between the patrician magistrates and the tribunes, when a dispute &mdash;arose through that family which was fated, as it seemed, to wrangle with the tribunes and with the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Appius</name> Claudius the censor, on the expiration of the eighteen months which had been fixed by the Aemilian law<note><date value="-434">434 B.C.</date> (iv. xxiv. 5).</note> as the limit of the censorship, although his colleague Gaius Plautius had abdicated, could himself by no compulsion be prevailed upon to do likewise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>it</reg> was Publius Sempronius, a tribune of the people, who commenced an action to confine the censorship to its legal limits &mdash;an action no less just than popular, and as welcome to every aristocrat as to the common people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>having</reg> repeatedly read out the Aemilian law, and praised its author, Mamercus Aemilius the dictator, for confining the censorship &mdash;which had until then been tenable for five years and was proving despotic by reason of the long continuance of its authority &mdash;within
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the space of a year and a half, he said, <quote><reg>come</reg>, tell us, Appius Claudius, what <pb id="p.291"/>you would have done had you been censor at the<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> time when Gaius Furius and Marcus Geganius were censors.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Appius</name> replied that the tribune's question had no particular bearing upon his own case;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for even though the Aemilian law had bound those censors in whose term of office it had been passed, because the people had enacted the law after their election to the censorship and their latest enactment was always the effective law, yet neither himself nor any one of those who had been chosen censors subsequently to the passage of that law could have been bound by it.<note>Appius held that, whereas the election of Furius and Geganius for a period of five years had been set aside by the Aemilian law, which was then the latest enactment on the subject and so replaced any earlier one, nevertheless all those who were elected subsequently derived their powers from still later enactments, by which in its tum the Aemilian law was superseded.</note></p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>"<reg>or</reg> will this be your contention, Appius, that the people is not bound by the Aemilian law? <reg>or</reg> that the people is bound, but that you alone are exempt? <name>The</name> Aemilian law bound those violent censors Gaius Furius and Marcus Geganius, who showed what mischief that magistracy could accomplish in the state, when, in their rage at the abridgment of their powers, they reduced Mamercus Aemilius, the foremost man of his time in war and peace, to the lowest class of

					<reg>during</reg> the progress of this affair in Rome, the Etruscans were already laying siege to Sutrium; and the consul Fabius, leading his army along the foot of the mountains to relieve the allies, and, if in any way practicable, to attack the works of the besiegers, encountered the enemy drawn up in line of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> plain spreading out below him revealed to the consul their exceeding strength; and in order to make up for his own deficiency in numbers by the advantage of position, he altered slightly his line of march, so as to mount the hills &mdash;which were rough and covered with stones &mdash;and there turned and faced the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> Etruscans, forgetting everything but their numbers, in which alone they trusted, entered the combat with such haste and eagerness that they cast away their missiles in order to come the sooner to close quarters, and drawing their swords rushed at the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> Romans, on the contrary, fell to pelting them, now with javelins and now with stones, of which latter the ground itself provided a good supply;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and even such of the Etruscans as were not wounded were confused by the blows that rattled down on their helms and shields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>it</reg> was no easy matter to get close enough <pb id="p.301"/>for fighting hand to hand, and they had no javelins<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> for long &mdash;range work. <reg>there</reg> they stood, exposed to missiles, with no adequate cover of any sort, and as some of them gave ground and the line began to waver and be unsteady, the Roman first and second lines, giving a fresh cheer, charged them, sword in hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>their</reg> onset was too much for the Etruscans, who faced about and fled headlong towards their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>but</reg> the Roman cavalry, riding obliquely across the plain, presented themselves in front of the fugitives, who then abandoned the attempt to reach their camp and sought the mountains; from which they made their way in a body, unarmed and suffering from their wounds, to the Ciminian Forest. <name>The</name> Romans, having slain many thousand Etruscans and captured eight &mdash;and &mdash;thirty standards, took possession also of the enemy's camp, with a very large booty. <reg>they</reg> then began to consider the feasibility of a pursuit.</p>

					<reg>in</reg> those days the Ciminian Forest was more impassable and appalling than were lately the wooded defiles of Germany,<note>Livy is probably thinking of the German campaigns of Caesar in 55 and 53, and of Agrippa in <date value="-38">38 B.C.</date></note> and no one &mdash;not even a trader &mdash;had up to that time visited it. <reg>to</reg> enter it was a thing that hardly anyone but the general himself was bold enough to do: with all the rest the recollection of the Caudine Forks was still too vivid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>then</reg> one of those present, the consul's brother Marcus Fabius, &mdash;some say that it was Caeso Fabius, others Gaius Claudius, a son of the same mother as the consul &mdash;offered to explore and return in a short time with definite information about everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>he</reg> had been educated at Caere in the house of family friends, and from this circumstance was learned in Etruscan writings and knew the Etruscan <pb id="p.303"/>language well. <reg>i</reg> have authority for believing that<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> in that age Roman boys were regularly wont to be schooled in Etruscan literature, as nowadays they are trained in Greek; but it seems more probable that this man possessed some exceptional qualification to induce him to venture amongst enemies in so daring a disguise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>it</reg> is said that his only companion was a slave, brought up with him, and hence acquainted, like his master, with the language.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>they</reg> set out, after acquiring no more than a summary knowledge of the nature of the region they must enter and the names of the chief men in those tribes, to save them from being detected in conversation by boggling at any well &mdash;known fact.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>they</reg> went dressed as shepherds and armed with rustic weapons, namely billhooks and a brace of javelins apiece. <reg>but</reg> neither their familiarity with the tongue nor the fashion of their dress and weapons was so great a protection to them as the fact that it was repugnant to belief that any stranger would enter the Ciminian defiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>they</reg> are said to have penetrated as far as Camerinum in Umbria, where the Roman, having ventured to tell who they were, was introduced into the senate, and treated with them in the consul's name for friendship and an alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>having</reg> then been hospitably entertained, lie was bidden to carry word back to the Romans that thirty days' provisions for their army would be waiting for them, if they came into that region, and that the young men of the Umbrian Camertes would be armed and ready to obey their orders.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>on</reg> their success being made known to the consul, he sent the baggage ahead, in the first watch, and directed the legions to follow the baggage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>he</reg> <pb id="p.305"/>himself stopped behind with the cavalry, and at<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> dawn of the following day made a demonstration against the enemy's outposts, which had been stationed at the entrance to the pass. <reg>having</reg> kept the enemy in play for a sufficient time, he retired within his camp, and emerging from it by the opposite gate overtook the column before night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>next</reg> day, with the first rays of light, he was on the crest of the Ciminian mountain and, looking thence over the rich ploughlands of Etruria, sent his soldiers to plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> Romans had already brought away out enormous booty when certain improvised bands of Etruscan peasants, called together in hot haste by the chief men of that country, encountered them, but with so little discipline that in seeking to regain the spoils they had nearly been made a spoil themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>having</reg> slain or driven off these men and wasted the country far and wide, the Romans returned to their camp, victorious and enriched with all manner of supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>there</reg>, as it happened, they found five legates, with two tribunes of the plebs,<note>The tribunes were added to the embassy that they might, if necessary, compel obedience to the senate by the exercise of their sacrosanct authority. <reg>this</reg> was an unusual procedure, as the powers of the tribunes were held to extend no further than one mile from the City.</note> who had come to order Fabius in the name of the senate not to cross the Ciminian Forest. <reg>rejoicing</reg> that they had come too late to be able to hinder the campaign, they returned to Rome with tidings of victory.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<reg>this</reg> expedition of the consul's, instead of putting an end to the war, only gave it a wider range. <reg>for</reg> the district lying about the base of Mount Ciminius had felt the devastation, and had aroused not only Etruria to resentment but the neighbouring parts of Umbria also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>so</reg> an army came to Sutrium that was larger than any they had raised before; and not only did they move forward their camp, out of the woods, but even, in their <pb id="p.307"/>eagerness for combat, came down into the plain at<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> the earliest opportunity in battle formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>at</reg> first, after forming up, they stood still in their positions, having left their enemies room to draw up opposite. <reg>then</reg>, finding the Romans in no haste to engage them, they advanced up to the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>when</reg> they saw that even the outguards had retired within the works, they began shouting to their generals, to have their rations for the day sent out to them from the camp; they would wait under arms, they said, and either that night, or at daybreak at the latest, attack the enemy's stockade. <name>The</name> Roman army was every whit as restless, but was restrained by the general's authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>it</reg> was about the tenth hour of the day<note>Perhaps about six o'clock.</note> when the consul bade the soldiers sup, and commanded them to be armed and ready at whatever hour of the day or night he might give the signal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>in</reg> a brief address he magnified the Samnite wars and belittled the Etruscans: there was no comparison, he said, between the two enemies, or between their numbers; moreover, he had an additional weapon in concealment; they should know about it when the time came; until then it must remain a secret.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>by</reg> these obscure hints he sought to engender a belief that the enemy were being betrayed, in order to revive the spirits of his men, which were damped by the numbers of their enemies; and the fact that the Etruscans had thrown up no breastworks where they lay lent colour to the insinuation.</p> 
				<p><reg>refreshed</reg> with food, the soldiers gave themselves up to sleep, and at about the fourth watch were awakened without noise and put on their armour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>mattocks</reg> were issued to the soldiers' servants, that they might <pb id="p.309"/>level the rampart and fill up the trenches.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> line<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> was drawn up inside the fortifications, and selected cohorts were posted at the exits. <reg>then</reg>, on the signal being given a little before dawn, which on summer nights is the time of deepest sleep, the rampart was thrown down, and the Romans, rushing out in battle &mdash;formation, fell upon their enemies, who were lying all about the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>some</reg> were slain without even stirring in their sleep, some were but half awake, the greatest number were reaching in terror for their weapons. <reg>only</reg> a few were given time to arm themselves; and even these, with no definite standard to follow and no leader, the Romans routed and chased from the field. <reg>some</reg> made for the camp and others for the mountains, as they fled this way and that. <name>The</name> forests afforded the surer refuge; for the camp, being situated in the plain, was captured the same day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>orders</reg> were issued that all gold and silver be brought to the consul; the rest of the booty went to the soldiers. <reg>on</reg> that day the enemy lost sixty thousand slain or captured.</p> 
				<p><reg>some</reg> historians relate that this famous battle was fought on the other side of the Ciminian Forest, near Perusia, and that Rome was in a panic lest the army should be surrounded and cut off in that dangerous defile by the Tuscans and Umbrians rising up on every hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>but</reg>, wherever it was fought, the Romans were the victors. <reg>and</reg> so from Perusia and Cortona and Arretium, which at that time might be the chief cities of the nations of Etruria, ambassadors came to Rome to sue for peace and an alliance. <reg>they</reg> obtained a truce for thirty years.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<reg>while</reg> these things were going on in Etruria, the other consul, Gaius Marcius Rutulus, <pb id="p.311"/>captured Allifae from the Samnites by assault.<note>At viii. xxv. 4, Livy mentioned the acquisition of Allifae, but has nowhere spoken of its recapture by the Samnites.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> <reg>many</reg> forts and villages besides were either wiped out in the course of hostilities or came intact into the hands of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Romans.</p> 
				<p><reg>at</reg> about this time a Roman fleet, commanded by Publius Cornelius, whom the senate had placed in charge of the coast, sailed for Campania and put into Pompeii. <reg>from</reg> there the sailors and rowers set out to pillage the territory of Nuceria.<note>Diod. (XIX. lxv.) tells us that Nuceria (formerly an ally of Rome) had revolted to the Samnites.</note> <reg>having</reg> quickly ravaged the nearest fields, from which they might have returned in safety to their ships, they were lured on, as often happens, by the love of booty, and going too far abroad aroused the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> enemy. <reg>while</reg> they roamed through the fields, nobody interfered with them, though they might have been utterly annihilated; but as they came trooping back, without a thought of danger, the country &mdash;folk overtook them not far from the ships, stripped them of their plunder, and even slew a part of them; those who escaped the massacre were driven, a disordered rabble, to their
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> ships.</p> 
				<p><name>Great</name> as had been the fears excited in Rome when Quintus Fabius marched through the Ciminian Forest, the rejoicings that took place in Samnium amongst the enemy were no less on their hearing a report that the Roman army was intercepted and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> besieged. <reg>they</reg> recalled the Caudine Forks as showing what the disaster would be
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> like; with the same temerity, they said, a race that was ever reaching out for what lay beyond had been led into pathless forests and there hemmed in, more by the difficulties of the ground than by the arms of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> enemy. <reg>soon</reg> their joy began to be mixed with a kind of envy, that Fortune should have transferred the glory <pb id="p.313"/>of the Roman war from Samnites to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Etruscans. <reg>so</reg><note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> they hastened to bring all their strength to bear upon crushing Gaius Marcius, the consul; and resolved, if Marcius should avoid an encounter, to march forthwith into Etruria, through the countries of the Marsi and the Sabines. <name>The</name> consul met them, and the battle was fiercely contested on both sides, but without a decision being reached. <reg>yet</reg>, doubtful though it was which side had suffered most, the report gained ground that the Romans had been worsted: they had lost certain members of the equestrian order, certain military tribunes, and one lieutenant, and &mdash;most conspicuous of their misfortunes &mdash;the consul himself was
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> wounded.</p> 
				<p><name>These</name> reverses as usual were further exaggerated in the telling, and the senate in great dismay determined on the appointment of a
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> dictator. <reg>nobody</reg> could doubt that Papirius Cursor, who was regarded as the foremost soldier of his time, would be
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> designated. <reg>but</reg> the senators were not certain that a messenger could be got through in safety to Samnium, where all was hostile, nor that the consul Marcius was alive. <name>The</name> other consul, Fabius, had a private grudge against
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Papirius; and lest this enmity might hinder the general welfare, the senate decided to send a deputation of former consuls, in the hope that their personal influence, when added to the wishes of the government, might induce him to forget those quarrels for the good of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> country. <name>The</name> ambassadors went to Fabius and delivered the resolution of the senate, with a discourse that suited their instructions. <name>The</name> consul, his eyes fixed on the ground, retired without a word, leaving the ambassadors uncertain what he proposed to
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> do. <reg>then</reg> in the <pb id="p.315"/>silence of the night, as the custom is, he appointed<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> Lucius Papirius dictator.<note>The consul rose and took the auspices after midnight because it was less likely that anything unlucky would then be said or done &mdash;in the absence of bystanders &mdash;to vitiate the ceremony.</note> <reg>when</reg> the envoys thanked him for nobly conquering his feelings, he continued obstinately silent, and dismissed them without making any reply or alluding to what he had done, so that it was clearly seen what agony his great
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> heart was suppressing.</p> 
				<p><name>Papirius</name> named Gaius Junius Bubulcus master of the horse. <reg>when</reg> he began to lay before the curiate assembly<note>Under the kings the curiate assembly had been the only formal assembly of the people (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> I. xiii. 6 for the origin of the <hi rend="italics">curiae</hi>), but in the time of the republic its functions had largely passed to the centuriate assembly. <reg>it</reg> was, however, still called upon to ratify the election of new magistrates by passing a <hi rend="italics">lex ciuriata de imperio,</hi> and retained certain other ceremonial duties.</note> a law confirming his authority, the proceedings were cut short by an evil omen, the first vote to be counted being that of the ward called Faucia, notorious for two calamities, the capture of the City and the Caudine Peace, which had both been incurred in years when this same curia had the right of

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<reg>next</reg> day the dictator sought the auspices afresh and carried the law through. <reg>then</reg>, setting out with the legions which had recently been recruited on account of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the fear occasioned by the army's march through the Ciminian Forest, he came to the vicinity of Longula,<note>Longula was a Volscian town, but was situated not far from the Samnite border. <reg>it</reg> is not necessary to assume, with Weissenborn-Mueller, that Livy is referring to an otherwise unknown Longula in Samnium.</note> and taking over from Marcius the consul his veteran troops, marched out and offered battle, which the enemy on their part seemed willing to accept.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> while the two armies stood armed and ready for the conflict, which neither cared to begin, night overtook them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>for</reg> some time after that they remained quietly in the camps <pb id="p.317"/>they had established near one another, neither lacking<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> confidence in themselves nor yet making light of their adversaries.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> field was contested with such rivalry of rage that neither side discharged a missile. <name>The</name> battle began with swords, and, furious at the outset, waxed hotter as the struggle continued, for the victory was long undecided. <reg>it</reg> seemed as though the Romans were contending, not with the so oft defeated Etruscans, but with some new race.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>no</reg> sign of flight was visible in any quarter. <reg>as</reg> the front &mdash;rankers fell, the second line moved up to replace the first, that the standards might not want defenders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>after</reg> that the last reserves were called upon; and to such extremity of distress and danger did the Romans come that their cavalry dismounted, and made their way over arms and over bodies to the front ranks of the infantry. <reg>like</reg> a fresh line springing up amongst the exhausted combatants, they wrought havoc in the companies of the Etruscans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>then</reg> the rest of the soldiers, following up their charge, despite of weariness, at last broke through the enemy's ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>at</reg> this their stubbornness began to be overcome, and certain companies to face about; and when these had once turned tail, the rest likewise took to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>that</reg> <pb id="p.319"/>day for the first time broke the might of the<note type="margin">B.C. 310</note> Etruscans, which had long flourished in prosperity. <reg>their</reg> strength was cut off in the battle, and their camp was taken and plundered in the same attack.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<name>The</name> war in Samnium, immediately afterwards,<note type="margin">B.C. 308</note> was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. <name>The</name> enemy, besides their other warlike preparations, had made their battle &mdash;line to glitter with new and splendid arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg> were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver. <name>The</name> shape of the shield was this: the upper part, where it protected the breast and shoulders, was rather broad, with a level top; below it was somewhat tapering, to make it easier to handle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>they</reg> wore a sponge<note>Weissenborn-Mueller think a breastplate resembling a sponge in appearance is intended. <name>The</name> translator follows Professor Anderson in taking the expression literally, of a corslet made of sponge.</note> to protect the breast, and the left leg was covered with a greave. <reg>their</reg> helmets were crested, to make their stature appear greater. <name>The</name> tunics of the gilded warriors were parti &mdash;coloured; those of the silvern ones were linen of a dazzling white.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> latter had silver sheaths and silver baldrics: the former gilded sheaths and golden baldrics, and their horses had gold &mdash;embroidered saddle &mdash;cloths.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> right wing was assigned to these: the others took up their post on the left. <name>The</name> Romans had already learned of these splendid accoutrements, and their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> indeed those other things were more truly spoil than arms, shining bright before a battle, but losing their beauty in the midst of blood and wounds;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> manhood they said, <pb id="p.321"/>was the adornment of a soldier; all those other<note type="margin">B.C. 305</note> things went with the victory, and a rich enemy was the prize of the victor, however poor.</p> 
				<p><reg>whilst</reg> his men were animated by these words, Cursor led them into battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>he</reg> took up his own post on the right, and committed the left to the master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>from</reg> the moment of encountering, there was a mighty struggle with the enemy, and a struggle no less sharp between the dictator and the master of the horse, to decide which wing was to inaugurate the victory. <reg>it</reg> so happened that Junius was the first to make an impression on the Samnites. <reg>with</reg> the Roman left he faced the enemy's right, where they had consecrated themselves, as their custom was, and for that reason were resplendent in white coats and equally white armour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>declaring</reg> that he offered up these men in sacrifice to Orcus<note>Orcus &mdash;the Greek Pluto &mdash;was god of the dead.</note> ,Junius charged, threw their ranks into disorder, and clearly made their
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> line recoil. <reg>when</reg> the dictator saw this, he cried, <quote><reg>shall</reg> the victory begin upon the left? <reg>shall</reg> the right, the dictator's division, follow the attack of others? <reg>shall</reg> it not carry off the honours of
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the victory?</quote> <reg>this</reg> fired the soldiers with new energy; nor did the cavalry display less valour than the foot, or the lieutenants less enthusiasm than the generals. <name>Marcus</name> Valerius on the right and Publius Decius on the left, both men of consular rank, rode out to the cavalry, which was posted on the wings, and, exhorting them to join with themselves in seizing a share of glory, charged obliquely against the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> enemy's flanks. <reg>thus</reg> a new and appalling danger enveloped their line on either side, and when the Roman legions, observing the terror of the Samnites, pressed forward with <pb id="p.323"/>redoubled shouts, the enemy began
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> to flee. <name>The</name><note type="margin">B.C. 308</note> fields were soon heaped with slain and with glittering armour. <reg>at</reg> first the frightened Samnites found a refuge in their camp, but presently even that had to be abandoned, and ere nightfall it had been taken, sacked, and set on fire.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/><name>The</name> dictator, as decreed by the senate, celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> captured armour. <reg>so</reg> magnificent was its appearance that the shields inlaid with gold were divided up amongst the owners of the moneychangers' booths, to be used in decking out the Forum.<note>It was forty years later when the Romans began to coin silver for themselves; but there would be much coined silver in circulation by this time from Etruria and Magna Graecia, to furnish employment for money &mdash;changers (<hi rend="italics">argentarii</hi>).</note> <reg>from</reg> this is said to have come the custom of the aediles adorning the Forum whenever the <hi rend="italics">tensae,</hi> or covered chariots of the gods, were
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> conducted through it.<note>A <hi rend="italics">tensa</hi> is figured in Stuart Jones, <hi rend="italics"><reg>companion</reg> to Roman</hi> <hi rend="italics"><reg>history</reg>,</hi> P1. xlix. <reg>it</reg> was used to carry the images of the Capitoline gods in solemn procession to the Circus, at the time of the <hi rend="italics">ludi circenses.</hi></note> <reg>so</reg> the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to the gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> name of Samnites.<note>The Romans seem to have obtained from Capua the idea of gladiators (Livy, <hi rend="italics"><reg>per</reg>.</hi> XVI.), and the <quote><name>Samnite</name></quote> was always one of the standard types. <name>The</name> sentence is usually taken as implying that the Capuans had been present as allies of the Romans in the battle.</note></p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> the same year the consul Fabius fought a battle with the remnants of the Etruscan forces near Perusia &mdash;which, together with other cities, had broken the truce<note>Chap, xxxvii. &sect; 12.</note> &mdash;and gained an easy
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> and decisive victory. <reg>he</reg> would have taken the town itself &mdash;for after the battle he marched up to the walls &mdash;had not ambassadors come out and
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> surrendered the place. <reg>having</reg> placed a garrison in Perusia and having sent <pb id="p.325"/>on before him to the senate in Rome the Etruscan<note type="margin">B.C. 308</note> deputations which had come to him seeking friendship, the consul was borne in
					<milestone unit="section" n="21??"/> triumph into the City, after gaining a success more brilliant even than the dictator's; indeed the glory of conquering the Samnites was largely diverted upon the lieutenants, Publius Decius and Marcus Valerius, of whom, at the next election, the people with great enthusiasm made the one consul and the other praetor.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<reg>in</reg> recognition of his remarkable conquest of Etruria, Fabius was continued in the consulship, and was given Decius for his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>Valerius</name> was for the fourth time chosen praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> consuls cast lots for the commands, Etruria falling to Decius and Samnium to Fabius. <name>The</name> latter marched against Nuceria Alfaterna, and rejecting that city's overtures of peace because its people had declined it when it was offered them, laid siege to the place and forced it to surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>a</reg> battle was fought with the Samnites, in which the enemy were defeated without much difficulty, nor would the engagement have been remembered but for the fact that it was the first time that the Marsi had made war against the Romans.<note>The Marsi, though of Samnite stock, had hitherto bee on good terms with the Romans.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Paeligni imitated the defection of the Marsi, and met with the same fate.</p> 
				<p><name>Decius</name>, the other consul, was also successful in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>when</reg> he had frightened the Tarquinienses into furnishing corn for the army and seeking a truce for forty years, he captured by storm a number of strongholds belonging to the people of Volsinii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>some</reg> of these he dismantled, lest they should serve as a refuge for the enemy, and by devastating far and wide he made himself so feared that all who <pb id="p.327"/>bore the Etruscan name begged the consul to grant<note type="margin">B.C. 308</note> them a treaty. <reg>this</reg> privilege they were denied, but a truce for a year was granted them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>they</reg> were required to furnish the Roman army with a year's pay and two tunics for each soldier; such was the price they paid for a truce.</p> 
				<p><name>The</name> tranquillity which now obtained in Etruria was disturbed by a sudden revolt of the Umbrians, a people which had escaped all the distress of war, except that an army had passed through their territory.<note>Livy has not mentioned this before.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>calling</reg> up all their fighting men, and inducing great part of the Etruscans to rebel, they mustered so large an army, that they boasted, with much glorifying of themselves and fleering at the Romans, that they would leave Decius behind them in Etruria and march off to the assault of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>when</reg> this purpose of theirs was reported to the consul Decius, he hastened by forced marches from Etruria towards the City, and encamped in the fields belonging to Pupinia,<note>South of the Anio not far from Gabii. <reg>see</reg> xxvi. ix. 12.</note> eagerly waiting for word of their approach.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>at</reg> Rome no one made light of an Umbrian invasion. <reg>their</reg> very threats had excited fear in those who had learnt from the Gallic disaster how unsafe was the City they inhabited.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>accordingly</reg> envoys were dispatched to carry word to Fabius the consul, that if there were any slackening in the Samnite war he should with all speed lead his army into Umbria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> consul obeyed the order, and advanced by long marches to Mevania,<note>In the neighbourhood of Perugia and Assisi.</note> where the forces of the Umbrians at that time lay.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <name>Fabius</name> was entrenching his camp when they attacked him. <reg>as</reg> soon as he saw them rushing madly upon his ramparts, he recalled the soldiers from their work and drew them up, as time and the nature of the ground permitted, and encouraging them with a true relation of the honours they had won, some in Etruria and some in Samnium, bade them end this trivial sequel to the Etruscan war, and revenge upon the foe his impious threat that he would assault the City of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <name>These</name> words were received by the soldiers with such alacrity that the speech of the general was interrupted by a spontaneous cheer. <reg>then</reg>, before the command could be given, they hurled themselves &mdash;to the blare of horns and trumpets &mdash;with the wildest abandon against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>they</reg> fought not as though their opponents had been men and armed; but &mdash;marvellous to relate -began with tearing the standards out of the bearers' hands, and then fell to dragging the bearers themselves before the consul and to bringing armed men over from the other line to their own; wherever they met with resistance, they did their work more with shields than with swords, swinging them from the shoulder and knocking down their enemies with the bosses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <name>The</name> slain were outnumbered by the prisoners, and all along the battle line one cry was heard: that they should lay down their arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> <reg>and</reg> so, while the battle was still going on, the surrender was made, by the men who had first advocated war. <reg>on</reg> the next and on succeeding <pb id="p.331"/>days the other peoples of Umbria also capitulated:<note type="margin">B.C. 308</note> the men of Ocriculum were received into friendship under a stipulation.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><name>The</name> proconsul Quintus Fabius fought near the city Allifae a pitched battle with the army of the Samnites. <name>The</name> result was anything but doubtful, for the enemy were routed and driven into their camp; and they could not have held the camp had there not been very little daylight left. <pb id="p.333"/><reg>even</reg> so they were invested before dark, and guards<note type="margin">B.C. 307-306</note> were posted in the night to prevent anyone's escaping.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>next</reg> day, before it was well light, they began to surrender. <name>The</name> Samnites among them bargained to be dismissed in their tunics; all these were sent under the yoke.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> allies of the Samnites were protected by no guarantee, and were sold into slavery, to the number of seven thousand. <reg>those</reg> who gave themselves out for Hernic citizens were detained apart in custody, and Fabius sent them all to the senate in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>there</reg> an enquiry was held as to whether they had been conscripted or had fought voluntarily for the Samnites against the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> after which they were parcelled out amongst the Latins to be guarded, and a resolution was passed directing the new consuls, Publius Cornelius Arvina and Quintus Marcius Tremulus &mdash;for these men had been elected &mdash;to refer the matter to the senate for fresh action.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<reg>in</reg> Samnium, too, the departure of Fabius was the cause of fresh disturbances. <name>Calatia</name> and Sora with their Roman garrisons were taken by assault, and the captured soldiers were treated with shameful rigour.<note>Calatia was mentioned in chap. ii. &sect; 2 as a Samnite town, and its capture by the Romans in <date value="-314">314 B.C.</date> is noted in chap. xxviii. &sect; 6.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> consuls, that not even a nimble courier could get through, and for some days the consuls were kept in uncertainty regarding everything and could only speculate about one another's state. <reg>fears</reg> for their safety even extended to Rome, where all of military age were given the oath and two full armies were enlisted, to meet any sudden emergencies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>but</reg> the war with the Hernici by no means answered to the present panic or to the nation's old renown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>they</reg> ventured nothing to speak of at any point, and having lost three camps in the space of a few days they bargained for a thirty days' truce, to enable them to send envoys to the senate in Rome, and delivered up two months' pay and corn, and a tunic for every soldier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> senate sent them back to Marcius, having passed a resolution empowering him to deal with the Hernici as he saw fit. <reg>he</reg> received, their submission on terms of unconditional surrender.</p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> Samnium the other consul was also stronger than the enemy, but was more embarrassed by the character of the ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> enemy had blockaded all the roads and seized the practicable passes, to prevent supplies being brought up anywhere. <reg>but</reg> though the consul offered battle daily, he could not entice them to fight.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> arrival of Marcius, who, having subdued the Hernici, made haste to come to the assistance of his colleague, deprived the enemy of any power to delay the struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>for</reg> since they had not considered themselves equal to a <pb id="p.337"/>battle with even one army, and believed that, once<note type="margin">B.C. 307-306</note> they had suffered two consular armies to unite, there would be no hope for them, they made an attack on Marcius as he was approaching in loose marching older.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>hastily</reg> throwing down their packs in the midst, the Romans formed up<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in a hollow square, as the words <hi rend="italics">in medium</hi> show.</note> as well as time permitted. <name>The</name> shouting was the first thing that was noticed in the camp of Cornelius. <reg>then</reg>, far off, a cloud of dust was descried, and caused a commotion in the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>The</name> consul ordered his men to arm, and leading them quickly out into line attacked the enemy in the flank, when their hands were full with another struggle, crying out that it would be a burning shame if they
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> let the other army win both victories, and failed to claim for themselves the glory of their own campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>bursting</reg> through at the point where he had charged, he advanced through the enemy's line, and capturing their camp, which was empty of defenders, set fire to it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>when</reg> the soldiers of Marcius saw the blaze, and the enemy, looking over their shoulders, saw it too, the flight of the Samnites soon became general; but at every point death blocked the way, and there was no escaping anywhere.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/><reg>thirty</reg> thousand of the enemy had already fallen, and the consuls had sounded the recall and were proceeding to assemble their forces in one body, amid the mutual congratulations and rejoicings of the men, when suddenly some new cohorts of the Samnites, which had been levied as reliefs, were made out in the distance, and occasioned a renewal of the slaughter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <name>The</name> victors rushed upon them, without orders from the consuls or receiving any <pb id="p.339"/>signal, exclaiming that the Samnites must begin<note type="margin">B.C. 307-306</note> their soldiering with a bitter lesson.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <name>The</name> consuls indulged the ardour of the legions, being well aware that the enemy's recruits, in the midst of routed veterans, would scarce be equal to so much as an attempt at fighting. <reg>they</reg> were not mistaken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> <reg>all</reg> the forces of the Samnites, old and new, broke and fled to the nearest mountains, up which the Romans too advanced in pursuit of them. <name>The</name> conquered could find no refuge anywhere that afforded safety, but were driven pell &mdash;mell from the ridges where they had made a stand. <reg>and</reg> now with one voice they all begged for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> <reg>they</reg> were required to furnish corn for three months, with a year's pay and a tunic for each Roman soldier, and envoys were then dispatched to the senate to sue for terms.</p>

					<reg>in</reg> the consulship of Publius Sulpicius<note type="margin">B.C. 304</note> Saverrio and Publius Sempronius Sophus, the Samnites, whether seeking to end or only to postpone hostilities, sent envoys to Rome to treat for peace.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>Publius</name> Sempronius, the consul, would shortly be in Samnium with an army; he was one whom they would be unable to deceive as to whether their hearts inclined to peace or war; after a thorough investigation he would report his findings to the senate; and on his leaving Samnium their envoys might attend him.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> been shown, they said, by the Hernici, since those who had been permitted to do so had chosen their own laws in preference to Roman citizenship, while those who had not been given an option were to have citizenship thrust upon them as a punishment.<note><hi rend="italics"><reg>cf</reg>.</hi> chap. xliii. 23 f. for the two groups.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> carry off all their possessions from the fields and defend their cities by means of their walls, they all with loud acclaim adopted it. <name>The</name> enemy were scattered over the countryside when at break of day the Romans came <pb id="p.349"/>out and formed in order of battle, and encountering<note type="margin">B.C. 304</note> nobody, advanced at a quick pace towards the

					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> blotted out. <reg>a</reg> triumph was celebrated over the Aequi; and warned by the example of their downfall, the Marrucini, Marsi, Paeligni, and Frentani sent ambassadors to Rome to sue for peace and friendship. <name>These</name> nations, at their request, were granted a treaty of alliance.</p>

					IN the consulship of Lucius Genucius and<note type="margin">B.C. 303-302</note> Servius Cornelius there was in general a respite from foreign wars. <reg>colonies</reg> were established at Sora and Alba.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>six</reg> thousand settlers were enrolled for Alba, in the Aequian country. <name>Sora</name> had belonged to the territory of the Volsci, but the Samnites had got possession of it; to this place were sent four thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>in</reg> this year also the Arpinates and Trebulani were granted citizenship. <name>The</name> Frusinates were mulcted in one &mdash;third of their land, because it was discovered that they had tampered with the Hernici; the ringleaders of the conspiracy, after the consuls, at the instance of the senate, had conducted an investigation, were scourged and beheaded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>nevertheless</reg>, that their year might not go by without any war whatever, the consuls made a little expedition into Umbria, because of a report that armed men issuing from a certain cave were making raids upon the farms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> soldiers carried their standards into the cave, and there in the murk received many wounds, particularly from stones that were thrown at them; until, having found the other mouth of the cavern &mdash;for there was a way of going through it &mdash;they heaped up faggots at both openings and set them afire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>in</reg> this way about two thousand armed men perished in the cave from the smoke and heat, for they finally rushed into the very flames in their efforts to escape.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.363"/>
				<p><reg>when</reg> Marcus Livius Denter and Marcus Aemilius<note type="margin">B.C. 303-302</note> were consuls, the Aequi resumed hostilities. <reg>indignant</reg> that a colony had been established, like a citadel, within their borders, they attacked it with great fury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>they</reg> were beaten off by the colonists themselves, but occasioned such dismay at Rome &mdash;since it was scarce to be believed that the Aequi when in so weakened a condition should have begun a war relying solely on their own resources &mdash;that a dictator was appointed to cope with the outbreak, in the person of Gaius Junius Bubulcus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>setting</reg> out with Marcus Titinius, his master of the horse, he reduced the Aequi to submission at the first encounter, and having returned in triumph to the City eight days later, dedicated as dictator the temple of Safety which he had vowed as consul and for which as censor he had let the contract.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<reg>during</reg> the same year a Greek fleet commanded<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> by Cleonymus the Lacedaemonian put in to the shores of Italy and seized the city of Thuriae in the country of the Sallentini.<note>If <hi rend="italics"><name>Thuriae</name></hi> is what Livy wrote, it must have been an otherwise unknown city in the heel of Italy, where the Sallentini lived.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> consul Aemilius was dispatched against this enemy, whom he routed in a single engagement and drove to his ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>Thuriae</name> was restored to its old inhabitants, and peace was established in the Sallentine territory. <reg>i</reg> find in some annals that Junius Bubulcus the dictator was sent among the Sallentini, and that Cleonymus withdrew from Italy before it became necessary to fight the Romans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/><reg>rounding</reg> then the promontory of Brundisium, he was swept on by the winds in the mid gulf of the Adriatic, and dreading the harbourless coasts of Italy on his left and on his right the Illyrians, Liburnians, and Histrians, &mdash;savage tribes and <pb id="p.365"/>notorious most of them for their piracies &mdash;kept<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> straight on until he reached the coasts of the Veneti.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>having</reg> sent a small party ashore to explore the country, and learning that it was a narrow beach that extended in front of them, on crossing which one found behind it lagoons which were flooded by the tides; that not far off level fields could be made out, and that hills were seen rising beyond them, and that a river of great depth &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Mediacus &mdash;debouched there, into which they could bring round their ships to a safe anchorage &mdash;having learned all this, I say, he ordered the fleet to sail in and make its way up stream.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>but</reg> the channel would not admit the heaviest ships, and the multitude of armed men, passing over into the lighter vessels, kept on till they came to thickly inhabited fields; for three maritime villages of the Patavini were situated there along the river &mdash;bank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>disembarking</reg> there they left a small body of men to defend the boats, burnt the houses, made spoil of men and cattle, and, lured on by the sweets of pillage, advanced to a greater and greater distance from their ships.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>when</reg> word of these events was brought to the Patavians, whom the vicinity of the Gauls kept always under arms, they divided their young men into two divisions. <reg>one</reg> of these marched into the region where the scattered marauding was reported; the other, taking a different road, to avoid falling in with any of the marauders, proceeded to the place where the ships were moored, fourteen miles from the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> latter party, slaying the guards, who were unaware of their approach, made a rush for the ships, and the terrified sailors were forced to get them over to the other side of the stream. <reg>onland</reg>, <pb id="p.367"/>too, the battle waged against the straggling<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> plunderers was equally successful, and when the Greeks would have fled back to their station, the Veneti stood in their way. <reg>thus</reg> the enemy were caught between two parties and were cut to pieces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>some</reg> of them, being taken prisoners, told how the fleet and King Cleonymus were three miles off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>thereupon</reg> the captives were consigned to the next village for safe &mdash;keeping, and armed men filling the river boats &mdash;suitably constructed with flat bottoms, to enable them to cross the shallow lagoons &mdash;and others manning the craft they had captured from the invaders, they descended upon the fleet and surrounded the unwieldy ships;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> which, being more fearful of the unknown waters than of the enemy, and more bent on escaping to the deep sea than on resisting, they pursued clear to the river's mouth, and having captured some of them and burnt them, after they had been run aground in the confusion, returned victorious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>Cleonymus</name> sailed off with barely a fifth part of his ships intact. <reg>in</reg> no quarter of the Adriatic had his attempts succeeded. <reg>there</reg> are many now living in Patavium<note>For Patavium see Introduction, Vol. I. p. ix f.</note> who have seen the beaks of the ships and the spoils of the Laconians which were fastened up in the old temple of Juno.

					<reg>a</reg> treaty was entered into at Rome this year with the Vestini, who solicited friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>thereafter</reg> there were alarms in several quarters. <reg>it</reg> was reported that Etruria was up in arms, in consequence of an outbreak that had its origin in dissensions at <pb id="p.369"/>Arretium, where a movement was begun to drive out<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> the Cilnii &mdash;a very powerful family<note>Maecenas, the patron of Horace and Virgil, belonged to this family.</note> &mdash;because of the envy occasioned by their wealth. <reg>at</reg> the same time the Marsi forcibly resisted the confiscation of their land, where the colony of Carscoli had been planted with an enrolment of four thousand men.<note>This appears to be a mistake, Carseoli was probably not planted until four years later (chap. xiii. &sect; 1)</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>in</reg> view, therefore, of these tumults, Marcus Valerius Maximus was appointed dictator and named Marcus Aemilius Paulus to be his master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>this</reg> I choose rather to believe than that Quintus Fabius, at his time of life and after the offices he had held, was made subordinate to Valerius; but I would not deny that the error might have originated in the surname of Maximus.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> that a confusion arose between M. Valerius Maximus and Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> &mdash;Setting out with his army, the dictator overthrew the Marsi in a single battle; then shutting them up in their walled cities, he captured Milionia, Plestina, and Fresilia, in the course of a few days, and having fined the Marsi in a part of their territory, renewed the treaty with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> campaign was then directed against the Etruscans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the dictator having set out for Rome, to take the auspices over again, the master of the horse went out to forage, and being ambushed, lost a number of standards and was driven back into his camp, with a shameful rout and slaughter of his soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;This discomfiture is very unlikely to have befallen Fabius, not only because if in any quality he came up to his surname, he assuredly did so in the glory of a soldier, but also because, remembering the severity of Papirius, he could never have been brought to engage in battle without the orders of the dictator.<note>See the story of Papirius and Fabius at viii. xxx &mdash;xxxv.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<name>The</name> news of this reverse gave rise in Rome to a greater alarm than the situation warranted. <reg>for</reg>, as though the army had been destroyed, a <pb id="p.371"/>cessation of legal business was proclaimed, guards<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> were
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> called into service at the gates, and night &mdash;watches in the several streets, arms and missiles being heaped upon the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>after</reg> summoning all of military age to take the oath, the dictator was dispatched to the army, and there found everything more tranquil than he had expected and reduced to order by the careful measures of the master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> camp had been withdrawn to a safer site, the cohorts that had lost their standards had been left outside the rampart
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> without tents,<note>By way of punishment for their cowardice. <hi rend="italics"><reg>cf</reg>.</hi> the punishment meted out to his soldiers in <date value="-209">209 B.C.</date> by Marcellus (XXVII. xiii. 9).</note> and the army was eager for battle, that it might the sooner wipe out its disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>accordingly</reg> he advanced without delay into the district of Rusellae.<note>In Western Etruria, on the river Umbro.</note> <reg>to</reg> this place the enemy followed him; and although in consequence of their success they had every confidence in their ability to cope with the Romans even in the open field, yet they also attempted an ambuscade, which they had successfully essayed before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>not</reg> far from the Roman camp stood the half &mdash;ruined buildings of a village which had been burned when the country was laid waste.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>concealing</reg> armed men in these ruins, they drove out some cattle in full sight of a Roman outpost, which was under the command of the lieutenant Gnaeus Fulvius. <reg>but</reg> when this tempting bait failed to lure any of the Romans from their post, one of the shepherds came up under the very works and called out to the others, who were hesitating to drive out their flock from amongst the tumble &mdash;down buildings, asking why they were so slow, for they could safely drive them through the midst of the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>some</reg> men from Caere<note>The Caerites were citizens (without the suffrage), and as such might serve in the Roman army.</note> interpreted these words to the lieutenant, and great was the indignation aroused <pb id="p.373"/>through all the maniples of soldiers; yet they dared<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> not stir without the orders of their leader, who commanded those familiar with the language to mark whether the shepherds' speech were more like that of rustics or of city &mdash;folk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>on</reg> their reporting that in accent, in carriage, and in complexion they were too refined for shepherds, <quote><reg>go</reg> then,</quote> said he, <quote>and bid them uncover the ambuscade they have laid in vain; for the Romans know all, and can now no more be entrapped than they can be conquered by force of arms.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>These</name> words were no sooner heard and repeated to those who lay in ambush than they suddenly all rose up from their hiding &mdash;places and advanced in martial array into the plain which was spread open to the view on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>their</reg> army seemed to the lieutenant to be greater than his own detachment could withstand, and he therefore sent in all haste to the dictator to summon help, in the meantime resisting by himself the enemy's charges.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<reg>on</reg> receiving his message the dictator bade advance the standards, and commanded his men to arm and follow them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>but</reg> everything was almost sooner done than ordered; standards and arms were hurriedly caught up, and the soldiers could hardly be restrained from pushing forward at a run. <reg>it</reg> was not anger alone that spurred them on, as they thought of the defeat they had recently sustained, but the shouts, as well, that fell faster on their hearing as the fight waxed more hot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>so</reg> they urged one another forward and exhorted the standard &mdash;bearers to a faster pace. <reg>but</reg> the more haste the dictator saw them make, the more earnest was he to hold them in, and commanded them to <pb id="p.375"/>slow down their march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> Etruscans, on the<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> contrary, having been called out at the beginning of the battle, had taken the field with all their troops. <reg>one</reg> messenger after another informed the dictator that all the Etruscan legions were engaged and that his own men could hold out no longer; and looking down from the higher ground, he could see for himself the perilous situation of his people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>still</reg>, feeling fairly confident that his lieutenant was capable, even then, of maintaining the fight, and that he was himself not too far off to rescue him from danger, he desired the enemy to become completely exhausted, that he might fall upon them with undiminished vigour when their strength was spent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>yet</reg> although the Romans advanced but slowly, they had now but a little space to charge in, especially the horse. <reg>in</reg> the van were the standards of the legions, lest the enemy should be apprehensive of any concealed or rapid movement; but the dictator had left intervals between the files of the infantry, to allow ample room for the horses to go through.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> legionaries gave a cheer, and simultaneously the horsemen were let loose and with a free course galloped straight upon the enemy, who were not prepared to resist a shock of cavalry and were overwhelmed with a sudden panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>and</reg> so, though the help had nearly come too late for men who were already well &mdash;nigh surrounded, yet they were now all given a respite, and the battle was taken over by fresh troops &mdash;a battle of no long duration nor of doubtful issue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> routed enemy fled back to their camp, and when the Roman standard &mdash;bearers pressed in after them, they gave way and huddled up together in the farthest part <pb id="p.377"/>of the enclosure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> narrow gates became choked<note type="margin">B.C. 302</note> with fugitives and a great part of them climbed upon the mound and palisade, in hopes that from that elevation they might be able either to defend themselves, or to climb over somewhere and escape.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>it</reg> chanced that in a certain place the mound had not been solidly rammed down, and this, overburdened with the weight of those who stood upon it, slid over into the trench.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>by</reg> that opening &mdash;crying out that the gods were providing them a means of flight &mdash;they saved themselves, but more got away without their arms than with them.</p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> this battle the might of the Etruscans was broken for the second time.<note>The other occasion was in <date value="-309">309 B.C.</date> (IX. xxxix. 11).</note> <reg>by</reg> promising a year's pay for the soldiers, with two months' corn, they obtained permission from the dictator to send envoys to Rome to negotiate a peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Peace</name> was denied them, but they were granted a truce of two years. <name>The</name> dictator returned to Rome and triumphed. &mdash;I find historians who say that Etruria was pacified by the dictator without any memorable battle, only by settling the dissensions of the Arretini and reconciling the Cilnian family with the plebs. &mdash;Marcus. <name>Valerius</name> resigned as dictator, to enter immediately upon the consulship.<note>This was the fifth consulship of M.

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>some</reg> authors have recorded that he was elected without seeking the office, indeed without even being present, and that the election was presided over by an interrex; this only is not disputed, that he held the consulship in company with Apuleius Pansa.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<reg>during</reg> their year of administration the<note type="margin">B.C. 300</note> foreign relations of the state were fairly peaceful:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Etruscans were kept quiet by their failure in <pb id="p.379"/>war and by the truce; the Samnites, tamed by the<note type="margin">B.C. 300</note> defeats of many years, had not wearied as yet of the new covenant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>at</reg> Rome also the relief afforded by the emigration of large numbers to the colonies had quieted the commons<note>Weissenborn thinks that Livy has in mind the colonies of a later day whose principal aim was to lighten the City of its over &mdash;population. <name>The</name> colonies actually alluded to were intended primarily to protect the frontiers.</note> Nevertheless, that tranquillity might not be found everywhere, the plebeian tribunes Quintus and Gnaeus Ogulnius stirred up a quarrel among the first men of the state, both patrician and
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> plebeian. <reg>they</reg> had sought in every quarter occasions for maligning the Fathers to the plebs; and having tried everything else in vain, they set on foot a project by which they might inflame, not the lowest of the rabble, but the very leaders of the plebs
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> &mdash;the commones, namely, who had enjoyed consulships and triumphs, an who lacked nothing but priesthoods, which were not yet open to all, to complete their list of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> honours. <name>The</name> Ogulnii accordingly proposed a law, that whereas there were then four augurs and four pontiffs and it was desired to augment the number of priests, four pontiffs and five augurs should be added, and should all be taken from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> plebs. &mdash;How this college could have been reduced to four augurs, unless by the death of two, I cannot discover; since it is a settled principle amongst the augurs that their number should be uneven, to the end that the three ancient tribes, the Ramnes, Titienses and Luceres, should each have its augur, or else
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;if a larger number should be needed &mdash;that they should increase the priests in the same proportion; as in fact they were increased when five were added to the four, and, making up the number of nine, gave each tribe
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <pb id="p.381"/>three.<note>Livy means that originally there had been three augurs and that each subsequent increase in their number had been by multiples of three. <reg>he</reg> can only account for the tradition that there were four at this time on the assumption that two had died, and their places had not yet been filled when the Ogulnii made their proposal.</note> &mdash;But since they were to be added from the<note type="margin">B.C. 300</note> plebs, the patricians were as distressed by the proposal as they had been when they saw the consulship thrown
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> open. <reg>they</reg> pretended that' the gods were more concerned than they themselves were: the gods would see to it that their rites should not be contaminated; for their own part they only hoped that no disaster might come upon the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> state. <reg>they</reg> made, however, no great struggle, accustomed as they now were to being worsted in contests of this kind; and they beheld their adversaries no longer reaching out after great honours which they had formerly scarce any hopes of attaining, but in full possession of all the things for which they had striven with dubious prospects of success &mdash;repeated consulships, censorships, and triumphs.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<reg>there</reg> is said, however, to have been a vigorous discussion as to the passage or rejection of the bill, in which Appius Claudius and Publius Decius Mus were the principal speakers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>after</reg> they had brought up nearly the same arguments concerning the rights of patricians and plebeians as had formerly been employed in behalf of and against the Licinian Law,<note>Enacted <date value="-367">367 B.C.</date> (vi. xxxv. 5).</note> when the plebeians sought access to the consulship, it
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> is related that Decius evoked the image of his father as he had been seen by many who were then present in the assembly, wearing his toga with the Gabine cincture,<note>Prescribed in the ceremony of devotion, as in certain others.</note> and standing over his weapon, as he had done when offering himself a sacrifice for the Roman People and the legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Publius</name> Decius the consul had <pb id="p.383"/>on that occasion seemed to the immortal gods an<note type="margin">B.C. 300</note> oblation no less pure and holy than if his colleague Titus Manlius had been offered up; could not then this same Publius Decius &mdash;he asked &mdash;have been duly chosen to solemnize the public sacrifices of the Roman People?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>or</reg> was it to be feared that the gods would hearken less readily to the speaker's prayers than to those of Appius Claudius? <reg>did</reg> Appius perform with more devotion the rites of domestic religion, and worship the gods more scrupulously than he did himself?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>who</reg> was there that repented him of the vows that had been uttered in the state's behalf by so many plebeian consuls and so many dictators, either on going to their armies or in the midst of their campaigns?

						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>we</reg> see that plebeians are members of the Ten charged with the sacred rites, interpreters of the Sibylline oracles and the destinies of this people, the same being also overseers of Apollo's ritual and of other ceremonies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>and</reg> yet the patricians were in no way wronged at the time when the two commissioners in charge of sacred rites were increased in number on account of the plebeians;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and our brave and vigorous tribune, in proposing at the present time to <pb id="p.387"/>add five augurs' places and four pontiffs', to which<note type="margin">B.C. 300</note> plebeians may be named, has not desired to oust you patricians, Appius, from your places, but that men of the plebs may help you in the administration also of divine affairs, even as they help you in other and human matters, to the measure of their strength.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>blush</reg> not, Appius, to have a colleague in the priesthood whom you might have had in the censorship or consulship. <reg>it</reg> is quite as possible that he should be dictator and you his master of the horse as that it should be the other way about.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>a</reg> Sabine immigrant, the first of your house to be ennobled &mdash;call him Attius Clausus or Appius Claudius, as you will &mdash;was admitted to their number by the patricians of that olden time: be not too proud to admit us into the number of the priests.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>we</reg> bring many distinctions with us, aye, every one of those same distinctions that have made you so high and mighty.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Lucius</name> Sextius was the first plebeian consul, Gaius Licinius Stolo the first master of the horse; Gaius Marcius Rutulus the first dictator and censor, Quintus Publilius Philo the first praetor.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>from</reg> you we have heard always the same song &mdash;that the auspices belong to you, that you alone are of noble birth, that you alone have the full <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> and right to divination, both at home and in the field. <reg>but</reg> the authority and divination of plebeian and patrician have prospered in equal measure until now, and so they shall do in the future.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>pray</reg>, has it ever been wafted to your ears that those who were first appointed to be patricians were not beings descended from celestial regions, but were such as could name their fathers &mdash;were free &mdash;born men, that is, and nothing more?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>i</reg> can already name a consul for <pb id="p.389"/>my father, and my son will presently be able to<note type="margin">B.C. 300</note> name one for his grandfather. <reg>in</reg> truth the matter is simply, Quirites, that we must always be first denied, and yet have our way in the end. <reg>a</reg> struggle is all that the patricians ask: they care not what may be the outcome of the struggle.

					<name>The</name> people straightway commanded the tribes<note type="margin">B.C. 299</note> to be called, and it seemed that the measure would be accepted; nevertheless it was put off for that day on account of a veto.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>on</reg> the following day the tribunes were cowed and the law was passed with acclamation. <reg>to</reg> be pontiffs were chosen the advocate of the law, Publius Decius Mus, with Publius Sempronius Sophus, Gaius Marcius Rutulus, and Marcus Livius Denter; the five augurs were likewise of the plebs, Gaius Genucius, Publius Aelius Paetus, Marcus Minucius Faesus, Gaius Marcius, and Titus Publilius. <reg>thus</reg> the number of pontiffs became eight and of augurs nine.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><reg>in</reg> the same year Marcus Valerius the consul proposed a law of appeal with stricter sanctions. <reg>this</reg> was the third time since the expulsion of the kings that such a law had been introduced, by the same family in every instance.<note>For the earlier laws <hi rend="italics">de provocatione,</hi> see II. viii. 2, and III.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> reason for renewing it more than once was, I think, simply this, that the wealth of a few carried more power than the liberty of the plebs. <reg>yet</reg> the Porcian law alone seems to have been passed to protect the persons of the citizens, imposing, as it did, a heavy penalty if anyone should scourge or put to death a Roman citizen.<note>This law was not passed until (probably) <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date>, at the instance of the elder Cato, who was then praetor.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Valerian law, having forbidden that <pb id="p.391"/>he who had appealed should be scourged with rods<note type="margin">B.C. 299</note> or beheaded, merely provided that if anyone should disregard these injunctions it should be deemed a wicked act.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>this</reg> seemed, I suppose, a sufficiently strong sanction of the law, so modest were men in those days;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> at the present time one would hardly utter such a threat in earnest.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> enterprise was therefore still unfinished when Marcus Fulvius Paetus<note>The <hi rend="italics"><reg>acta</reg> Triumphorum</hi> (<hi rend="italics">C.I.L.,</hi> 12, p. 171) give him as son of Gnaeus and grandson of Gnaeus; he is therefore not the same as the M.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><name>Licinius</name> Macer and Tubero declare that all the centuries were for naming Quintus Fabius consul for this year, though he was not a candidate, but that Fabius himself urged them to defer his consulship to a year when there was more fighting; just then he would be of greater service to the state if invested with an urban magistracy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>and</reg> so, neither dissembling what he had in mind nor yet seeking it, he was elected curule aedile, with Lucius Papirius Cursor.<note>Fabius had already held this office, <date value="-331">331 B.C.</date> (viii. xviii. 4).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>i</reg> have been unable to put this down for certain, because Piso, one of the older annalists,<note>For Piso and the other annalists see Vol. I. pp. xxviii- XXX.</note> states that the curule aediles for that year were Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, the son of <pb id="p.393"/>Gnaeus, and Spurius Carvilius Maximus, the son of<note type="margin">B.C. 299</note> Quintus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>i</reg> fancy that this surname occasioned an error in regard to the aediles, and that a story afterwards grew up in harmony with the error, from a confusion of the aedilician with the consular elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>this</reg> year witnessed also the closing of the lustrum,<note>The <quote>closing of the lustrum</quote> was accomplished by the sacrifice of a swine, a sheep and an ox (the <hi rend="italics">suovetaurilia</hi>), and completed the ceremonies incidental to the census.</note> by the censors Publius Sempronius Sophus and Publius Sulpicius Saverrio, and two tribes were added &mdash;the Aniensis and the Terentina. <reg>so</reg> much for affairs at Rome.</p>

					<reg>meantime</reg>, at the town of Nequinum, while the siege dragged slowly on, two of the townsmen, whose dwellings abutted on the wall, dug a tunnel and made their way in secret to the Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>thence</reg> they were conducted to the consul, whom they assured of their readiness to admit a party of soldiers within the fortifications and the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>it</reg> was not thought wise to spurn this offer, nor yet rashly to confide in it. <reg>in</reg> company with one of these men &mdash;the other being held as a hostage &mdash;two scouts were sent through the tunnel;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the result of their investigation was satisfactory, and three hundred armed men, with the renegade as guide, effected an entrance by night into the city and seized the nearest gate. <reg>once</reg> this had been broken down, the Roman consul and his army captured the place without a struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>thus</reg> Nequinum came under the sway of the Roman People. <reg>a</reg> colony was sent there to make head against the Umbrians, and was given the name of Narnia from the river Nar. <name>The</name> army, enriched with spoil, marched back to Rome.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><name>The</name> Etruscans planned to go to war that year in violation of the truce; but while they were busy <pb id="p.395"/>with this project an enormous army of Gauls invaded<note type="margin">B.C. 299</note> their borders and diverted them for a little while from their purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>afterwards</reg>, putting their trust in money, of which they had great store, they endeavoured to convert the Gauls from enemies into friends, to the end that, uniting the Gallic army with their own, they might fight the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> barbarians made no objection to an alliance: it was only a question of price. <reg>when</reg> this had been agreed upon and received, and the Etruscans, having completed the rest of their preparations for the war, bade their new allies follow them, the Gauls demurred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>they</reg> had made no bargain, they said, for a war with Rome; whatever they had received had been.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> in consideration of their not devastating the Etruscan territory and molesting its inhabitants; nevertheless they would take the field, if the Etruscans were bent on having them, but on one condition only &mdash;that the Etruscans admit them to a share in their land, where they might settle at last in a permanent home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>many</reg> councils of the peoples of Etruria were held to consider this offer, but nothing could be resolved upon, not so much from a reluctance to see their territory lessened as because everyone shrank from having men of so savage a race for neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>so</reg> the Gauls were dismissed, and departed with a vast sum of money, acquired without any toil or risk. <name>The</name> Romans were alarmed by the rumour of a Gallic rising in addition to a war with the Etruscans, and lost no time in concluding a treaty with the people of Picenum.<note>Now mentioned for the first time by Livy.</note></p>

					<name>The</name> command in Etruria fell by lot to Titus<note type="margin">B.C. 298</note> Manlius the consul. <reg>he</reg> had barely entered the <pb id="p.397"/>territory of the enemy, and was exercising with the<note type="margin">B.C. 298</note> cavalry, when, in wheeling his horse about after a swift gallop, he was thrown
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> and ere long breathed his last, for the third day following the accident saw the end of the consul's life. <reg>taking</reg> this as an omen of the war, and declaring that the gods had begun hostilities in their behalf, the Etruscans plucked up courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>it</reg> was sad news to the Romans; not only could they ill spare the man, but his death occurred at an embarrassing moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> Fathers would have ordered the nomination of a dictator had not the election held to choose a substitute for the consul fallen out in accordance with the wishes of the leaders. <name>Marcus</name> Valerius was the choice of all the centuries for consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>it</reg> was he whom the senate had intended to have named as dictator, and they now commanded him to proceed forthwith to the legions in Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>his</reg> arrival so damped the ardour of the Etruscans that none ventured outside their fortifications, and their own fear was like a besieging host. <reg>nor</reg> could the new consul entice them into giving battle by wasting their lands and firing their buildings, though the smoke was rising on every side from the conflagration not only of farm &mdash;houses but of many villages as well.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><reg>while</reg> this war was prolonged beyond anticipation, another war &mdash;justly dreaded by reason of the many losses which the parties to it had inflicted on each other &mdash;was beginning to be talked of in consequence of information given by the Picentes, Rome's new allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> Samnites, they said, were looking to arms and a renewal of hostilities, and had solicited their help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> Picentes were thanked, and the senate's anxiety was diverted, in great measure, from Etruria to the Samnites.</p> <pb id="p.399"/>
				<p><name>The</name> citizens were also concerned at the dearness<note type="margin">B.C. 298</note> of provisions, and would have experienced the direst need, as those writers have recorded who are pleased to represent Fabius Maximus as having been aedile in that year, if that heroic man, who had on many occasions managed military undertakings, had not at this juncture shown himself equally expert in the administration of the market and the purchase and importation of corn.<note>This is said to be the first recorded instance of the aediles being charged with the oversight of the City's foodsupply.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>in</reg> this year &mdash;for no cause assigned &mdash;there befell an interregnum. <name>The</name> interreges were Appius Claudius, and afterwards Publius Sulpicius. <name>The</name> latter held a consular election, and announced that the choice had fallen on Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Gnaeus Fulvius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><reg>in</reg> the beginning of this year Lucanian envoys came to the new consuls to complain that the Samnites, since they had been unable by offering inducements to entice them into an armed alliance, had invaded their territories with a hostile army and by warring on them were obliging them to go to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>The</name> people of Lucania, they said, had on a former occasion strayed all too far from the path of duty, but were now so resolute as to deem it better to endure and suffer anything than ever again to offend the Romans.<note>The Lucanians had entered upon friendly relations with the Romans in <date value="-326">326 B.C.</date> (viii. xxv. 3), but had been seduced from their loyalty by the Samnites (viii. xxvii. 10). A Roman army invaded them in 317 (ix. xx. 9).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>they</reg> besought the Fathers both to take the Lucanians under their protection and to defend them from the violence and oppression of the Samnites. <reg>though</reg> their having gone to war with the Etruscans was necessarily a pledge of loyalty to the Romans, yet they were none the less ready to give hostages.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<reg>discussion</reg> in the senate was soon over. <reg>every</reg> opinion was for entering into a treaty with <pb id="p.401"/>Lucania and demanding satisfaction of the Samnites.<note type="margin">B.C. 298</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> Lucanians received a friendly answer, and the league was formed. <reg>fetials</reg> were then sent to command the Samnites to leave the country belonging to Rome's allies, and withdraw their army from the territory of Lucania. <reg>they</reg> were met on the way by messengers, whom the Samnites had dispatched to warn them that if they went before any Samnite council they would not depart unscathed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>when</reg> these things were known at Rome, the senate advised and the people voted a declaration of war against the Samnites.<note>This was the so &mdash;called Third Samnite War.</note></p> 
				<p><name>The</name> consuls divided the commands between them, Scipio getting Etruria and Fulvius the Samnites, and set out for their respective wars. <name>Scipio</name> looked forward to a slow campaign like that of the previous year, but was met near Volaterrae by the enemy drawn up in
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> column.<note>The phrase <hi rend="italics">instructor agmine</hi> seems to be used of a column formed for marching in such a way that the soldiers merely by executing a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> (or <hi rend="italics">left</hi>) <hi rend="italics">face</hi> would constitute a battle &mdash;line.</note> <name>The</name> fighting, which lasted for the best part of a day, was attended with heavy losses on
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> both sides; and night came on while it was yet uncertain to which nation victory had been vouchsafed. <name>The</name> morning showed who was victor and who vanquished, for in the silence of the night the Etruscans
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> had decamped. <name>The</name> Romans marched out into line of battle; and when they saw that the enemy by his retreat had conceded their superiority, they advanced and possessed themselves of the camp, which was unoccupied and contained much booty, for it had been a permanent post and had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> hurriedly abandoned. <name>Scipio</name> then led his troops back into the Faliscan territory, and having left his baggage with a small guard in Falerii, set out with <pb id="p.403"/>his army in light marching order to ravage the<note type="margin">B.C. 298</note> territory of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the enemy. <name>The</name> whole country was laid waste with fire and sword and booty was brought in from all directions. <reg>not</reg> only was the soil left bare for the enemy, but even strongholds and villages were burned. <name>The</name> consul stopped short of attacking the walled towns, into which the frightened Etruscans had fled
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for refuge.</p> 
				<p><name>The</name> other consul, Gnaeus Fulvius, fought a famous battle in Samnium, near Bovianum, and gained a victory that was by no means doubtful. <reg>he</reg> then attacked and captured Bovianum, and not long afterwards Aufidena.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<reg>a</reg> colony was founded in that same year at Carseoli in the land of the Aequicoli.<note>We had already been told of the colony at Carseoli in chap. iii. &sect; 2. Livy seems here to be following a different authority, and perhaps a better one, as the town is here correctly located among the Aequicoli (mentioned in I. xxxii. 5 as an ancient tribe from whom Ancus Marcius copied the ritual of the fetials) instead of among the Marsi.</note> <name>The</name> consul Fulvius triumphed over the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>as</reg> the consular elections drew near, a rumour arose that the Etruscans and the Samnites were levying huge forces;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it was said that in all their councils the leaders of the Etruscans were openly censured for not having brought the Gauls into the war, on whatever terms; and the Samnite magistrates were attacked for having confronted the Romans with an army raised to oppose a Lucanian foe;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> thus their enemies were girding themselves for war, in their own might and the might of their allies, and they would have to contend with them on far from even terms.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>this</reg> danger, though illustrious men were candidates for the consulship, made everyone tum to Quintus Fabius Maximus, who was not a candidate, in the first place, and who, when he saw the direction of the people's wishes, actually refused to stand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>why</reg> must they trouble him, he asked, <pb id="p.405"/>who was an old man now and had done with<note type="margin">B.C. 298</note> toil and the rewards of toil? <reg>neither</reg> his body nor his mind retained their vigour undiminished, and he feared Fortune herself, lest some god might deem that she had already been too kind to him and more constant than human beings were meant to find her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>he</reg> himself had risen to the glory of his elders, and he rejoiced to see others growing up to the measure of his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>there</reg> was no lack of great offices in Rome for the bravest men, nor of brave men for the offices.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>such</reg> moderation but intensified the well &mdash;merited enthusiasm of his friends; and Fabius, thinking that it would have to be restrained by respect for the laws, bade read aloud the statute which prohibited the re &mdash;election of the same man to the consulship within ten years.<note>The statute dated from <date value="-342">342 B.C.</date> and applied equally to all magistracies, but was frequently disregarded. <reg>as</reg> Fabius had not been consul since 308, his election now would not have contravened the statute, and Luterbacher suggests that the story may have originated in connexion with the election of two years before (chap. ix. &sect; 10).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>whereupon</reg> there was such a clamouring that the law could scarce be heard, and the tribunes of the plebs declared that it should be no impediment, for they would propose to the people that he be granted a dispensation from the laws. <name>Fabius</name>, for his part, stoutly persisted in his refusal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>what</reg>, in that case, he demanded, was the good of making laws, when their very makers broke them? <name>The</name> laws were no longer in control, but were themselves controlled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>nevertheless</reg> the people proceeded to the election, and every century, as it was summoned within, in no uncertain terms named Fabius consul.<note>There was an enclosure (the <hi rend="italics">saepta</hi>) in the Campus Martius, into which the centuries were summoned, and there, one by one, proclaimed their choice.</note> <reg>then</reg> at last, overborne by the consent of all the citizens, <quote><reg>may</reg> Heaven,</quote> he said, "approve, Quirites, of what you are doing and propose to do.

					<reg>while</reg> the new consuls, Quintus Fabius<note type="margin">B.C. 297</note> Maximus (in his fourth term) and Publius Decius Mus (in his third), were laying plans together how one should take the field against the Samnites,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> and the other against the Etruscans, and were considering what forces would suffice for these respective provinces and which of them was the better suited to the one command and which to
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the other, there came deputies from Sutrium and Nepete and Falerii, with the news that the nations of Etruria were counselling together how they might sue for peace, and thus diverted upon Samnium the whole burden of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>when</reg> the consuls set out, in order to lessen the difficulty of getting supplies and to keep the enemy uncertain where the attack would come, Fabius marched into Samnium by way of Sora, Decius through the territory of the Sidicini.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>arrived</reg> at the borders of the enemy, each spread his army over a wide front and pillaged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>yet</reg> they scouted more widely than they pillaged, and the enemy were therefore unable to surprise them near Tifernum, where they had drawn their forces up in a secluded valley, and were preparing to assail the Romans from above, once they should have <pb id="p.409"/>entered it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>removing</reg> the baggage to a place of<note type="margin">B.C. 297</note> safety and appointing a small force to guard it, Fabius warned his troops that a struggle was at hand, and forming them into a hollow square, led them up towards the place where the enemy lay, as I have said, concealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>balked</reg> of their surprise attack, the Samnites &mdash;since it must ultimately come to an open trial of strength &mdash;likewise preferred to fight a regular engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>they</reg> accordingly descended to level ground, and committed their cause to Fortune, with courage greater than their hopes. <reg>however</reg>, whether owing to their having assembled the fighting strength of all the Samnite nations, or because a contest on which everything was staked heightened their valour, they occasioned some perturbation amongst the Romans, even in an open battle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>when</reg> Fabius saw that the enemy were nowhere giving way, he ordered Maximus his son<note>Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, aedile two years later (chap. xxxi. &sect; 9) and consul <date value="-293">293 B.C.</date> (chap. xlvii. &sect; 5).</note> and Marcus Valerius &mdash;military tribunes with whom he had hurried to the front &mdash;to
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> go to the horsemen and tell them that if they remembered ever an occasion when the state had been helped by the horse, now was the time for them to exert their strength to preserve untarnished the glory of that body:
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> in the struggle of infantry the enemy were yielding not an inch; no hope remained save in a charge of cavalry. <reg>addressing</reg> each of the young men by name, lie loaded them now with praise and now with promises.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>but</reg> since it was conceivable that even their prowess might prove to be inadequate, he thought proper to resort to strategy, if strength <pb id="p.411"/>should not achieve his purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>so</reg> he ordered<note type="margin">B.C. 297</note> Scipio, his lieutenant, to withdraw the <hi rend="italics">hastati<note>These <quote>spearmen</quote> formed the first of the three lines of battle, but would ordinarily after being engaged a little while be reinforced or replaced (as here) by the <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> (second line troops).</note></hi> of the first legion from the battle and conduct them, as secretly as possible, by a circuitous route to the nearest mountains; they were then, concealing their ascent from observation, to climb the heights and suddenly show themselves on the enemy's rear.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/><name>The</name> cavalry, led by the tribunes, occasioned hardly more confusion in their enemies than in their friends, as they rode out unexpectedly in front of the standards.

					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>this</reg> gave the enemy a fresh access of spirits; and the front ranks would have been incapable of sustaining so long a struggle and the increasing violence with which the enemy's confidence inspired him, had not the second line, by the consul's order, come up to relieve them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>their</reg> fresh strength halted the Samnites, who were now pressing forward; and catching sight just at this juncture of our detachments descending from the mountains, and hearing the cheer they gave, the enemy was filled with terror of worse things than actually threatened him;

					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> the legions were at hand; and this mistake, occurring in a good hour for the Romans, filled the Samnites with fear and bewilderment, for they dreaded nothing so much as that the other army, fresh and entire, might overwhelm them in their exhausted <pb id="p.413"/>state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> <name>The</name> slaughter was less than is usual in so<note type="margin">B.C. 297</note> great a victory, for the enemy scattered far and wide in their flight. <reg>three</reg> thousand four hundred were slain; about eight hundred and thirty were made prisoners, and twenty &mdash;three standards were taken.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>in</reg> this instance also the rout was greater than the slaughter: two thousand Apulians were killed, and Decius, scorning such an enemy, led his legions into Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>there</reg> the two consular armies, overrunning the land in different directions, had laid all waste within four months' time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>there</reg> were forty &mdash;five places in Samnium where Decius had encamped; the other consul had encamped in eighty &mdash;six.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>nor</reg> did they leave behind them only the traces of their ramparts and their trenches, but other much more conspicuous memorials, in the havoc and devastation of the country round about. <name>Fabius</name> also captured the city of Cimetra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>in</reg> this siege two thousand nine hundred men &mdash;at &mdash;arms were taken and some nine hundred and thirty were slain fighting.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><reg>after</reg> this he set out for Rome for the election, which he made haste to call. <name>The</name> centuries that voted first were all naming Quintus Fabius for consul, when Appius Claudius, who was a
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> candidate for that post and a pushing and ambitious man, but no more eager to gain the honour for himself than to have the patricians recover two consular places, exerted his own strength and that of the whole nobility to induce them to elect him as Fabius's <pb id="p.415"/>colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Fabius</name> would not have it so, raising<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> virtually the same objections he had raised in the previous year. <name>The</name> nobles all thronged about his seat, and besought him to lift up the consulship out of the plebeian mire and restore both to the office and to the aristocratic families their old &mdash;time dignity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>obtaining</reg> silence, Fabius soothed their excited feelings with a temperate speech, in which he said that he would have done as they desired and have received the names of two patricians, if he had seen another than himself being made consul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> as it was, he would not entertain his own name at an election, for to do so would violate the laws and establish a most evil precedent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>so</reg> Lucius Volumnius, a plebeian, was returned, together with Appius Claudius, with whom he had also been paired in an earlier consulship.<note><date value="-307">307 B.C.</date> (ix. xlii. 2).</note> <name>The</name> nobles taunted Fabius with having avoided Appius Claudius for a colleague, as a man clearly his superior in eloquence and statecraft.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<name>The</name> election over, the old consuls were bidden to carry on the war in Samnium, having received an extension of their command for six months.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>so</reg> in the following year likewise &mdash;the consulship of Lucius Volumnius and Appius Claudius &mdash;Publius Decius, who had been left behind in Samnium, when consul, by his colleague, ceased not as proconsul to lay waste the farms, until finally he forced the army of the Samnites &mdash;which would nowhere risk a battle &mdash;to withdraw from the country.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><reg>they</reg> retreated into Etruria, and thinking that what they had often tried in vain to bring about by means of embassies they might with so great <pb id="p.417"/>a body of armed men and the menace which would<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> be added to their entreaties accomplish more effectually, called for a council of the Etruscan leaders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>on</reg> its assembling, they pointed out for how many years they had been fighting with the Romans for their liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>they</reg> had made every effort, they said, if haply they might of their own strength bear up under so great a war; and had also &mdash;but to little purpose &mdash;made trial of the help of neighbouring nations. <reg>unable</reg> to sustain the war, they had sought peace of the Roman People; but had renewed hostilities, because peace with servitude was harder to endure than war with liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>their</reg> sole remaining hope lay in the Etruscans, whom they knew for the richest nation of Italy, in arms, in men, and in money; a nation, too, that marched with the Gauls, men born amid the clash of arms and possessing not only an instinctive love of fighting but a feeling of enmity to the Roman People, whose defeat at their hands and ransom for gold they were wont to relate with no idle boast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>if</reg> the Etruscans had the spirit that once had animated Porsinna<note>See II. ix.-xv.</note> and their forefathers, there was no reason why they should not expel the Romans from all the country north of the Tiber, and compel them to fight, not for an intolerable sovereignty over Italy, but for their own existence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>here</reg> was a Samnite army, provided with arms and pay, and ready to follow on the instant, though they should lead it to the assault of Rome itself.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<reg>while</reg> they were thus boasting and intriguing in Etruria, the Roman invasion was distressing their countrymen at home. <reg>for</reg> Publius Decius, having <pb id="p.419"/>ascertained through scouts that the Samnite army<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> had departed, summoned a council, and said, <quote><reg>why</reg> do we range about the countryside, bringing war to this, that, and the other village?
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>why</reg> do we not assail cities and walled towns? <reg>there</reg> is no longer any army defending Samnium; they have withdrawn beyond their borders, sentenced to banishment by their own decree.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>with</reg> their unanimous approval he led them to the assault of Murgantia, a strong city; and such was the ardour of the troops, by reason both of affection for their general and the hopes that they entertained of greater booty than was to be got by ranging the country, that they took the place by force of arms in a single day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>there</reg> two thousand one hundred Samnites were surrounded and made prisoners as they fought, and vast spoils of other kinds were seized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>lest</reg> these should encumber the marching army with heavy baggage, Decius called the soldiers together and thus addressed them: <quote><reg>will</reg> this single victory or these spoils content you? <reg>will</reg> your expectations not be equal to your courage? <reg>all</reg> the cities of the Samnites and the riches left behind in them are yours, since, after defeating their legions in so many battles, you have in the end expelled them from their country.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>sell</reg> these prizes and with hope of gain lure the traders on to follow your column; I will find you from time to time wares to dispose of.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>let</reg> us go from here to the city Romulea, where no greater toil awaits you, but greater booty.</quote></p> 
				<p><name>The</name> booty was sold off, and the men themselves urging on their general, they marched to Romulea. <reg>there</reg>, too, they used no siege &mdash;works or artillery; but once they had come up under the walls, no force <pb id="p.421"/>could constrain them to retire; quickly setting up<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> their ladders at the nearest places, they swarmed over the battlements.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>The</name> town was captured and sacked; two thousand three hundred were slain and six thousand made prisoners, and the soldiers came into possession of huge spoils which they were obliged, as before, to sell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>after</reg> that they marched with the utmost alacrity &mdash;though they had been allowed no time to rest &mdash;to Ferentinum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>but</reg> there they encountered more difficulty and danger: the city was defended with the utmost energy, and fortification and nature had combined to make it safe; yet all obstacles were overcome by a soldiery grown used to plunder. <reg>some</reg> three thousand of the enemy were slain about the walls; the spoils went to the men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><reg>of</reg> the glory accruing from these sieges the larger share is in certain annals assigned to Maximus; they allow that Murgantia was stormed by Decius, but give to Fabius Ferentinum and Romulea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>there</reg> are those who claim the credit for the new consuls, and some give it not to both but to one of them, Lucius Volumnius, to whom, they say, fell the command in Samnium.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<reg>whilst</reg> these operations were being carried out in Samnium &mdash;whoever had the command and auspices &mdash;a mighty war was preparing against the Romans in Etruria, on the part of many nations, at the instigation of a Samnite named Gellius Egnatius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> Tuscans had almost all voted for war; the nearest Umbrian tribes had caught the contagion; and Gallic auxiliaries were being solicited for pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>all</reg> this multitude was assembling at the camp of the Samnites. <reg>when</reg> news of this sudden rising <pb id="p.423"/>was brought to Rome, Lucius Volumnius the consul,<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> with the second and third legions and fifteen thousand of the allies, had already set out for Samnium, and it was resolved to send Appius Claudius into Etruria at the earliest possible moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>two</reg> Roman legions followed him, the first and fourth, and twelve thousand of the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>they</reg> encamped not far from the enemy.<note>This is the first time that Livy has designated the legions by number. <reg>a</reg> consular army regularly comprised two legions (with their cavalry and auxiliaries), but in the present instance the consular armies of the previous year are still in the field.</note></p> 
				<p><reg>but</reg> the consul's prompt arrival accomplished more, by checking, through dread of the Roman name, certain peoples of Etruria that were already meditating war, than he gained by his generalship, which was characterized neither by much ability nor by good fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>he</reg> repeatedly joined battle at untoward times and places, and the enemy grew every day more hopeful and more formidable, until now the soldiers were near losing confidence in their commander and he in them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>i</reg> find it recorded by three annalists that he dispatched a letter sending for his colleague out of Samnium; yet am I loath to set it down for certain, since the consuls of the Roman People, now holding that office for the second time, disputed about that very point-Appius denying that he had sent a letter, Volumnius affirming that a letter from Appius had summoned him.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><name>Volumnius</name> had already captured three fortresses in Samnium, in which some three thousand of the enemy had been slain and about half as many taken prisoners; and dispatching Quintus Fabius as proconsul with a seasoned army into Lucania, he had suppressed &mdash;with the hearty approval of the optimates &mdash;certain insurrections which had broken out there at the instigation of necessitous plebeian agitators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>leaving</reg> to Decius the devastation of <pb id="p.425"/>the fields, Volumnius himself with his own troops<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> marched to join his colleague in Etruria, where he was welcomed on his arrival with general rejoicings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>but</reg> what Appius was feeling his conscience alone could tell! &mdash;indeed he was justly angered if he had sent no word, but illiberal and ungracious if he had needed help and now sought to dissemble &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> coming forth to meet his colleague, before they had fairly greeted one another, he demanded, <quote><reg>is</reg> all well, Lucius Volumnius? <reg>how</reg> stand affairs in Samnium? <reg>what</reg> has moved you to come out of your own province?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>Volumnius</name> replied that affairs were prospering in Samnium, and that he was come being sent for by Appius' own letter; but if this were a forgery and he were not needed in Etruria, he would immediately face about and march back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <quote><reg>by</reg> all means go!</quote> cried Appius. <quote><reg>no</reg> one hinders you! <reg>for</reg> truly it is no way fitting that when, perhaps, you are hardly equal to your own war, you should boast of coming hither to help others.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>Volumnius</name> prayed that Hercules might direct all for the best; he had rather, he said, his trouble should go for naught than that anything should have befallen to make one consular army insufficient for Etruria.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<name>The</name> consuls were parting, when the lieutenants and tribunes from the army of Appius gathered round them. <reg>some</reg> of them besought their general not to spurn his colleague's help &mdash;which
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> ought even to have been asked for &mdash;now that it was proffered voluntarily; the greater number threw themselves in the way of Volumnius, as he turned to go, and conjured him not to betray the welfare of the state by an unworthy quarrel with his colleague:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> if any <pb id="p.427"/>disaster should occur, the blame would lie more<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> with the deserter than the deserted; to such a pass had matters come that the entire credit or disgrace of success or failure in Etruria was referred to Lucius Volumnius;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> no one would enquire what the words of Appius had been, but what the fortune of the army; he was being dismissed by Appius, but retained by the republic and the army; let him but test the wishes of the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>thus</reg> admonishing and entreating them they dragged the all but resisting consuls to the place of assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>there</reg> they spoke at greater length, but substantially to the same effect as they had argued before in the hearing of a few; and when Volumnius, besides having the better cause, likewise showed himself to be no mean orator in opposing the rare
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> eloquence of his colleague, Appius jeeringly remarked that they ought to give himself the credit, for that instead of a mute and tongue &mdash;tied consul they had got one who was actually fluent, since in his former consulship, at all events in its early months, he had been incapable of opening his mouth, but was now delivering popular orations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash; <quote><reg>how</reg> I could wish,</quote> exclaimed Volumnius, <quote>that you might rather have learnt from me to act with vigour than that I should have learnt to speak cleverly from you!</quote> <reg>in</reg> conclusion he proposed a compact which would determine, not which was the better orator &mdash;for this was not what the republic wanted &mdash;but the better general.<note>In their former consulship (<date value="-307">307 B.C.</date>) Volumnius had conducted a successful campaign against the Sallentini, while Appius had been left in Rome without any military command. <reg>see</reg> ix. xlii. 4-5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>Etruria</name> and Samnium were the nations to be conquered; let Appius choose which he liked; with his own army he would campaign either in Etruria or in Samnium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>then</reg> the soldiers began to cry out that both <pb id="p.429"/>should undertake the Etruscan war together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>perceiving</reg><note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> them to be of one mind in this, Volumnius said, <quote><reg>since</reg> I erred in interpreting my colleague's wishes, I will not make the blunder of leaving yours in doubt: do you signify by a shout whether you would have me stay or go.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>then</reg> in truth they cheered so loud that the enemy were drawn out from their camp, and snatching up their arms went down<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> from the higher ground on which their camp lay, into the plain below.</note> into line of battle. <name>Volumnius</name>, too, bade sound the signal and advance the banners from the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Appius</name>, they say, was uncertain what to do, perceiving that, whether he fought or refrained from fighting, the victory would be his colleague's; then, fearing that even his own legions would follow Volumnius, he, too, gave his men the signal for which they were clamouring.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/><reg>on</reg> neither side had the forces been very advantageously marshalled; for the Samnite commander Gellius Egnatius had taken a few cohorts and gone off to forage, and his soldiers were entering the battle more as their own impulse guided them than under
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> anybody's leadership or orders, and the Roman armies were not both led out together nor had they sufficient time to form.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <name>Volumnius</name> was engaged before Appius came within reach of the enemy, and the line of attack was accordingly uneven. <reg>moreover</reg>, as though lots had been cast, there was a shifting of the customary opponents, the Etruscans confronting Volumnius, and the Samnites &mdash;after a little hesitation, owing to the absence of their general &mdash;meeting Appius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>it</reg> is said that when the conflict was at its hottest, Appius was seen to lift up his hands<note>The ancients prayed with the arms outstretched and palms turned upwards.</note> in the very forefront of the standards and utter this petition: <quote><name>Bellona</name>, <pb id="p.431"/>if to &mdash;day thou grant us the victory, then do I vow<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> thee a temple.</quote> <reg>having</reg> pronounced this prayer, as though the goddess were inspiring him, he kept pace with the courage of his colleague and the army kept pace with his.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>and</reg> now the generals were quitting themselves like true commanders, and the soldiers were striving that victory might not come first on the other wing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <reg>they</reg> therefore routed and put to flight the enemy, who found it no easy task to withstand a greater force than they had been wont to engage with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> <reg>pressing</reg> hard upon them when they faltered and pursuing where they fled, the Romans drove them to their camp. <reg>there</reg>, on the appearance of Gellius and the Sabellian cohorts, the battle was renewed for a little while;
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> but presently, when these too had been dispersed, the conquering troops assailed the camp, and while Volumnius himself led a charge against the gate, and Appius, calling from time to time on Bellona, goddess of victory, inspirited his soldiers, they burst through the trenches and the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> <name>The</name> camp was taken and pillaged, and the vast booty found there was given over to the soldiers. <reg>seven</reg> thousand eight hundred of the enemy were slain, two thousand one hundred and twenty taken prisoners.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<reg>while</reg> both consuls and all the strength of Rome were being devoted mainly to the Etruscan war, new armies rose up in Samnium to waste the territories under Roman sway, and crossing over into Campania and the Falernian district, through the land of the Vescini, gathered in huge spoils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>as</reg> Volumnius was returning by long marches into Samnium &mdash;for now the extension of authority granted to Fabius and Decius was drawing to a <pb id="p.433"/>close<note>Their command had been extended for six months (chap. xvi. &sect; 1).</note> &mdash;a rumour about the Samnite army and its<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> depredations in the territory of Campania turned him aside to the defence of the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>when</reg> he came to the Calenian country, he saw for himself the fresh traces of the enemy's ravages, and the Calenians informed him that the Samnites had already so great a train of booty as to march with difficulty, and their leaders were
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> saying openly that they must retire at once into Samnium, and leaving their plunder there, return to the invasion, and not subject an army so heavily burdened to the risks of battle. <name>These</name> reports were plausible enough; nevertheless he thought it right to obtain more authentic information.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>he</reg> therefore sent out horsemen in various directions, to intercept straggling plunderers in the fields, from whom he learned, on questioning them, that
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> their army was encamped at the Volturnus river, whence they would set forward in the third watch and march towards Samnium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><reg>being</reg> satisfied of the truth of these reports, he followed the enemy and encamped at such a distance from them that while they could not learn of his arrival from his being too close at hand, he yet might surprise them as they were leaving their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>a</reg> little before dawn he approached the camp and sent ahead men who knew the Oscan language to find out what was being done. <reg>mingling</reg> with their enemies, as they could easily do in the confusion of the dark, they learned that the standards had gone forward with a scanty following of men &mdash;at &mdash;arms, that the booty and its escort were just setting out, but that the column was incapable of progress, since every man was intent upon his <pb id="p.435"/>own affairs, with no common understanding among<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> any of them nor any very definite leadership.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> time seemed highly suitable for delivering an attack, and the day was breaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>Volumnius</name> therefore ordered them to sound the charge and assailed the enemy's column. <name>The</name> Samnites were impeded by their booty and few of them were armed; some quickened their pace and drove the cattle before them, some stood still, uncertain whether it were safer to go on or to return to camp; while they hesitated, the Romans were upon them, and now they had scaled the rampart and the camp was filled with carnage and commotion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> Samnite column, besides being charged by the enemy, had also been disordered by a sudden outbreak of the prisoners, some of
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> whom, being loose, were releasing those who were bound, while others were catching up the weapons tied up in the soldiers' packs,<note>The Samnites, not anticipating any fighting, had put up their arms in the bundles, which were tied to a pole that was carried on the shoulder.</note> and, mixed up with the column as they were, caused a hurly &mdash;burly that was more terrifying than the battle itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>they</reg> presently performed a remarkable exploit; for as Staius Minatius, the Samnite general, was riding along the ranks and encouraging them, they made a rush at him, and scattering the horsemen who were with him, surrounded him, and hurried him off a prisoner, horse and all, to the Roman consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>this</reg> tumult had the effect of bringing back the vanguard of the Samnites, who renewed the battle, which had been almost finished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>but</reg> prolonged resistance was impossible. <name>The</name> slain amounted to six thousand men, and twenty &mdash;five hundred were captured &mdash;among them four military tribunes &mdash;as well as thirty standards. <reg>what</reg> caused most joy among the victors was the recovery of <pb id="p.437"/>seven thousand four hundred prisoners and a vast<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> quantity of spoils belonging to the allies. <name>The</name> owners were summoned by proclamation to identify and recover their property on an appointed day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>those</reg> things for which no owner appeared were made over to the soldiers, and they were compelled to sell their booty, that they might have no concern in anything but fighting.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<reg>this</reg> raid upon the Campanian countryside had occasioned a great alarm in Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and just at that time, as it happened, there came news out of Etruria, that after the withdrawal of the army of Volumnius the Etruscans had been induced to arm, that Gellius Egnatius, the Samnite general, and the Umbrians were being invited to join in the revolt, and that the Gauls were being tempted with great sums of money.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>terrified</reg> by these reports, the senate ordered that a cessation of the courts should be proclaimed, and that a levy should be held of every sort of men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>not</reg> only was the oath administered to free citizens of military age, but cohorts were also formed out of older men, and freedmen were mustered into centuries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>plans</reg> were discussed for defending the City, and the supreme command was given to the praetor, Publius Sempronius. <reg>but</reg> the senators were relieved of a part of their anxiety by a dispatch from Lucius Volumnius, the consul, apprising them of the slaughter and dispersion of the army that had ravaged Campania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>they</reg> accordingly voted a thanksgiving for the victory, in the consul's name, and reopened the courts, which had been closed for eighteen days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> thanksgiving was a very joyful one.</p> <pb id="p.439"/>
				<p><reg>they</reg> next considered how they might protect<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> the region devastated by the Samnites, and resolved to plant two colonies in the Vescinian and Falernian country,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> one, which was named Minturnae, at the mouth of the river Liris, the other in the Vescinian forest,<note>Perhaps situated between <hi rend="italics"><reg>mons</reg> Massicus</hi> and the sea on the heights of <hi rend="italics"><reg>mondragone</reg>.</hi></note> hard by the Falernian district, where the Greek city of Sinope is said to have stood, thereafter called Sinuessa by the Roman settlers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> tribunes of the plebs were assigned the task of obtaining a plebiscite directing Publius Sempronius the praetor to appoint three commissioners to conduct the colonists to these places;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> yet it was not easy to find men who would enroll, since they regarded themselves as sent, not to settle on the land, but to serve almost as a perpetual outpost in a hostile territory.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><name>The</name> senate's attention was diverted from these cares by the growing seriousness of the war in Etruria, and by a succession of dispatches from Appius, in which he warned them not to make light of the disturbance in that region.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>four</reg> races, he said, were uniting their arms, the Etruscans, Samnites, Umbrians, and Gauls; and they had already divided their camp into two, one place not being able to hold so great a multitude.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>for</reg> these reasons and because of the elections &mdash;the time for which was rapidly approaching &mdash;the consul Lucius Volumnius was recalled to Rome. <reg>before</reg> summoning the centuries to vote, he brought the people together in an assembly, and discoursed at length of the magnitude of the war in Etruria:
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> even earlier, when he himself and his colleague had campaigned there together, the war had been so great that one general and one army could not have conducted it; <pb id="p.441"/>but it was said that the Umbrians had since then<note type="margin">B.C. 296</note> been added to the enemy's forces, as well as a huge army of Gauls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> they should remember that on that day they were choosing consuls to oppose four peoples; for his own part, were he not confident that the Roman People would unanimously choose for consul the man who was then looked upon as unquestionably the first of all commanders, he would at once have named him dictator.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<reg>no</reg> one doubted that Fabius would by the<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> common voice of all be for the fifth time elected; and in fact the prerogative centuries and all those which were summoned first<note>The <hi rend="italics">praerogativae</hi> were the 18 centuries of knights; the others here referred to were the 80 centuries of the first class, <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> I. xliii. 11.</note> were naming him consul, together with Lucius Volumnius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>Fabius</name> then made a speech, to the same purport as he had done two years before; but, overborne by the general agreement, he ended by requesting that he might have for colleague Publius Decius, who would be a prop to his old age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>in</reg> the censorship and the two consulships which he had shared with Decius, he had found that nothing more tended to the preservation of the commonwealth than the harmony of colleagues. <reg>to</reg> a new partner in authority he could now hardly hope to adapt an old man's mind: with one whose character he knew, it would be easier to share his counsels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>his</reg> plea was seconded by the consul, who bestowed well &mdash;merited
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> praise on Publius Decius, and recalling the advantages that accrued from harmony betwixt the consuls to the administration of military measures and the harm that resulted from their discord, reminded his hearers how dire had been the danger occasioned lately by the strife between himself and his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>Decius</name> and Fabius, he said, were of one heart and <pb id="p.443"/>one mind, and were, besides, men born for war,<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> great in their deeds, but unskilled in the strife of words and of the tongue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>theirs</reg> were talents meet for the consul's office. <reg>but</reg> shrewd and clever men, masters of the law and of eloquence, like Appius Claudius, should be had to preside over the City and the Forum,<note>Where the law &mdash;courts were held.</note> and should be elected praetors to administer
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> justice. <reg>with</reg> these transactions the day was taken
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> up. <reg>on</reg> the following day, by the direction of the consul, elections were held both of consuls and of praetors. <name>Quintus</name> Fabius and Publius Decius were chosen consuls and Appius Claudius praetor &mdash;all three being absent<note>Fabius and Decius can only have been absent from the voting place, but Appius was away from Rome.</note> &mdash;and the senate passed a decree, which the people ratified, prolonging for a year the command of Lucius Volumnius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<reg>in</reg> that year were many portents, to avert which the senate decreed supplications for two days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>wine</reg> and incense were provided by the state, and the people went in throngs to offer their prayers -both men and women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> supplication was rendered memorable by a quarrel that broke out among the matrons in the chapel of Patrician Modesty, which stands in the Cattle Market, by the round temple of Hercules.<note>It is likely that the tradition of a shrine to Pudicitia in the Forum Boarium is due to a confusion of this goddess with Fortuna Virgo, who had a chapel there near the temple of Mater Matuta (a birth
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;goddess), and was, like her, a woman's goddess. <reg>young</reg> brides dedicated to her their maiden's dress, on marrying, and the mistake was favoured by the unusual circumstance that the image of Fortuna Virgo was veiled. <name>The</name> story preserved by Livy is an attempt to explain the epithet of Pudicitia Plebeia (&sect; 7). See Wissowa, <hi rend="italics"><reg>religion</reg> und Kultus der R&ouml;mer</hi> (1912.2), pp. 257, 333.</note> <name>Verginia</name>, Aulus's daughter, a patrician wedded to a commoner, Lucius Volumnius the consul, had been excluded by the matrons from their ceremonies, on the ground that she had married out of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> patriciate. <reg>this</reg> led to a short dispute, which the hot anger of the sex soon kindled to a blaze of passionate contention. <pb id="p.445"/><name>Verginia</name> boasted, and with reason, that she had<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> entered the temple of Patrician Modesty both a patrician and a modest woman, as having been wedded to the one man to whom she had been given as a maiden, and was neither ashamed of her husband nor of his honours and his
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> victories. <reg>she</reg> then added a noble deed to her proud words. <reg>in</reg> the Vicus Longus, where she lived, she shut off a part of her mansion, large enough for a shrine of moderate size, and, erecting there
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> an altar, called together the plebeian matrons, and after complaining of the injurious behaviour of the patrician ladies, said, <quote><reg>i</reg> dedicate this altar to Plebeian
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Modesty; and I urge you, that even as the men of our state contend for the meed of valour, so the matrons may vie for that of modesty, that this altar may be said to be cherished &mdash;if it be possible &mdash;more reverently than that, and by more modest
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> women.</quote> <reg>this</reg> altar, too, was served with almost the same ritual as that more ancient one, so that no matron but one of proven modesty, who had been wedded to one man alone, should have the right to
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> sacrifice. <reg>afterwards</reg> the cult was degraded by polluted worshippers, not matrons only but women of every station, and passed finally into
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> oblivion.</p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> that same year Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius the curule aediles brought a number of usurers to
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> trial, and, confiscating their possessions, employed the share which came into the public treasury to put brazen thresholds in the Capitol, and silver vessels for the three tables in the shrine of Jupiter, and a statue of the god in a four &mdash;horse chariot on the roof, and at the fig &mdash;tree Ruminalis<note>Popular etymology made <hi rend="italics"><name>Ruminalis</name></hi> come from <hi rend="italics"><reg>romularis</reg></hi> and that from <hi rend="italics"><name>Romulus</name>.</hi> <reg>it</reg> was in the overflow of the Tiber near this fig &mdash;tree that the twins were exposed (I. iv. 5).</note> a representation of the infant Founders of the City being <pb id="p.447"/>suckled by the wolf. <reg>they</reg> also made a paved walk<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> of squared stone from the Porta Capena to the temple
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> of Mars. <reg>and</reg> the plebeian aediles Lucius Aelius Paetus and Gaius Fulvius Curvus, likewise with the money from fines, which they exacted from convicted graziers,<note>Convicted probably of using for grazing purposes more of the public domain than they were legally entitled to control.</note> held games and provided golden bowls for the temple of Ceres.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<reg>after</reg> that Quintus Fabius (for the fifth time) and Publius Decius (for the fourth) began their consulship, having thrice been colleagues in that office and once in the censorship,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> and being not more distinguished for the renown, great though that was, of their achievements than for their harmonious co &mdash;operation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>this</reg>, however, was not destined to be permanent, though its interruption was due, I think, more to rivalry between the orders than to their own; for the patricians strove that Fabius should have the command in Etruria without drawing lots, and the plebeians insisted that Decius should demand that method of determining the question.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>at</reg> all events there was a contention in the senate, and Fabius proving to be the stronger there, the case was carried before the people. <reg>in</reg> the assembly the speeches were short, as befitted soldiers and men who trusted more to deeds than to words.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><name>Fabius</name> argued that when one man had planted a tree, it was unfair that another should gather the fruit that dropped from it; it was he that had opened up the Ciminian Forest and had made a path for Roman arms through remote and desert tracts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>why</reg>, pray, had they troubled him, old as he was, if they had meant to wage the war with another general?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>it</reg> was only too clear, he said &mdash; <pb id="p.449"/>taking gradually a more reproachful tone &mdash;that he<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> had selected an adversary, not a partner in command, and that Decius had begrudged the friendly spirit in which they had administered three offices together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>finally</reg>, he asked no more than that if they thought him worthy of the command they should give it to him; he had submitted to the decision of the senate and would obey the people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><name>Publius</name> Decius complained of the senate's injustice: as long as they were able, the Fathers had striven to deny the plebeians access to great honours; and since native worth had of its own strength won the right to be recognized in any class of men, they were seeking to make of none effect not only
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the suffrages of, the people but also the awards of Fortune, and to subject them to the control of a few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>all</reg> the consuls who had preceded him had drawn lots for their commands, but the senate was now conferring a command on Fabius without the lot. <reg>if</reg> they were doing this to honour him, he would say that the man had deserved so well both of
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> himself and of the state that he stood ready to promote the glory of Fabius, provided only that its lustre were not purchased with insult to himself. <reg>but</reg> who could doubt, when there was one difficult, dangerous war, and this was entrusted without lots to one of the consuls, that the other was regarded as superfluous and useless?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Fabius</name> gloried in his Etruscan victories: Publius Decius would fain glory too. <reg>and</reg> perhaps that fire which Fabius had left covered up, but so that it was continually breaking out into new flames, might be by him extinguished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>in</reg> short he was willing, for the reverence he bore his colleague's years and dignity, to yield to him <pb id="p.451"/>honours and rewards; but when peril, when strife,<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> was set before them &mdash;he yielded not, of his own consent &mdash;nor ever would.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>and</reg> if he got nothing else by this contest, one thing at any rate he would get &mdash;that what belonged to the people should be disposed of by the people, not bestowed by the Fathers as a favour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>to</reg> Jupiter Optimus Maximus and the immortal gods he prayed that they would grant him an equal chance in the lot with his colleague only if they were ready to grant him the same courage and the same good fortune in the administration of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <reg>at</reg> least it was a thing in its nature reasonable, in its example salutary, and material to the reputation of the Roman People, that the consuls should be such that the Etruscan war could be managed aright under the leadership of either one of them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/><name>Fabius</name> only prayed the Roman people to listen, before the tribes were called to vote, to a dispatch of Appius Claudius the praetor that had been brought in from Etruria. <reg>he</reg> then left the comitium, and the people then, as unanimously as the senate had done, decreed that Fabius should have the command in Etruria without drawing lots.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<reg>nearly</reg> all the younger men now flocked about the consul, and each gave in his name, so eager were they to serve under such a captain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>surrounded</reg> by this throng he said, <quote><reg>i</reg> have in mind to enrol no more than four thousand foot and six hundred horse; I will take with me those of you who give in your names to &mdash;day and to &mdash;morrow.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>I</name>am more concerned to bring all my men back with their purses filled than to wage war with many soldiers.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>marching</reg> out with a fit army, which was <pb id="p.453"/>all the more confident and hopeful because he had<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> not desired a great host, he took his way towards the town of Aharna,<note>Probably= Arna, across the Tiber from Perusia, and about six miles due east of it.</note> from which the enemy were not far distant, to the camp of Appius the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>a</reg> few miles this side the camp he encountered some men who had come out with an armed escort to gather wood. <name>These</name> people, seeing the lictors in the van and learning that Fabius was consul, with lively manifestations of satisfaction gave thanks to the gods and to the Roman People for having sent him to be their general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>then</reg>, as they trooped about him and hailed him consul, Fabius asked whither they were bound, and they answered that they were come out to get wood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <quote><reg>is</reg> it possible,</quote> he cried, <quote>that you have no rampart round your camp?</quote> and, on their shouting back that they had a double rampart and a trench and yet were in mortal fear, <quote><reg>then</reg> you have quite wood enough,</quote> said he; <quote><hi rend="italics">go</hi> back and pull up your stockade.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> for use as firewood.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Returning to camp they began pulling up the palings, to the terror of their comrades who had stayed behind, as
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> well as of Appius himself, till the news was spread, as each talked with his neighbours, that they were acting under orders of the consul Quintus Fabius. <reg>on</reg> the morrow the camp was removed and the praetor Appius was sent away to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>thenceforward</reg> the Romans had no permanent camp anywhere. <reg>it</reg> was of no use, Fabius maintained, for the army to sit down in one place: by marching and shifting its position it grew more mobile and more healthy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> marches, of course, were such as could be made at a season when winter was not yet over.</p> 
				<p><reg>in</reg> the early spring, leaving the second legion in <pb id="p.455"/>the neighbourhood of Clusium &mdash;which they used of<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> old to call Camars &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> putting Lucius Scipio, as propraetor, in charge of the camp, Fabius himself returned to Rome to consult about the war, either voluntarily, because he had a task in prospect that was greater than he had believed the reports to signify, or, it may be, summoned by the senate; for both accounts are vouched for.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>some</reg> would have it appear that he was compelled to return by Appius Claudius the praetor, who continued to exaggerate the perils of the Etruscan war in the senate and before the people, as he had done persistently in his dispatches.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>it</reg> was not enough, he said, to have one commander and one army against four nations: the danger was &mdash;whether they united to overwhelm him or campaigned separately &mdash;that one man would be incapable of meeting simultaneously all emergencies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>he</reg> himself had left on the ground two Roman legions, and less than five thousand infantry and cavalry had come with Fabius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <reg>it</reg> was his opinion that Publius Decius the consul should march at the very earliest moment to Etruria, to join his colleague, and that Lucius Volumnius should be given the command in Samnium; or, if the consul preferred to go out to his own province, that Volumnius should set out for Etruria with a regular consular army.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> two Roman legions with the usual complement of cavalry and allies.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <name>The</name> majority were moved by the praetor's speech, but Publius Decius &mdash;so they say &mdash;advised that all be left to the free and unhampered judgment of Quintus Fabius, until Fabius should either come to Rome himself &mdash;if this were compatible with public policy &mdash;or
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> send some one of his lieutenants, to inform the senate how great a war was on foot <pb id="p.457"/>in Etruria, and with what forces, commanded by<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> how many generals, it ought to be conducted.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<name>Fabius</name>, when he returned to Rome, both in the senate and afterwards in speaking to the people, steered a middle course, that he might appear neither to exaggerate the current reports about the war nor minimize them, and in accepting an additional commander to be rather consulting the fears of others than guarding against a danger to himself or the republic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> the rest, if they chose to give him a helper in the war and a partner in authority, how &mdash;he asked &mdash;could he possibly forget Publius Decius the consul, whom he had proved so often when they had been colleagues?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>there</reg> was no one living with whom he would sooner share his commission; he should have troops enough, if Decius were with him, and his enemies would never be too numerous.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>but</reg> if his colleague preferred some other arrangement, let them give him Lucius Volumnius to be his coadjutor. <name>The</name> decision in regard to everything was left by the people and the senate, and by his colleague himself, entirely to Fabius; and when Publius Decius had made known his readiness to set out either for Samnium or Etruria, there were such rejoicings and congratulations that men tasted the sweets of victory in anticipation, and it seemed as though the consuls had been voted a triumph and not a war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>i</reg> find in some historians that Fabius and Decius set out for Etruria at the very beginning of their consulship, and they make no mention of the casting of lots for provinces or of the disputes betwixt the colleagues which I have described.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>on</reg> the other hand, even these disputes have not been enough <pb id="p.459"/>for some, but they have added invectives pronounced<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> by Appius before the people against the absent Fabius, and stubborn opposition on the praetor's part to the consul who was present, and another quarrel between the colleagues, when Decius urged that each should attend to his allotted province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> authorities begin to be in agreement from the moment that both consuls set out for the seat of war.</p> 
				<p><reg>but</reg> before the consuls could reach Etruria, the Senonian Gauls were come with a great multitude to Clusium, to besiege the Roman legion in camp there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <name>Scipio</name>, who was in command, thought it necessary that he should gain the advantage of position to eke out the smallness of his numbers, and marched his troops up a hill situated between the city and his camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but, as happens in sudden emergencies, he had sent no scouts ahead of him, and led his men up to a ridge which was held by the enemy, who had approached it from another direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>thus</reg> the legion was attacked in the rear and found itself surrounded, with the enemy assailing it from every quarter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>some</reg> writers say that the legion was even annihilated there, so that none survived to bear away the tidings, and that the consuls, who were not far from Clusium, got no report of the disaster till some Gallic horsemen came in sight, with heads hanging at their horses' breasts or fixed on their lances, and singing their customary song of triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>others</reg> allege that they were not Gauls but Umbrians, and that the reverse experienced was not so great. <reg>some</reg> foragers, according to their account, under Lucius Manlius Torquatus,<note>Possibly a son of the consul who was thrown from his horse and killed in <date value="-299">299 B.C.</date> <reg>see</reg> chap. xi. &sect; 1.</note> a lieutenant, had been cut off and Scipio the propraetor sallied forth from the <pb id="p.461"/>camp to their relief, and renewing
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> the battle defeated<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> the victorious Umbrians and took from them their prisoners and their booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>it</reg> is more probable that the discomfiture was incurred at the hands of a Gallic than of an Umbrian enemy, since apprehensions of a Gallic rising, which had often at other times troubled the Romans, were in that year particularly alarming. <reg>and</reg> so, not only did both consuls go out to war, having four legions and a strong body of Roman cavalry, together with a thousand picked horse from Campania &mdash;furnished for this campaign &mdash;and an army of allies and Latins that outnumbered the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> but two other armies were posted over against Etruria, not far from the City, one in the Faliscan district and the other in the Vatican. <name>Gnaeus</name> Fulvius and Lucius Postumius Megellus &mdash;propraetors both &mdash;were ordered to maintain a standing camp there.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<name>The</name> consuls came up with the enemy &mdash;who had crossed the Apennines &mdash;in the territory round Sentinum, and went into camp about four miles off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>consultations</reg> were then held amongst the enemy and they decided not to unite all their forces in one camp nor to give battle all together; to the Samnites were joined the Gauls and to the Etruscans the men of Umbria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>a</reg> day was designated for the battle, and the Samnites and Gauls were appointed to make the attack; in the midst of the engagement the Etruscans and the Umbrians were to assault the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>These</name> plans were upset by three Clusinian deserters who came over secretly in the night to Fabius, and having informed him of the enemy's designs were rewarded and sent back again, so that from time to time, as each new <pb id="p.463"/>step should be decided on, they might find it out<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> and report upon it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> consuls wrote to Fulvius and Postumius to march from their respective posts in the Faliscan and Vatican districts to Clusium, and lay waste the territories of the enemy with the utmost rigour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> reports of this devastation drew off the Etruscans from the region of Sentinum to the defence of their own frontiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>thereupon</reg> the consuls strove to bring about an engagement in their absence. <reg>for</reg> the space of two days they harassed the enemy, but in these two days there was nothing done worth telling: a few were slain on either side and spirits were whetted for a downright battle, but the main issue was not brought to a decision.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>on</reg> the third day the opposing armies descended in full strength into the field.</p> 
				<p><reg>as</reg> they stood arrayed for battle, a hind, pursued by a wolf that had chased it down from the mountains, fled across the plain and ran between the two lines. <reg>they</reg> then turned in opposite directions, the hind towards the Gauls, the wolf towards the Romans. <reg>for</reg> the wolf a passage was opened between the ranks, but the hind was killed by the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>then</reg> one of the front &mdash;rankers on the Roman side called out, <quote><reg>that</reg> way flight and slaughter have shaped their course, where you see the beast lie slain that is sacred to Diana; on this side the wolf of Mars, unhurt and sound, has reminded us of the Martian race and of our Founder.</quote><note>See chap. xxiii. &sect; 12 for the bronze group which had recently been erected of the wolf suckling the twins (the Sons of Mars) and <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> the reference at xxii. i. 12 to a statue of Mars and images of wolves (a group?) on the Appian Way. <name>Virgil</name> uses the epithet <hi rend="italics"><name>Martius</name></hi> of the wolf (<hi rend="italics"><name>Aen</name>.</hi> ix. 566) and Horace has <hi rend="italics"><name>Martialis</name> lupos,</hi> at <hi rend="italics"><reg>carm</reg>.</hi> I. xvii. 9.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><reg>on</reg> the right wing stood the Gauls, on the left the Samnites. <reg>facing</reg> the Samnites, Quintus Fabius drew up the first and third legions, to form the Roman right, while Decius marshalled the fifth and sixth on the Roman left, against the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <name>The</name> <pb id="p.465"/>second and the fourth were campaigning in Samnium<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> under Lucius Volumnius the proconsul. <reg>at</reg> the first shock the strength put forth on both sides was so equal that if the Etruscans and the Umbrians had been present either in the battle or at the camp, in whichever quarter they had thrown their weight the Romans must have suffered a disaster.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<reg>but</reg>, though so far it was a doubtful battle and Fortune had given no indication where she intended to bestow her might, the fighting was very different on the right wing from what it was on the left.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>The</name> Romans with Fabius were rather defending themselves than attacking, and were trying to prolong the struggle to as late an hour in the day as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>this</reg> was because their general was persuaded that both Samnites and Gauls fought fiercely at the outset of an engagement, but only needed to be withstood;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> when a struggle was prolonged, little by little the spirits of the Samnites flagged, while the physical prowess of the Gauls, who could least of all men put up with heat and labour, ebbed away, and, whereas in the early stages of their battles they were more than men, they ended with being less than women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>so</reg> until the time should come when the enemy were wont to fail, he was keeping his men as fresh as he could contrive to do.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>but</reg> Decius, with the greater impetuosity of his youth and spirits, expended all the strength he could muster in the first encounter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>and</reg> because the fighting of the infantry seemed to languish, he called on the cavalry to attack, and attaching himself to the bravest squadron of troopers besought the youthful nobles to join him in a charge. <reg>theirs</reg>, he said, would be a double share <pb id="p.467"/>of glory, if victory should come first to the left wing<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> and to the cavalry. <reg>twice</reg> they drove the Gallic cavalry back.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<reg>from</reg> that moment the battle seemed scarce to depend on human efforts. <name>The</name> Romans, after losing their general &mdash;an occurrence that is wont to inspire terror &mdash;fled no longer, but sought to redeem the field;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Gauls, and especially the press about the body of the consul, as though deprived of reason, were darting their javelins at random and without effect, while some were in a daze, and could neither fight nor run away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> in the other army the pontifex Livius, to whom Decius had handed over his lictors, bidding him act as propraetor, cried aloud that the Romans had won the victory, being quit of all danger by the consul's doom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>The</name> Gauls, he said, and the Samnites were made over to Mother Earth and to the Manes; Decius was haling after him their devoted host and calling it to join him, and with the enemy all was madness and despair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>while</reg> the <pb id="p.471"/>Romans were restoring the battle, up came Lucius<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> Cornelius Scipio and Gaius Marcius, whom Quintus Fabius the consul had ordered to take reserves from the rearmost line and go to his colleague's support. <reg>there</reg> they learned of Decius's death, a great incentive to dare everything for the republic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>and</reg> so, though the Gauls stood crowded together with their shields interlocked in front of them, and it looked no easy battle at close quarters, the lieutenants bade their men gather up the javelins that were scattered about on the ground between the hostile lines and cast them against the <hi rend="italics">testudo<note><hi rend="italics"><reg>testudo</reg>,</hi> <quote>tortoise,</quote> was the name given to a formation in which the shields were held so close together as to form a sort of pent &mdash;house or <hi rend="italics">shell</hi> over the soldiers.</note></hi> of their enemies; and as many of these missiles stuck fast in the shields and now and then one penetrated a soldier's body, their phalanx was broken up &mdash;many falling, though unwounded, as if they had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> stunned. <reg>such</reg> were the shifts of Fortune upon the Roman left.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><reg>on</reg> the right, Fabius had begun, as has been said before, by holding back and delaying the decision; later, when neither the shouts of the foe, nor their assaults, nor the missiles they discharged, seemed to have any longer the same force, he ordered the praefects of the cavalry to lead their squadrons
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> round the wing of the Samnites, that, on the signal being given, they might attack them in the flank with all possible vigour, and commanded his own men to push forward by degrees and dislodge the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> enemy. <reg>when</reg> he saw that they made no resistance and there could be no question of their weariness, he gathered up all the troops which he had hitherto held in reserve, and, sending in his legions, made a signal to the cavalry to
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> charge. <name>The</name> Samnites could not withstand their onset and fled in confusion past the Gallic line itself, <pb id="p.473"/>abandoning their comrades in the midst of the fighting and<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> seeking refuge in their camp. <name>The</name> Gauls had formed a <hi rend="italics">testudo</hi> and stood there closely packed
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> together. <reg>then</reg> Fabius, who had learned of his colleague's death, commanded the squadron of Campanians, about five hundred lances, to withdraw from the line, and fetching a compass, assail the Gallic infantry in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> rear; these the <hi rend="italics">principes,</hi> or middle line, of the third legion were to follow, and, pushing in where they saw that the cavalry charge had disordered the enemy's formation, make havoc of them in their
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> panic. <reg>he</reg> himself, after vowing a temple and the enemy's spoils to Jupiter Victor, kept on to the Samnite camp, whither the whole affrighted throng was being
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> driven. <reg>under</reg> the very rampart, since the gates could not receive so great a multitude, those who were shut out by the crowding of their fellows attempted some resistance; there Gellius Egnatius, the commander &mdash;in
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> &mdash;chief of the Samnites, fell; in the upshot the Samnites were driven within the rampart and after a short struggle their camp was taken and the Gauls were cut off in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> rear. <reg>there</reg> were slain that day five &mdash;and &mdash;twenty thousand of the enemy, and eight thousand were captured; nor was it a bloodless victory; for of the army of Publius Decius seven thousand were slain and seventeen hundred of the army of
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Fabius. <name>Fabius</name> sent out men to search for the body of his colleague, and, piling up the spoils of the enemy, burned them in sacrifice to Jupiter the
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Victor. <name>The</name> consul's body could not be found that day, having been buried under heaps of Gauls who had been slain above him; on the day after, it was found and brought in, amidst the lamentations of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> <pb id="p.475"/>soldiers. <reg>postponing</reg> his concern for everything else,<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> Fabius celebrated the funeral of his colleague with every show of honour and well &mdash;merited eulogiums.</p>

					<reg>in</reg> Etruria too at the same time Gnaeus Fulvius the propraetor was succeeding according to his wishes, and, besides the enormous damage which his forays inflicted on the enemy, fought also a victorious battle with them.

					<reg>despite</reg> these victories, there was not yet peace either with the Samnites or in Etruria;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for war had broken out afresh at the instigation of the Perusini, after the consul had withdrawn his army, and the Samnites were raiding the lands of Vescini and of Formiae on the one hand, and on the other the territory of Aesernia and the region adjacent to the Volturnus river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>against</reg> these the praetor Appius Claudius was dispatched with the army that Decius had commanded. <name>Fabius</name> dealt with the new outbreak in Etruria, where he slew four thousand five hundred of the Perusini and took one thousand seven hundred and forty prisoners, who were ransomed at three hundred and ten <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each, the rest of the

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> Samnite levies, of whom a part were being pursued by Appius Claudius the praetor and a part by Lucius Volumnius the pro &mdash;consul, effected a junction in the Stellate district, where they all took up a position near Caiatia. <name>Appius</name> and Volumnius also combined their forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <name>The</name> ensuing battle was very bitterly contested, the Romans being incited by resentment against a people who had so often rebelled, while those on the other side were staking their last hopes <pb id="p.479"/>on the conflict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> Samnites accordingly lost<note type="margin">B.C. 295</note> sixteen thousand three hundred slain and two thousand seven hundred captured; in the Roman army two thousand seven hundred fell.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>on</reg> account of these signs the Sibylline books were consulted. <reg>in</reg> this year Quintus Fabius Gurges, the consul's son, assessed a fine of money against a number of married women who were convicted before the people of adultery, and with this money erected the temple of Venus which is near the Circus.<note>Fabius was presumably an aedile (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. xxiii. &sect;11 and chap. xxxiii. &sect; 9).

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <name>Samnium</name> was assigned them both for their province, in consequence of a report that the enemy had raised three armies, with one of which they meant to return into Etruria, with another to resume the devastation of Campania, while the third was making ready for the defence of their frontiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>Postumius</name> was detained in Rome by ill health: Atilius marched out at once, that he might put down the enemy in Samnium &mdash;for such was the senate's plan &mdash;ere they could cross the border.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>as</reg> though it had been prearranged, they encountered the foe in a place where they themselves were prevented from laying waste the territory of their enemies, while they prevented the Samnites from coming out into the district which had been pacified and the territory of the allies of the Roman People.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>on</reg> the camps being established over against each other, what the Romans would hardly have dared to do, victorious as they had so often been, the Samnites ventured &mdash;such temerity does utter hopelessness beget, &mdash;that is, to assault the enemy's camp; and although their desperate enterprise did not fully succeed, still, it was not altogether futile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>there</reg> was a fog which lasted well on into the day, so dense as to shut out the light and <pb id="p.483"/>render it impossible to see, not only beyond the<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> rampart, but even at a little way off, when people approached each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>relying</reg> on this, as on a screen for their operations, the Samnites came up, when day had scarcely dawned, and even so was hidden behind the murk, to the Roman outpost that was negligently standing guard before the gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>falling</reg> upon them unawares they encountered neither courage nor strength sufficient to hold them in check.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>they</reg> charged in by the decuman gate in the rear of the camp, captured the quaestor's tent,<note>Situated behind the <hi rend="italics">praetorium</hi> (headquarters) and between it and the decuman gate.</note> and slew the quaestor, Lucius Opimius Pansa; whereupon a general alarm was cried.</p>

					<name>The</name> consul, aroused by the din, commanded the two allied cohorts which happened to be nearest &mdash;those from Lucania and Suessa &mdash;to guard headquarters, and put himself at the head of the legionary maniples in the <hi rend="italics">via principalis.</hi><note>A wide street parallel with the front and rear lines of the camp, at either end of which was a gate
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;the <hi rend="italics">portaprincipalis</hi> <hi rend="italics">dextra</hi> and <hi rend="italics">porta principals sinistra</hi> respectively.</note> The men fell in ere they had fairly fitted on their armour, and, knowing the enemy more by their shouting than by the sight of them, were unable to form any estimate of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> numbers. <reg>at</reg> first they gave ground, uncertain how fortune stood with them, and admitted the foe into the middle of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> camp; then, on the consul's asking them whether they meant to be driven without the wall and afterwards make an assault on their own camp, they gave a cheer, and, exerting themselves, first made a successful stand, and afterwards pushed forward and forced their enemies back, and, having once repulsed them, left them no time to recover their first dismay, but thrust them out of gate and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> rampart. <reg>not</reg> venturing then to go on and pursue them, since the dim light made them fear an ambush, they retired &mdash;content to have <pb id="p.485"/>cleared their camp &mdash;within the palisade, having<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> slain about three hundred of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> enemy. <name>The</name> Roman loss, at the outpost and amongst those who were taken by surprise at the quaestor's tent, was some seven hundred and
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> thirty.</p> 
				<p><reg>this</reg> bold and not unsuccessful venture of the Samnites raised their spirits; and not only would they not permit the Romans to go forward, but they would not even permit them to forage in their fields; the foragers fell back on the peaceful territory about
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sora. <name>The</name> rumour of these events &mdash;more startling even than the events themselves &mdash; being brought to Rome compelled the consul Lucius Postumius, though barely recovered, to take the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> field. <reg>but</reg> after issuing a proclamation calling upon his soldiers to assemble at Sora, he himself, before leaving the City, dedicated a shrine to Victory, which he had built,<note>Probably on the Palatine, since Livy mentions a shrine of Victory as being there at xxix. xiv. 13.</note> as curule aedile, with money received from
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> fines. <reg>having</reg> then set out to join the army, he led it from Sora to his colleague's camp in Samnium. <name>The</name> Samnites then retreated, having no confidence in their ability to resist two armies, and the consuls separated and marched in different directions to waste their fields and attack their cities.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>thereupon</reg>, though the city was already taken, there ensued in every quarter without interruption, from the fourth hour till about the eighth, a desperate struggle, the result of which was long in doubt. <reg>at</reg> last the <pb id="p.487"/>Romans made themselves masters of the place.<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/><reg>from</reg> there the legions were led to Feritrum,<note>Otherwise unknown.</note> which the townspeople, with all their possessions which they could carry or drive away, evacuated in the silence of the night, by the opposite gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>so</reg>, then, the consul was no sooner come than he advanced up to the walls with all the order and circumspection of one who looked for the same resistance that he had met with at Milionia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but afterwards, finding the city as silent as a desert and neither arms nor men upon the battlements and towers, he restrained his soldiers, who were eager to scale the abandoned walls, lest they should rush improvidently into some hidden trap. <reg>he</reg> ordered two squadrons of Latin allies to make a circuit of the fortifications and effect a thorough reconnaissance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> troopers discovered a wide &mdash;open gate, and near it in the same quarter another one, and saw in the roads leading out of them the traces of the enemy's nocturnal flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>riding</reg> up then slowly and cautiously to the gates, they saw that the city could be safely traversed by streets that led straight through it, and reported to the consul that it had been abandoned. <reg>this</reg> was evident, they said, from the unmistakable solitude and the fresh signs of flight and the objects that lay scattered about where they had been discarded in the confusion of the darkness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>on</reg> receiving this account, the consul led his army round to that side of the city which the horsemen had approached. <reg>halting</reg> the troops not far from the gate, he commanded <pb id="p.489"/>five horsemen to enter and advance for a short<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> distance; then, if all seemed safe, three of these were to remain there together, and the other two were to report to him what they had found.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>when</reg> they came back and reported that they had advanced to a place from which a view could be had in all directions, and that silence and solitude reigned far and wide, the consul at once led some light &mdash;armed
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> cohorts into the city and ordered the rest to construct a camp in the meanwhile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>having</reg> entered the place and broken in the house &mdash;doors, the soldiers discovered some few decrepit or bed &mdash;ridden people and certain things abandoned as too difficult to remove. <name>These</name> things were seized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>it</reg> was learned from the prisoners that a number of communities in the vicinity had agreed together in planning flight; their own people had left in the first watch; they believed that the Romans would find the same solitude in the other cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> statements of the prisoners turned out to be true, and the consul took possession of the deserted towns.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<name>The</name> other consul, Marcus Atilius, had by no means so easy a war. <reg>he</reg> was marching, at the head of his legions, towards Luceria, which he had heard was being besieged by the Samnites, when the enemy met him at the Lucerine frontier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>on</reg> this occasion rage made their strength as great as his, and the battle was one of shifting fortunes and doubtful issue. <reg>yet</reg> its outcome was more discouraging to the Romans, both as having been unaccustomed to defeat, and because, as they were retiring from the field, they could see, even better than during the actual engagement, how much their side had got the worst of it in killed and wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.491"/><name>The</name> consequence of this was such a panic in the<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> camp as, had it come over them whilst they were fighting, must have led to a signal overthrow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>even</reg> so the night was an anxious one, for they thought that the Samnites would soon be attacking the camp, or else that they would have to fight their victorious enemy at break of day.</p> 
				<p><name>The</name> enemy had suffered less, but was not less faint &mdash;hearted. <reg>as</reg> soon as it grew light they wished to retire without giving battle. <reg>but</reg> there was only one road, and this led past their enemies, and when they had started to go that way, they looked as if marching straight to attack the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> consul ordered the soldiers to arm and follow him outside the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>to</reg> the lieutenants, tribunes, and prefects of the allies he explained what part it was needful for their several commands to play. <reg>they</reg> all assured him that, as for themselves, they were ready for anything, but that the soldiers were dispirited;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> all night long they had been kept awake by the groans of the wounded and the dying; had the enemy attacked the camp before daylight, their fear would have been so great as to cause them to desert their ranks;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> as it was, they were withheld by shame from running away, but were otherwise as good as beaten.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>on</reg> hearing this, the consul thought he had best go about himself among the men and talk to them. <reg>wherever</reg> he went he scolded those who were hesitating to arm themselves: Why did they linger and hold back?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> enemy would come into the camp, unless they went out; and they would be fighting before their tents, if they were not willing to fight before the palisade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>if</reg> men armed themselves <pb id="p.493"/>and fought, it was a question whose the victory<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> would be; but a man who waited for the enemy, unarmed and helpless, must put up with either death or slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>to</reg> these objurgations and reproaches they replied that they were exhausted with the battle of the previous day and had no strength left nor blood to shed; while the enemy appeared to be in greater numbers than on the day before.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/><reg>meanwhile</reg> the column was approaching; and presently, as the soldiers obtained a closer view of them, they declared that the Samnites were carrying stakes and were doubtless going to fence in the camp.<note>The true explanation being that the Samnites were quitting their camp and were carrying the stakes to use in constructing the next one.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>at</reg> this the consul lost all patience, and shouted out that it was a shameful thing to suffer such disgrace and humiliation at the hands of the most cowardly of foes. <quote><reg>shall</reg> we even be pent up within our camp,</quote> he cried, <quote>to die shamefully of hunger, rather than, if need be, by the sword, like gallant men?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <name>Heaven</name> prosper them! <reg>they</reg> must act as each thought worthy of himself; but the consul, Marcus Atilius &mdash;alone if there were none to follow him &mdash;would
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> charge the enemy, and sooner fall amongst the standards of the Samnites than see a Roman camp beleaguered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <name>The</name> consul's words were approved by the lieutenants and the tribunes and by all the squadrons of horse and the centurions of highest rank.</p> 
				<p><reg>then</reg> the soldiers began, for very shame, to arm, and slowly emerged from the stockade; in a long and straggling column, discouraged and almost beaten, they advanced towards the enemy, who were no better off for hopefulness or courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <reg>accordingly</reg>, no sooner had they beheld the Roman standards than a murmur ran through the column <pb id="p.495"/>of the Samnites, from the foremost to the hindmost,<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> that the Romans &mdash;just
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> as they had feared &mdash;were coming out to dispute their passing; there was no way open even for flight; they must fall where they stood, or else cut down their foes and escape over their bodies.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<reg>they</reg> heaped up their baggage together, and, being armed, went every man to his own place in the ranks, and the battle &mdash;line was formed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>and</reg> now there was but a little space between the armies, and they halted, each waiting for the other to be first to attack and first to raise a cheer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>neither</reg> side had any stomach for fighting, and they would have gone off in opposite directions, scatheless and unhurt, had they not been afraid that, if they retired, their enemies would advance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>no</reg> signal was given, but though unwilling and reluctant, they began to fight, in a half &mdash;hearted manner, with an uncertain and unequal shout; nor would any man stir from his place.</p> 
				<p><reg>then</reg> the Roman consul, to put some life into the work, detached a few troops of cavalry and sent them in. <reg>of</reg> these the most part were unhorsed, and, the rest being thrown into confusion, there was a rush on the part of the Samnites to dispatch the fallen and on that of the Romans to save their comrades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>this</reg> infused a little spirit into the fighting; but the Samnites had charged somewhat more briskly and in greater numbers, and the disordered cavalry, their horses becoming terrified, rode down their own supports, who began a flight that spread to the whole Roman army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>and</reg> now the Samnites were on the backs of the fugitives, when the consul, galloping
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> on before to the gate of the camp, posted <pb id="p.497"/>there a guard of horse and commanded them,<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> whosoever should make for the rampart, be he Roman or Samnite, to treat him as a foe. <reg>he</reg> likewise threatened the men himself, and stopped them as they made in disorder for the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <quote><reg>where</reg> are you going, men?</quote> he shouted: <quote><reg>here</reg> too you will find arms and soldiers, and while your consul lives you shall not enter the camp, except as victors. <reg>choose</reg>, therefore, whether you would sooner fight with fellow &mdash;citizens or enemies!</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>as</reg> the consul spoke these words, the cavalry gathered round the infantry and levelling their spears bade them return into the battle. <reg>not</reg> only the consul's bravery but Fortune also helped; for the Samnites did not press their advantage, and he had time to reverse his standards and change his front from the camp to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>they</reg> then began to encourage each other to resume the fight; the centurions snatched the standards from the standard &mdash;bearers and carried them forward, pointing out to their men that the enemy were few in number and were coming on in irregular and ill &mdash;formed ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>at</reg> this juncture the consul lifted up his hands to heaven, and in a clear voice, so as to be overheard, vowed a temple to Jupiter the Stayer, if the Roman army should stay its flight, and renewing the struggle cut to pieces and overcome the legions of the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>everybody</reg>, all along the line &mdash;officers, soldiers, infantry and horse &mdash;made an effort to restore the day. <reg>it</reg> even seemed that the divine power of the gods was concerned for the renown of Rome, so easily was the struggle turned and the enemy repulsed from the camp, and in a short time driven back to the place where the fighting had <pb id="p.499"/>begun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>there</reg> they were held up by the heap of<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> bundles which they had piled together, and, to keep their effects from being rifled, they formed around them a circle of armed men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>then</reg> the foot &mdash;soldiers fell hotly upon them in the front, and the cavalry rode round and assailed them in the rear; and so between the two they were slaughtered or made prisoners. <name>The</name> number of the captives was seven thousand eight hundred, who were all stripped and sent under the yoke: the slain were reported at four thousand eight hundred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>even</reg> the Romans had no joy of their victory, for the consul found, on reckoning up the two days' casualties, that he had lost seven thousand eight hundred men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/><reg>whilst</reg> these affairs were taking place in Apulia, the Samnites with a second army attempted to seize Interamna, a Roman colony on the Latin Way, but could not take it;
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> having pillaged the farms, they were driving off a miscellaneous booty of men and beasts, together with the captured settlers, when they encountered the victorious consul returning from Luceria, and not only lost their spoils, but, marching without order in a long and encumbered column, were massacred themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <name>The</name> consul made proclamation summoning the owners back to Interamna to identify and receive again their property, and, leaving there his army, went to Rome for the purpose of conducting the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <reg>when</reg> he sought to obtain a triumph, the honour was denied him, on the ground that he had lost so many thousand men, and because he had sent the prisoners under the yoke, though they had made no terms.<note>The consul was blamed not for humiliating the enemy, but for letting them off with the humiliation &mdash;as though they had surrendered upon that understanding &mdash;instead of selling them as slaves, which he had it in his power to do.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<name>The</name> other consul, Postumius, in default of enemies in Samnium, transferred his army to <pb id="p.501"/>Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>there</reg> he first devastated the lands of the<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> Volsinienses, and then, when they came out to defend their territory, defeated them at no great distance from their own walls. <reg>two</reg> thousand eight hundred Etruscans were slain; the rest were saved by their nearness to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <name>The</name> army was then led into the territory of Rusellae. <reg>there</reg> not only were the fields laid waste, but the town was captured too. <reg>more</reg> than two thousand were made prisoners and somewhat fewer were killed in the fighting about the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>yet</reg> a peace was made that year in Etruria that was more glorious and of more importance than the fighting had been. <reg>three</reg> very powerful cities, the chief places in that country, namely Volsinii, Perusia, and Arretium, made overtures of peace, and arranged with the consul, in return for clothing and corn for his troops, to be permitted to send ambassadors to Rome, who obtained a truce for forty years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>a</reg> fine of five hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi> to be paid at once, was assessed upon each state.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><reg>in</reg> view of these achievements, the consul asked the senate for a triumph, more as a matter of custom than with any hope of obtaining his request.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>when</reg> he perceived that some were for denying him on the ground of his tardiness in leaving the City, and others because he had gone over without the authorization of the senate from Samnium into Etruria &mdash;a part of these critics being his personal enemies, and the rest friends of his colleague, who were minded to console the latter for his rebuff by denying a triumph to Postumius also &mdash;seeing,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I say, how matters stood, he spoke as follows: <quote><reg>i</reg> shall not be so mindful, Conscript Fathers, of your dignity as to forget that I am consul. <reg>in</reg> virtue of the same authority with <pb id="p.503"/>which I conducted my wars, I intend, now that those<note type="margin">B.C. 294</note> wars are happily concluded with the subjugation of Samnium and Etruria and the winning of victory and peace, to celebrate a triumph.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>so</reg> saying he left the senate. <reg>a</reg> dispute then arose amongst the tribunes of the plebs; some declared that they would interpose their veto to prevent this unprecedented kind of triumph, others that they would support his claims against the opposition of their colleagues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>The</name> question was discussed in an assembly and the consul was asked to speak. <reg>he</reg> reminded them that Marcus Horatius and Lucius Valerius, the consuls, and lately Gaius Marcius Rutulus, father of him who was then censor, had triumphed not by authorization of the senate but by command of the people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and he added that he, too, would have referred the question to the people, had he not known that there were tribunes who were owned by the nobles and would obstruct the law<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the law granting the triumph.</note> ; but the wishes and approbation of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> people when they were of one accord had all the binding force with him &mdash;and ever would have of any orders whatsoever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>and</reg> so, on the following day, with the support of three tribunes of the plebs, against the opposition of seven who forbade the proceedings and a unanimous senate, Postumius triumphed, with the people thronging in attendance.</p> 
				<p><reg>of</reg> this year, too, the tradition is uncertain.<note>Compare chap. xxvi. &sect;&sect; 5-7, and chap. xxx. &sect;&sect; 4-7.</note> <name>Postumius</name>, if we follow Claudius,<note>Q.

					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> that at Luceria both sides suffered heavy losses; in the course of the battle a temple was vowed to Jupiter Stator, as Romulus had vowed one before; but only the <hi rend="italics">fanum,</hi> or place set apart for the temple, had been consecrated;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> this year, however, their scruples demanded that the senate should order the erection of the building, since the state had now been obligated for the second time by the same vow.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<name>The</name> following year brought with it a<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> consul, Lucius Papirius Cursor, remarkable both for his father's glory and for his own, and a mighty war, with a victory such as no one, save Lucius Papirius, the consul's father, had until that day obtained over the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>and</reg> it happened that the enemy had made their preparations for the war with the same<note>The same, that is, as in the year <date value="-309">309 B.C.</date>, when they had fought against the Romans, who were commanded by the elder Papirius (ix. xl. 2 ff.).</note> earnestness and pomp and all the magnificence of splendid arms, and had likewise invoked the assistance of the gods, initiating, as it were, their soldiers, in accordance with a certain antique form of oath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>but</reg> first they held a levy throughout Samnium under this new ordinance, that whosoever of military age did not report in response to the proclamation of the generals, or departed without their orders, should forfeit his life to Jupiter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>which</reg> done, they appointed all the army to meet at Aquilonia, where some forty thousand soldiers, the strength of Samnium, came together.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>there</reg>, at about the middle of the camp, they had enclosed an area, extending approximately two hundred feet in all directions, with wicker hurdles, and roofed it over with linen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>in</reg> this place they <pb id="p.507"/>offered sacrifice in accordance with directions read<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> from an old linen roll. <name>The</name> celebrant was one Ovius Paccius, an aged man, who claimed to derive this ceremony from an ancient ritual of the Samnites which the forefathers of those present had formerly employed when they had gone secretly about to get Capua away from the Etruscans.<note>At iv. xxxvii. 1 f. we were told how the Etruscan city of Volturnum was captured by the Samnites and renamed Capua.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>on</reg> the conclusion of the sacrifice, the general by his apparitor commanded to be summoned all those of the highest degree in birth and deeds of arms; and one by one they were introduced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>besides</reg> other ceremonial preparations, such as might avail to strike the mind with religious awe, there was a place all enclosed, with altars in the midst and slaughtered victims lying about, and round them a guard of centurions<note>These are called <quote>armed priests</quote> at chap. xli. &sect; 3.</note> with drawn swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <name>The</name> man was brought up to the altar, more like a victim than a partaker in the rite, and was sworn not to divulge what he should there see or hear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>they</reg> then compelled him to take an oath in accordance with a certain dreadful form of words, whereby he invoked a curse upon his head, his household, and his family, if he went not into battle where his generals led the way, or if he either fled from the line himself or saw any other fleeing and did not instantly cut him down.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>some</reg> there were at first who refused to take this oath; these were beheaded before the altars, where they lay amongst the slaughtered victims &mdash;a warning to the rest not to refuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>when</reg> the leading Samnites had been bound by this imprecation, the general named ten of them and bade them choose every man another, and so to proceed until they had brought <pb id="p.509"/>their number up to sixteen thousand.<note>See ix. xxxix. 5, where this mode of selection is described as having been employed by the Etruscans.</note> <name>These</name> were<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> named the <quote><name>Linen</name> Legion,</quote> from the roof of the enclosure wherein the nobles had been sworn, and were given splendid arms and crested helmets, to distinguish them from the rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>a</reg> little over twenty thousand<note>To be consistent with the total given in &sect; 4, this number should be 24,000.</note> men composed another corps, which neither in physical appearance nor in martial renown nor in equipment was inferior to the Linen Legion. <reg>this</reg> was the size of the army, comprising their effective forces, which encamped at Aquilonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<name>The</name> consuls set out from the City, Spurius Carvilius, to whom had been assigned the veteran legions which Marcus Atilius the consul of the previous year had left in the territory of Interamna, being the first to take the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>proceeding</reg> with these forces into Samnium, while the enemy, busy with their superstitious rites, were holding secret councils, he carried the Samnite town of Amiternum by assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>there</reg> about two thousand eight hundred men were slain and four thousand two hundred and seventy made prisoners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>Papirius</name>, having levied a new army &mdash;for so it had been decreed &mdash;took by storm the city of Duronia, making fewer prisoners than his colleague but killing many more. <reg>in</reg> each place a rich booty was obtained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>afterwards</reg>, the consuls having ranged over Samnium and laid waste especially the district of Atina, Carvilius appeared before Cominium and Papirius before Aquilonia, where the main power of the Samnites lay encamped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>there</reg> for some days there was neither cessation from hostilities nor downright fighting, but the time was spent in provoking the enemy when they were quiet and retreating when they offered resistance &mdash;in a word, in feinting rather <pb id="p.511"/>than attacking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>whatever</reg> was undertaken or given<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> over, the result of every skirmish, no matter how trivial it might be, was reported at the other camp, which was twenty miles away. <name>The</name> other colleague, Carvilius, though absent, shared in every plan of operations, and was more intent upon Aquilonia, as the crisis became more imminent, than upon Cominium, to which he was laying siege.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><name>Lucius</name> Papirius, being now prepared at all points for the battle, sent word to his colleague that he purposed, if the auspices permitted, to engage the enemy on the following day;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> it was needful, he said, that Carvilius should also direct an assault, as violent as possible, on Cominium, that no relaxation of the pressure there might allow of the Samnites' sending relief to Aquilonia. <name>The</name> messenger had a day for the journey. <reg>returning</reg> in the night, he reported that Carvilius approved the measures taken by his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <name>Papirius</name> had no sooner sent off the courier than he addressed his
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> troops, and said many things of war in general and much regarding the present equipment of the enemy, more vain and showy than effective.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <reg>for</reg> crests, said he, dealt no wounds, and painted and gilded shields would let the Roman javelin through, and their battle &mdash;array, resplendent in white tunics, would be stained with blood when sword met sword. <reg>long</reg> ago a gilt and silvern Samnite army had been utterly destroyed by his father, and the spoils had done their conquerors more credit than the arms had brought to their bearers.<note>In <date value="-310">310 B.C.</date> <reg>see</reg> ix. xl. 1-17.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>it</reg> had perhaps been granted to his name and family to be sent forth as generals against the mightiest efforts of the Samnites, and to win such trophies as should strikingly adorn even public <pb id="p.513"/>places.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> immortal gods, he said, were ready to<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> intervene in behalf of treaties so often sought and so often broken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <reg>if</reg> it were possible in any way to surmise the feelings of the gods, they had never been
					<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> more enraged with any army than with this one, which with horrid rites and stained with the commingled blood of men and beasts, doubly devoted to the wrath of Heaven, as it trembled now at the gods that attested the treaties it had made with the Romans, and now at the curses called down
					<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> when it undertook to break those treaties, had sworn unwillingly, hated its oath, and dreaded at one and the same moment its gods, its fellow &mdash;citizens, and its enemies.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<name>These</name> fears had been made known to Papirius by deserters; and when he had described them to his soldiers, incensed as they already were of themselves, their hopes both of gods and men ran high, and they called out in unison demanding battle; they were vexed at the postponement of the struggle until the morrow, and to wait for a day and night disgusted them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>in</reg> the third watch of the night, having now received his colleague's answer, Papirius rose silently and sent the keeper of the chickens<note>For the use of sacred chickens in augury see VI. xli. 8 and note (Vol. III., p. 344).</note> to take the auspices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>there</reg> was no class of men in camp who were not affected by the lust of battle; both high and low felt the same eagerness; the general could see the ardour of the men, the men that of their general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>this</reg> universal zeal spread even to those who took the auspices, for when the chickens refused to feed, their keeper dared to falsify the presage and reported that the corn danced on the ground as it fell from their greedy beaks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <name>The</name> consul joyfully announced that <pb id="p.515"/>the omens were most favourable, and that the gods<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> would be with them as they fought.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>so</reg> saying, he displayed the signal for a battle. <reg>it</reg> chanced, as he was already moving out to the field, that a deserter came up with the information that twenty cohorts of the Samnites &mdash;of about four hundred each &mdash;had set out for Cominium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>that</reg> his colleague might not be ignorant of this, he instantly dispatched a messenger to him, and ordered his own troops to advance in double time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>he</reg> had assigned supports to take their posts at favourable points and officers to command them; the right wing he had given to Lucius Volumnius, the left to Lucius Scipio; to lead the cavalry he appointed the other lieutenants, Gaius Caedicius and Titus Trebonius. <name>Spurius</name> Nautius he directed to remove the pack &mdash;saddles from the mules, and with three cohorts of auxiliaries to make a hasty detour to a hill which lay in full view, and thence to show himself, in the heat of the engagement, raising as much dust as possible.<note>For a similar use of pack
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> &mdash;animals to simulate cavalry, compare vii. xiv. 7-10.</note></p> 
				<p><reg>while</reg> the general was thus employed, a dispute which broke out amongst the keepers of the chickens about the auspices for that day was overheard by some Roman cavalrymen, who, deeming it no negligible matter, reported to Spurius Papirius, the consul's nephew, that the auspices were being called in
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> question. <name>The</name> young man had been born before the learning that makes light of the gods,<note>Compare the caustic remark at iii. xx. 5: But there had not yet come about that contempt for the gods which possesses the present generation; nor did everybody seek to construe oaths and laws to suit himself, but rather shaped his own practices by them.</note> and having inquired into the affair, that he might not be the bearer of an uncertain rumour, acquainted the consul with
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> it. <name>The</name> consul replied: <quote><reg>for</reg> yourself, I commend your conduct and your diligence; but he who takes the auspices, if he reports aught that is false, draws down the wrath of Heaven upon
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <pb id="p.517"/>himself; as for me, I was told that the corn had<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> danced; it is an excellent omen for the Roman People and the army.</quote> <reg>he</reg> then ordered the centurions to station the keepers of the chickens in the front rank. <name>The</name> Samnites, too, advanced their standards, which were followed by the battle &mdash;line in gorgeous armour &mdash;a splendid spectacle, though composed of
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> enemies. <reg>before</reg> the first shout and the clash of arms, a random javelin struck the chicken &mdash;keeper and he fell before the
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> standards. <name>The</name> consul, on being told of this, exclaimed, <quote><name>The</name> gods are present in the battle; the guilty wretch has paid the penalty!</quote> <reg>in</reg> front of the consul a raven, just as he spoke, uttered a clear cry, and Papirius, rejoiced with the augury, and declaring that never had the gods been more instant to intervene in human affairs, bade sound the trumpets and give a cheer.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<name>The</name> battle was fought fiercely, but with far from equal spirit. <name>The</name> Romans were filled with rage and hope and ardour for the combat, and, thirsting for their enemies' blood, rushed into the engagement. <reg>as</reg> for the Samnites, in most cases it was necessity and the fear of Heaven that compelled them, however reluctant, rather to resist than to attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>nor</reg> would they have held out against the first battle &mdash;cry and onset of the Romans, accustomed, as they had now been for some years, to being beaten, had not another yet more powerful fear benumbed their hearts and prevented them from fleeing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>for</reg> their eyes beheld all that array of the secret rite, and the armed priests, and the mingled slaughter of men and beasts, and the altars spattered with the blood of victims &mdash;and with that other blood &mdash;and they could hear the baleful execrations <pb id="p.519"/>and that dire oath, framed to invoke perdition on<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> their families and on their stock.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <name>These</name> were the chains that stayed them from flight, and they feared their countrymen more than they feared their foes. <reg>on</reg> came the Romans from either wing and from the centre, and cut them down as they stood there dazed by the dread of gods and men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>they</reg> resisted, but sluggishly, like men whom cowardice restrained from running.</p> 
				<p><name>The</name> carnage had now reached almost to the standards, when a cloud of dust appeared on their flank, as though raised by the oncoming of a mighty host.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>it</reg> was Spurius Nautius &mdash;some say Octavius Maecius &mdash;with the auxiliary cohorts; they made more dust than their numbers warranted, for the grooms who rode the mules were dragging leafy branches along the ground. <reg>arms</reg> and standards were made out in the van through the murky air, and behind them another denser cloud of dust seemed to show that cavalry were closing the rear, and deceived not only the Samnites, but the Romans as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>this</reg> mistake the consul confirmed by calling out in the front ranks, so loud that his voice carried even to the enemy, that Cominium was taken, and that his victorious colleague was at hand; let them therefore strive to conquer before the other army won the glory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>he</reg> was on horseback as he shouted these words. <reg>he</reg> then commanded the tribunes and centurions to open a path for the cavalry, having previously admonished Trebonius and Caedicius that when they saw him holding his lance aloft and shaking it, they should make their horsemen run full tilt against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <reg>everything</reg> fell out according to his wishes, <pb id="p.521"/>as happens when plans are laid beforehand. <reg>lanes</reg><note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> were opened up between the files; the cavalry dashed out, and with levelled spears assailed the midst of the enemy's array, and broke his ranks wherever they charged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>hard</reg> after them came Volumnius and Scipio, and made havoc of the disordered Samnites.</p> 
				<p><reg>then</reg> at last, overwhelmed by gods and men, the Linen Cohorts were put to rout; the sworn and the unsworn fled alike, and knew no fear but fear of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>such</reg> portion of the foot as survived the battle was driven to the camp or to Aquilonium; the nobles and cavalry escaped to Bovianum. <reg>horse</reg> were pursued by horse, infantry by infantry. <name>The</name> Roman wings advanced on different objectives, the right on the Samnite camp, the left on their city.

					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <name>Scipio</name>, fearing that it would be a tedious task to reduce a fortified city, unless the affair were concluded during the first panic of his enemies and before they should collect their spirits, asked his soldiers whether they could be content that the other wing should have taken the camp, while they, though victors, were repulsed from the city gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <reg>when</reg> they all together cried out <quote><reg>no</reg>!</quote> he himself led the way to the gate, shield over head, and the others, following him, formed a <hi rend="italics">testudo,</hi> burst into the city, and hurling down the defenders seized the walls adjoining the gate; they durst not <pb id="p.523"/>venture into the middle of the city, because their<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> numbers were so small.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<reg>of</reg> these events the consul was at first unaware, and was intent upon the withdrawal of his army; for the sun was now rapidly sinking in the west, and night coming on apace made all things dangerous and suspect, even to the victors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>as</reg> he rode farther forward, he saw on his right hand that the camp was taken, while from the city, on his left, a confused uproar was rising in which the shouts of the combatants were mingled with screams of terror; and it so happened that at that very moment the struggle at the gate was in progress.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>then</reg>, riding nearer and perceiving that his men were on the walls and that his course was already marked out for him, since the adventurousness of a few men had provided him with a great opportunity, he gave orders that the troops withdrawn should be called back and advance against the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <reg>they</reg> entered it on the nearest side, and, as night was approaching, bivouacked; in the night the town was abandoned by the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><reg>there</reg> were slain that day of the Samnites at Aquilonia twenty thousand three hundred and forty, and three thousand eight hundred and seventy were captured, with ninety &mdash;seven military standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <reg>tradition</reg> also avers that hardly had there ever been a general more joyous in combat, whether owing to his native temper or to his confidence that he should gain the victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <reg>it</reg> resulted from the same stoutness of heart that he was not to be recalled from giving battle by the dispute about the omen, and that in the hour of crisis, when it was customary to vow temples to the immortal gods, he made a <pb id="p.525"/>vow to Jupiter the Victor that if he routed the<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> legions of the enemy he would present him with a thimbleful of mead before he drank strong wine himself. <reg>this</reg> vow was pleasing to the gods and they gave a good tum to the auspices.<note>The consul's vow was by no means prompted by a spirit of mockery, but was merely an hilarious expression of confidence and good understanding &mdash;not without a playful assumption of superiority as a toper, implied in the contrast between <hi rend="italics">pocillum mulsi</hi> and <hi rend="italics">temetum.</hi> <reg>that</reg> Jupiter should have savoured the jest shows him to have been blessed with a livelier sense of humour than the elder Pliny, who cites the anecdote (<hi rend="italics">N.

					<name>The</name> same good fortune attended the other consul at Cominium. <reg>with</reg> the dawn he led up all his forces under the walls and invested the city, posting strong supports to prevent any sally from the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>he</reg> was in the act of giving the signal when the courier from his colleague came up with the alarming news about the twenty cohorts,<note>See chap. xl. &sect; 6.</note> thus delaying the assault and obliging him to recall a part of his troops who were already drawn up and eager to attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>he</reg> commanded Decimus Brutus Scaeva, his lieutenant, to proceed with the first legion, ten auxiliary cohorts, and the cavalry, to confront the new forces of the enemy:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> wherever he fell in with them, he was to block their path and delay them, giving battle if the situation happened to require it; but on no account must these troops be suffered to approach Cominium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>he</reg> himself gave orders to bring up scaling &mdash;ladders from every side against the walls of the city, and under a mantlet of shields approached the gates. <reg>thus</reg> at the same instant the gates were burst open and the walls assaulted. <name>The</name> Samnites, although, until they beheld armed men upon their walls, they had pluck enough to keep their enemies from coming near the city, yet when the combat was no longer carried on with missiles at long range, but was fought hand &mdash;to &mdash;hand, and when those who had <pb id="p.527"/>mounted with difficulty from the.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> making easy work of it on the level ground with an enemy that was no match for them, they forsook their towers and battlements, and, huddled all together in the market &mdash;place, made there one last brief attempt to redeem the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <reg>then</reg>, throwing down their arms, some eleven thousand four hundred men cast themselves on the mercy of the consul; about four thousand eight hundred had been slain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><reg>such</reg> were the operations at Cominium and at Aquilonia. <reg>in</reg> the place between, where a third battle had been looked for, the enemy were not encountered. <reg>recalled</reg> by their leaders when seven miles from Cominium, they had not been present at either engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>as</reg> the evening shadows began to fall, when they had already come within sight of the camp and of Aquilonia, they had been halted by the shouts, which were equally loud from both directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>but</reg> afterwards, from the direction of the camp, which had been fired by the Romans, the flames broke out so extensively, with their warning of an unmistakable disaster, as to keep them from advancing further, and throwing
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> themselves on the ground at random, just where they were, without stopping to remove their arms, they passed the whole weary night in waiting for the dawn, which at the same time they dreaded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>as</reg> the day broke, they were hesitating which way to march, when the Roman cavalry, who had pursued the Samnites when they left their town in the night, caught sight of the army, lying there without breastworks or outpost, and instantly routed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <pb id="p.529"/><reg>their</reg> mass had been seen, too, from the walls of<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> Aquilonia, and presently the legionary cohorts were likewise in pursuit of them. <reg>but</reg> the infantry could not overtake the fugitives, though the cavalry killed some two hundred and eighty of the rear &mdash;guard, who in their fright abandoned a quantity of arms and eighteen military standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <name>The</name> rest of the column made good its escape, as safely as could be in so great a confusion, to Bovianum.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<name>The</name> rejoicing in each of the Roman armies was enhanced by the good fortune the other had enjoyed. <reg>each</reg> consul, with the approval of his fellow, made over the town he had captured to be sacked by the soldiers, and when the houses had been emptied, gave it to the flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>so</reg> on the same day Aquilonia and Cominium were destroyed by fire, and the consuls, amid the mutual exultations and good wishes of their legions and themselves, united their camps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>in</reg> the full sight of both armies Carvilius commended his men as each had merited, and presented them with decorations; and Papirius, who had fought an engagement of many sorts &mdash;in line of battle, round the camp, and about the city &mdash;awarded armlets and wreaths of gold to Spurius Nautius and to his nephew Spurius Papirius, and to four centurions and a maniple of <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi><note>Front &mdash;line troops.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;to Nautius for the charge by which, as though with a huge force, he had dismayed the enemy; to the young Papirius for his valiant service with the cavalry, both in the battle and in the night when he harassed<note>This interference was not mentioned at chap. xlii. &sect;4.</note> the flight of the Samnites after their secret departure from

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> armlets.</p> 
				<p><reg>a</reg> council of war was then held, and the question was debated whether the time were now come for withdrawing both armies, or at any rate one of the two, from
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Samnium. <reg>but</reg> they decided that the greater the damage they had inflicted on the Samnites, the more sharply and pertinaciously ought they to carry out such measures as remained, and to persist until they could hand over to the consuls who succeeded them a Samnium utterly
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> subdued.</p> 
				<p><reg>since</reg> there was no longer any hostile army that seemed likely to engage in a pitched battle with them, one form of war alone remained, the storming of cities; by destroying which they would be able to enrich their troops with booty and crush their enemies, who would fight for their altars and their
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> hearths. <reg>accordingly</reg>, after dispatching letters to the senate and the Roman People recounting their achievements, the consuls parted company, Papirius marching to attack Saepinum, and Carvilius Velia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<name>The</name> consuls' letters were listened to with vast exultation both in Senate &mdash;house and in assembly, and the general rejoicing found expression in the eagerness with which a thanksgiving of four days' duration was observed by individual citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>for</reg> the Roman People, moreover, it was not only a great but also a very seasonable victory, since it happened that they got news at about the same time that the Etruscans had commenced hostilities again.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>men</reg> wondered how they could have withstood Etruria if anything had gone wrong in Samnium; for the Samnite coalition and the diversion of both consuls <pb id="p.533"/>and all Rome's military strength to Samnium had<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> encouraged these other enemies to revolt while the Roman People had their hands full.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/><reg>deputations</reg> from the allies, introduced into the senate by Marcus Atilius the praetor, complained that their lands were being burnt and devastated by the neighbouring Etruscans, because they were not willing to forsake the Roman People, and besought the Conscript Fathers to defend them against the violence and injuries of their common foes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <reg>answer</reg> was made to the deputations that the senate would see to it that the allies should not regret their loyalty:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the Etruscans would shortly meet with the same fortune as the Samnites, Nevertheless, the Etruscan business would have dragged but for intelligence that the Faliscans likewise, who had for many years been friendly, were now united in arms with the Etruscans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <name>The</name> proximity of this people sharpened the anxiety of the Fathers, and they decreed that fetials should be dispatched to demand redress. <reg>on</reg> the refusal of this demand, war was declared against the Faliscans, by command of the people, on the authorization of the senate, and the consuls were bidden to cast
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> lots to determine which should cross over with his army from Samnium into Etruria.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><name>Carvilius</name> had already taken Velia and Palumbinum and Herculaneum<note>The situation of none of these three towns is known.</note> from the Samnites &mdash;Velia in a few days' time, and Palumbinum the same day that he approached its walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <reg>at</reg> Herculaneum he even fought a regular engagement, of which the issue was for some time in doubt and his losses heavier than the enemy's; he then pitched his camp and shut the enemy up within his walls, and finally stormed the town and captured it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <reg>in</reg> these three <pb id="p.535"/>places ten thousand or so of the enemy were taken<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> or put to death, with the prisoners very slightly outnumbering the slain. <reg>when</reg> the consuls cast lots for their commands, Etruria fell to Carvilius, thus answering the prayers of his soldiers, who could endure no longer the rigorous cold in Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <name>Papirius</name>, before Saepinum, had a larger body of the enemy still to reckon with. <reg>his</reg> troops were many times engaged in regular battle, many times when marching, and many times about the city itself, in resisting the sorties of the enemy. <reg>it</reg> was not a siege, but war upon even terms; for the Samnites protected their walls with arms and men full as much as the walls protected them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <reg>at</reg> length, fighting hard, he forced the enemy to submit to a regular blockade, and by assault and siege &mdash;works captured the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <name>The</name> exasperation of the Romans made the massacre more bloody when the city fell. <reg>seven</reg> thousand four hundred were slain and fewer than three thousand were made prisoners. <name>The</name> booty, which was very great, since the Samnites had gathered their wealth together in a few cities,<note>The Samnites lived for the most part in small, unfortified villages; cf. chap. xvii. &sect; 2.</note> was handed over to the soldiers.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<name>The</name> ground was now covered with snow and men could no longer live out of doors. <name>The</name> consul therefore withdrew his army from Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <reg>on</reg> his coming to Rome he was unanimously voted a triumph. <reg>this</reg> he celebrated, while still holding office, in a style which, for the circumstances of those days, was magnificent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <reg>foot</reg>-soldiers and horsemen marched or rode past the crowds adorned with their decorations; many civic crowns were seen, and many that had been won at the escalade of a rampart or a city wall.<note>The civic crown was conferred on a soldier who saved the life of a fellow
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;citizen; the others on the first man to mount the enemy's rampart and city wall, respectively.</note> <reg>men</reg> inspected the spoils that he had <pb id="p.537"/>taken from the Samnites, and compared them for<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> splendour and beauty with those his father had won, which were familiar to them from being often used in the decoration of public
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> places. <reg>a</reg> number of noble captives, famous for their own and their fathers' deeds, were led in the procession. <reg>of</reg> heavy bronze there were carried past two million five hundred and thirty &mdash;three thousand pounds. <reg>this</reg> bronze had been collected, it was said, from the sale of captives. <reg>of</reg> silver which had been taken from the cities there were eighteen hundred and thirty
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> pounds. <reg>all</reg> the bronze and silver was placed in the Treasury, none of the booty being given to the soldiers. <name>The</name> ill &mdash;feeling which this gave rise to in the plebs was increased by the gathering of a war &mdash;tax to pay the troops, since, if the consul had forgone the glory of depositing the captured money in the Treasury, the booty would then have afforded the soldiers a donative, as well as providing for their
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> pay. <name>Papirius</name> dedicated the temple of Quirinus. <reg>i</reg> find no ancient authority who states that it was vowed in the hour of conflict, nor indeed could it possibly have been completed in so short a time; his father had vowed it when dictator, and the son as consul dedicated it, adorning it with the spoils of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> enemy. <reg>of</reg> these there was such a great quantity that not only were the temple and the Forum bedecked with them, but they were distributed also amongst the allies and the neighbouring colonies for the decoration of their temples and public
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> squares. <reg>after</reg> triumphing, Papirius led his army into the country of the Vescini &mdash;a district infested by the Samnites &mdash;to pass the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> winter.</p> <pb id="p.539"/>
				<p><reg>in</reg> Etruria meanwhile the consul Carvilius, having<note type="margin">B.C. 293</note> made his preparations to begin with an attack on Troilum,<note>Site unknown.</note> agreed with four hundred and seventy of the wealthiest inhabitants for a large sum of money to let them
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> go; the rest of the population and the town itself he took by assault. <reg>he</reg> then stormed five fortresses situated in positions of great
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> strength. <reg>there</reg> he slew two thousand four hundred of the enemy, making fewer than two thousand prisoners. <reg>he</reg> also granted a year's truce to the Faliscans &mdash;who came to him seeking peace &mdash;having stipulated for a hundred thousand of heavy bronze and the year's pay for his
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> soldiers. <reg>after</reg> these exploits he departed to enjoy his triumph, which, though less distinguished than his colleague's had been for success against the Samnites, was a match for it when the Etruscan war was counted
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> in. - Of heavy bronze he lodged in the Treasury three hundred and eighty thousand pounds; with what remained he contracted for a temple to Fors Fortuna to be erected from the general's spoils, near the temple of that goddess dedicated by
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> King Servius Tullius,<note>The temple was not mentioned by Livy in his account of that king's reign (I. xxxix.-xlviii.).</note> while to the soldiers he apportioned from the rest of the booty one hundred and two <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each, and as much again to the centurions and horsemen. <name>These</name> allowances were all the more welcome because of the parsimony of his
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> colleague. <name>The</name> consul's popularity served to shield his lieutenant Lucius Postumius from the people. <reg>he</reg> had been indicted by Marcus Scantius, a plebeian tribune, but had escaped trial before the people &mdash;so the story ran &mdash;through his appointment to the lieutenancy; so that it was easier to threaten him than to carry home the accusation.<note>The course of events somewhat obscurely indicated here would seem to have been as follows: &mdash;When Scantius lodged the indictment, Carvilius procured Postumius immunity for a year by making him a <hi rend="italics">legatus.</hi> <reg>on</reg> the expiration of the year some successor of Scantius revived the prosecution, but was induced by the friends of Carvilius to let the proceedings drop.</note></p> <pb id="p.541"/>

					desiring a successor, that his little farm had been deserted
					by the labourers hired to work it. <reg>afterwards</reg>, on
					Fortune's seeking to exhibit in the case of Regulus an

					she was fined. <reg>then</reg> for the first time two praetors were

					also the flamen of Mars, when he desired to go forth
					to war, nor would he suffer him to forsake his sacred
