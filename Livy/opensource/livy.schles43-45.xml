					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same summer in which this campaign<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> was fought in Thessaly, the staff-officer . . .,<note>The name is lost; perhaps it was the ex-consul Gaius Claudius (cf. XLII. xlix. 9), since the other ex-consul, Mucius, was made a <hi rend="italics">legatus</hi> (XLII. lxvii. 9, cf. also lviii. 13).</note> sent by the consul into Illyricum, besieged two rich cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ceremia<note>The name is uncertain, and is not mentioned elsewhere; the location of the town can only be conjectured.</note> he compelled by force of arms to surrender; and he left to its inhabitants all their possessions, in order by his reputation for clemency<note>The usual practice was to plunder a city which had been stormed, and spare one which surrendered (XXXVII. xxxii. 12).</note> to entice the dwellers in the walled city of Carnuns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After he had been unable either to induce them to surrender or to capture them by blockade, in order that his soldiery might not be worn out by two sieges and gain nothing, he plundered the city which he had previously left untouched.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Gaius Cassius the second consul failed to accomplish anything of note in Gaul,<note>The active sector of his province of Italy (XLII. xxxii. 4).</note> which had fallen to his lot, and made a vain attempt to lead his legions through Illyricum into Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul's venture on this journey became known to the senate through an <pb id="p.5"/>embassy from Aquileia, which complained that their<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> colony was new<note>It had been founded ten years before, cf. XL. xxxiv. 2.</note> and weak and had been as yet insufficiently fortified against the surrounding hostile tribes of Histrians and Illyrians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> on their requesting that the senate should concern itself with means for fortifying this colony, they were asked if they wished this matter to be entrusted to Gaius Cassius the consul, but replied that Cassius, having mustered his army at Aquileia, had set out through Illyricum for Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This report seemed unbelievable at first, and the senators each thought to himself that perhaps a campaign against the Carnians or Histrians had been begun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the envoys from Aquileia said that they knew and dared assert nothing more than that thirty days' grain had been issued to the soldiery, and that guides who knew the roads from Italy into Macedonia had been sought out and taken along.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then indeed the senate was incensed that the consul had such effrontery as to leave his own district, trespass upon his colleague's, lead his army by a dangerous, untried route<note>Cassius would either have had to traverse uninterruptedly mountainous country, as he followed the coast, or to go far inland, approximately to the line of the modern railway to Saloniki, as Philip planned for the Bastarnae; but these would have been aided by friendly tribes, whereas Cassius would have been beyond aid. The Romans had always used the short sea-route from Brundisium to Illyricum and Greece, little as they liked seafaring.</note> among foreign peoples, and leave open to so many tribes the way into Italy.<note>The most recent threat from this direction had been in 186-<date value="-183">183 B.C.</date>, cf. XXXIX. xxii. 6, xlv. 6-7, liv, though the Transalpine Gauls who had moved in near Aquileia had acted peaceably enough. Cf. the plans of Philip for an invasion of Italy by the Bastarnae, XL. lvii.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A full senate decreed that the praetor Gaius Sulpicius should name three envoys from among the senators, who should that very day set out from the city and with all possible speed overtake the consul Cassius, wherever he might be;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> they were to declare to him that he must not engage in war with any people unless <pb id="p.7"/>the senate had determined on war against them.<note>Strictly speaking, both the senate and the people had to approve the undertaking of a war; cf. the condemnations of similar unauthorized forays in XXXVIII. xlv. 5 and XLI. vii. 7-8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> The following envoys set out: Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Marcus Fulvius, Publius Marcius Rex. Fear for the consul and his army displaced for the present any consideration of fortifying Aquileia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next, envoys of several peoples from each of the Spains were presented to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After complaining of the greed and arrogance of Roman officials,<note>On the overbearing attitude of Roman officials at this time, cf. below, vii-viii.</note> they begged of the senate on bended knees that it would not permit them, its allies, to be more wretchedly despoiled and harassed than its enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since they complained of other acts of injustice also and it was in fact obvious that money had been extorted, the task was assigned to the praetor Lucius Canuleius, to whom Spain<note>The two provinces recognized in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXII. xxviii. 11 and the note) were combined during this war in order to leave one praetor free to command the fleet (<date value="-171">171 B.C.</date>, XLII. xxxi. 9; presumably in 170; 168, XLIV. xvii. 9; in 167, the two provinces were again separated, XLV. xvi. 1).</note> had been allotted, to assign for each man, from whom the Spaniards were seeking to recover money, five judges<note>Sometimes such a board was chosen by the parties to the case, either from their own number, or from a panel proposed by the magistrate in charge, but several inscriptions (<hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi>2 I. 585, p. 460. xxxiv) mention choice of the arbiters by the magistrate. <hi rend="italics">Recuperatores</hi> (literally <quote>recoverers</quote>) were usually concerned with a claim involving Romans <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> foreigners. As foreigners, the Spaniards had to be represented by Roman advocates.</note> of senatorial rank and to permit the Spaniards to choose any advocates they might wish.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The decree of the senate was read to the envoys, who had been summoned to the senate-house, and they were ordered to name their advocates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They named four, Marcus <pb id="p.9"/>Porcius Cato,<note>He had benefited the province in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> by establishing order and developing mining, cf. XXXIV. xxi. A speech in this case seems to have been once extant under the title <hi rend="italics">Pro Hispanis de frumento</hi> (Charisius II. 198. 224 Keil) in which Cato attacked Publius Furius Philus, praetor of Nearer Spain in <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date> (XLI. xxi. 3, cf. below, 8) for unjust valuation of grain received as tribute (Asconius on Cicero <hi rend="italics">Divinatio in</hi> <hi rend="italics">M. Caecilium</hi> 66, <hi rend="italics">Cato accusavit</hi> . . . <hi rend="italics">P. Furium pro iisdem</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Lusitanis) propter iniquissimam aestimationem frumenti</hi>), cf. below, 12.</note> Publius Cornelius Scipio son of Gnaeus,<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> Lucius Aemilius Paulus son of Lucius,<note>Scipio had been praetor in Farther Spain in <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> (XXXIV. xliii. 7 records his assignment, XXXV. i. 3-12, his exploits), and Paulus had been in Farther Spain as praetor and propraetor from 191 to <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (his assignment in XXXVI. ii. 6; his activities, XXXVII. lvii. 5-6).</note> and Gaius Sulpicius Gallus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The case of Marcus Titinius, who had been praetor in Nearer Spain during the consulship of Aulus Manlius and Marcus Junius,<note>In <date value="-178">178 B.C.</date>; Titinius was also in Spain the following two years (XLI. ix. 3, xv. 11, xxvi. 1). A namesake was City Praetor in 178.</note> was first taken up by a board of judges.<note>This is the earliest known trial of an official thus accused by provincials; previous complaints of like nature (cf. XXIX. xvi-xix, XXXIX. iii. 1-3, below, v) had been adjusted by the senate directly, or through the consuls.</note> The trial was twice adjourned, and at the third session the defendant was acquitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A dispute arose between the envoys of the two provinces; the peoples of Nearer Spain chose as advocates Marcus Cato and Publius Scipio, those of Farther Spain took Lucius Paulus and Sulpicius Gallus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There were brought before judges by the peoples of the nearer province Publius Furius Philus, by those of the farther province Marcus Matienus<note>Cf. XLI. xxviii. 5, where the first name is given as Gaius.</note> ; the former had been praetor three years before, in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> consulship of Spurius Postumius and Quintus Mucius, the latter had served two years before, when Lucius Postumius and Marcus Popilius were consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Both were accused on most serious charges and the cases were adjourned; when the time came for a fresh trial, the defence reported that they had left Roman territory to go into exile. Furius went for his exile to Praeneste, Matienus to <pb id="p.11"/>Tibur.<note>Polybius VI. xiv. 7 mentions these towns and Naples as <hi rend="italics">asyla</hi> for exiles, and praises as a form of Roman moderation the institution of voluntary exile. In these private suits the exile was apparently not made official by the <quote>ban of fire and water,</quote> as in cases prosecuted by the state, cf. XXVI. iii. 12. Exiles automatically surrendered their Roman citizenship and took up that of the town in which they took refuge.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There was a rumour that the advocates<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> would not allow accusations against men of rank and influence; this suspicion was increased by Canuleius the praetor, who gave up this investigation, began to hold a levy, and then suddenly left for his province, so that no more men should be assailed by the Spaniards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Though bygones were thus shrouded in silence, the senate voted for the future what the Spaniards had requested &mdash;that a Roman official should not set the price for grain, nor compel the Spaniards to sell their five-per-cent quotas<note>Roman officials are forbidden to demand an arbitrary money-equivalent for grain furnished them, perhaps for their own use and that of their army; nor are they arbitrarily to set the price paid for the grain which the Spaniards were required to sell to the Romans, in order to help maintain the flow of grain to Italy. Whereas in Sicily tithes of grain constituted a tax traditional in the region and continued by the Romans, in Spain the tax (<hi rend="italics">stipendium</hi>) paid to the Romans as overlords seems to have been in money, or perhaps in precious metals; the twentieths here mentioned were not a tax, but a compulsory sale, like the <hi rend="italics">second</hi> tithe which might on occasion be required of Sicily. The size of the quota perhaps reflects the lesser fertility of Spain. Special levies of money and grain from Spain are mentioned in XXIX. iii. 5 (a punitive levy), XXX. iii. 2 (a war-levy for the army in Africa) and XXX. xxvi. 6 (perhaps the regular tax).</note> at the price he wished, and that no officers should be placed over their towns to collect money.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Another embassy, also from Spain, of a novel class of people, arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Stating that they were the children of Roman soldiers and of Spanish women, between whom legal marriage could not exist,<note>Children of such unrecognized marriages were not illegitimate in the modern sense, but had the mother's status, so that these people were legally Spaniards.</note> and that they numbered over four thousand souls, they asked that a town be given them in which to live.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate decreed that they should declare before Lucius Canuleius the praetor their own names and the names of any slaves they might have set free, <pb id="p.13"/>and that it was the pleasure of the senate that these<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> people should be settled at Carteia near the Ocean;<note>Carteia was at the head of the Bay of Algeciras, just west of Gibraltar.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> any present inhabitants of Carteia who wished to remain at home would have the opportunity to be members of the colony, but on assigned land.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> they might not keep their former land, but must take a share along with the newcomers.</note> This colony was to have Latin rights<note>This was the first colony outside of the Italian peninsula to be given Latin rights; it was, in legal theory, an autonomous ally of Rome, whose citizens had the rights of trade and intermarriage with Romans.</note> and to be called the freedmen's colony.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At the same time there came from Africa both Prince Gulussa, the son of Masinissa, as ambassador for his father, and Carthaginian envoys.<note>The previous story of the boundary dispute between these parties is told in XLII. xxiii-xxiv.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Gulussa was presented to the senate first, and set forth what supplies had been sent by his father for the Macedonian campaign<note>As related in XLII. Ixii. 2, lxv. 12-14, lxvii. 8.</note> ; he also promised that if they wished to order anything further, his father would furnish it, as due return to the Roman people, and he warned the senators to beware of treachery from the Carthaginians; they had adopted the plan, he added, of preparing a large fleet,<note>The Carthaginians had been left with only ten triremes (the cruisers of this period) at the end of the Second Punic War (XXX. xxxvii. 3); the treaty did not expressly forbid the rebuilding of the fleet, but the Romans would no doubt have prevented such action, except for the reason here alleged by the Carthaginians; on naval help to Rome by the Carthaginians, cf. XXXVI. xlii. 2 and XLII. lvi. 6.</note> ostensibly for the Romans and against the Macedonians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> when this fleet should be ready and equipped, the Carthaginians would be free to decide for themselves who should be considered an enemy or who an ally. The instilling of this [suspicion caused the senate] . . .<note>Four quaternions are lost from the MS. at this point. The following matters were treated: the outcome of the dispute between Masinissa and Carthage; the choice of magistrates and their provinces for <date value="-170">170 B.C.</date> &mdash;the consuls were Aulus Hostilius Mancinus for Macedonia and Aulus Atilius Serranus for Italy (cf. below), while the praetor Lucius Hortensius received the fleet; the mistreatment of Coronea by Licinius (cf. below, iv. 5 and 11, and the Summary); the defeat of the praetor Lucretius at Ore&uuml;s (Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius Paullus</hi> ix); the secession of the Epirotes and Hostilius' narrow escape from them (cf. below, xxi. 4, Polybius XXVII. 13-14, Diodorus XXX. 5); Hostilius' unsuccessful campaign (cf. XLIV. ii. 6 and xxxvi. 10); Macedonian successes against the Dardani and Illyrians (cf. below, xix. 14, the Summary, and Orosius iv. 20); and the flare-up in Spain (cf. the Summary), the account of which comes to a conclusion as the text resumes.</note></p> <pb id="p.15"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>. . they thereafter<note><quote>thereafter</quote> is a conjecture not usually accepted by editors. The <quote>heads</quote> evidently belonged to two leaders of the revolt; those who brought them to the Spanish camp may have been released prisoners.</note> caused such terror as<note type="margin">B.C. 170</note> they entered the camp, displaying the heads, that if the army had been brought up at once, the camp might have been taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Even as it was, a great panic took place, and there were those who advised sending envoys to beg for peace; many cities, too, on hearing this news, offered themselves in surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These cities cleared themselves and placed the blame on the folly of two men<note>Olonicus was the chief rebel, according to the Summary.</note> who had of their own accord gone to meet their punishment, and the praetor, having accepted these excuses, set out at once for the other cities and, since everybody obeyed his
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> commands, passed without using his army through a region, now peaceful, which shortly before had been aflame with a huge uprising.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This clemency of the praetor, whereby without bloodshed he had tamed a very war-like people, was the more pleasing to the Roman commons and the Fathers because the campaign in Greece had been conducted with too much cruelty and greed by both the consul Licinius and Lucretius the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucretius was assailed in his absence by the tribunes of the people in meeting after meeting, although it was stated in his behalf that he was absent in the service of the state; but in that day even the neighbourhood of the city was such unknown territory that he was at that time on his estate at Antium<note>Less than 35 miles from Rome.</note> and was engaged in bringing water to Antium from the River Loracina<note>A small stream east of the city.</note> at the <pb id="p.17"/>cost of his spoils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He is said to have let the contract<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> for this work at one hundred and thirty thousand <hi rend="italics">asses;</hi> he also decorated with paintings from the booty the temple of Aesculapius.<note>According to Valerius Maximus I. viii. 2 this temple was earlier than that of Aesculapius at Rome.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Disapprobation and disgrace were diverted from Lucretius to Hortensius, his successor, by envoys from Abdera,<note>Abdera was apparently a free ally of Rome.</note> who wept before the senate-house and complained that their city had been stormed and plundered by Hortensius;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the reason for the destruction of the city had been, they said, that when the praetor had ordered a hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> and fifty thousand peeks of wheat, they had asked for a stay, during which they might send envoys about the matter to the consul Hostilius and to Rome. Hardly had they come to the consul when they heard that their town had been stormed, their leading men beheaded with the axe, and the rest sold at auction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This seemed to the senate a disgraceful occurrence, and they issued the same decree about the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> people of Abdera which they had issued the preceding year about the people of Coronea,<note>This city of Boeotia, an opponent of Rome, cf. XLII. xliv. 4, lxiii. 3, had been severely handled by the consul Licinius, cf. above, sec. 5, and the Summary, also Zonaras 9. 22. Livy's account of the event has been lost, cf. above, p. 13, n. 7.</note> and instructed Quintus Maenius the praetor<note>Apparently the praetor in charge of aliens (<hi rend="italics">peregrinus</hi>), since in ch. vi. 10 he receives the Lampsacenes as allies; the city praetor, Marcus Raecius, was absent, cf. below, ix. 6 and the note.</note> to make a similar proclamation before an assembly. Furthermore, two envoys, Gaius Sempronius Blaesus and Sextus Julius Caesar, were sent to restore the people of Abdera to freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To these same envoys instructions were given to inform both Hostilius the consul and Hortensius the praetor that
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> the senate had resolved that an improper war had been undertaken against the people of Abdera, and that it was just that all who were <pb id="p.19"/>enslaved should be sought out and restored to<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> freedom.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this same time complaints were made to the senate about Gaius Cassius, who had been consul the year before and was then a tribune of the soldiers<note>Cassius seems to have obtained this position directly after his consulship, to avoid returning to Rome and giving an account of his hare-brained attempt to reach Macedonia from north Italy (above, ch. i. 4-12).</note> in Macedonia with Aulus Hostilius, and envoys of Cincibilus, a king of the Gauls, arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king's brother spoke before the senate, complaining that Gaius Cassius had ravaged the land of the Alpine tribes, their allies, and had dragged thence into slavery many thousand persons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the same time envoys of the Carnians, Histrians, and Iapydes arrived; they said, first, that guides had been demanded of them by the consul Cassius, to show him the way as he was leading his army to Macedonia; he had left them peaceably as if to wage a war elsewhere.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Next, that returning from the middle of his journey, he had traversed their territory as an enemy; slaughter, pillage and burning had taken place everywhere; nor did they know to that very minute why they had been treated as enemies by the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both to the absent prince of the Gauls and to these peoples the answer was given that the senate neither had known that these occurrences of which they complained would take place nor, if they had taken place, did the senate approve. But to condemn an ex-consul in his absence without a trial would be an injustice, since he was absent in the service of the state;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> when Gaius Cassius should have returned from Macedonia, then, if they wished <pb id="p.21"/>to accuse him to his face, on hearing the case the<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> senate would see to it that amends were made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was voted not only to make a reply to these peoples, but to send envoys, two to the prince beyond the Alps and three to the several other peoples; the envoys were to announce what the opinion pronounced by the Fathers was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They determined to send to the envoys gifts of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> apiece and to the two princely brothers the following special gifts, two twisted necklaces made of five pounds of gold and five silver vessels of twenty pounds, and two horses with trappings for head and chest, along with their grooms, and cavalry weapons and military cloaks, and to the princes' attendants, both free and slave, garments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These things were sent; the following was granted at their request-that they should have the privilege of buying ten horses apiece and of exporting them from Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As envoys there were sent with the Gauls across the Alps Gaius Laelius and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,<note>Lepidus was chief of the Senate for the second time, and <hi rend="italics">pontifex maximus,</hi> cf. XL. li. 1, and below, ch. xv. 6; Laelius was probably the noted friend of Scipio Africanus; this embassy seems then to have been regarded as very important; the members of the other embassy are not otherwise known, unless Sicinius was not Gaius, but the Gnaeus Sicinius mentioned in XLII. ix. 8 and elsewhere.</note> and to the other peoples, Gaius Sicinius, Publius Cornelius Blasio, and Titus Memmius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time envoys from a large number of the states of Greece and Asia gathered in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Athenians were presented first; they pointed out that they had sent their whole fleet and army to Publius Licinius the consul and Gaius Lucretius the praetor;

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Milesians, without mentioning anything which they had furnished, promised that if the senate wished to order anything for the war they were ready to furnish it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The envoys of Alabanda announced that they had built a temple to the City of Rome,<note>Such a temple had been built by Smyrna in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date>, Tacitus, <hi rend="italics">Annals</hi> IV. 56. The conception of Rome as a goddess was quite un-Roman; it was invented by Greeks, adopted by Roman poets (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Vergil, <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi> VI. 781-7, Lucan, <hi rend="italics">Pharsalia</hi> I. 186-192), but not officially adopted as part of Roman religion till the reign of Hadrian (Cassius Dio LXIX. 4. 3).

For the whole must necessarily be prior to the part ...</quote> tr. Rackham, <hi rend="italics">L.C.L.</hi>).</note> and had established annual games in honour of that divinity;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they had also brought with them a golden crown of fifty pounds' weight to place in the Capitol as a gift to Jupiter Greatest and Best, besides three hundred cavalry shields; these they would deliver to whomever the senate ordered. They asked permission to place their gift in the Capitol and to offer sacrifice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same request was also made by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> people of Lampsacus, who brought a crown of eighty pounds' weight,<note>Perhaps a gift to the goddess Roma, like the similar but more lavish gift of Rhodes when in the bad graces of the Romans (Polybius XXX. 5. 4).</note> and called to mind that they had abandoned Perseus, after a Roman army had come into Macedonia, although they had been subject to Perseus and previously to Philip.<note>This statement may be inaccurate; Lampsacus declared itself independent of Antiochus in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxxviii. 3) and when last heard of (XXXVII. xxxv. 2, <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date>) was apparently recognized as independent; perhaps Livy or his source has assumed that Lampsacus had abandoned Perseus at the time when it came forward as an ally of Rome.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In return for this and for their action in furnishing the Roman generals with everything, they asked only that they might be <pb id="p.25"/>admitted to friendship<note>Apparently they wanted an entente with Rome, without the precise and formal undertakings of an alliance (<hi rend="italics">societas).</hi> Usually, <quote>friendship</quote> and <quote>alliance</quote> go hand in hand (<hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> XXXVI. iii. 8, XLV. xx. 8), but Rhodes maintained a state of <quote>friendship</quote> without alliance for 140 years (cf. below, XLV. xxv. 7-9) because, in the words of Polybius (XXX. 5. 8, tr.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A kindly answer was given the other envoys; as for the Lampsacenes, the praetor Quintus Maenius was ordered to enroll them as allies. Gifts of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> apiece were given to all the envoys. Those from Alabanda were ordered to carry the shields back to Aulus Hostilius, the consul in Macedonia.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Envoys from Africa also arrived, both Carthaginians and those of Masinissa together. The Carthaginian envoys reported that they had conveyed to the sea a million pecks of wheat and five hundred thousand of barley, in order that they might deliver it wherever the senate should determine;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> they said that this gift and act of duty of theirs was, they knew, less than a return for the favours of the Roman people and less than they would wish; but they had often, on other occasions when both peoples had been prospering, fulfilled the duties of grateful and faithful allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Likewise the envoys of Masinissa promised the same total of wheat as well as twelve hundred cavalry and twelve elephants;<note>He had previously sent a thousand cavalry, a thousand infantry, and twenty-two elephants (XLII. lxii. 2).</note> they requested the senate to order anything else which might be needed, for the king would furnish such things with as good a will as he gave what he, of his own accord, had <pb id="p.27"/>promised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thanks both to the Carthaginians and to<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> the king were expressed and they were asked to deliver what they had promised to Hostilius the consul in Macedonia. To each of the envoys a gift of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> was sent.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Cretan envoys reported that they had sent to Macedonia as large a force of archers as the consul Publius
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Licinius had stipulated, but when they did not deny, on being questioned, that a larger number of their archers were serving with Perseus<note>A force of nearly three thousand is mentioned in XLII. li. 7; they participated in at least one battle (XLII. lviii. 6).</note> than with the Romans, they were told in reply that if
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the people of Crete intended truly and zealously to prize the friendship of the Roman People above that of King Perseus, the Roman senate would also respond to them as it did to indubitable allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Meanwhile, let them report to their people that it was the pleasure of the senate that the people of Crete should make a point of recalling home at the first possible moment those soldiers whom they might have within the lines of King Perseus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the Cretans had been dismissed with this reply, the envoys of Chalcis were summoned; their embassy stirred sympathy by its very entrance, because Micythion,<note>The name is given in the MS. as Micion; but it seems probable that the Romanophile mentioned in XXXV. xxxviii. 1 and I-li is meant.</note> their chief, having an affliction of the feet, was borne in on a litter;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> at once the occasion seemed one of direst necessity, in which an excuse on grounds of health for one so afflicted either had seemed to the victim himself something for which he should not ask, or had not been granted at his request.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After he had begun by saying that no part of him was still living except the tongue <pb id="p.29"/>wherewith to bewail the disasters of his fatherland, he set<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> forth, first, the good services of his state, both in earlier times and those which, during the war with Perseus, they had performed for the Roman commanders
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and armies, and next the acts of arrogance, greed, and cruelty which in the first instance had been committed against Micythion's fellow-countrymen by Gaius Lucretius the Roman praetor, and, furthermore, were being committed more than ever at that time by Lucius Hortensius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Just as they considered that, rather than depart from their loyalty, they should suffer everything, even more grievous injuries than those which they were now suffering, so also, as far as Lucretius and Hortensius were concerned, they were aware that it would have been safer to bar their gates than to receive those Romans into their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Those cities which had shut them out &mdash;Emathia, Amphipolis, Maronea, Aenus<note>The approach to these cities seems to have been during a naval raid like that of Marcius, XLIV. x.</note> &mdash;were unharmed. In Chalcis, temples had been stripped of all their adornments and the loot of these profanations Gaius Lucretius had transported in his ships to Antium; free persons had been rushed away to slavery; the possessions of allies of the Roman people had been plundered and daily were being plundered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For, according to the precedent set by Gaius Lucretius, Hortensius too was quartering his sailors, in summer no less than in winter, in private houses, and the homes of Chalcis were full of the mob from the fleet; at large among the Chalcideans and their wives and their children there were men utterly reckless in word and deed.</p> <pb id="p.31"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was voted to summon Lucretius before<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> the senate in order that he might plead in person and attempt to clear himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> However, when he appeared he heard many more reproaches than had been hurled at him in his absence; and more influential and powerful accusers joined in, namely, two tribunes of the people, Manius Iuventius Talna and Gnaeus Aufidius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These not only assailed him in the senate, but also dragged him before an assembly, and after casting many reproaches at him, then set a day for his trial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By order of the senate Quintus Maenius the praetor replied to the envoys of Chalcis that, as to the services to the Roman People, both previously and in the war now being waged, which the envoys mentioned, the senate knew that they had spoken truly and, also, these services were appreciated exactly as they should be.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As to their complaints about what the Roman praetor Gaius Lucretius had done, and what Lucius Hortensius the Roman praetor was doing, no one could be unaware that these things had been done and were being done without the consent of the senate, &mdash;no
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> one, that is, who knew that the Roman People had declared war on Perseus and previously on Philip, his father, to preserve the freedom of Greece,<note>The slogan for Roman intervention to the eastward, cf. XXXIV. lviii. 11-12, XXXVII. liv. 17.</note> and not to inflict on allies and friends such injuries from Roman officers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His fellow-senators, said Maenius, would send a letter to the praetor Lucius Hortensius, saying that the senate was displeased with those actions of which the people of Chalcis complained; that if any free persons had been sold into slavery, he should take steps at the first possible moment to search them out <pb id="p.33"/>and restore them to freedom; that the senate<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> deemed it just that none of the sailors, except the captains, should be quartered in private houses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These instructions were by order of the senate written to Hortensius. Gifts of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> apiece were sent to the envoys, and carriages were hired at public expense for Micythion, to convey him comfortably to Brundisium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As for Gaius Lucretius, on the day set for his trial, the tribunes accused him before the people<note>In the <hi rend="italics">comitia tributa;</hi> a few more details in the account of the similar trial, below, xvi. 11-16.</note> and proposed a fine of one million <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Among the Ligurians nothing noteworthy was accomplished that year. For neither did the enemy take up arms, nor did the consul lead his legions into enemy territory;

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After having at an early time led the force of allies of the Latin Name into winter-quarters at Luna and Pisa, he himself visited with the cavalry several towns of the province of Gaul.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Nowhere else was there war except in Macedonia.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Claudius, being unsatisfied with the force that he had brought, by collecting auxiliaries from the allies brought under arms about eight thousand men of various sorts, and after traversing all that region took up his position at Lychnidus of the Dassaretii.<note>Garrisons had been placed in their territory the preceding year, XLII. xxxvi. 9.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not far from there lay Uscana, a town belonging to the lands and realm of Perseus.<note>But below, xviii. 5-xxi. 1, Livy relates, presumably after Polybius, that Uscana was held by a Roman garrison until captured by Perseus, and that Lucius Coelius led an abortive attempt to recover it. There seems to be a duplication of the story here, of which Livy is unaware; the account here given presumably comes from a Roman source.</note> It had ten thousand inhabitants and a moderate garrison of Cretans to protect it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From there, secret messengers kept coming to Claudius, declaring that if he would bring his troops up closer, there were those who were ready to betray the city. And it would be worth his while, they added, for he would not only satisfy himself and his friends, but also his soldiers with the booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hope joined to greed so blinded his mind <pb id="p.37"/>that neither did he keep with him any of the<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> messengers who had come, nor did he demand hostages as security that there would be no treachery in the carrying out of the plan, nor did he send men to reconnoitre, nor did he receive any solemn promise. Having merely agreed upon a day, he set out from Lychnidus and pitched camp twelve miles from the city to which he was marching.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thence in the fourth watch he began to advance, leaving about a thousand to garrison the camp. The soldiers arrived near the city in disorder, scattered in along column, and straggling, since wandering by night had dispersed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their carelessness increased after they saw no armed man on the walls. However, as soon as they were within range of missiles, a sally was made from two gates at once; and together with the battle-cry of the sallying parties, there arose from the walls a great uproar of women howling and of bronze clashing everywhere, while an unorganized crowd, with disorderly bands of slaves amongst them, clamoured with various outcries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This appalling surprise, presented from all directions in so many forms, brought it about that the Romans could not withstand the first storm-blast of the sally. And so more were slaughtered in the flight than in the combat; hardly two thousand men, together with the commander himself, escaped to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since the way to the camp was long, the enemy had the opportunity to overtake more of the weary men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Appius, not even lingering in camp to gather his men scattered in flight-an action which would have been the means of saving those who were wandering through the countryside-at once led back to Lychnidus the remnants of the disaster.</p> <pb id="p.39"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This and other affairs in Macedonia conducted<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> with no success were reported by Sextus Digitius, a tribune of the soldiers, who had come to Rome to offer a sacrifice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The result was that the Fathers, solicitous lest some greater disgrace might befall, sent as commissioners to Macedonia Marcus Fulvius Flaccus and Marcus Caninius Rebilus, who were to report after investigation on what was taking place;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the Fathers also decided that Aulus Atilius the consul should proclaim the assembly for the election of consuls for such a time that it might be completed during the month of January, and that he should return to the city at the first possible moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Meanwhile Marcus Raecius the praetor was charged with recalling to Rome by proclamation all senators from the whole of Italy, except those who were absent on public business, while those

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The commissioners from Macedonia returned when the month of February was just ended.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These reported the successes achieved by King Perseus during that summer, and how great a panic had seized the allies of the Roman people when so many cities were brought under the control of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The army of the consul, said the commissioners, was reduced in numbers because leaves of absence had been lavishly granted as a means of currying political favour; blame for this situation was placed by the consul on the tribunes of the soldiers, but by them, on the other hand, on the consul.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the other consul no fixed number of Roman citizens whom he might select as reinforcements was defined. This only was fixed that he should enroll two legions, each of which was to have five thousand and two hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Of the Latins, a larger number was assigned than to his colleague, ten thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry. Four additional legions were ordered enrolled, to be led out if needed anywhere. For these, the consuls were not allowed<note>Presumably by the senate (cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> However, not only does my own mind, as I write of old-time matters, become in some way or other old-fashioned, but also a certain conscientious scruple keeps me from regarding what those very sagacious men of former times thought worthy of public concern as something unworthy to be reported in my history.

At Minturnae also during these very days the sky presented the appearance of being on fire. At Reate there was a rain of stones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At Cumae the Apollo on the citadel shed tears for three days and three nights. In the city of Rome two temple-attendants announced portents; one, that a crested snake had been seen by many people in the temple of Fortune;

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two portents were not treated as public matters, the one because it took place in a privately-owned spot-Titus Marcius Figulus reported that a palm had sprung up in his catch-basin<note>This was an ornamental basin in the floor at the centre of the atrium, or principal room, which caught rain entering through the central opening of the roof (<hi rend="italics">compluvium</hi>).</note> &mdash;the other because it occurred in a non- Roman place<note>Fregellae was a Latin colony, therefore legally autonomous, and its territory not Roman; Minturnae was a Roman colony, hence part of Rome; Anagnia was either subject territory, or its inhabitants had been granted Roman citizenship; Cumae and Reate were <quote>allied states</quote> (<hi rend="italics">civitates foederatae</hi>), but their territory was evidently regarded as part of the Roman domain (<hi rend="italics">ager publicus</hi>).</note> &mdash;at Fregellae, in the house of Lucius Atreus, a spear which he had bought for his son's service in the army was said to have blazed during the day for more than two hours in such a way that the fire consumed none of it.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Retorting to them Gaius Sulpicius and Marcus Claudius the praetors pleaded the cause of the commons; the levy, they said, was difficult, not for consuls, but for politically-minded consuls; they never enrolled a soldier against his will.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That the Conscript Fathers might also be sure that this was so, they themselves, though praetors, whose powers of office and importance were less, would, if it seemed best to the senate, complete the levy.<note>Conduct of a levy by praetors when the consuls were otherwise occupied was not without precedent, cf. XXXIX. xx. 4, xxxviii. 10; XLII. xviii. 6; but the supplanting of the consuls was peculiar to this occasion.</note> This task was entrusted to the praetors with great enthusiasm on the part of the Fathers, not without jeers at the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The censors, to further the business, made the following proclamation before a meeting; that they were going to lay down a rule for taking the <pb id="p.51"/>census that, besides the general oath for all citizens,<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> they would require assent on oath to the following:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>Are you less than forty-six years of age, and have you, in accordance with the proclamation of Gaius Claudius and Tiberius Sempronius the censors, come forward for the levy, and as often as there shall be a levy, as long as these censors shall hold office,<note>Either for a year and a half, during which the censors were allowed to be active, by the Aemilian law (<date value="-434">434 B.C.</date>, IV. xxiv. 5, cf. IX. xxxiii. 3 ff.), or for three years, as the censors' authority over construction and repairs was, according to XLV. xv. 9, customarily continued for a second period of equal length; hardly for the full five years till other censors were chosen.</note> if you have not entered the army, will you come forward for the levy?</quote>;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> again, since it was rumoured that many were absent on leave from the legions in Macedonia without specific reason because of the popularity-hunting of the generals, they proclaimed concerning the soldiers enrolled for Macedonia in the consulship of Publius Aelius and Gaius Popilius<note><date value="-172">172 B.C.</date>; a small force crossed over to the towns of the west coast in that year, cf. XLII. xxvii.</note> or after that consulship, that whoever of them were in Italy should within thirty days, having first appeared before the censors, return to their province, and that the names of those who were subject to the authority of father or grandfather<note>Such men would not appear before the censors, as their property belonged to the estate of their controlling relative.</note> should be reported to the censors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They would also review, they said, the reasons for discharges, and those whose discharge before completion of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> military service seemed to the censors to result from indulgence they would order to be enrolled as soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Through this proclamation of the censors, and through their letters sent about throughout the markets and hamlets, so large a crowd of men of military age assembled at Rome that the unusual throng was burdensome to the city.</p> <pb id="p.53"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Besides the levy of those who were needed<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> to be sent as reinforcements four legions were enrolled by Gaius Sulpicius the praetor, and within eleven days the levy was completed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consuls then drew lots for their provinces. For the praetors had drawn lots more promptly to secure the administration of justice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The city praetorship fell to Gaius Sulpicius, the jurisdiction over aliens to Gaius Decimius; Spain was drawn by Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Sicily by Servius Cornelius Lentulus, Sardinia by Publius Fonteius Capito, the fleet by Gaius Marcius Figulus. Of the consuls, Italy fell to Gnaeus Servilius, and Macedonia to Quintus Marcius; when the Latin Festival had been held, Marcius at once set out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When Caepio then consulted the senate as to which two of the new legions he should take with him to Gaul, the Fathers voted that Gaius Sulpicius and Marcus Claudius the praetors should give the consul what legions they chose from those they had enrolled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Feeling insulted that a consul should be subject to the decision of praetors, Servilius dismissed the senate and, taking his stand at the judgment-seat of the praetors, demanded that, in accordance with the decree of the senate, they assign him two legions. The praetors gave the consul his choice in the selection.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Thereupon the censors chose the senate; Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was chosen chief. This was the third time the censors had chosen him.<note>His previous elections are recorded in XL. li. 1 and XLI. xxvii. 1.</note> Seven were expelled from the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In receiving the census of the people they forced the soldiers from the army in Macedonia &mdash;the census showed how numerous were these absentees from the ranks &mdash;to <pb id="p.55"/>return to their province;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> they reviewed the excuses<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> of those discharged from service, and in the case of any whose discharge seemed premature they compelled assent on oath to the following: <quote>With your whole heart will you, in accordance with the decree of Gaius Claudius and Tiberius Sempronius the censors, return to the province of Macedonia, as you are able, in all sincerity, to do this?</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In reviewing the knights, the censorship of these officials was rather stern and harsh; they deprived many of their horses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When in this matter they had offended the order of knights, they added fire to the grudge by a proclamation, in which they proclaimed that none of those who in the censorship of Quintus Fulvius and Aulus Postumius<note>The previous censors, XLI. xxvii.</note> had farmed the public revenues or the public works should appear at the auction of Claudius and Sempronius,<note>Literally, <quote>to their spear,</quote> since a spear was the sign of an auction; at the censors' auction contracts for public works and for collecting the revenues were to be made, cf. XXXIX. xliv. 8 and the note.</note> or should be a partner or sharer in the contracting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When, after many complaints about this decree, the veteran tax-gatherers were unable to induce the senate to set a limit to the censors' power,<note>Compare the Pyrrhic victory of the contractors in <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date>, XXXIX. xliv. 8.</note> at last in a tribune of the people, Publius Rutilius, who was angry with the censors over a dispute concerning a private matter, they found an advocate for their cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A freedman client of Rutilius had been ordered by the censors to pull down a house-wall on the Sacred Way opposite the public temples, because the wall was built on state land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> An appeal was made by the citizen to the tribunes. When no one but Rutilius intervened in his behalf, the censors <pb id="p.57"/>sent agents to secure bonds<note>Such bonds, designed to secure the appearance for trial of a person charged with a crime, were secured, not directly from the defendant, but from bondsmen from among his friends. For this practice, cf. III. xiii. 8, XXV. iv. 8-10, XXXIX. xli. 7, and Summary XLVIII. Aulus Gellius, XVI. x. 8, mentions bondsmen as one of the obsolete legal forms abolished by the <hi rend="italics">lex Aebutia</hi> (exact date unknown). After this time, bonds were posted by the defendant.</note> and announced before<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> a meeting a fine for the citizen.<note>The veto of one tribune sufficed to debar an action, but the censors apparently expected the other tribunes to suppress Rutilius, as had been done on various other occasions, cf. II. xliii. 4, IV. xlix. 6 and liii. 7, IX. xxxiv. 26, XXIV. xliii. 3, or that the senate would support them, cf. XXIX. xxxvii. 17.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A dispute having arisen from this cause, when the veteran tax-gatherers had resorted to the tribune, a proposed law was suddenly published under the name of the one tribune, stating that whereas Gaius Claudius and Tiberius Sempronius had let certain public revenues and public works, the letting of these should be void;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> they should be let anew, and everyone without restriction should have the right of farming and contracting. The tribune of the people announced for the assembly<note>An Assembly of the Commons (<hi rend="italics">concilium plebis</hi>).</note> a day for voting on this proposal.<note>An attempt is made here to translate the MS. text, without the usual alterations (see critical note). I accept the suggestion of Duker that the phrase, if completed, would be <hi rend="italics">ad eius rogationis rogationem, rogatio</hi> meaning (a) a bill or proposed law, (<hi rend="italics">b</hi>) the process of putting it to a vote.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When this day came, as the censors came forward to advise against the law,<note>In a meeting (<hi rend="italics">contio</hi>) held before the voting assembly.</note> while Gracchus was speaking there was silence; when heckling greeted Claudius, he ordered the herald to bring the meeting to order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When this was done, the tribune, complaining that the meeting had been taken out of his hands and that he had been deprived of his authority, left the Capitol, where the assembly was. Next day he raised a great uproar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He first dedicated to the gods the property of Tiberius Gracchus because in the matter of the fine and the bonds imposed on one who had appealed to a tribune, <pb id="p.59"/>Gracchus had, by not obeying the tribune's interposition,<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> deprived him of his authority;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> he set a day for the trial of Gaius Claudius on the charge of taking the meeting away from him; and he announced that he judged each censor guilty of treason, and asked of Gaius Sulpicius the city praetor a day for an assembly.<note>Rutilius proceeds under the law mentioned in III. Iv. 7, that one who injured a tribune should forfeit his head to Jupiter, and that his property should be sold at the temple of Ceres, Liber and Libera; the ceremony of dedicating the man and his property to the gods might be performed by a tribune, cf. Cicero, <hi rend="italics">De Domo Sua</hi> 47 (123-5), but apparently had to be confirmed by action of the people. Livy's phrasing seems to make Rutilius arrange for two trials for Claudius, but we hear of only one (below, 14-16) and it seems probable that the trial for treason, based on the charges mentioned, was the one action which was to confirm the sentence already pronounced by the tribune; also this sentence was probably directed equally against both, though Gracchus is named alone. For a trial of treason, the <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata</hi> was called, since a death-sentence was involved, not the <hi rend="italics">comitia tributa,</hi> as above, viii. 9, cf. the note, nor the <hi rend="italics">concilium plebis.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Since the censors did not object to having the people pass judgment on them at the first possible moment, the day for the assembly-trial for treason was set for the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of September.<note>A day for each defendant, see XXV. iv. 10.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The censors immediately mounted to the Hall of Liberty<note>This appears to have been next to the Senate-house, and perhaps a sort of annex to it. A rebuilding of the <hi rend="italics">atrium</hi> in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date> is mentioned in XXXIV. xliv. 5; hostages were kept there, according to XXV. vii. 12; archives for laws were maintained there (Festus 241); and the enrolment of freedmen in the city tribes took place there (XLV. xv. 5). The anniversary day of the sanctuary of Freedom was April thirteenth (Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Fasti</hi> IV. 623). In the first century B.C., slaves were imprisoned there (Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Pro Milone</hi> 59), and, following a plan of Julius Caesar's, Asinius Pollio founded there the first public library in Rome, with rich sculptural adornment (Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Tristia</hi> III. 1. 71-2, Suetonius, <hi rend="italics">Augustus</hi> 29).</note> and, having there sealed the public accounts and closed the account room and sent away the public slaves, declared that they would transact no public business until the judgment of the people upon them had been passed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Claudius pleaded his cause first; and when of the twelve centuries of knights eight had condemned the censor, along with many other centuries of the first class, at once the leading men of the state, in the sight of the people, laid aside their gold rings and <pb id="p.61"/>put on mourning,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> a dark toga; with it jewellery was not worn, and senators and magistrates did not wear the purple stripe on their togas of mourning.</note> in order to go about entreating<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> the commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Chiefly, however, Tiberius Gracchus is said to have changed men's minds, because, although there was everywhere shouting from the commons that Gracchus was in no danger, he swore in formal terms that if his colleague were condemned he would not await the outcome of his own trial, but would accompany Claudius into exile.<note>Except for the knights, among whom were the hostile tax-gatherers, the danger to Claudius obviously arose from his harsh and arbitrary behaviour; cf. his actions during his consulate in <date value="-177">177 B.C.</date>, XLI. x. 5-13.</note> None the less, so near did the defendant come to the last ray of hope that only eight centuries were lacking for condemnation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> When Claudius had been acquitted, the tribune of the people said that he did not care about the case of Gracchus.<note>The later activities of these censors are told below, XLIV. xvi. and XLV. xv.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In that year, at the request of envoys from Aquileia that the number of colonists be increased, fifteen hundred households were enrolled in accordance with a decree of the senate, and a board of three, Titus Annius Luscus, Publius Decius Subulo, and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, were sent to lead the settlement.<note>The reinforcement was sent two years after it was requested, cf. above, i. 5-12. The sending of settlers may have been easier during the censors' activity, cf. XXXIX. xliv. 10.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the same year<note>At this point Livy begins to draw on Polybius XXVIII, 3; but Polybius says that the envoys urged the Thebans to loyalty, and read the senate's resolution only in the Peloponnese.</note> Gaius Popilius and Gnaeus Octavius, the envoys who had been sent into Greece, first caused to be read at Thebes and then to be carried about to all the cities of the Peloponnese the decree of the senate that no one should contribute anything to Roman officers for the war except what the senate should have voted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This resolution had <pb id="p.63"/>produced confidence for the future, too, that they<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> had been relieved of both burdens and outlays, by which, as one and another ordered various things, they were being drained dry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Before an Achaean council held for them at Aegium the Roman envoys both spoke and were heard with cordiality,<note>Cf. Polybius XXVIII. 3. 7-10.</note> and leaving this most loyal people with extraordinary hope for their future position, they crossed to Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There no revolt indeed had as yet broken out, but every move was suspected and replete with the mutual recriminations of the Aetolians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> having, because of these, called for the giving of hostages, but without bringing the trouble to an end,<note>Cf. Polybius XXVIII. 4.</note> the envoys set out thence for Acarnania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At Thyrreum the Acarnanians held a council for the envoys. There too a contest between factions was under way; some of the chief men demanded that garrisons be brought into their cities to guard against the madness of those who were dragging the tribe toward the Macedonians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> some objected to this, on the ground that the disgrace which was customary for those captured in war and hostile should not be inflicted on peaceful and allied cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This plea in opposition seemed sound.<note>Cf. Polybius XXVIII. 5.</note> The envoys returned to Hostilius the proconsul at Larisa &mdash;for they had been sent by him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Octavius he kept with him, Popilius he sent with about a thousand soldiers into winter quarters at Ambracia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Perseus did not dare to leave the limits of Macedonia at the outset of winter, for fear that at some point the Romans might raid his undefended realm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About the winter solstice, however, when <pb id="p.65"/>the depth of snow makes the mountains<note>That is, the western passes, cf. XLII. liii. 6; Tempe was held by the Macedonian garrison at Gonnus, XLII. liv, 8; and cf. XLIV. ii.</note> impassable<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> from Thessaly, he thought that here was an opportunity to shatter the hopes and spirits of his neighbours, so that no danger might arise from them while his attention was turned toward the campaign against the Romans. On the side of Thrace Cotys assured peace, as did Cephalus on the side of Epirus<note>Livy's account of affairs in Epirus and the campaign against the Dardani is lost, cf. above, iii. 7 and the note. Concerning the latter, Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius Paullus</hi> IX. 3, says that Perseus killed 10,000 Dardanians and acquired much booty.</note> by his sudden desertion of the Romans, while the recent campaign had subdued the Dardani.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Perceiving then that the only quarter hostile to Macedonia was that which allowed access from Illyricum, where the Illyrians themselves were restless and were providing the Romans with an approach, and that if he conquered the nearest Illyrians, he might also entice King Gentius, who had long been wavering, into an alliance, Perseus set
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> out with ten thousand infantry, some of whom were phalanx-men,<note>The rest were peltasts, cf. Perseus' muster-roll in XLII. li. 3-11.</note> two thousand light troops, and five hundred cavalry, and reached Stuberra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thence, taking grain for a number of days and ordering equipment for besieging cities to follow, on the third day he pitched camp by Uscana<note>Cf. above, x. and the note, for a Roman counter-attack on this town, the account of which Livy has not harmonized with Polybius' account reproduced here.</note> &mdash;which is the largest city of the Penestian region &mdash;but sent, before bringing an attack to bear, men to test the mood, now of the commanders of the garrison, now of the townspeople.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For there was in the city, along with the young men of the Illyrians, a Roman garrison. After the messengers reported <pb id="p.67"/>nothing in the way of terms, Perseus began to press<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> the siege and tried to capture the city with a surrounding attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although without interruption through day and night relay of men after relay here brought ladders against the walls, and there fire against the gates, nevertheless, the defenders of the city withstood this tempest, because they had
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> hopes that the Macedonians could not longer endure the violence of winter in the open, and that the lull in the Roman campaign would not long permit the king to linger. However, after they saw sheds being brought up and towers raised, their determination was overcome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For apart from the fact that they were not equally matched against the assault, there was no supply even of grain or of anything else in the city, as was natural when the siege was unexpected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so, since there was no hope of holding out, Gaius Carvilius of Spoletium and Gaius Afranius were sent from the Roman garrison to request of Perseus, first, that he should permit them to depart under arms and carrying their possessions with them, and next, if they failed to obtain this, that they should at least receive assurances of life and freedom. The king's generosity was greater in promise than in performance; for after bidding them to depart carrying their possessions with them, he deprived them first of their arms, then of their freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After the Romans had left the city, both the force of Illyrians &mdash;there were five hundred of them &mdash;and the people of Uscana surrendered themselves and their city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After placing a garrison in Uscana, Perseus <pb id="p.69"/>took the whole mass of prisoners, which almost<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> equalled his army in numbers,<note>According to ch. x. above, the population of Uscana was 10,000.</note> to Stuberra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, after assigning the Romans &mdash;of whom there were four thousand<note>In view of the numbers given elsewhere for garrison details (XLII. xxxvi. 9, forts of Dassaretii and Illyrians, 2000 Romans; lxvii. 9, Ambracia, 2000 men; XLIII. ix. 6, force of Claudius, 4000 Romans, 4000 local levies, to protect Illyricum in general), this number seems exaggerated.</note> &mdash;, except the chief officers, to various cities to guard, and selling the people of Uscana and the Illyrians, he led the army back among the Penestae in order to bring
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> under his control the town of Oaeneum, which was in many ways strategically situated, particularly in that the route to the Labeates, where Gentius was king, passes this way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As he was passing a populous fort, Draudacum by name, one who knew this region said that there was no use of capturing Oaeneum unless Draudacum too was under his control; for it was even more strategically situated for all purposes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On his bringing up his army, all at once surrendered.</p> 
				<p>Encouraged by this surrender, more prompt than he had hoped, after he noticed how great was the fear caused by his column, -he brought under his control eleven other forts because of this same dread.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At only a very few was there need of force; the rest were voluntarily surrendered; and in these there were taken prisoner fifteen hundred<note>In view of the numbers given elsewhere for garrison details (XLII. xxxvi. 9, forts of Dassaretii and Illyrians, 2000 Romans; lxvii. 9, Ambracia, 2000 men; XLIII. ix. 6, force of Claudius, 4000 Romans, 4000 local levies, to protect Illyricum in general), this number seems exaggerated.</note> Roman soldiers who had been distributed among the garrisons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Carvilius of Spoletium was most useful in the parleys, in saying that no harshness had been used against him and his comrades. Next, Perseus arrived at Oaeneum, which could not be taken without a regular <pb id="p.71"/>siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The city was strong both because of a somewhat<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> larger force of young men than the others had had and because of its walls; moreover, on the one side a river, Artatus by name, on the other a very high mountain, difficult to ascend, girt the city about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These defences gave the people of the city hope of holding out. Perseus, after encircling the town with earthworks, began to build up a mound on the higher side, high enough to bring him above the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While this work was in progress, the frequent battles which meanwhile took place, as the townspeople resorted to sallies to protect their walls and to hinder the siege-works of the enemy, caused a great wastage in casualties of one kind or another, while those townspeople who survived were incapacitated by daily and nightly toil and by wounds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As soon as the mound was joined to the wall, the royal company, whom they call the Conquerors,<note>It is not clear to what sort of unit Livy is referring; one would suppose a <hi rend="italics">corps d'&eacute;lite,</hi> and the reference, in XXVIII. v. 15, to a royal company kept by Philip as a mobile reserve under his personal command, would seem to confirm this; so also the royal company of Antiochus, called the Silver- Shields, in XXXVII. xl. 7; but the royal company mentioned in XL. vi. 3, at a review of the Macedonian army, would seem to be the group of young nobles described in XLV. vi. 7, as serving as royal pages or squires, cf. Arrian IV. xiii. 1, Diodorus XVII. 65, Curtius Rufus VIII. vi. 2-7, and X. vii. 16. The only other reference to the name <quote>Conquerors</quote> is Hesychius' definition: <quote>the most excellent in the units</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">nikath=res oi( a)kmaio/tatoi e)n tai=s ta/cesi</foreign>)</note> passed over it, and also at the same time an attack was made with ladders against many parts of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> All the adult males were killed; their wives and children Perseus put under guard; the other items of booty fell to the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Returning thence victoriously to Stuberra, he sent as envoys to Gentius, Pleuratus the Illyrian, who was in exile at his court, and Adaeus, a Macedonian from Beroea;<note>Taken from Polybius XXVIII. 8; who adds the Epirotes to the list of Perseus' opponents, cf. above, xviii. 2.</note> he instructed them to relate his achievements of that summer and winter against <pb id="p.73"/>the Romans and Dardanians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> they were to add the<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> recent operations of his winter march into Illyricum; and they were to urge Gentius to join in friendship with Perseus and the Macedonians.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After crossing the ridge of Mount Scordus, and passing through the desert regions of Illyricum, which the Macedonians had purposely made desert by ravaging, so that there might be no easy passage for the Dardanians to Illyricum or Macedonia, these envoys came at last with great toil to Scodra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> King Gentius was at Lissus. Thither the envoys were summoned, and their message was given a favourable hearing; but the reply which they took away accomplished nothing; it was to the effect that Gentius did not lack the will to fight the Romans, but to try to effect his will he did especially lack money.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These words the envoys reported at Stuberra to the king, who was at that moment engaged in selling the prisoners from Illyricum. At once the same envoys, with the addition of Glaucias from among the king's bodyguard, were sent back with no word about money, by which alone the poverty-stricken barbarian could be urged into war.<note>On Perseus' stinginess, cf. XLII. lxvii. 5 and the note, XLIV. xxvi. 1, Polybius XXVIII. 9; Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xii. 4-xiii. 2 mentions the Bastarnae as also victims of Perseus' greed, and points out the contrast to Alexander the Great and Philip, his father, who disregarded money for the sake of conquest.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thence after a few days he sent Marcus Trebellius of Fregellae with a strong enough detachment among the Penestae to receive hostages from those cities which had remained loyal to the alliance; he ordered Trebellius to proceed also to the Parthini,<note>They had been recognized as allies of the Romans in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (Polybius II. 11. 11, VII. 9. 13, Livy XXIX. xii. 13), but seem to have come again under Philip's rule; in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date>, XXXIII. xxxiv. 11, they were put under Pleuratus, the father of Gentius (not the exile mentioned above, xix. 13), who had aided Rome against Philip (XXXI. xxviii. 1-3, xl. 10; cf. also below, xxiii. 6).</note> for they had likewise promised to give hostages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From both peoples Trebellius exacted the hostages without disturbance. The knights of the Penestae were sent to Apollonia, those of the Parthini to Dyrrachium &mdash;at that time the name Epidamnus was more generally in use among the Greeks.<note>Including Polybius, e.g., XXXIV. 7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Appius Claudius, eager to atone for the disgrace he had received in Illyricum,<note>Cf. above, ix-x.</note> attempted to besiege Phanote, a fort of Epirus. He took with him auxiliaries from the Chaonians<note>Phanote lay in their territory; the Chaonians were divided in their attachment, some holding with Perseus.</note> and The sprotians, besides his Roman army, a total of about six <pb id="p.77"/>thousand men; he did not accomplish anything<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> worth his trouble, since Cleuas, who had been left by Perseus, was defending it with a strong garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Perseus also, setting out for Elimea,<note>Here the city, not the district as in XXXI. xl. 1, XLII. liii. 5, and Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> ix. 3.</note> and purifying his army in that neighbourhood, led his force, at the invitation of the Epirotes,<note>Epirote exiles, cf. below xxii. 9, unless this is a mistake for <quote>Aetolians.</quote></note> to Stratus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Stratus was at that time the strongest city of Aetolia; it is situated inland from the Ambracian Gulf near the River Inachus.<note>Until <date value="-270">270 B.C.</date> the chief city of Acarnania, Stratus was then given to the Aetolians. The river is properly the Achelo&ouml;s (cf. <hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> Polybius V. 13. 10); the name Inachus was sometimes applied to the upper portion of the Achelo&ouml;s which was mistakenly regarded as a tributary, hence, perhaps, Livy's mistake.</note> Perseus set out thither with ten thousand infantry and three handred cavalry, a smaller number of which<note>Two hundred less cavalry (and apparently the two thousand light-troops were also omitted) than on the previous expedition; above, xviii. 4.</note> he took with him because of the narrowness and roughness of the roads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When on the third day he had arrived at Mount Citium, the snow was so deep that he barely succeeded incrossing and had difficulty also in finding a place for his camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Setting out thence, more because he could not stay than because either the way or the weather was bearable, with great suffering, especially of the baggage-animals, on the second day he pitched camp at the temple of Jupiter whom they call the Victorious.<note>Zeus Nikaios. is named in inscriptions from Asia Minor; Cassius Dio XLVII. 40. 2 uses this name as a translation of <quote>Jupiter Victor</quote> at Rome.</note> Thence having traversed a huge march to the Aratthus River, he halted . . . delayed by the depth of the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In this length of time a bridge was finished, and, leading his troops across, he proceeded one day's march and effected a meeting with <pb id="p.79"/>Archidamus, a prominent Aetolian, who was trying<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> to hand over Stratus to him.<note>Archidamus is mentioned by Polybius XXVIII. 4. 8 as accused of anti-Romanism by Lyciscus, a professional pro-Roman, cf. Vol. XII. p. 403, and 478, note 1.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On that day camp was pitched at the edge of Aetolian territory; thence on the second day they arrived at Stratus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although, when he pitched camp there near the Inachus River, Perseus expected the Aetolians to come streaming out of every gate to put themselves under his protection, he found that the gates were closed and that on the very night when he had arrived a Roman garrison, under the staff-officer Gaius Popilius, had been received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The leading men, driven by the influence of Archidamus while he was there, had summoned the king, but had become less active when Archidamus had gone out to meet Perseus, and had given an opportunity to the opposing party of summoning Popilius with a thousand infantry from Ambracia.<note>Cf. above, xvii, 10.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Just in time, too, came Dinarchus, the chief of cavalry<note>This officer was second in command of the Aetolian League, cf. XXXVIII. xi. 7.</note> of the Aetolian League, with six hundred infantry and a hundred cavalry. It was well known that he had come to Stratus as if on his way to Perseus, but then, changing his mind with his
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> luck, had joined the Romans, against whom he had come. Popilius, for his part, was not more off his guard than he should have been, considering the fickle temperaments which encompassed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He at once took control of the keys of the gates and the guarding of the walls, and removed to the citadel, ostensibly as
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> its garrison, Dinarchus and his Aetolians, along with the young men of Stratus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Perseus, after attempting parleys from the hills which overhang the upper part of the <pb id="p.81"/>city,<note>To the north; ruins of the small citadel are traceable in this quarter.</note> on seeing that they were determined and were<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> even keeping him at a distance with missiles, pitched his camp five miles from the city across the river Petitarus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There he called a council and, although Archidamus and the Epirote deserters tried to keep him where he was, when the leading Macedonians were of the opinion that he should not fight against the unfavourable season of the year without having arranged for supplies, since the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> blockaders were bound to feel the want of them before the blockaded, especially when winter-quarters of the enemy were not far distant, Perseus in fear moved his camp into Aperantia.<note>Taken by the Aetolians from Philip in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date>, XXXVIII. iii. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Aperantians, because of their great regard for Archidamus and his influence with that people, by general agreement received Perseus; Archidamus himself, with a garrison of eight hundred men, was put in charge of the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With no less suffering of beasts and men than when he had come, the king returned to Macedonia; Appius, however, was drawn away from the siege of Phanote by the report that Perseus was marching on Stratus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Cleuas, following with a force of vigorous young men beneath the almost impassable spurs of the mountains, killed about a thousand men of the burdened column and captured about two hundred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After passing over the narrows, Appius remained in camp a few days in the plain which they call Meleon. Meanwhile Cleuas, taking along Philostratus, who had five hundred of the Epirote people, crossed over to the territory of <pb id="p.83"/>Antigonea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Macedonians set out to plunder;<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> Philostratus with his detachment settled down in ambush in a hidden spot. When armed men sallied forth from Antigonea against the scattered plunderers, as they pursued in too open order after these fugitives, they burst into the valley ambushed by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After the killing there of about a thousand and the capturing of nearly a hundred, the campaign was successfully conducted everywhere, and they moved their camp near the settled camp of Appius, so that no violence might be inflicted by the Roman army on their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Appius, who was wasting time to no purpose in these parts, after sending away the forces of Chaonians, The sprotians and whatever other Epirotes there were, retired to Illyricum with his Italian soldiers, divided his men in winter-quarters among the allied cities of the Parthini, and himself returned to Rome to offer sacrifices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Perseus sent to Cassandrea to act as its garrison a thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry recalled from the people of the Penestae. The envoys returned from Gentius with the same reply.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the one hand, Perseus did not cease thereafter to make overtures to him by sending embassy after embassy, and, on the other hand, although it was obvious how much reinforcement Gentius could provide, yet he could not induce himself to incur expense for a matter of the greatest importance in every respect.<note>Cf. above, p. 73, note 1.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AT the beginning of the spring following the<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> winter campaigns just mentioned, Quintus Marcius Philippus<note>Cf. XLII. xxxvii. &mdash;xlvii. and lvi. 7.</note> the consul left Rome and reached Brundisium with five thousand<note>This figure seems to come from Polybius.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> legions. The ex-consul Marcus Popilius<note>Cf. XLII. xxii. 7.</note> and some young men of equally high birth accompanied the consul as tribunes of the soldiers<note>Perhaps elected by the people, see XLIII. xii. 7.</note> in the legions for Macedonia. About the same time Gaius Marcius Figulus<note>A cousin of the consul Philippus. Cf. Polybius XVIII. 16. 4; Livy XLIII. xi. 7.</note> the praetor, who had been assigned
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to the fleet, arrived in Brundisium, and the two commanders left Italy together, reached Corcyra the next day, and made port at Actium, the harbour of Acarnania, on the day
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> after. Thence the consul disembarked at Ambracia and marched overland to Thessaly; the praetor rounded Cape Leucas, entered the Gulf of Corinth and, leaving his ships at Creusa, also took to the land and made for the fleet at Chalcis through the midst of Boeotia-one day's rapid journey.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At this time Aulus Hostilius had his camp in Thessaly near Old Pharsalus, having on the one hand performed no military feat worth mentioning, but on <pb id="p.93"/>the other hand having accustomed the soldiery to<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> strict military discipline in place of uncontrolled laxness and having loyally furthered the interests of the allies and protected them from any kind of harm. On hearing of his successor's approach, he carefully inspected his men, their arms, and their horses, and with his army in parade order went to meet the approaching
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> consul. Not only was the first meeting of the commanders in accord with the high station both of the men themselves and of the Roman name, but the utmost harmony prevailed in their subsequent operations, for the proconsul remained with the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> army.</p> 
				<p>A few days later the consul addressed a meeting of his
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> soldiers. Beginning with the unnatural crimes of Perseus committed against his brother and planned against his
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> father,<note>For the attacks of Perseus against his brother, cf. XL. v ff. and xx ff.; in XL. lvi. 9, Philip is represented as having died in anger against Perseus, but Livy gives no description of the plot here alleged.</note> he went on to mention the acquisition of the throne by crime, the subsequent poisonings and slaughter, the attack by scoundrelly bandits on Eumenes, the wrongs committed by Perseus against the Roman people, and the plunderings of cities allied to them, contrary to
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> treaty.</p> 
				<p><quote>How hateful all these actions are to the gods also,</quote> said the consul, <quote>Perseus will discover in the outcome of his enterprises; for the gods support the cause of duty and faithfulness, the qualities by which the Roman people has climbed to so great an
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> eminence.</quote> The consul then compared the strength of the Roman people, who now controlled the whole earth, with that of Macedonia, and the military
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> forces of the one with the other, and asked how much greater were the resources of Philip and Antiochus, which had been shattered by forces no greater than this Roman army?</p> <pb id="p.95"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the consul had aroused the ardour of<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> the soldiers by a speech to this effect, he began to hold councils on strategy. Gaius Marcius the praetor, after picking up the fleet at Chalcis, arrived in camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was decided not to waste more time by lingering in Thessaly, but to break camp at once and proceed thence into Macedonia, while
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the praetor was to make sure that the fleet should simultaneously attack the hostile coast-line.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After the praetor's departure, the consul ordered his soldiers to take with them grain for a month and broke camp nine days after having assumed command;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> after a day's march, he summoned the guides for various routes, bade each explain before the council the route by which he would guide them, and then, after dismissing the guides, laid before the council the question of which route to choose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Some preferred the road via Pytho&uuml;s; others the one over the Cambunian Mountains used the preceding year by the consul Hostilius; others, a route past Lake Ascuris.<note>For Pytho&uuml;s, cf. XLII. liii. 6 and below, xxxii. 9 and xxxv. 15. Perseus entered Thessaly by the Cambunian Mountain route, cf. XLII. liii. 6; Livy's account of the march of Hostilius seems to have disappeared in one of the lacunae, cf. p. 14 n. 7. Volustana, mentioned below, sec. 10, is at the north-east end of this route, next to Mt. Olympus. Lake Ascuris is the modern Nezeros.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For a certain distance yet there was no divergence in the routes; therefore the discussion as to this choice was postponed until they should encamp near the point of separation of the roads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence the consul led his army into Perrhaebia and settled down between Azorus and Doliche<note>This seems to have been farther west than necessary for the Ascuris route.</note> for further conference as to the road to take.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> During the same time Perseus, knowing that the enemy was <pb id="p.97"/>approaching, but unaware which route he would choose,<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> decided to occupy all the passes with forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the summit of the Cambunian Mountains (which the Macedonians themselves call Volustana) he sent ten thousand light-armed young men<note><quote>Young men</quote> seems superfluous, and editors are inclined to substitute an expression suggesting whence the troops came.</note> under the command of Asclepiodotus; near the fort above Lake Ascuris &mdash;Lapathus is the name of the place &mdash;Hippias
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> was ordered to hold the pass with a force of twelve thousand Macedonians.<note>Asclepiodotus is mentioned in XLII. li. 7 as a commander of Gauls; Hippias appears in XLII. li. 3 and lix. 7 as a commander of phalanx-men.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The king himself with the rest of his forces remained in camp near Dium; later, so planlessly that he seemed to have lost his mind, he would dash with some unencumbered cavalry along the shore, now to Heracleum, now to Phila, returning without halt to Dium.<note>This patrolling may not have been as senseless as Livy would have it; Livy seems to be convinced that the gods made Perseus mad, preparatory to destroying him; but if Perseus had happened upon the Romans when they actually came down from the mountains, it would have been to his advantage. Cf. Diodorus XXX. 10 for the same view of Perseus' folly; <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> 2 elaborates the incident told below, vi. 1.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the consul had settled on the plan of proceeding by the pass where the king's officer was encamped near Ottolobus.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> the pass by Lake Ascuris. Cf. Herodotus VII. 128 on Xerxes' choice of routes in <date value="-480">480 B.C.</date>; he went via Perrhaebia and Gonnus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was decided, however, to send ahead four thousand men to seize valuable advance positions; the commanders of this force were Marcus Claudius and Quintus Marcius, the son of the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Immediately the whole Roman army followed. However, so steep, rough, and rugged was the road that the advance forces, travelling light, barely completed a two days' march of fifteen miles <pb id="p.99"/>before pitching camp. The place they occupied is<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> called Dierus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thence on the following day they advanced seven miles, seized a hill not far from the enemy's camp, and reported by messenger to the consul that they were in contact with the enemy, that they had occupied a place safe and suitable for all purposes, and that he should follow them as rapidly as he could march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While the consul was worrying both over the difficulty of the journey upon which he had entered and over the fate of the small force which he had sent ahead into the midst of hostile garrisons, he was met by the messenger near Lake Ascuris.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul thereupon gained confidence, and after joining the advance force encamped beneath the hill which had been seized, in the place best adapted through the nature of the terrain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Not only the enemy camp, a little over a mile away, but the whole region to Dium, Phila, and the seashore was before their eyes in the extensive view from so lofty a ridge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This sight roused the spirits of the soldiery, after they had a birds eye view of the whole campaign including all the king's forces and the land of the enemy, from so near by.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Although the soldiers, made eager by this sight, urged the consul to lead them at once to the enemy's camp, one day's rest was given them, since they were weary from the toil of the march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Next day, the consul, leaving part of his forces to guard the camp, advanced against the enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hippias had recently been sent by the king to guard the pass; as soon as he saw the Roman camp on its hill, he roused the spirits of his men to combat; and now he marched out against the oncoming column of the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans had come out <pb id="p.101"/>unencumbered for battle and the enemy were light troops, a<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> type very ready to stir up combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore immediately on meeting they discharged their weapons; many wounds were both received and inflicted by either side in the hasty encounter; small numbers of both forces were killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Now that their spirits had been roused for the succeeding day, a more stubborn clash of larger forces occurred; and the decisive battle of the war would have been fought if there had been room enough to deploy the battle line; but the ridge of the mountain running up to a narrow peak barely allowed for a front of three files.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so while a few fought, the large remainder, especially the heavy-armed, stood by as onlookers of the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Light forces were also able to charge forward over the rolling slopes of the ridge and engage the opposing light forces in flanking attacks over terrain favourable and unfavourable. More had been wounded than killed that day when the battle was broken off at nightfall.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>On the third day the Roman commander was at a loss; for he could neither remain on the ridge without supplies nor retire without disgrace and even danger, if the enemy pursued his retreat from the higher ground. There remained indeed no alternative to amending a bold undertaking by persistent boldness, which is occasionally wise in the long run.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In fact, the position was such that, had the consul confronted an enemy like to the old-time kings of Macedonia, he <pb id="p.103"/>might have suffered a great disaster.<note>This passage illustrates the strength of Livy's dramatic sense, and his weakness as a military commentator; but he had reason to point out the rashness of Marcius, who had once been badly defeated by the Ligurians because he rushed into a narrow pass without reconnaissance (XXXIX. xx. 5-10).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But though<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> the king was scouring the shore near Dium with cavalry, and at a distance of twelve miles could almost hear the shouts and din of the fighting men, he neither added to his forces by reinforcing his weary men with fresh troops, nor did he himself appear on the battle-field &mdash;a matter of greatest moment &mdash;although the Roman commander, aged over sixty and overburdened with flesh, performed vigorously in person all the duties of a soldier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Magnificently he pursued his bold undertaking to the end;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> he left Popilius to guard the ridge during his advance over pathless ground, sent ahead men to clear out a road, and ordered Attalus and Misagenes, each with the auxiliaries of his own nation, to act as guard for the men clearing the pass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consul himself sent the cavalry and baggage ahead of him and brought up the rear with the legions.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The toil of the descent and the damage to baggage-animals and their loads cannot be put into words. After they had advanced a mere four miles, they would have given anything to return as they had come, if they but could.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The confusion of an attack by an enemy was caused by the elephants, which on arriving at the pathless places cast off their mahouts and with horrible trumpetings caused a great panic, especially among the horses, until a plan was devised for getting them through.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the steep hillside the slope was marked off, and at the lower end two long strong posts were set in the ground, separated by a distance slightly greater than the width of one of the beasts;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> on a cross-beam laid <pb id="p.105"/>upon these posts, planks, each thirty feet long, were<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> fastened together to form a runway, and earth thrown on top of them.<note>As with Hannibal's use of vinegar for breaking rock (XXI. xxxvii. 2), this passage leaves several questions unanswered, including the question of whether it ever happened. We can say that either Livy or a copyist left out of the account of the runway a mention of the stringers which would be necessary; the <quote>thirty-foot planks</quote> somehow have replaced these stringers and the transverse planks which presumably would provide the flooring.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next, at a slight interval below, a second runway of the same sort was built, then a third, and others one after the other, where the cliffs were sheer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From firm ground an elephant would advance on to the runway; before he could proceed to its end, the posts were cut and the tilting of the runway forced the animal to slide gently to the head of the next runway.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some of the elephants would slide standing erect, others would squat on their haunches. Whenever they were met with the level expanse of another runway, they were again carried down by a like collapse of the lower structure, until they arrived at the more passable valley.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The Romans advanced on that day hardly more than seven miles. Very little of the journey did they accomplish on their feet. Usually they advanced by casting themselves down, arms, baggage, and all, while meeting with every kind of difficulty, so that even the leader who had chosen the route could not deny that a small force could have destroyed the whole army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> By nightfall they reached a scant level area, nor did men who had unexpectedly at long last found a place which offered sure footing, have the leisure to observe the unfriendly nature of the place, hemmed in as it was on all sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For the next day as well they were compelled to wait in the depths of this valley for Popilius and the troops left behind <pb id="p.107"/>with him. These troops too, though threatened from<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> no direction by the enemy, were harassed as by an enemy by the ruggedness of the terrain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the third day, they proceeded with the united forces through the pass called Callipeuce<note>The name (Fair Pines) suggests a forested area.</note> by the natives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the fourth day, they descended through country as pathless as before, but their skill was greater through practice, and their morale was higher, since the enemy had not showed himself anywhere and they were reaching the sea. On reaching the plains between Heracleum and Libethrum they pitched a camp, most of which occupied hills.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This was the infantry camp; they embraced part of the plain too within the rampart, where the cavalry might encamp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The king was in his bath, they say, when the presence of the enemy was announced. At this message he leapt in terror from his tub and dashed out crying that he had been beaten without a battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And thereafter, as his terror drove him to a succession of fear-struck plans and orders, he sent out two of his friends, one to Pella to cast into the sea the money stored in Phacus,<note>The citadel of Pella, cf. below, x. 3; xlvi. 6; Polybius XXIX. 3 and XXXI. 17 (25); Diodorus XXX. 11. It is not clear why the treasure was thrown into the sea, and not simply dumped into the marshy lake which washed the walls of Phacus, but the recovery of most of the treasure by divers sounds as if it had been dumped on clean bottom.</note> the other to Thessalonica to burn the dockyards. He recalled Asclepiodotus and Hippias and their forces from outpost duty and opened every approach for attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king ran off with all the gilded statues at Dium, to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, and compelled the inhabitants of that region to move to Pydna. Thereby <pb id="p.109"/>what might have seemed the rashness of the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> in advancing to a position from which he could not retire without the consent of the enemy, was turned by the king into well-calculated boldness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the Romans had two passes by which they could extricate themselves: one through Tempe into Thessaly, the other into Macedonia past Dium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both of the passes were being held by the king's forces;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> therefore if the king, by fearlessly holding his own, had resisted the first false appearance of approaching danger, he would have left the Romans no retreat through Tempe to Thessaly, nor any route for bringing up provisions from that direction.<note>Livy neglects the possibility of supply by sea, on which the consul seems to have relied, see below, vii. 10; this is probably due to the characteristic preoccupation of a Roman with the land, though one must admit that the passage above cited shows that the fleet was badly handled, and the coast presumably was difficult, cf. below, xlii. 5-6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For even without the opposition of an enemy Tempe is a defile difficult of passage; for besides five miles of narrows through which the road is cramped for a loaded animal, the cliffs on either side are so sheer that one can hardly look down without some dizziness of eye and brain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> An additional source of fear is the roar and depth of the Pene&uuml;s River flowing through the midst of the canyon. This place, so unfriendly by its very nature, was blocked at four separate points by the king's garrisons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> One was at the very entrance near Gonnus, the second at Condylus, an impregnable fort, the third in the vicinity of Lapathus, which they call the Palisade, the fourth set by the road itself where the canyon, in the middle of its course, is at its narrowest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> where it can easily be defended by no more than ten soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If the Romans' access to <pb id="p.111"/>supplies through Tempe, as well as their line of<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> retreat, had been cut off, they would have had to return to the mountains through which they had descended.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As they had deceived the enemy in this by stealth, they could not duplicate the feat without concealment and while the enemy were in possession of the higher summits; and the difficulty they had undergone would have laid low all hope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There was no alternative left in this rash enterprise but to get out into Macedonia past Dium in the teeth of the enemy, and this undertaking, had not the gods deprived the king of his wits, would itself have been of the utmost difficulty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For between the foothills of Mount Olympus and the sea lies an interval of a little more than a mile, half of which space is taken up with the broad estuary of the Baphyrus River, while part of the plain is obstructed by either the temple of Jupiter<note>For this famous temple, cf. Polybius IV. 62.</note> or the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The very small remainder could have been barred off by a ditch of no extravagant size and a palisade, and there was such an abundance of stone and of forest timber at hand that even a wall could have been thrown up and towers erected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Since none of these possibilities revealed themselves to a mind blinded by sudden panic, the king stripped away all his defences and opened every approach to assault
					<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> before taking refuge in Pydna.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul sighted much security as well as hope in the folly and inaction of the king; he sent back a message to Spurius Lucretius<note>On this section, cf. Polybius XXVIII. 0. 11 (9a. 12). Lucretius had been praetor in <date value="-172">172 B.C.</date>, cf. XLII. ix. 8.</note> at Larisa to seize the forts abandoned by the enemy in the region of Tempe, and sending Popilius to reconnoitre the crossings around Dium, arrived at that city in two days' march, since he learned that everything lay open in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He ordered his camp to be <pb id="p.113"/>pitched next to the temple itself, so that no sacrilege<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> against the sacred precinct might be committed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On personally inspecting the city which, though not large, was adorned with public installations and an abundance of statues<note>Among these statues were the portraits by Lysippus of the twenty-five Cavalry Companions killed at the battle of the Granicus, cf. Arrian, <hi rend="italics">Anabasis</hi>I. 16. 4.</note> and was magnificently fortified, the consul could hardly convince himself that no ruse lurked in the unreasonable abandonment of such remarkable objects.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After a day's delay for general reconnaissance all around, he advanced, and being convinced that there would be abundant grain in Pieria, he proceeded on that day to a river named Mitys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Continuing on the following day, he accepted the surrender of the city of Agassae by its inhabitants; and to win over the hearts of the other Macedonians, he contented himself with hostages and promised to leave the city to its people without garrison, and to accord them autonomy and freedom from tribute. Advancing thence a day's journey, he encamped by the Ascordus River.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Because he felt more strongly the want of every sort of supplies the further he advanced from Thessaly, he retired to Dium, thereby demonstrating beyond a doubt to everyone what he would have suffered had he been cut off from Thessaly, since he found it unsafe to advance far from there.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After Perseus had assembled all his forces and officers, he blamed the commanders of his outposts, above all Asclepiodotus and Hippias;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> they, he said, had surrendered the keys to Macedonia to the Romans &mdash;a crime for which no one would have been more justly prosecuted than himself.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>After the sight of the Roman fleet at sea had brought to the consul hope that the ships were bringing provisions &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> there was a great scarcity of grain and almost a famine &mdash;he heard from the men just <pb id="p.115"/>come into port that the freight ships had been left<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> in Magnesia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As the consul was debating what should be done &mdash;so completely was his struggle directed against the mere difficulty of the situation, without the slightest effort on the part of the enemy to make matters worse &mdash;in
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the nick of time a despatch arrived from Spurius Lucretius that he was in possession of the forts above Tempe and around Phila, and that he had found a supply of grain and other useful materials in them.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Greatly pleased by this news, the consul moved from Dium to Phila, both to strengthen its garrison and to distribute to the soldiers the grain, transportation of which was slow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This march started unpleasant rumours; for some put it that he had retired from before the enemy out of fear, because he would have had to fight a battle if he had remained in Pieria, while others said that
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> in his ignorance of the daily fluctuations in the fortunes of war, and as if events were awaiting his signal, he had dropped from his grasp advantages which presently could not be recovered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For at one move he had lost his grip on Dium and had stirred up the enemy to perceiving at long last that he must recover what previously he had shamefully lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For on hearing of the departure of the consul, the king returned to Dium, rebuilt what had been cast down and despoiled by the Romans, replaced the battlements knocked off the walls, and strengthened the walls all around. Then he placed his camp five miles from the city on the nearer bank of the Elpe&uuml;s River, intending to use the river itself as a fortification since it was very hard to cross.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It flows from a ravine of Mount Olympus, is scanty in summer, but again in <pb id="p.117"/>winter is swollen by rains; it forms great rapids<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> above its boulders, and below, by carrying off the eroded earth to the sea, produces great abysses and banks sheer on either side above a deeply-hollowed channel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thinking that the enemy's advance was barred by this river, the king intended to use up the rest of the summer.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Meanwhile the consul sent Popilius with two thousand soldiers from Phila to Heracleum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This is about five miles from Phila, on a cliff overhanging the river midway between Dium and Tempe.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before Popilius brought his men against the walls, he sent envoys to persuade the magistrates and chief citizens to prefer making trial of the good faith and mildness of the Romans rather than of their force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This advice availed nothing, because the fires of the king's camp at the Elpe&uuml;s were in sight. Then the siege began, both with assaults and with field-works and engines, both from land and sea, for the fleet, too, had arrived and occupied the shore side.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The younger Romans even captured the lowest part of the wall by turning to military use a performance of the arena.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was the custom then, before there had been introduced the present extravagance<note>Livy notes the beginnings of lavishness in shows as early as <date value="-186">186 B.C.</date>, see XXXIX. xxii. 2, XLI. xxvii. 6, and below, xviii. 8.</note> of cramming the arena with animals from all over the earth, to hunt out various sorts of spectacles, for one race with four-horse chariots and one with bareback riders hardly occupied the space of an hour for the two events.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As one of these performances, groups of about sixty<note>Sixty was the usual number of soldiers in the so-called <quote>century.</quote></note> youths (occasionally more at more <pb id="p.119"/>elaborate games) entered under arms. Their entrance<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> was in some respects an imitation of military manoeuvres, but in other respects was of a style more showy than the military and more akin to the fashion of gladiatorial combats.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After passing through various evolutions in this manoeuvre, they would form in ranks, with shields close-set over their heads, the front rank erect, the second somewhat stooped, the third and fourth more so, and the rear rank down on their knees, so that they would form a <quote>tortoise</quote> sloped like the roof of a house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Next two armed men, separated by an interval of some fifty feet, would rush out, feint at each other, and mount from bottom to top of the <quote>tortoise</quote> over the close-set shields. They would then act as if skirmishing at the outer edges of the <quote>tortoise,</quote> now clash with each other in the centre, and leap about just as if they were on solid ground.</p> 
				<p>A <quote>tortoise</quote> like this was brought up to the lowest part of the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When soldiers on top came up to the wall, they were at their highest elevation level with the defenders of the wall; the defenders were routed and the soldiers of two maniples<note>Polybius (XXVIII. 11 (12)) says that a third maniple formed the <quote>tortoise.</quote> Cf. Ammianus Marcellinus XXVI. 8. 9 for a similar formation.</note> crossed into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The only difference from the show was that the front rank and those exposed on the flanks did not raise their shields over their heads, but held them out in the usual position for battle in order not to expose their bodies. In this way the missiles hurled from the wall did not injure the men as they approached and those cast on the <quote>tortoise</quote> <pb id="p.121"/>slid harmlessly like rain down to the bottom of the<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> slippery slope.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>On capturing Heracleum, the consul advanced his camp there, as if he were going to advance to Dium and thence, after dislodging the king, into Pieria as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But as he was already making ready for wintering, he ordered the roads from Thessaly to be repaired for the transport of provisions and suitable sites for granaries to be chosen and houses built where those transporting the provisions could lodge.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Perseus at length recovered his courage from the panic which had struck him down. and would have preferred that his commands had not been obeyed when he ordered the treasure at Pella to be cast into the sea and the dockyards at Thessalonica to be burned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Andronicus, the envoy to Thessalonica, had killed time to allow for the very thing which happened, a change of mind.<note>Andronicus is accused by Diodorus XXX. 11 of working in this matter for a Roman victory.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nicias at Pella was less wary in casting away part of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the money which was in Phacus, but he seemed to have made his mistake in a manner not irreparable, since almost all the money was brought up by divers. So great was the king's shame at this panic of his that he ordered the divers secretly to be put to death, and after them Andronicus and Nicias, too, so that there should be no one having knowledge of so crazy an order.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Meanwhile, Gaius Marcius set out with the fleet from Heracleum for Thessalonica, ravaged the countryside far and wide by setting ashore forces at several points, and in several successful battles drove back those who sallied from the city headlong within their walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was striking terror into the city itself, when <pb id="p.123"/>from the engines of all types which were distributed<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> about, stones shot by machine struck down not only the skirmishers about the walls who rashly approached, but even the men in the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Recalling the soldiers to the ships and abandoning the siege of Thessalonica, they made thence for Aenea. This city is fifteen miles away, set opposite Pydna in fertile land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After devastating its territory they followed the shore and arrived at Antigonea. There they disembarked and for a time both ravaged the fields round about and carried some booty off to their ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then the Macedonians, cavalry and infantry together, attacked the scattered raiders and pursuing as they fled in disorder, killed about five hundred and captured as many.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nothing but utter necessity, when they were kept from finding safety in their ships, aroused the spirits of the Roman soldiers, both by despair of other means of safety and by indignation. The fight was renewed on the shore; those aboard the ships came to the rescue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Here about two hundred of the Macedonians were slain and an equal number captured. From Antigonea the fleet sailed to the peninsula of Pallene and landed troops to ravage it. This land belonged to the territory of Cassandrea<note>Established about <date value="-300">300 B.C.</date> on the site of Potidaea, which had been destroyed by Philip II in <date value="-356">356 B.C.</date></note> and was by far the most fertile of all the coast they had passed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Here they were met by King Eumenes, who had set out from Elaea<note>The port of Pergamum, east by south of Lesbos.</note> with twenty decked<note>According to Nissen, the use of this word indicates that Livy is following Polybius here.</note> ships, as well as by five decked ships sent by King Prusias.<note>He was hedging on his neutrality of <date value="-171">171 B.C.</date>, cf. XLII. xxix. 3.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With this accession of strength, the praetor's spirits rose to the point of attacking Cassandrea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.125"/>This was founded by King Cassander precisely in the<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> narrows which connect the peninsula of Pallene with the rest of Macedonia and are bounded on the one side by the Gulf of Macedonia, and on the other by that of Torone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the peninsula on which this city is situated rises high and projects into the sea quite as far as Mount Athos, which is noted for its size; it forms, opposite to the district of Magnesia, two unequal promontories, the larger named Posideum and the smaller Canastraeum.<note>Livy's description is confusing; Posideum, the westward promontory, is no more than a spur on the side of the main peninsula, of which Canastraeum forms the tip, extending to the south-east; the slimness of this tip induced Livy or his source to call it the smaller.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The siege was begun in separate divisions. The Roman commander constructed works, including <hi rend="italics">chevaux-de-frise,</hi> extending from the Macedonian to the Toronaic gulf, in the quarter called Clitae, in order to cut off the highway. On the other side is a narrow strait<note>Perhaps a moat open at one end to the sea.</note> ; there Eumenes was attacking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans found that their greatest task was filling the moat which Perseus had lately built as a defence. When the praetor inquired why there were no mounds to be seen, where the earth dug from the moat would be, he was shown certain arches.<note>These arches were probably intended as sally-ports, cf. XXXVI. xxiii. 3; it is not so clear what they had to do with the absence of soil from the moat-whether the bricks had been made from the soil, or whether the latter had been taken within the walls through the arches for disposal, before the brick curtains were built.</note> These, he heard, were built up not to the same strength as the old wall, but only to the thickness of a single brick. He therefore adopted the plan of opening a path into the city by piercing the brickwork.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He further expected to effect surprise in this move if he attacked the walls elsewhere with scaling ladders and, by raising confusion, drew off the defenders of the city to the protection of this second spot.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.127"/>
				<p>In the garrison of Cassandrea there were, besides<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> a respectable contingent of young citizens, eight hundred Agrianes<note>Cf. XLII. li. 5 and the note.</note> and two thousand Illyrian Penestae<note>These Illyrians were mentioned in XLIII. xxiii. 7; Pleuratus, who sent them, is possibly the exile mentioned in XLIII. xix. 13 as serving with Perseus.</note> sent from their home by Pleuratus &mdash;both peoples being good fighters. They were defending the walls as the Romans struggled with the utmost energy to mount them, when the piercing of the brickwork of the arches in the twinkling of an eye, laid open the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If men had been there to dash in armed, they would have taken the town at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the accomplishment of this breakthrough was reported to the Roman soldiers, they at once eagerly raised a shout of joy, expecting to burst into the city at several points.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The enemy were first struck with wonder as to the meaning of this sudden uproar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the commanders of the garrison, Pytho and Philip, had been informed that the city lay open, they considered that the work had been done for the benefit of the side first to press the attack, and made a sally with a strong force of Agrianes and Illyrians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans, who were coming up and being summoned from various points to advance into the city, were routed in their scattered and unorganized state and chased to the moat, into which they were driven and which they filled with the fallen. About six hundred were killed there and almost to a man those caught between the wall and the moat were wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The praetor, being so grievously dashed by his own undertaking, had become less eager to form other plans. Not even Eumenes, who was attacking both by sea <pb id="p.129"/>and land, gained any worth-while advantage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> commanders therefore determined to strengthen the forces on guard, so that no reinforcement from Macedonia might be sent in, and since open assault was unsuccessful, to attack the fortifications with siege-works.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During the preparation of these works, ten Macedonian scout-ships, sent from Thessalonica with picked Gallic auxiliaries, saw that the besieging ships were anchored out to sea, and in the dead of night, in single column, hugging the shore as closely as possible, entered the city. Report of this new defence force compelled both the Romans and the king to abandon the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They sailed around the cape and put in near Torone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After attempting to besiege this city too, and observing that it was defended by a strong force, they gave up their undertaking, and made for Demetrias. On approaching it they saw the walls filled with armed men, and sailed past to make a landing at Iolcus, planning to ravage the fields and then attack Demetrias too.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the consul, for his part, in order not merely to remain sluggishly idle in hostile territory, sent Marcus Popilius with five thousand soldiers to assail the city of Meliboea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This is situated in the foothills of Mount Ossa, on the side sloping toward Thessaly, and conveniently threatening Demetrias.<note>The threat to Demetrias must have consisted in cutting its line of communications, since Meliboea is twenty-five miles away, air-line.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The first arrival of the enemy dismayed the inhabitants of the place; then, after rallying their spirits from the unexpected fright, they ran under arms to their posts at gates and wall, where the expected lines of attack were, and at once dispelled the hope that the town could be taken at the first rush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Preparations for a siege were therefore made and the construction of works for the assault was begun.</p> <pb id="p.131"/>
				<p>When Perseus heard that Meliboea was being<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> attacked by the consul's army at the same time that the fleet was anchored at Iolcus, in order to attack Demetrias from there, he sent a certain Euphranor, one of his officers, with two thousand picked soldiers to Meliboea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Euphranor's orders were that if he dislodged the Romans from Meliboea, he was to enter Demetrias unobserved before the Romans brought their camp up to the city from Iolcus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The besiegers of Meliboea, in great panic when Euphranor suddenly made his appearance on higher ground, abandoned their works and set them afire. So the siege of Meliboea was given up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After freeing one city from siege, Euphranor at once advanced to Demetrias. He entered the walls by night and gave the inhabitants such confidence that they felt sure of their ability not only to defend their walls, but to protect their land from raids. Sallies were made against the scattered ravagers, not without casualties to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> However, the praetor and the king rode around the walls, reconnoitring the situation of the city, in case they could attempt an assault by works or by main force at any point.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was a rumour that Cydas the Cretan<note>A substantial account of this and other intrigues is given by Polybius XXIX. 6 (lc).</note> and Antimachus, the commander in Demetrias, were agents in discussing terms of friendship between Eumenes and Perseus. At any rate, the Romans departed from Demetrias.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Eumenes sailed to the consul, and after offering congratulations on his successful entrance into Macedonia, left for Pergamum in his own kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The praetor Marcius Figulus sent part of his fleet into winter quarters at Sciathus, and made for Ore&uuml;s in <pb id="p.133"/>Euboea with the rest of his ships, thinking that this<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> city was most suitable for the forwarding of supplies to the armies in Macedonia and Thessaly.</p> 
				<p>The historians give highly different accounts of King Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If you trust Valerius Antias,<note>As Livy knew, trusting Valerius Antias was a hazardous proceeding. Polybius XXIX. 5 (lb) is less certain about Eumenes' attitude; Valerius perhaps reported the view prevailing in Rome at the time.</note> his account is that although the praetor summoned the king with frequent despatches, he did not even receive naval assistance from him, nor did Eumenes on his way to Asia part on good terms with the consul, being indignant because he was not permitted to encamp in the Roman area;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Eumenes, says Valerius, could not even be persuaded to leave behind the Galatian cavalry he had brought with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> His brother Attalus, continues Valerius, not only remained with the consul, but displayed genuine and unwavering good faith and notable exploits in this campaign.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the war was continuing in Macedonia, envoys from across the Alps from a Gallic chieftain &mdash;his name is given as Balanos, but there is no record of his tribe &mdash;came to Rome promising aid for the Macedonian campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thanks were expressed by the senate and gifts sent the envoys, a twisted necklace of two pounds of gold and golden bowls of four pounds, a horse with ornamental trappings, and cavalry weapons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the Gauls, Pamphylian<note>They had apparently been recognized as free <quote>friends</quote> of Rome after a dispute as to their status under the treaty with Antiochus, XXXVIII. xxxix. 17, and xv. 6.</note> envoys presented in the senate-house a gold crown made of twenty thousand philips<note>These coins were worth about twenty silver drachmas, cf. XXXVII. lix. 4 and the note. The gift seems to have been unusually large; the Rhodians gave the same when desperately trying to regain Roman favour, see XLV. xxv. 7; the figure here may be wrong. The philip, by weight a stater or double drachma of the Athenian standard (= 8.6 g.; the theoretical U.S. gold dollar of 1934 = 15r[grains troy = 0.988 g.), was popularized by Philip II after the fall of Olynthus in <date value="-348">348 B.C.</date> He seems to have taken the coin from the Olynthians; it paralleled an earlier issue from Philippi, which began as a colony of Thasos three years before its capture by Philip, and which had an Athenian adviser. Philip continued the coinage of this town. During the second century, the philip was the commonest gold coin of Rome (see XXXIV. lii. 7; XXXVII. lix. 4; XXXIX. v. 15 and vii. 1, and frequent allusions of Plautus' <hi rend="italics">Bacchides, Poenulus,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Trinummus</hi>); as a result of Roman trade, philips also made their appearance in central Gaul, and were locally imitated there, in the Rhine-land, and even in Britain. (See Seltman, <hi rend="italics">Greek Coins,</hi> pp. 200-202, and <hi rend="italics">R.E.</hi> 2196-2198.)</note> and their request was <pb id="p.135"/>granted that they be permitted to deposit this<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> present in the temple of Jupiter, Greatest and Best, and to offer sacrifice on the Capitol;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> a gracious answer was given to the envoys' request for a renewal of the state of friendship, and a gift of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> apiece was sent them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Next, an audience was given to envoys from King Prusias, and shortly thereafter to those from the Rhodians, who made a very different presentation of the same request.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both embassies treated of making terms again with King Perseus. Prusias' attitude was more that of entreaty than demand, for he declared that up to this time he had taken the part of the Romans, and would so continue as long as the war lasted;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> however, inasmuch as envoys from Perseus had come to him to discuss ending the war with the Romans, he had promised to plead Perseus' cause before the senate; he requested that if they could bring themselves to do so, they would put an end to their wrath, and would accord him, too, their thanks for the restoration of peace. So spoke the king's envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Rhodians haughtily reviewed their services to the Roman people, and claimed for themselves almost the greater part of the victories, especially over King Antiochus; they then added that while peace had existed between the Macedonians and Romans, they had entered upon friendship with King Perseus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> this they had broken off against their will and on account of no fault of his toward them, but because it had seemed good to the Romans to draw them into participation in the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <pb id="p.137"/>For the third year, they said, they were feeling many<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> inconveniences from this war because of the interruption of commerce; their island was poor, and could not be inhabited without the assistance of sea-borne supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Since therefore they could no longer endure this privation, they had sent other envoys to Perseus in Macedonia, to inform him that it was the Rhodians' wish that he should arrange a peace with the Romans, and that they had sent a similar announcement to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If either party was responsible for preventing the ending of the war, the Rhodians would deliberate as to what action they ought to take against this party.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>I feel sure that even now these statements cannot be read or heard without indignation; from this one can judge what the senate's state of mind was as they listened.<note>For the services of the Rhodians, cf. XLII. xlvi. 6. According to Polybius XXVIII. 16, relations between Rome and Rhodes were entirely cordial this year; in <date value="-168">168 B.C.</date> the consul Marcius suggested to an embassy of the Rhodians that they act as mediators; the only result was to encourage the pro-Macedonians in Rhodes (cf. below, xxxv. 4, where Livy still saddles the Rhodians with the onus in this matter; also XLV. iii. 3, with which cf. Polybius XXIX. 10). Polybius suspects Marcius of planning to have the Rhodians annoy the Romans and so justify Rome's overriding their independence; in view of Marcius' liking for intrigue (XLII. xlvii. 1-4), this is quite probable. In XLV. xxii. 2, Livy suggests that Roman suspicion of Rhodes was something new in <date value="-167">167 B.C.</date>; in XLV. xxv. 6, the <quote>freeing</quote> of Lycia and Caria seems to have been ordered in that year. Claudius (see below) or some other annalist seems to have misled Livy by anticipating developments. Cassius Dio XX. fr. 66, 2 = Zonaras 9. 22 says that Perseus would have been granted peace but for the tactlessness of the Rhodians. Livy certainly had no suspicion that the Romans might have continued to tolerate Perseus.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Claudius has it that the senate returned no answer, but only had read its decree that the Roman people gave the Carians and Lycians their freedom<note>Previous friction between these peoples and the Rhodians was noted in XLI. vi. 8-12, cf. the note, and XLII. xiv. 8. Polybius XXX. 5. 12 records a decree <quote>freeing</quote> the Carians and Lycians in the year 168-<date value="-7">7 B.C.</date>, probably the time when it was actually passed.</note> and that despatches should be immediately sent to both peoples, on hearing which the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> chief of the <pb id="p.139"/>Rhodian embassy, for whose proud language the<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> senate-house had but a moment before seemed too small, now suffered deflation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Other historians record the following answer:</p> 
				<p><quote>At the outset of this war the Roman people were informed by no trifling sources that the Rhodians had entered upon secret plots with King Perseus against the Roman state,<note>Cf. XLII. xxvi. 8 for earlier Roman suspicions, which to a large extent resulted from the Rhodians' non-partisanship, based on a preference for a balance of power, cf. XLII. xxx. 5-6.</note> but even had this been doubtful before, the words of the embassy just uttered have made the matter certain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Frequently treachery unmasks itself, even if it is more wary at first. And now the Rhodians pass judgment throughout the world as to peace and war!
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the beck and call of the Rhodians will the Romans take up and lay down their arms! Now we are no longer to call upon the gods to witness treaties, but rather the Rhodians!
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Unless obedience is rendered them, and our armies are removed from Macedonia, the Rhodians will see, will they, what they must do?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What the Rhodians will see, they themselves know. But surely the Roman people, after their conquest of Perseus, which they hope will take place any day, will see that they repay a suitable reward for the actions of each state during the war.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless, a present of two thousand sesterces apiece was sent to the envoys, which they refused.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereafter despatches from Quintus Marcius the consul were read, describing his crossing over into Macedonia, by forcing the pass;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in Macedonia he had procured supplies in advance of winter from <pb id="p.141"/>various localities, and in particular had received<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> twenty thousand bushels of wheat and ten thousand of barley from the Epirotes, so that payment for this grain should be arranged with their envoys at Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Clothes, said the consul, should be sent to the army from Rome; there was need for about two hundred horses, especially Numidians, and he had no supply of them where he was. A decree of the senate was passed to carry out these requests of the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Gaius Sulpicius the praetor<note>He was the city praetor, cf. XLIII. xv. 3. Under Sulpicius' sponsorship as praetor, Ennius produced his <hi rend="italics">Thyestes</hi> (Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi> 78), and in his consulship, Terence produced his <hi rend="italics">Andria;</hi> for Sulpicius' prediction of an eclipse, see below, xxxvii. 5.</note> let a contract for transporting to Macedonia six thousand togas,<note>For this use of a civilian garment by soldiers, cf. XXII. liv. 2 and the note.</note> thirty thousand tunics, and two hundred horses, and for depositing them where the consul chose. Sulpicius also paid the envoys of the Epirotes the price of the grain, and brought before the senate Onesimus, son of Pytho, a Macedonian noble.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had always been a proponent of peace to the king, and had advised him to adopt frequently, if not regularly, the practice which his father Philip had begun and continued to the last day of his life &mdash;namely, that of reading through twice daily the treaty he had made with the Romans. After Onesimus had been unable to discourage the king from war, Onesimus began at first to withdraw on one excuse or another, so as not to be associated with projects of which he disapproved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Finally, when he saw that he was an object of suspicion and that occasionally he was being charged by innuendo with treachery, he deserted to the Romans and made himself very useful to the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On being introduced to the senate, he recited these facts, and the senate ordered that he be enrolled in the category of allies, that a residence and entertainment <pb id="p.143"/>be provided for him, that two hundred acres of the<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> public land of the Roman people in the district of Tarentum be given him, and that a house be bought for him at Tarentum.<note>For similar rewards, cf. II. xvi. 4-5; XXIII. xlvi. 6-7; XXVI. xxi. 9-13.</note> Gaius Decimius the praetor<note>He was praetor in charge of aliens, XLIII. xv. 3.</note> was entrusted with the execution of these orders.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The censors conducted the census on the thirteenth of December more strictly than before. Many were deprived of their rank of knights, among them Publius Rutilius who as tribune of the commons had violently assailed the censors; he was also removed from his tribe and disenfranchised.<note>Severity to knights was previously mentioned, XLIII. xvi. 1; either the process was interrupted by the objections there described, or the censors conducted a new review at this later date. Rutilius was now open to their attack, because he had left the tribunate four days before on December 9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As half the revenues of the year had by decree of the senate been assigned by the quaestors to the censors for the construction of public works, Titus Sempronius, out of the funds assigned to him, bought for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> state the house of Publius Africanus behind the Old Shops in the direction of the statue of Vortumnus, as well as the butcher's stalls and the shops adjacent, and saw to the construction of the basilica which afterward received the name of Sempronian.<note>Africanus was the father-in-law of the censor. The Old Shops had been built in <date value="-209">209 B.C.</date>, cf. XXVII. xi. 16, and were so called to distinguish them from some built in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date> The bronze statue of the Etruscan god Vortumnus stood in the <hi rend="italics">Vicus Tuscus</hi> some distance south-west of the Forum, but visible from it; the statue is mentioned by Cicero, <hi rend="italics">in Verrem</hi> II. I. 59, 154, and Propertius V. (IV.) 2. The god, whose name seems to be good Latin, was in charge of turning or exchange, and received a temple in Rome after the overthrow of his home town of Volsinii in <date value="-264">264 B.C.</date> The Basilica Sempronia was later supplanted by the Basilica Julia.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year was drawing to its close, and because of concern, especially for the war with Macedonia, men were discussing what consuls they should elect for this year, to bring this war at last to an end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A resolution of the senate was therefore passed, that Gnaeus Servilius should come as promptly <pb id="p.145"/>as possible to hold the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The praetor<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> Sulpicius forwarded the resolution to the consul, and read to the senate a few days later the return despatch from that officer. In this, he set the day for the elections as . . ., and announced his return to the city previous to that time. The consul made haste, and the elections were completed on the day set.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were elected as consuls Lucius Aemilius Paulus for the second time, in the fourteenth year after his first term, and Gaius Licinius Crassus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the following day, there were elected to the praetorship Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus, Lucius Anicius Gallus, Gnaeus Octavius, Publius Fonteius Balbus, Marcus Aebutius Helva, and Gaius Papirius Carbo. Concern for the war with Macedonia induced the speeding up of the whole procedure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Therefore it was voted that these magistrates-elect should be allotted their fields of operation immediately, so that when it was
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> known which consul had received Macedonia and which praetor the fleet, the designated men might begin their plans and preparations of the supplies necessary for war and might consult the senate if there was need for consultation on any subject.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was determined to hold the Latin Festival as soon as was possible on religious grounds after the entrance upon office of the magistrates, to avoid any delay to the consul who was to set out for Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In these decrees, the fields of operation for the consuls were designated as Macedonia and Italy; those for the praetors were, besides the two jurisdictions in the city, the fleet, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia. <pb id="p.147"/>Macedonia fell to the lot of the consul Aemilius,<note>It was later assumed, cf. <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> I.2 1, p. 194, <hi rend="italics">elogium</hi> XV. and Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> x that Paulus was <hi rend="italics">elected</hi> as general for Macedonia; this cannot be taken literally, as it would have been the senate which assigned him to a province; unless a judicious falsifying of the allotment process took place, the appointment of Paulus was a bit of the <hi rend="italics">felicitas</hi> of the Roman people. Crassus had a respectable record as a soldier, cf. XLII. lviii. 12.</note> Italy to<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> Licinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Of the praetors, Gnaeus Baebius received the jurisdiction over citizens, Lucius Anicius was given that over aliens and was placed at the disposal of the senate, Gnaeus Octavius received the fleet, Publius Fonteius Spain, Marcus Aebutius Sicily, and Gaius Papirius Sardinia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was at once obvious to everyone that Lucius Aemilius was going to prosecute this war in no sluggish fashion, not only because he was a warlike man, but also because without relaxing by day or night he turned over in his mind nothing but what concerned this war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First of all he requested the senate to send envoys to Macedonia to inspect the armies and the fleet and to report their findings as to what was needed by way of forces on land or sea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> moreover, they were to collect information as far as possible about the king's forces and about the terrain under our control and under that of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were to investigate the following: whether the Romans were encamped among the mountains or whether all the narrows had been passed and the plains reached; which of the allies were loyal to us, which were wavering and of a loyalty dependent on fortune, and which seemed definitely hostile; how large a supply of provisions had been prepared and whence they could be brought, by a land route or by ships, respectively; what had been achieved on land and sea during this summer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From good information on these points sure decisions might be made for the <pb id="p.149"/>future, said Aemilius. The senate gave the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 169</note> Gnaeus Servilius the task of choosing three men satisfactory to Lucius Aemilius as envoys to Macedonia. Two days later the envoys set out &mdash;Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, Aulus Licinius Nerva, and Lucius Baebius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Report was made of two showers of stones near the end of this year, one on Roman land, one on that of Veii. On both occasions a nine-day rite was performed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The priests who died during this year were Publius Quinctilius Varus, the <hi rend="italics">flamen</hi> of Mars,<note>He was replaced in the following year by Lucius Postumius Albinus, XLV. xv. 10.</note> and Marcus Claudius Marcellus of the Board of Ten. Gnaeus Octavius replaced the latter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Display being now on the increase, it is recorded that at the games in the arena by the curule aediles Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica and Publius Lentulus, sixty-three leopards and forty bears and elephants participated.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the consulship of Lucius Aemilius Paulus<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> and Gaius Licinius, on the fifteenth of March, at the beginning of the new year, the senators were on the <hi rend="italics">qui vive,</hi> especially as to what the consul in charge of Macedonia would bring before them about his field of operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But Paulus said that he had nothing to present until the envoys returned, but that the envoys were now at Brundisium, after having been blown back twice to Dyrrachium on their voyage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As soon as he acquired the information which was the first necessity, he would lay matters before the senate, and this would take place within a very few days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In order to avoid any delay to his <pb id="p.151"/>settingout, said Paulus, the day for the Latin Festival had<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> been set at April twelfth<note>The date is given below, xxii. 16, as March 31; in either case, it was very early as compared with dates cited elsewhere, <hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> XLI. xvi. 1 (May 5), XLII. xxxv. 3 (June 1). Actually, due to the confusion of the calendar, the festival was held in late January this year, cf. below, xxxvii. 8.</note> ; after the proper performance of the sacrifice, if the senate concurred, he and Gnaeus Octavius would both set out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> His colleague Gaius Licinius would take care, in his absence, to get ready and send out what should be made ready and sent to the war; meanwhile, said Paulus, the embassies of foreign nations might be given audience.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>First the envoys from King Ptolemy and Queen Cleopatra at Alexandria were announced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Grimy,<note>As part of their costume as suppliants.</note> with untrimmed beard and hair, they entered the senate-house bearing olive-branches, and prostrated themselves; their speech was more pitiable than their array.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Antiochus, the king of Syria, who had been a hostage at Rome, under the decent pretext of restoring the elder Ptolemy to his throne, was waging war against the younger brother, who was then in possession of Alexandria.<note>On Antiochus' sojourn at Rome, cf. XLI. xx; a previous stage in Antiochus' encroachment on Egypt was mentioned in XLII. xxix. 5, cf. Polybius XXVII. 19, also XXVIII. 18 f. (16 f.) The <quote>elder Ptolemy</quote> is Ptolemy VI Philometor; the <quote>younger,</quote> Euergetes II.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Antiochus had won a naval battle at Pelusium and, after leading his forces across the Nile on a hastily-constructed bridge, was overawing Alexandria with his siege and seemed to be on the very point of laying his hands on a very rich kingdom. Complaining of this attack, the envoys begged the senate to come to the rescue of a kingdom and a royal pair who were friends of Roman rule.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Such, they argued, were the benefits conferred on Antiochus by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> Roman people, and such their influence with all kings and nations that, if they sent <pb id="p.153"/>envoys to declare to Antiochus that the senate did not<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> wish war to be made on kings allied to it, Antiochus would at once depart from the walls of Alexandria and would lead his army back into Syria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If they hesitated to do this, shortly Ptolemy and Cleopatra, robbed of their kingdom, would arrive in Rome, somewhat to the shame of the Roman people, because they had offered no aid in the final crisis of their fortunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The senators, stirred by the entreaties of the Alexandrines, at once<note>Polybius XXIX. 2 (1) stresses the Roman interest in keeping Antiochus out of Egypt; he does not indicate that the Roman embassy accompanied the Egyptians, and puts more emphasis than does Livy on Roman initiative.</note> sent Gaius Popilius Laenas, Gaius Decimius, and Gaius Hostilius as envoys to bring an end to the war between the kings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They were instructed to approach first Antiochus and then Ptolemy, and to proclaim that if war was not concluded, the party constituting the obstacle would not be considered either a friend or an ally to the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This embassy left within three days along with the envoys from Alexandria. The mission from Macedonia arrived on the last day of the Quinquatrus<note>This festival, first mentioned for the year <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>, occurred on March 19-23, see XXVI. xxvii. 1 and the note, also Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Fasti</hi> III. 810; <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> I.2 1, p. 312 gives a discussion of the origin of the name (probably because it originally fell on the <quote>fifth</quote> day, Roman inclusive reckoning, after the Ides), and points out that besides being connected with Minerva, the day had associations with Mars, and seems to have been the time for ceremonial readying of weapons for the campaigning season.</note> amid such eagerness that, had it not been evening, the consuls would have summoned the senate at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next day the session was held and the envoys were heard. They reported as follows: <quote>The army has been led into Macedonia by trackless passes at a risk disproportionate to the gain.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Pieria, which the army has reached, is in the hands of the king; the encampments are so nearly in contact that hardly more than the Elpe&uuml;s River separates them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king does not offer battle, and our forces have <pb id="p.155"/>not the strength to compel him to do so. Also the<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> winter is an added obstacle to an active campaign. The soldiers are being supported in idleness and have grain for no more than six days.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Macedonian forces are said to number thirty thousand. If Appius Claudius<note>Livy has not mentioned him since XLIII. xxiii. 6; Polybius XXVIII. 13 (11) tells how Appius in the meantime had tried to raise Achaean troops, but had been hindered by Marcius.</note> had sufficient strength in the region of Lychnidus, he could have distracted the king with a second front; as it is, Appius and the force with him are in the greatest danger unless either a full-fledged army is quickly sent him or his present force is extricated.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As to the fleet, we heard after we left the camp that some of the sailors have been lost by disease, and some, especially the Sicilians, have gone home, so that the ships lack crews. Those who are there have not received their pay and are insufficiently clothed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Eumenes and his fleet have come and gone for no good reason, as if his ships were drifting before the wind; and there is no good evidence that the spirit of this king is unwavering.</quote><note>The immediate facts reported by Livy, above, x. 12-xiii. 10, and xxviii, do not bear this out; but Eumenes was not above bargaining with Perseus, below, xxiv-xxv (based on Polybius), and some of Livy's sources may have projected back later Roman suspicions, cf. above, xiii. 9. 12-13. Livy usually falls into the attitude, natural enough for his own day, that no one had any business to act contrary to Roman interests; but in the second century, Rome was not the paramount power in the Macedonian-Greek world, and it was not even clear that she proposed at this time to take a permanent interest in the affairs of that region.</note> The envoys reported that Attalus was as gallantly unswerving as Eumenes was entirely undependable.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After hearing the envoys, Lucius Aemilius laid before the senate the question of the conduct of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate decreed that the consuls and the people should each choose half of the tribunes for <pb id="p.157"/>eight legions; however, it was voted that no one who<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> had not held office should be chosen that year.<note>These provisions for officering the legions provided for reasonably competent officers, while still avoiding the suspicion of favouritism among an office-holding clique which may have caused the use of popular election of tribunes the previous year XLIII. xii. 7. Of the eight legions, two were probably for Gaul (i.e., north Italy), and two were to be Home Guard (<hi rend="italics">urbanae</hi>); officers less competent or less congenial to the consuls could be shunted to these legions. The dangers of <quote>inbreeding</quote> in office-holding at Rome are especially well illustrated by the Jugurthine War; the counter-dangers of politically able commoners elevated to military posts are shown by the careers of Flaminius and Varro in the Second Punic War.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then from among the tribunes Lucius Aemilius was to choose whomever he preferred for the two legions for Macedonia. It was further voted that after the completion of the Latin Festival, the consul Lucius Aemilius and Gnaeus Octavius, the praetor to whom the fleet had been allotted, should depart for their field of operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To them was added the praetor Lucius Anicius, whose post was the court for aliens; it was voted that he should succeed Appius Claudius in the Illyrian theatre near Lychnidus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Charge over the levy was given to the consul Gaius Licinius. He was instructed to enroll seven thousand Roman citizens and two hundred horsemen and to demand of the allies of the Latin Name seven thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> he was to send a despatch to
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> Gnaeus Servilius the commander in the province of Gaul, instructing him to enroll six hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This force Licinius was ordered to send as promptly as possible to his colleague in Macedonia; a limit of two legions was placed on the army on that front, and each legion was to be reinforced till it contained six thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry; the surplus infantry and cavalry were to be distributed as garrisons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Men unfit for military service were to be discharged. An added levy was imposed on the allies of ten thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This force was given to Anicius besides the <pb id="p.159"/>two legions which he was ordered to transport to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> Macedonia, each legion having five thousand two hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry. Moreover, five thousand sailors were enrolled for the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Licinius the consul was ordered to hold his area with two legions, and to add to them ten thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry of the allies.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the senate had finished its voting, the consul Lucius Aemilius went from the senate-house to a public meeting and made the following speech:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>I seem to have noticed, fellow-citizens, that greater congratulations were offered me when I was allotted Macedonia as my field of operations than when my election as consul was announced, or on the day when I entered upon office. The reason for this was none other, I believe, than that you regard me as capable of bringing the long-drawn-out war in Macedonia to an end worthy of the high position of the Roman people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The gods too, I hope, approve this fall of the lot and will likewise be at my side in action.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So far I can partly prophesy, and partly hope; another matter I dare to assert as sure namely, that I will strive with every effort that the hope you have conceived for me shall not be vain.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What is required for the war has been voted by the senate, and since it is determined that I shall set out at once, for which I am not reluctant, the preparations will be made by that excellent man, my colleague Gaius Licinius, as vigorously as if he were going to conduct the campaign.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For your part, see to it that you have confidence only in the reports I make to the senate and to you, and beware of nourishing by your credulity the gossip for which no sponsor will appear.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For I have noticed that, as is commonly the case, so <pb id="p.161"/>now especially in this war no one is so scornful of<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> rumour that his spirit cannot be weakened.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In all the clubs and even &mdash;God save us! &mdash;at dinner-tables there are experts who lead armies to Macedonia, who know where camp should be pitched, what places should be held with garrisons, when or by what pass Macedonia should be invaded, where granaries should be set up, by what routes on land or sea provisions should be supplied, when we must join battle with the enemy and when it is better to remain inactive.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Not only do they decide what should be done, but when anything is done contrary to their opinion, they accuse the consul as if he were in the dock. Such behaviour is a great obstacle to the men in the field.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For not everyone is as unwavering and as steadfast of spirit against hostile gossip as was Quintus Fabius, who preferred to have his independence of command lessened by popular folly rather than to neglect the best interests of the state for the sake of acclaim.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I am not, fellow-citizens, one who believes that no advice may be given to leaders; nay rather I judge him to be not a sage, but haughty, who conducts everything according to his own opinion alone. What therefore is my conclusion?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Generals should receive advice, in the first place from the experts who are both specially skilled in military matters and have learned from experience; secondly, from those who are on the scene of action, who see the terrain, the enemy, the fitness of the occasion, who are sharers in the danger, as it were aboard the same vessel.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thus, if there is anyone who is confident that he can advise me as to the best advantage of the state in this campaign which I am about to conduct, let him not refuse his services to <pb id="p.163"/>the state, but come with me into Macedonia. I will<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> furnish him with his sea-passage, with a horse, a tent, and even travel-funds. If anyone is reluctant to do this and prefers the leisure of the city to the hardships of campaigning, let him not steer the ship from on shore.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The city itself provides enough subjects for conversation; let him confine his garrulity to these; and let him be aware that I shall be satisfied with the advice originating in camp.</quote><note>Polybius XXIX. 1 (la) also mentions Paulus' attack on the armchair generals, which President Roosevelt used effectively <hi rend="italics">(New York Times,</hi> Mar. 18, 1942, p. 10). In sec. 2, cf. the note on the text, it is possible that there was a reference to Paulus' reluctance to assume the consulship in this year, a reluctance to which Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> x f., refers both as a fact and as an item in Paulus' speech.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>After this address and the due completion of the sacrifice at the Latin Festival,
					<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> which was held on March 31<note>The date had been set for two weeks later, according to xix. 4 above; it seems unlikely that the date, once announced, could have been advanced, and there is probably a confusion in the text between Ides and Kalends either here or above.</note> on the Alban Mount, both the consul and the praetor Gnaeus Octavius immediately set out for Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> History records that the consul was escorted by an unusually great throng of persons paying their respects to him, and that men prophesied with almost sure expectation that the Macedonian war would come to an end, and that the return of the consul would be prompt and in great triumph.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these events were occurring in Italy, Perseus decided that since he had discovered that the Romans had entered the pass and that the final crisis of the war impended, he must no longer postpone the project which he could not bring himself to complete because expenditure of money was required-namely, gaining the adherence of Gentius, king of Illyria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Inasmuch as Perseus had agreed through his envoy Hippias<note>Not named by Livy in his description of an earlier stage of the negotiations in XLIII. xx. In the present passage, Livy is following Polybius XXIX. 3-4.</note> on a payment of three <pb id="p.165"/>hundred talents of silver, on condition of an exchange<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> of hostages, he sent Pantauchus, one of his most trusty friends, to complete the agreement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At Meteon in the region of Labeatis, Pantauchus met the Illyrian king; there he received the king's oath and his hostages. Gentius too sent an envoy named Olympio to require the oath and the hostages of Perseus.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Others were sent with him to receive the money; and, at Pantauchus' suggestion, Parmenio and Morcus were named as envoys to go with the Macedonians to Rhodes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To them instructions were given to set out for Rhodes only after the oath, the hostages, and the money had been received; it was thought that by the prestige of two kings at once the Rhodians could be induced to war with the Romans, and that once the kings were joined by the state to which
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> belonged a unique reputation for sea-power, no hope on land or sea would be left the Romans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>On the arrival of the Illyrians, Perseus left his camp at the Elpe&uuml;s River with all his cavalry and met them at Dium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There the terms agreed upon were executed in the presence of the surrounding column of cavalry, whom the king wished to be present at the ratification of the alliance with Gentius, thinking that it would somewhat raise their spirits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The hostages were also given and received in the sight of all, those who were to receive the money were sent to the royal treasury at Pella and those who were to accompany the Illyrian envoys to Rhodes were ordered to take ship at Thessalonica.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Metrodorus<note>A Rhodian, agent of the pro-Macedonian party.</note> was at that port, a recent arrival from Rhodes, who stated, on the authority of Dinon and Polyaratus, the <pb id="p.167"/>heads of the state,<note>They were heads of the pro-Macedonian party, but Livy may exaggerate their official position.</note> that the Rhodians were ready for<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> war. Metrodorus was assigned as the leader of the combined embassy with the Illyrians.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, identical messages, suggested by the state of affairs, were sent both to Eumenes and to Antiochus, as follows: by nature a free state and a king were things hostile to each other; the Roman people attacked kings one by one, and &mdash;an unjust state of affairs &mdash;assailed kings with the help of kings;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Perseus' father had been overcome with the aid of Attalus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> with Eumenes helping, and to a certain extent Perseus' father Philip as well, Antiochus had been assailed<note>On Attalus, see above, XXIX. xii. 14 and XXXI. xiv; for Eumenes, XXXV. xiii; XXXVI. xliv; XXXVII. xli; for Philip, XXXVII. vii.</note> ; now both Eumenes and Prusias were in arms against Perseus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> if the kingdom of Macedonia were out of the way, next would come Asia Minor, which the Romans had already made their own to some extent under pretext of freeing communities, and after Asia Minor, Syria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Already Prusias was being given a position above Eumenes, already Antiochus, though victorious, was being barred from Egypt, his prize of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Perseus bade each king, on considering these facts, to take such steps that either he might force the Romans to make peace with Perseus, or if Rome persevered in an unjust war might regard the Romans as the common enemy of all kings.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The message to Antiochus was open; to Eumenes the envoy was sent under guise of ransoming prisoners, but in fact certain more secret matters were under discussion, which for the time being embarrassed Eumenes, who was already an object of <pb id="p.169"/>hatred and suspicion to the Romans, with false and more serious charges;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for he was already regarded as a traitor and almost an enemy, while the two kings with grasping hands vied with each other in guile and greed.<note>Polybius XXIX. 7-8 (Id) calls Eumenes <quote>most unscrupulous</quote> and Perseus <quote>most miserly,</quote> and says that Eumenes <quote>was unable by his lack of scruple to get the best of Perseus' stinginess.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was a Cretan, Cydas, one of Eumenes' henchmen. He had held conversations, first at Amphipolis with a certain Chimarus, a fellow-countryman who was serving in Perseus' army, then later at Demetrias, beneath the very walls of the city, once with a certain Menecrates and again with Antimachus, both of whom were officers of the king.<note>For the negotiations at Demetrias, see above, xiii. 9, where Antimachus only is mentioned on the Macedonian side.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Herophon also, who was then sent by Perseus, had similarly undertaken two previous missions to Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These conversations were secret, and the missions caused bad rumours, but there was no knowledge of what had been discussed or upon what the kings had agreed. The actual state of affairs, however, was as follows.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Eumenes did not want a victory for Perseus, nor did he intend to assist him in winning one by military means, not so much because of the mutual hostility of their fathers, as because of the hatred engendered between himself and Perseus.<note>Livy is in this chapter expanding the account of Polybius XXIX. 7-8 (Id).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The jealousy of kings is such that Eumenes would not have viewed with calmness the attainment by Perseus of such great strength and prestige as awaited him if he defeated the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Eumenes also perceived that from the very outset of the war Perseus had nurtured the hope of peace in every way<note>Livy now states what his presentation of facts showed before-that Perseus did not want the war, and stood on the defensive from the first, see Vol. XII. 396 and 460, notes 1, Roman suspicions and propaganda notwithstanding; the latter have influenced Livy extensively in his commentary on events.</note> and as <pb id="p.171"/>time went on had come more and more, as the threat<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> came closer, to treat and think of nothing else.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since the war was dragging on longer than the Romans had hoped, they too, their commanders, and their senate would not be averse, so Eumenes thought, to ending so disturbing and difficult a war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having ascertained this willingness on either side, Eumenes was eager to put on sale his good offices in an effort to negotiate the peace which he thought might even come about automatically through the weariness of the stronger and the fears of the weaker side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Therefore Eumenes tried to negotiate for a reward, now for not aiding the Romans' military effort on land or sea, now for securing peace with the Romans; for his abstention from war, his price was a thousand talents,<note>Polybius says five hundred.</note> for negotiating peace, fifteen hundred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He showed himself always ready not only to pledge his word to either course of action, but even to give hostages.</p> 
				<p>Perseus was very ready to undertake the attempt under pressure of fear, and as
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> to the acceptance of hostages the discussion proceeded without delay, and it was agreed that, when accepted, the hostages should be sent to Crete.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the subject of money came up, there Perseus hesitated, and said that especially for the first alternative the payment of money was dishonourable and base for kings of so high a reputation, not only for the giver, but even more for the recipient;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for the hope of peace with the Romans, he would not refuse an expenditure, but he would pay on the completion of the enterprise, and meanwhile would deposit the funds in the temple on Samothrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Since this island was in Perseus' realm, Eumenes saw that it made no difference <pb id="p.173"/>whether the money was there or at Pella; he<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> attempted to secure some sort of down payment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so having tried vainly to overreach each other, the kings got themselves nothing but a bad reputation.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This was not the only failure incurred by Perseus because of miserliness, when by payment of money he could either through Eumenes' efforts have secured peace. which he should have bought even at the price of part of his kingdom, or had he been deceived, he could have exposed his enemy with the booty on him and aroused just hostility toward him on the part of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But a previous parallel case was that of the alliance with King Gentius, ready for the taking; and at this same time Perseus lost through miserliness the tremendous assistance of the Gauls who were scattered through the region of Illyria.<note>These people may have been much the same as the Bastarnae of XL. v. 10 and lvii, cf. also XLI. xix. 3-11. The name of the leader, Clondicus, is the same here and in XL. lviii. 8, which makes it sound like a title rather than a proper name. In Polybius XXV. 6 (XXVI. 9), there is a reference to the Bastarnae joining Perseus and the Gauls (Paton's interpretation),which has led some scholars to think that Polybius was referring to the Bastarnae as Gauls (Galatai) here. Properly, the Bastarnae were Germans rather than Gauls, as was recognized soon after Livy's time, cf. Strabo VII. 306, Pliny, <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> IV. 81, Tacitus, <hi rend="italics">Germania</hi> 46. The location of the Bastarnae was to the north-east of the location here suggested for these Gauls, but cf. below, xxvii. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were on their way ten thousand cavalry and an equal number of infantry who matched their pace to that of the horses, and in turn seized the riderless horses of fallen cavalrymen for further fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These men had been pledged a cash payment of ten gold pieces per cavalryman, five per infantryman, and a thousand for their leader.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they approached, Perseus went to meet them from his camp at the Elpe&uuml;s with half of his forces and began to give orders throughout the villages and cities near the road to bring out provisions so that there would be plenty of grain, wine, and animals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He <pb id="p.175"/>himself brought horses, breast-ornaments, and capes<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> as presents for the chief men, and a small amount of gold to distribute among a few, supposing that the rank and file could be led along by expectations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He reached the city of Almana and pitched camp on the banks of the Axius River. The force of Gauls halted near Desudaba in Maedica,<note>Probably on the mid-Strymon.</note> waiting for their promised pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thither Perseus sent Antigonus, one of the wearers of the purple, to order the rank and file of the Gauls to shift camp to Bylazora (this is a place in Paeonia) and the leaders to come in a body to him. The Gauls were seventy-five miles from the Axius River and the king's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Antigonus carried this message to them and added an account of the abundance of all supplies prepared through the thoughtfulness of the king, through which they would travel, and of the gifts of garments, silver, and horses with which the king proposed to greet their leaders on their arrival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Gauls replied that they would certainly find out about these matters from personal observation, but they asked about what had been promised for immediate delivery &mdash;whether he had brought with him the gold which was to be distributed among the individual horsemen and footmen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When they received no reply on this point, Clondicus, their chieftain, declared: <quote>Go back then and report to the king that the Gauls will not move a step farther unless they receive the gold and hostages.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>When this message was reported to the king, he summoned his council, but when it became clear what everyone would advise, the king, a trustier guardian of his cash than of his kingdom, began to discourse on the treachery and savagery of the Gauls, which had been demonstrated long since by disasters <pb id="p.177"/>to many people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> it was dangerous, he said, to receive<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> such large numbers into Macedonia, for fear that they would find the Gauls more deadly as allies than the Romans were as enemies; a force of five thousand cavalry was sufficient, for these they could use for military
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> purposes and would not themselves be overawed by their numbers.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was obvious to everyone that he was troubled about the pay and nothing else; but as no one dared to give him the advice he asked for, Antigonus was sent back to announce that the king could use the services of five thousand cavalry only, and would not keep the rest of the host.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the barbarians heard this, there was an indignant outcry from the remainder that they had been to no purpose lured away from their homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Clondicus again asked whether he would pay what had been agreed upon to these five thousand; and when he saw that to this, too, a devious reply was being concocted, the Gauls returned to the Danube, without injury to the messenger who had tricked them (a fate he had hardly hoped could befall him), but plundering that part of Thrace which adjoined their route.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This force of Gauls, even had the king remained inactive at the Elpe&uuml;s before the Romans, could if brought into Thessaly through the pass of Perrhaebia have not only stripped the fields by their ravages, so that the Romans could have looked for no provisions from there, but could even have stormed cities as long as Perseus held the Romans
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> at the Elpe&uuml;s, in order to prevent their rescuing the cities of their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans would have had to consider their own plight, since they could neither remain if Thessaly, the army's source of supplies, were lost, nor could they advance <pb id="p.179"/>while the camp of the Macedonians lay before them.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By losing this added strength, Perseus weakened to no small degree the morale of the Macedonians, who had been depending on this source of hope.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The same miserliness caused a rift with Gentius. For when Perseus had counted out three hundred talents for the envoys sent by Gentius to Pella, he permitted them to affix their seal to the money; then he sent ten talents to Pantauchus and ordered this paid at once to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His own people were transporting the rest of the money marked with the seal of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Illyrians, and he ordered them to convey it by short stages, and then when the Macedonian frontier was reached, to halt there and wait for messengers from him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After Gentius had received a scant portion of the money, he was continually spurred on by Pantauchus to assail the Romans with an act of hostility, and so he threw into prison Marcus Perpenna and Lucius Petilius, the ambassadors who happened to reach him at this time.<note>See below xxxii. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On hearing of this Perseus thought that Gentius had committed himself to fight the Romans in any case, and sent a recall to the one conveying the money, as if his only concern was to save as much booty as possible for the Romans after his own defeat.</p> 
				<p>Herophon also returned from the court of Eumenes, the secret negotiations being still unrevealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Macedonians spread the word that discussion about prisoners had taken place, and Eumenes, to avoid suspicion, informed the consul to this same effect.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the disappointment of Herophon's return from the court of Eumenes, Perseus sent Antenor and Callippus, his naval commanders, with <pb id="p.181"/>forty scout-ships &mdash;there were five cutters<note>Cf. XXXV. xxvi. 1, Polybius XVI. 2. 9 and XVIII (XVII) 1. 1, lumps these <hi rend="italics">pristes</hi> with the <hi rend="italics">lembi</hi> as light fighting vessels. Livy, quoting from the latter passage of Polybius, translates <hi rend="italics">pristis</hi> by <quote>beaked ship,</quote> XXXII. xxxii. 9.</note> added to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> this number &mdash;to
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Tenedos, in order to protect from that base the ships scattered through the Cyclades islands on their way to Macedonia with grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The ships were launched at Cassandrea, and after crossing first to the harbours under Mount Athos and thence on a calm sea to Tenedos, they sent away unharmed and even with kind addresses some undecked Rhodian ships which were at the port with Eudamus their commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then Antenor discovered that on the other side of the island fifty of their freight ships were blockaded by warships of Eumenes, under command of Damius, which were stationed at the mouth of the harbour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Antenor promptly sailed around and by threat caused the enemy ships to retreat; the freight ships were sent to Macedonia under convoy of ten scout-ships, which were instructed to return to Tenedos after seeing them safe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the ninth day thereafter they returned to the fleet, which was now anchored at Sigeum. Thence they crossed to Subota, an island lying between Elaea and Chios.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the day after the arrival of the fleet at Subota, thirty-five of the ships called horse-transports, setting out from Elaea with Galatian cavalry and their mounts, were making for Phanae, a cape of Chios, from which they could cross to Macedonia. They were being sent to Attalus by Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When a signal reached Antenor from a lookout post that these ships were at sea, he started from Subota and met them between the cape of Erythrae and Chios, where <pb id="p.183"/>the strait is narrowest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Eumenes' officers least of<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> all suspected that a Macedonian fleet was at large in that sea; now they thought them to be Romans, now Attalus, or some men sent back by Attalus from the Roman camp and on their way to Pergamum. But when the shape of the approaching scout-ships was unmistakable and the rapid motion of the oars and the pointing of the prows head-on revealed that enemies were approaching, then panic fell upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Since there was no hope of resistance, both because of the unwieldly type of vessel and because the Galatians could hardly withstand an undisturbed voyage,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> some of them, who were nearer to the mainland, swam ashore at Erythrae and some set sail for Chios, ran their ships aground, and abandoning their horses fled in rout to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But as the scoutships put troops ashore nearer the city at a more convenient landing-place, the Macedonians overtook the Galatians and cut them down, partly as they fled along the road and partly when they were shut out of the city gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For the Chians had closed their gates, not knowing who were fleeing or who pursuing.<note>The move by Eumenes to add to Attalus' force indicates that Livy's charges of treachery against Eumenes were none too well founded. The exact course of the action described is not clear from the account in Livy's usual impressionistic manner; but the Macedonian ships seem to have let the transports pass Subota, wherever that was, and then pursued, overtaking them between Phanae, the cape and harbour at the south end of Chios (cf. above, XXXVI. xliii. 11 and Strabo XIV. 1. 35) and Chios city. The Chians were allies of Rome.</note> About eight hundred of the Galatians were killed and two hundred taken alive; some of the horses were destroyed in the sea as the ships were wrecked, some were hamstrung on shore by the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Antenor ordered twenty horses of exceptional beauty, along with the prisoners, to be taken to Thessalonica by the same ten scout-ships he had sent before, which he ordered to return as soon as possible <pb id="p.185"/>to the fleet;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> he said he would await them at Phanae.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> For about three days the fleet anchored before the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Then they moved on to Phanae, and setting sail on the unexpectedly early arrival of the ten scout-ships, crossed the Aegean Sea to Delos.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these events were taking place, the Roman envoys,<note>To Alexandria, cf. xix. 13.</note> Gaius Popilius, Gaius Decimius, and Gaius Hostilius, set out from Chalcis in three five-banked ships and on arriving at Delos found there forty Macedonian scout-ships and five five-bankers of King Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The holiness of the temple and the island kept them all from harm. And so the Roman, the Macedonian, and Eumenes' sailors mingled in the temple under the truce provided by the sacredness of the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Whenever signals came from the lookouts that any freight-ships were passing out at sea, Antenor, Perseus' officer, would himself pursue with some ships, while others of his ships were distributed among the Cyclades, and either sank or plundered every ship not sailing for Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Popilius would come to the rescue with what ships he had either of his own or Eumenes'; but the Macedonians would evade him by sailing at night mostly in groups of two or three ships.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At about this same time, the envoys from Macedonia and Illyria
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> arrived together at Rhodes, and weight was lent their words not only by the arrival of the scoutships roaming all around the Cyclades and the Aegean Sea, but also by the very fact of the combination between the kings Perseus and Gentius, and the rumour of the arrival of the Gauls in great numbers both of infantry and cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since, then, the boldness of Dinon and Polyaratus, who sided with <pb id="p.187"/>Perseus, was on the increase, not only was a cordial<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> response given to the kings, but the flat statement was made that the Rhodians would by their influence bring an end to the war, and that therefore the kings
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> themselves should make up their minds calmly to accept peace.<note>Livy is following Polybius XXIX. 11 (5). Polybius says that the loss of Eumenes' cavalry impressed the Rhodians, but does not mention the Gauls from the North; he does not make the Rhodians sound as cock-sure as does Livy.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By now spring was beginning<note>It was late April by the then Roman calendar, but actually early February, see below, xxxvii. 5-9.</note> and the new commanders arrived in the field, the consul Aemilius in Macedonia, Octavius with the fleet at Ore&uuml;s, and in the region of Illyria, Anicius, whose task was the campaign against Gentius.<note>The characterization of Gentius is based on Polybius XXIX. 13 (5).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This king, the son of Pleuratus, king of the Illyrians, and Eurydice, had two brothers, Plator, a full brother, and Caravantius, born of the same mother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The latter Gentius suspected less because of the obscurity of his father, but the king killed Plator and two friends of his, Ettritus and Epicadus, energetic men, for the greater security of his reign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The rumour was that he envied his brother his betrothal to Etuta, daughter of Monunius the chieftain of the Dardani, since by this marriage Plator would secure the support of the Dardani; and Gentius made this really very probable by marrying the girl after the murder of Plator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Once the fear of his brother was removed, Gentius began to be oppressive to his people, and the violence innate in his character was inflamed by overuse of wine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> However, when he had been stirred up to fight the Romans, as has been related above, he collected all his forces at Lissus. These were fifteen thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From there he sent his brother with <pb id="p.189"/>a thousand infantry and fifty cavalry to subdue the<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> tribe of the Cavii either by force or threats, while he himself advanced from Lissus five miles to the city of Bassania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The inhabitants were allied to the Romans; and so when overtures were made by messengers sent ahead of Gentius, they preferred to stand siege rather than to surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As Caravantius arrived among the Cavii, the town of Durnium received him hospitably; Caravandis, another city, shut him out; and while he was ravaging their territory far and wide, a few scattered soldiers were killed by the rallying farmers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By now Appius Claudius too had added auxiliaries of the Bullini and the citizens of Apollonia and Dyrrachium to the army he had with him, and had set out from winter quarters to a camp by the Genusus River, since he had heard of the treaty between Perseus and Gentius and was incensed by the mistreatment of the molested envoys, so that he was bent on campaigning against Gentius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> About this time Anicius the praetor heard at Apollonia of affairs in the region of Illyria, and sending ahead orders to Appius to wait for him at the Genusus, he himself arrived in camp in three days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He added to the auxiliaries he had two thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry of the young men of the Parthini &mdash;Epicadus commanded the infantry, Algalsus the cavalry &mdash;and made ready to march into the region of Illyria, especially in order to relieve the siege of Bassania. His urgency was restrained by a rumour of scout-ships ravaging the coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There were eighty of these ships, sent by Gentius at the suggestion of Pantauchus to plunder <pb id="p.191"/>the territory of Dyrrachium and Apollonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then a<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> fleet at . . .<note>Appian, <hi rend="italics">Illyrian Wars</hi> ii. 9 says that Anicius <quote>captured some of Gentius' scout-ships and then engaged him in battle on land, defeated him, and shut him up in a fortress.</quote></note> . . . they surrendered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereafter the cities of the region did the same, the turn of their thoughts being assisted by the mildness and justice of the Roman praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next he arrived at Scodra, the centre of resistance not only because Gentius had appropriated it as the citadel for his whole kingdom, but also because it is the best-fortified town of the Labeate tribe, and is hard to approach.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Two rivers surround it, the Clausal flowing by on the side of the city which faces eastward, the Barbanna on the west side, flowing from the Labeate Lake. (These two streams after joining fall into the Oriundes River<note>This river is elsewhere called the Drilon (modern Drin); in 1858, after a period during which the Drilon emptied to the south, and the Barbanna followed its own course to the sea, the Drin, in flood, resumed the course reported by Livy, and was maintaining it, except for some water following the southern channel, about 1940 (see the <hi rend="italics">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</hi> 1944, <hi rend="italics">s. v.</hi> Albania).</note> which rises on Mount Scordus, is swelled by many other streams, and falls into the Adriatic Sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mount Scordus, by far the highest of that region, overlooks Dardania to the eastward, Macedonia to the south, and the Illyrian region to the west.)
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although the town was fortified by its surroundings and the whole nation of the Illyrians, as well as their, king, was defending it, nevertheless the Roman praetor decided that since his first moves had met with success, good fortune in the campaign as a whole would follow these beginnings, and that a fast-moving threat would be efficacious;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> so he advanced to the wall with his army in formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If well-placed forces had shut the gates and defended the walls and gate-towers, they <pb id="p.193"/>would have routed the Romans from the wall and<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> made their attempt worthless; as it was, they sallied from the gate and on level ground joined battle with more spirit than they maintained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For they were routed and huddled in flight, while over two hundred fell in the very mouth of the gate, and they
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> brought in with them such panic that Gentius at once sent representatives named Teuticus and Bellus, leading men of the nation, to the praetor to ask for a truce so that the king might deliberate over his situation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he was given three days for this purpose, he boarded a ship, since the Roman camp was about half a mile from the city, and sailed up the Barbanna River to Lake Labeate, as if seeking a secluded spot for taking council; actually, as became evident, he was stirred by an unfounded hope that his brother Caravantius<note>Possibly he had gone to a different region from that mentioned in the preceding chapter, and was among friends.</note> would arrive with many thousands of soldiers gathered in the region to which he had been sent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After the talk about this had evaporated, on the third day he brought the same ship downstream to Scodra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> First sending messengers to secure an opportunity for addressing the praetor and on being given the opportunity, he came into camp. At the outset of his speech he began by blaming his own stupidity, and at the end gave himself up to entreaties and a flood of tears, and falling at the praetor's knees, put himself into his hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Immediately he was bidden to take heart, and after being invited to dinner, returned to his own people in the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> On that day he was banqueted with marks of distinction by the praetor, and then put under the guard of Gaius Cassius, tribune of the soldiers, after <pb id="p.195"/>having received a mere ten talents, hardly the fee of<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> a gladiator, though he
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> was a king dealing with a king, to induce him to sink to such misfortune.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On taking over Scodra, Anicius' very first order was that the ambassadors Petilius and Perpenna should be searched out and brought to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they had been restored to a properly dignified state, he immediately sent Perpenna to arrest the friends and relatives of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Perpenna set out for Meteon, the city of the Labeate tribe, and brought to camp at Scodra Etleva,<note>We cannot determine whether this is another queen, or whether the name Etuta in xxx. 4 refers to the same woman.</note> the queen, with her two children, Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus, and Caravantius the king's brother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After completing the Illyrian campaign within thirty days, Anicius sent Perpenna to Rome as messenger of this victory, and a few days later sent on King Gentius himself with his mother, wife, children, and brother, as well as other leading Illyrians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This campaign was unique in that its conclusion was reported at Rome before its beginning.</p> 
				<p>During the time that this was going on, Perseus also was in great fear because of the arrival not only of Aemilius the new consul, who he heard had come on the scene bringing dire threats, but also of Octavius the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king was feeling equally keenly the threat from the Roman fleet and the danger to the coastal area. At Thessalonica, Eumenes and Athenagoras were in command with a small garrison of two thousand light infantry.<note>Cf, XLII. li. 4 and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To that place Perseus sent the officer Androcles also, under orders to encamp right by the dockyards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To Aenea a thousand cavalry under Creon of Antigonea were sent to <pb id="p.197"/>protect the coastal area, in order to come at once to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the aid of the country folk at any point on the shore where they heard that enemy ships had put in.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Five thousand Macedonians were sent to garrison Pytho&uuml;s and Petra,<note>These places guarded a pass north of Mount Olympus by which the position at the Elpe&uuml;s might have been taken in the rear.</note> the commanders being Histiaeus, Theogenes, and Midon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When these forces had left, Perseus set himself to fortifying the bank of the Elpe&uuml;s, because its dry bed could be crossed. In order that his entire force might be free for this operation, women gathered from the near-by cities brought foodstuffs into camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the soldiers, under orders, from the woods near by generously . . .<note>Further preparations of Perseus and the arrival of Paulus at the Roman camp were described in this gap.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>... to gather, and finally he ordered the water-carriers to follow him to the sea, which was less than three-tenths of a mile away, and to dig wells on the beach, some here, some there, at slight intervals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The immense height of the mountains,<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xiv. 1, says that the green woods on the slopes indicated abundant ground-water.</note> especially inasmuch as they produced no visible rivers, gave him the hope that underneath were hidden streams, the veins of which trickled through to the sea and mingled with the salt water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hardly had the uppermost sand been penetrated when jets of water spurted out, at first muddy and slight, but then proceeding to pour out, as if by a miracle, with clear and copious water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This success too gave the commander no little glory and power of leadership with the soldiers. Then when the soldiers were ordered to put their weapons in condition, the consul with the tribunes and ranking centurions went forward to reconnoitre the crossings, in order to find out where <pb id="p.199"/>the way down was easy for men under arms and where<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> on the farther bank there was the least unfavourable way up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After gathering sufficient information on these points, he introduced other changes, too; in the first place, he saw to it that everything in the column should take place in good order and without confusion at the beck and call of the commander;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> when orders were given to the whole army at once and not all were within hearing, he said, some, after receiving an unclear order, made additions of their own and did more than was bidden, while others did less; hence discordant outcries arose everywhere and the enemy found out what was afoot sooner than one's own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Therefore the consul decided that the tribune of the soldiers should first give an order privately to the chief centurion of the legion, and he and his subordinates in rank should then each tell to the next in rank<note>Centurions ranked according to their place in the formation of the legion, cf. e.g. XLII. xxxiv. 5-8.</note> what was to be done, whether the order was to be passed from the head of the column to the rear, or from the last to the first.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul also made the innovation of forbidding sentries to carry a shield<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xiii. 5, says a spear.</note> on post; for he said that a sentry is not going into combat to use his weapons, but is to keep on guard so that when he perceives the approach of the enemy, he may retire and rouse the others to arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Men set the shield before them and stand there, helmet on head; then when they are tired, they lean on the spear, rest the head on the shield-rim, and stand there drowsing, so that with their shining armour they can be detected by the enemy from afar, while they themselves do not see ahead at all. The consul also changed the practice of the outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All were used to spending the entire day under arms, cavalry with their horses bridled; when this took <pb id="p.201"/>place on summer days under an unremitting -and<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> burning sun, after so many hours of heat and weariness the tired men and horses were often attacked by fresh enemy troops and superior numbers thrown into confusion by even a few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So he gave orders that men on duty in the morning should be relieved at noon by a different afternoon detail; in this way a fresh enemy could never attack tired men.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After he had announced to an assembly of the soldiers the decision to adopt these measures, the consul added a speech in the vein of his address in Rome:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/><quote>There should be a single general in an army who foresees and plans what should be done, sometimes by himself, sometimes with the advisers he calls into council. Those who are not called into council should not air their own views publicly or privately.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A soldier should concern himself with the following: his body, to keep it as strong and as nimble as possible; the good condition of his weapons; and the readiness of his food-supply for unexpected orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the rest, he should realize that the immortal gods and his general are taking care of him. In an army in which the soldiers deliberate and the general is led about by the gossip of the rank and file, conditions are utterly unsound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For my part, I shall do the duty of a general &mdash;that is, see to it that you have an opportunity for successful action. You ought not to ask what is going to happen, but when the signal is given, then do your duty as soldiers.</quote></p> 
				<p>After these instructions, he dismissed the assembly, while throughout the army even the veterans admitted that they, like raw recruits, had for the first time learned how military matters should be handled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.203"/>Not only did they show by such remarks with how<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> much approval they had heard the words of the consul, but there was also an immediate response in action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Soon you could have seen no one idle in the whole camp; some were sharpening swords, others were polishing helmets and cheek-pieces, still others shields and coats of mail;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> some were fitting their armour to their bodies and trying the nimbleness of their bodies under arms, others were brandishing spears, others fencing with their swords and inspecting the point<note>The Romans relied chiefly on the thrust, cf. Vegetius I. 12.</note> ; so that anyone could easily see that as soon as an opportunity of joining battle with the enemy had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> given, they would put an end to the war either by a glorious victory or by a death that would go down in history.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>When Perseus, too, noticed that on the arrival of the consul and the beginning of spring everything in the enemy camp was full of noise and bustle as if the war were just beginning, that the camp had been shifted from Phila to the bank opposite the Macedonians, and the hostile commander was now going about to view Perseus' defences, no doubt because he was reconnoitring a passage, now .. .<note>According to Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xv, a period of startling inactivity on both sides ensued. The words with which the text resumes may conclude an account of how the news of Gentius' defeat arrived in the two camps.</note> . of the Romans was.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This affair raised the spirits of the Romans. It also brought no little panic to the Macedonians and their king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At first he tried to hide the report of the event in secret, by sending men to forbid Pantauchus, who was coming from there, to approach the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But now some boys were seen by their relatives being led along with the Illyrian hostages <pb id="p.205"/>and the more carefully the various details were<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> concealed, the more easily they leaked out through the garrulity of the king's servants.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>About the same time envoys from Rhodes came into camp with the same message about peace which had aroused great wrath in the senators at Rome. They received a much less favourable audience from the council in the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So while some advised that the envoys be thrown into chains, others that they be driven headlong out of camp without an answer, the consul announced that he would make a reply a fortnight later. Meanwhile, to make it clear how much influence the Rhodian peace-makers had succeeded in exerting, he began to hold consultations as to the plan of campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Some, especially the younger, wished to force a way through the bank of the Elpe&uuml;s and the fortifications;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> a solid formation, they said, attacking in single column would be irresistible to the Macedonians, who had the previous year been driven out of so many forts,<note>This is contrary to the picture given by Livy above, chs. iv-vii, and seems to be inserted to show that the speakers estimated the situation incorrectly.</note> rather higher and better fortified and held with strong garrisons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Others advised that Octavius with his fleet should make for Thessalonica and by ravaging the coastal area create a diversion of the king's forces, so that on the appearance of another attack in his rear the king would be pulled about to guard the inner part of his kingdom and be compelled to open a crossing somewhere over the Elpe&uuml;s. The consul himself regarded the riverbank as impregnable by nature and by fortification and, besides the fact that artillery had been placed everywhere, he had heard that the enemy employed <pb id="p.207"/>missile weapons better and with more deadly aim.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The whole thought of the Roman commander inclined in a different direction;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and dismissing his council, he summoned the Perrhaebian merchants Coenus and Menophilus, men already known to him for loyalty and wisdom, and secretly inquired what the passes into Perrhaebia were like.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When they said that the terrain was not difficult, but was blocked by the king's guard-forces,<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xv and xvi. 1, says that the passes were not guarded at this time, but that Perseus sent a force after hearing that Romans, under Nasica, were on the march to Pythium. Plutarch cites Polybius and Nasica himself for the story of the dislodging of the Macedonians.</note> the consul conceived the hope that the guards could be dislodged if he attacked suddenly by night with a strong force and surprised them; for, he argued, javelins, arrows, and other missiles are useless in the dark when the target cannot be sighted at a distance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the sword is the weapon used at close quarters in a confused throng, and with that weapon the Roman soldier would win. Planning to use the abovementioned merchants as guides, the consul summoned the praetor Octavius, explained his plans, and ordered him to sail for Heracleum with the fleet and have ten days' cooked rations for a thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For his own part, he sent Publius Scipio Nasica and his own son Quintus Fabius Maximus<note>As explained by Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xv, this was the elder of Aemilius' sons by his first wife; the younger became Scipio Africanus the Younger, cf. below, xliv. 1-2. After divorcing his wife, remarrying, and having two more sons(for whom see below, XLV. xl. 7), Aemilius gave the older pair in adoption. Fabius was about eighteen at this time; his adoption had taken place about ten years before.</note> with five thousand picked
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> men<note>Plutarch, following Nasica and correcting Polybius, lists three thousand Italians (<quote>special troops</quote> &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">e)kto\s ta/cews</foreign> =<hi rend="italics">extraordinarii</hi>?), five thousand of the <quote>left wing</quote> (= <hi rend="italics">sinistra</hi> <hi rend="italics">ala, i.e.</hi> cavalry?), 120 cavalry, and 200 mixed Thracians and Cretans.</note> to Heracleum, in order to feign an embarkation for the purpose of the plan mentioned in the council, namely, of ravaging the coastal area of inner Macedonia. Scipio and Fabius were privately <pb id="p.209"/>informed that food was ready for them at the fleet,<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> so that they would not be
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> delayed. Next, the guides were instructed to arrange the stages of the journey so that they could attack Pytho&uuml;s in the fourth watch of the third day. Next day at dawn the consul himself, in order to keep the king from investigating the other projects, joined battle with the enemy's outposts in the middle of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> river-bed. The fight was conducted with light-armed troops on both sides. It was impossible to fight with heavier troops in so rough a stream-bed. The slope of either bank to the bottom was about three hundred paces; between the banks, a space of a little over a mile lay open where the torrent had hollowed it out in varying degrees from place to
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> place. There the fight took place in sight of the watchers from the walls of both camps, the king on one side, the consul and his legions on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> other. The king's light troops fought better at long range with missiles; at close quarters the Romans were steadier, and better protected by either the cavalry targe or the Ligurian rectangular
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> shield.<note>This is based on Polybius XXIX. 14. 4; the Ligurian shield was long and light, according to Diodorus V. 39. 7.</note> About noon the consul ordered the recall to be sounded for his
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> men. So that day the fight was broken off with no small losses to both sides. At sunrise the next day an even sharper fight took place, since their spirits had been roused by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> combat. But the Romans received a great many wounds not only from those with whom the fight had been joined, but much more from the large numbers posted on the towers with all sorts of missile weapons and stones. As they came nearer to the enemy's bank, the shots from the engines reached even the rear ranks. After far more severe losses that day, the consul recalled his men somewhat
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> later. On the <pb id="p.211"/>third day, he desisted from battle and went down to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the lower side of the camp as if he were going to attempt the crossing through the spur of the fortifications which ran down to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> sea. What was before Perseus' eyes ...<note>Judging from Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xvi, the lost four sheets told of the success of Nasica in clearing the pass, Perseus' fright and retreat, and his subsequent resolve to make a stand at Pydna; also of the joining of Nasica with Paulus and the overtaking of the Macedonians.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit                   ="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The season was that immediately following the turn of midsummer<note>See below, xxxvii. 5-8 and note 1; by the then calendar, it was Sept. 3.</note> ; the time of day was approaching noon; the journey had been made through much dust and an ever-hotter sun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Weariness and thirst now began to make themselves felt, and since it was presently obvious that midday would intensify the blazing heat, the consul decided not to expose men so weakened to a fresh and unwearied enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but such zeal was in their hearts for fighting at all costs that the consul needed as much skill to out manoeuvre his own men as the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since all were not yet in formation, he urged on the tribunes of the soldiers to hasten the deployment; he himself went about the ranks and was engaged in rousing the spirits of the men to battle by exhortation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At this they first kept eagerly calling for the signal; then, in proportion as the heat increased their countenances were less lively and their cries slacker, and some stood lolling on their shields and leaning on their spears. Then the consul proceeded openly to give the order to the ranking centurions to layout the front of the camp and place the baggage.<note>Which was placed next the wall of the camp.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the soldiers perceived that this was being done, some rejoiced
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> openly that he had not compelled men wearied by the toil of marching to fight a battle in scorching heat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Surrounding the general were his <pb id="p.213"/>staff and the foreign commanders, among whom was<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> Attalus, all showing approval as long as they believed the consul was going to fight (for he had not revealed his doubts even to them); then at the sudden change of plan they were all silent except Nasica,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> who alone dared to advise the consul not to loose his grasp on an enemy who had baffled previous generals by avoiding an encounter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nasica feared that if the enemy departed by night, he would have to be pursued with the greatest toil and risk into the interior of Macedonia, and that the summer would be wasted, as under previous leaders,<note>As far as Livy's account goes, this applies only to Marcius, above, vi-x.</note> in roaming about the bypaths and passes of the Macedonian mountains;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> for his own part he strongly urged attack while the consul had the enemy in open country, so as not to lose the opportunity for victory which had been offered. The consul, nothing offended by the outspoken warning from so famous a young man, replied:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/><quote>I too have had the spirit which you now have, Nasica, and you will come to have the spirit I now have. From many vicissitudes of war I have learned when to fight and when to refuse battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There is not time to instruct you while you are standing-to for battle as to the reasons why it is better to be inactive today. You shall ask for my reasoning at another time; now you will be satisfied to take the word of an experienced general.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The young man held his tongue, thinking that no doubt the consul saw some obstacles to battle which he himself did not envisage.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After Paulus saw that the camp had been laid out and the baggage placed, he quietly withdrew the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> rear formation first from behind the <pb id="p.215"/>battle-line, next the chief formation, while the forward<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> formation stood its ground at the front of the battle-line, in case the enemy should make a move; last of all he withdrew the forward formation, taking the soldiers of one maniple at a time, starting with the right wing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this way, while the cavalry and the light-armed troops faced the enemy from in front of the battle-line, the infantry were withdrawn without confusion, and the cavalry were not called away from their posts until the facade of the rampart and the ditch facing the enemy had been completed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although the king would have been prepared to fight that day without reluctance, he was satisfied to let it be seen that the delay was due to the enemy, and he too withdrew his forces into camp.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the fortification of the camp was complete, Gaius Sulpicius Gallus,<note>He is mentioned by Cicero, <hi rend="italics">De Senectute</hi> xiv. 49 as a geometer and astronomer. For his praetorship, see XLIII. ii. 5. Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Nat. Hist.</hi> II. xii. 53, Frontinus I. xii. 8, and Zonaras 9. 23 speak of a prediction by Sulpicius; Justinus 33. 1. 7, Cicero, <hi rend="italics">De Republica</hi> I. xv. 23, Valerius Maximus 8. 11. 1, and Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xvii say that the explanation followed the eclipse. A fragment of Polybius XXIX. 16 (6) states that the eclipse was interpreted as portending the fall of a king; therefore it cheered the Romans and discouraged the Macedonians, see below, sec. 9. Modern reckoning sets the date of the eclipse as June 21, which would mean that the calendar was at least 70 days ahead of time, cf. p. 87, Appendix.</note> tribune of the soldiers with the second legion, who had been praetor the year before, summoned the soldiers to an assembly, by permission of the consul, and announced that no one should regard it as a bad omen when on the following night an eclipse of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the moon would take place from the second to the fourth hour of the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since this occurred in the regular order of nature at certain times, said Sulpicius, it could be calculated ahead of time and foretold. Therefore just as they were not surprised &mdash;inasmuch as both the risings and the settings of the sun and moon are well understood &mdash;when they saw the moon shining now full, now during its wane with a narrow arc, no more ought they to count it a prodigy that the moon is darkened <pb id="p.217"/>whenever it is hidden in the shadow of the earth.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the night preceding the 4th of September, when the moon was eclipsed at the predicted hour, the Roman soldiers regarded the wisdom of Gallus as almost divine;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Macedonians took it as a dire portent, foretelling the downfall of the kingdom and the nation, and no soothsayer shook their conviction. There was uproar and wailing in the Macedonian camp until the moon emerged to shine as usual.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>On the following day, so great was the eagerness of both armies for battle that some of their followers blamed both the king and the consul for separating without a fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The king had a rejoinder ready at hand: not only that the enemy had taken the lead in openly declining battle and leading his men back to camp, but that he had posted his forces in a position to which the phalanx could not be advanced, since even slightly unfavourable terrain makes a phalanx useless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As for the consul, besides his seeming loss of an opportunity for battle on the previous day and his giving the enemy a chance of withdrawing by night if they wished, he seemed on this day too to be wasting time on the pretext of offering sacrifice, although he should have given the signal at dawn and gone out to battle.<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xvii. 6, says that the consul's sacrifice to Heracles obtained good omens only with the twenty-first victim; also that the consul waited till the afternoon so that the sun would not be in the eyes of his troops.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At the third hour, after due completion of the sacrifice, he at last called a council, and in doing so seemed to some to be expending in talk and untimely advisement the time needed for carrying out action. In reply to such talk the consul delivered the following speech:</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"That excellent young man, Publius <pb id="p.219"/>Nasica, alone among all those who favoured fighting<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> yesterday disclosed his opinion to me; he too kept silent later, so that he may have seemed to have exchanged his view for mine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Certain others thought it better to criticize their general behind his back rather than to advise him openly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both to you, Publius Nasica, and to any others who less openly shared your opinion, I shall not hesitate to give an accounting for having postponed the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For I am so far from regretting our inactivity yesterday that I believe I saved the army by so planning. That none of you may believe me to hold this opinion groundlessly, come let each, if he please, review with me how many factors weighed for the enemy and against us. First of all, of their great superiority in numbers I am sure that you were all previously aware, and that you took notice of it on seeing the battle-line drawn up yesterday.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Out of this small force of ours, one-fourth of the men were left to guard the baggage; and you know that the guarding of the packs is not put in the hands of the most cowardly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But suppose we had been united: can we possibly consider it a small advantage that we shall go out, with the good help of the gods,<note>For similar expressions of precautionary piety, see VI. xxiii. 10, VII. xxxii. 17, XXI. xxi. 6.</note> from this camp in which we have spent last night, to do battle either today or at latest tomorrow if we so determine?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Does it make no difference whether you bid a soldier take up arms and lead him into battle when he is wearied neither by the toil of a
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> journey nor by construction on that day, when he is rested and refreshed in his own tent, when he is full of strength and vigorous in body and in spirit? Or whether he <pb id="p.221"/>is wearied by a long march and tired by his load,<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> dripping with sweat, his throat dry with thirst, his mouth and eyes full of dust, with the midday sun beating down upon him?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Will you pit him against an enemy fresh and rested, who brings into battle a strength unsapped by previous exertion? Who, by the gods' good faith, when he is thus matched, sluggish though he be and unwarlike, will not overcome the bravest fighter?</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>"What of the fact that the enemy had drawn up their line completely at leisure, had made ready their spirits, were standing each
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> at his post in the ranks, while we at that time had to incur the hasty turmoil of drawing up our line and had to enter battle in disorder? 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Oh yes, you say, we should have had a battle-line undeployed and disorderly; but our camp was fortified, our water-supply found, the way to it secured by placing guards, and reconnaissance made all around.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Or did our men have nothing but the bare ground on which to fight . . .? Your ancestors regarded a fortified camp as a haven against all the mischances of an army, whence they might go out to fight, and whither they might find shelter from the storm of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore when they had walled in their camp with fortifications, they used also to strengthen it with a powerful garrison, because one who had been stripped of his camp, even though he had won the battle, would be considered the loser. Camp is the shelter of the conqueror, the refuge of the conquered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> How many armies meeting with none too favourable fortune in battle, after being driven within their rampart, have in their own good time, sometimes after only a moment, sallied forth and routed the victorious enemy?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This abode is a second <pb id="p.223"/>home for the soldier, its rampart takes the place of<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> city walls and his own tent is the soldier's dwelling and hearthside. Should we have fought like nomads with no abode, so that, whether conquered or conquerors, we might return &mdash;where?</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>"To this statement of the difficulties and hindrances to battle, here is the rejoinder: what if the enemy had departed during the interval of last night? How much toil would we have had to expend in the renewed pursuit far into the utmost end of Macedonia?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For my part I am sure that he would never have remained here or led his forces out into battle-line had he decided to retreat from here. For how much easier it would have been to depart while we were at a distance than now when we are on his neck and he cannot trick us by leaving either by night or day?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What more can we wish than to attack our enemy in open country from the rear of his retreating and dispersed column after he has left his fortifications, instead of attacking, as we have attempted to do, his camp protected by the lofty bank of a river, and barricaded as well with a rampart and plenty of towers?</p> 
				<p><quote>These were my reasons for postponing battle from yesterday to today.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For I too prefer to fight; and therefore since the way to the enemy was barred by the Elpe&uuml;s River, I have opened a new road by expelling the enemy's guards from a different pass, and I will not turn back till I have fought to a finish.</quote></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech silence ensued, partly because men had changed over to his opinion, partly because they shrank from offending him to no purpose in a matter which was in any case a lost opportunity and could not be brought back. Nor <pb id="p.225"/>even on that day did either the consul or the king<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> care to fight, the king because he would have had to attack men no longer weary from travel as on the previous day, nor in turmoil as they marshalled their line of battle and hardly in formation, the consul because neither wood nor fodder had been collected in the new camp and a large number of soldiers had gone out of camp to seek them from the near-by countryside. Without either general wishing it, Fortune, which is stronger than human planning, brought on the battle. There was a stream of no great size nearer the camp of the enemy, from which both the Macedonians and the Romans were drawing water after posting guards on either bank in order to accomplish this mission safely. There were two cohorts on the Roman side, a Marrucinian and a Paelignian, and two troops of Samnite cavalry under the command of the staff-officer Marcus Sergius Silus; another fixed outpost was stationed before the camp under the staff-officer Gaius Cluvius, composed of three cohorts, from Firmum, the Vestini, and Cremona respectively, and two troops of cavalry from Placentia and Aesernia.<note>The Marrucini, Paeligni, Samnites, and Vestini were Italian <quote>allies</quote> of the Romans; Firmum, Cremona, Placentia, and Aesernia were colonies with Latin rights.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While there was quiet at the river, since neither side took the offensive, about the ninth hour a baggage-animal shied from the hands of his grooms and escaped toward the other bank.<note>Plutarch credits Aemilius with ordering a horse to be let loose, in order to bring on the battle.</note> While three soldiers were chasing him through the water, which was about knee-deep, two Thracians dragged the animal from mid-stream to their bank; the Romans pursued them, killed one, <pb id="p.227"/>recaptured the animal, and retired to their post.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> There was a guard of eight hundred Thracians on the Macedonian bank.

Judging from Plutarch, these pages contained a description of the advance of the armies from camp, their battle-order, skirmishing by the light-armed troops in which the Macedonians had the advantage, the charge of the Paelignians against some Macedonian light infantry and their collision with the phalanx (cf. below, sec. 9), and perhaps the impression made on Aemilius by the phalanx, an impression which he was careful not to show at the time.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>... led... the battle. The men were stirred by the prestige of his office, the fame of the man, and 
					above all by his age, for though he was over sixty he kept assuming functions of men in their prime in undergoing an outstanding amount of toil and danger. The legion 
					filled the space between the light infantry and the phalanxes and broke the enemy line. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the rear were the light infantry; the consul faced a unit with metal shields 
					&mdash;these were called the Bronze Shields. Lucius Albinus the ex-consul was ordered to lead the second legion against the White Shield phalanx<note>Plutarch speaks of 
					this unit as having gilded armour.</note> ; this was the centre of the hostile line. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On the right wing, where the battle had begun near the river, the consul brought 
					up the elephants and the squadrons of the allies; and from this point the flight of the Macedonians first began. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For, as frequently men's new inventions appear strong 
					when described, but in actual trial, when there is need for action rather than a description of how they will act, these inventions disappear without achieving any 
					result, so in this battle the anti-elephant corps was <pb id="p.229"/>a mere name without practical effect.<note>Zonaras 9. 22 (p. 269) says that these were infantry 
						with sharp spikes projecting from their helmets and shields, and also cavalry, both forces having been drilled to fight elephants; dummy elephants were used to 
						accustom the horses to them. The words of Livy at the beginning of sec. 4 seem to be a direct quotation from Polybius XXIX. 17. 2 (12).</note> 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The 
					charge<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> of the elephants was followed up by the allies of the Latin Name, who routed the left wing. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In the centre the charge of the 
					second legion scattered the phalanx. No reason for the victory was more obvious than the fact that there were many scattered engagements which first threw into confusion 
					and then disrupted the wavering phalanx. The power of this formation when closed up and bristling with spears extended is irresistible; 
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>but if by attacks at several 
					points you compel them to swing their spears about, unwieldy because of their length and weight, they become tangled in a haphazard mass; and if indeed some sort of 
					uproar is heard on a flank or from the rear, 
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>they are involved in utter confusion. Such was the case on this occasion, when the phalanx was compelled to meet the Romans 
					who were attacking in groups, while the Macedonian line was broken at many points. The Romans for their part kept infiltrating their units wherever gaps presented 
					themselves. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>If they had attacked frontally in solid line against an orderly phalanx, as happened to the Paelignians who at the beginning of the battle recklessly met the 
					light infantry, the Romans would have spitted themselves on the spears and would not have withstood the solid line.<note>A variant account of the battle is given by 
						Frontinus II. iii. 20, who says that Paulus arranged his line in wedges, and tried to draw out the Macedonians by attacking with skirmishers (<hi rend="italics">velites</hi>); 
						when this failed, Paulus retreated, to induce the Macedonians to break formation; when this also failed, the Roman cavalry from the left wing were ordered to charge 
						along the front of the phalanx and break off the spear-points with their shields; when this manoeuvre succeeded, the Macedonians broke and fled. Livy seems to have a 
						far preferable account.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> However, while the infantry were being slaughtered all over the field, except for those who cast 
					away their weapons and fled, the cavalry on the <pb id="p.231"/>other hand retired from the fight almost unscathed.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> 
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The king 
					himself was the leader in the flight. Directly from Pydna he set out for Pella with the Sacred Squadrons of cavalry; immediately Cotys and the Odrysan cavalry 
					followed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The other Macedonian squadrons also continued to retreat in orderly formation because the line of the infantry in between kept the 
					victors busy with slaughter and caused them to forget the pursuit of the cavalry. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For a long time the phalanx was cut to pieces from 
					the front, from the flanks, and from the rear. Finally those who slipped through the hands of the Romans fled weaponless to the sea, and some even entered the water and 
					raising their hands to the men on board ship humbly begged for life. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When they saw small boats gathering from all around the fleet, they thought that these were coming 
					to pick them up, to take them prisoner rather than to kill them, and so they advanced farther into the water, some even swimming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But when they were mercilessly cut down from the boats, those who could made for shore again by swimming and ran into a more 
					dreadful form of destruction; for the elephants, guided by their mahouts to the shore, trampled and crushed the men coming out of the water.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><p>It is readily agreed that the Romans never killed so many Macedonians in any other single battle. For about twenty thousand men were slain; about six thousand who escaped from the battlefield to Pydna were taken alive, and five thousand stragglers were captured in flight. Of the victors not more than one hundred fell and by far the greater part of them were Paeligni; somewhat more were wounded. If fighting had broken out earlier, so that sufficient <pb id="p.233"/>daylight would have remained for the victors to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> pursue, the entire Macedonian force would have been wiped out; as it was, the approach of night both sheltered the fugitives and inspired in the Romans a reluctance to pursue over unknown terrain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> Perseus fled to the Pierian Forest along the military road with a large column of cavalry and the 
					royal entourage. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As soon as they arrived in the forest, where there were many divergent ways, and night was approaching, the king left the road with a very few of 
					his most trusty men. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The cavalry, left without a commander, took various routes in dispersing to their own cities; a very few went on to Pella more rapidly than the 
					king, since they had gone by the direct and clear way. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The king was bothered till about midnight by losing his way and by various difficulties of the route. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At the palace Perseus was waited upon by the commanders of Pella, Euctus, and Eulaeus,<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxiii, calls them <quote>the

					from the battle to Pella, not one came to him, though they were summoned many times. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>There were only three companions in flight with him, Evander the Cretan, Neon 
					the Boeotian, and Archidamus the Aetolian.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With these he escaped in the fourth watch, being now afraid that those who refused to come to him would presently venture on a 
					bolder stroke. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>His escort was composed of about five hundred Cretans. He was making for Amphipolis; but he had left Pella at night because of his anxiety to cross 
					the Axius River before dawn, since he thought that because of the difficulty of crossing this would be the limit of the Roman pursuit.</p> <pb id="p.235"/>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> When the consul returned victorious to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> camp, he was prevented 
					from enjoying an unalloyed delight by the sting of worry over his younger son. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This was Publius Scipio, who was also called Africanus later after the destruction of 
					Carthage, born son to the consul Paulus and by adoption grandson of Africanus. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This son was then in his seventeenth year, a fact which in itself increased the 
					anxiety for him, and had been carried away in another direction by a crowd while in hot pursuit of the enemy. When he returned very late, then at last on the safe recovery of his son the consul felt the joy of so great a victory.<note>The 
						soldiers hailed him as <hi rend="italics">imperator</hi> for the third time (Mommsen, <hi rend="italics">M&uuml;nzwesen</hi> 633, number 486).</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At Amphipolis the news of the battle had by now arrived; there was a gathering of the matrons in the temple of Diana whom they call Tauropolos, to pray for help. 
					Diodorus, who was in charge of the city, feared that the Thracians, two thousand of whom were in the garrison, would plunder the city during the confusion. Hence 
					he craftily hired a man to play the part of dispatch bearer, from whom he received papers in the middle of the market place. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The message in these despatches was that the Roman fleet had put in at Emathia<note>The district west of Amphipolis, toward the Chalcidic peninsula.</note> and was harassing the surrounding 
					countryside, and that the officers in charge of Emathia requested him to send a force against the ravagers. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After reading this, he urged the Thracians to start out 
					to defend the coast of Emathia, telling them that they would cause great slaughter and get great booty among the Romans scattered all over the fields. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At the same time he minimized the report of the loss of a battle; if this were true, he said, man after man would have been arriving direct from the rout. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Having got rid of <pb id="p.237"/>the Thracians on this pretext, he barred the gates as<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> soon as he saw that they had crossed the Strymon.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> On the second day after the battle Perseus arrived at Amphipolis. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>From there he sent ambassadors with the staff of Mercury to Paulus. Meanwhile Hippias, Midon, and Pantauchus, the chief among the king's friends, set out of their own accord from Beroea, where 
					they had taken refuge after the battle, and surrendered to the Romans at the consul's camp. Others too, overcome with fear, were thereafter preparing to do the same. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The consul sent as messengers of his victory his son Quintus Fabius, Lucius Lentulus, and Quintus Metellus with despatches to Rome and granted the spoils of the slain 
					enemy to the infantry, 
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and to the cavalry the right to plunder the surrounding territory, provided that they were not absent from camp for more than two nights. He 
					himself moved camp nearer to the sea by Pydna. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Beroea first, then Thessalonica and Pella, and then almost all Macedonia was surrendered within two days. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The people of Pydna who were nearest had not yet sent envoys; a heterogeneous crowd of numerous nationalities together and the mob which had been amalgamated by flight from the 
					battlefield were standing in the way of planning and agreement among the citizens. The gates were not only closed but built up solid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Midon and Pantauchus were sent up to the walls to confer with Solon, who was in charge of the garrison; through him dismissal of 
					the mob of soldiers was arranged. The city when surrendered was given to the Roman troops to plunder.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After Perseus had tried his only expedient, to get aid from the Bisaltae,<note>A tribe living just west of Amphipolis.</note> to whom he sent envoys 
					<pb id="p.239"/>without result, he appeared before an assembly bringing<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> his son Philip with him, 
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>in order to strengthen by exhortation the spirits of the people of Amphipolis themselves, and of the cavalry and infantry who had either accompanied him or had in their flight reached the 
					same goal. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>He began to speak several times, but tears choked him, and when he could not open his mouth he instructed Evander the Cretan in the matters which he 
					wished to discuss with the people and went down from the sacred spot.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> the speakers' stand, cf. VIII. xiv. 12, describing the 
					consecration of the Roman Rostra.</note> 
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>At the sight of the king and his truly pitiable weeping the crowd itself groaned and wept; but with equal readiness 
					they would have none of Evander's speech; and some dared to shout from the midst of the assembly, <quote>Get away from here so that we few survivors may not perish 
					on your account.</quote> The vehemence of these interruptions choked off Evander's speech. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Thereafter the king went home, put his money, his gold, and his silver 
					into the scout-ships which were moored in the Strymon and himself went down to the river. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The Thracians and the rest of the mob of soldiers, not daring to trust 
					themselves to ships, slipped away to their homes; the Cretans followed Perseus in hopes of cash. Because apportionment would create more hard feelings than gratitude, 
					fifty talents were set out on the river-bank for them to scramble for. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>When after this scramble they were boarding the ships in riotous fashion, they sank one 
					scout-ship at the mouth of the river by overcrowding it. On that day the party reached Galepsus, on the next Samothrace, their destination; 
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>it is said that two 
					thousand talents were brought there.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> Paulus sent men to take charge of all the <pb id="p.241"/>surrendered cities, so that no 
					wrong should be done<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> to the conquered in the first days of peace; he kept the king's ambassadors with him and, since he did 
					not know of the king's flight, sent Publius Nasica to Amphipolis with a small force of infantry and cavalry, 
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>both to ravage Sintica and to interfere with any moves of the king. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meanwhile Meliboea was captured and plundered by Gnaeus Octavius. At Aeginium, to besiege which the staff-officer Gnaeus Anicius had been sent, two hundred men were lost in a sally from the 
					town because the people of Aeginium did not know that the war was over.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The consul set out from Pydna with his whole army and on the second day reached Pella, pitched camp a mile from there, and remained in this camp for a few days, 
					examining the site of the city from all sides and noticing that it had not been chosen to be the capital without good reason. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It is situated on a hill sloping to the south-west; swamps of a depth impenetrable in summer or winter surround it, formed by the ponding of rivers. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The citadel Phacus projects like an island from the swamp itself, where it comes nearest the city, and is set on an embankment, a huge construction designed to bear the weight of a wall and remain 
					undamaged by the water of the surrounding swamp. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At a distance it appears to be joined to the city wall, but it is separated by a river within the walls and 
					likewise connected by a bridge, so that there is no approach for a besieger from without nor is there any escape for anyone imprisoned by the king within, 
					except over a very easily guarded bridge. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The royal treasury was located there; but at that time nothing was found except the three hundred talents which had 
					been sent to King Gentius and then withheld. 
					<pb id="p.243"/><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>During the days in camp at Pella, numerous embassies<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> were 
					received which came, especially from Thessaly, to offer congratulations. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Then on receiving the news that Perseus had crossed to Samothrace, the consul set out 
					from Pella and arrived at Amphipolis on the fourth day's march. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The pouring out of the entire populace to meet him showed to any one that Paulus had not robbed

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE messengers of victory, Quintus Fabius,<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> Lucius Lentulus, and Quintus Metellus, summoned up the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> utmost possible speed and quickly arrived in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Yet they found that the joy of their announcement had been anticipated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the third day<note>As the battle took place on Sept. 4, Livy thinks of these games as occurring on Sept.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> 7 by the then calendar (actually June 25, see above, pp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> 87-89). It is not possible to establish exactly for this period the date of the Roman Games mentioned below;
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> in the time of Augustus, they extended from Sept. 4 to Sept.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> 19, but were probably extended as time went on.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The story of the mysterious announcement is told also by Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxiv, who agrees with Livy
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> in eliminating the gods from direct action on this occasion;

						<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ii. 6, Valerius Maximus I. viii. 1, and Pliny, <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> VII. xxii. 86, the news was proclaimed by Castor and Pollux.</note> after the battle with the king, while games were being celebrated in the circus, a rumour in the audience suddenly swept over the whole auditorium that a battle had been fought in Macedonia and the king beaten; then the buzz increased; finally there arose shouting and clapping, as if a definite report of victory had arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The magistrates were astonished and sought after the originator of this sudden rejoicing. When no such person was found, the rejoicing as if for an established fact died away, but the happy omen lurked nevertheless in men's minds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After confirmation came through the genuine report on the arrival of Fabius, Lentulus, and Metellus, men rejoiced both in the actual victory and in the prophetic power of their spirits. The story is told of a second rejoicing by the mob at the circus, which seemed no less genuine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the sixteenth of <pb id="p.251"/>September, on the second day of the Roman Games,<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> it is said that a messenger who said he came from Macedonia handed despatches wreathed with laurel to the consul Gaius Licinius as he was going up to start the chariot-race. When the race was over, the consul mounted his chariot and as he was being driven back to the reserved seats, showed the despatches to the people. At the sight of them the people at once forgot the show and rushed down into the arena. On the spot, the consul summoned the senate, had the despatches read, and on motion of the Fathers, announced to the people before the magistrates' seats that his colleague Lucius Aemilius had fought a pitched battle with King Perseus, that the Macedonian army had been slaughtered and routed, that the king had fled with but few followers, and that all the cities of Macedonia had come under the sway of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On hearing this, shouting with great clapping of hands began; the games were deserted and most of the people took home the glad news to their wives and children. This was the twelfth day after the battle had taken place in Macedonia.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>II. Next day the senate met in the senate-house, a thanksgiving was voted, and a resolution passed that the consul should discharge men whom he had under oath,<note>These men under oath might be volunteers or veterans specially summoned (evocati); Servius, <hi rend="italics">ad Aen.</hi> VIII. 1, describes <hi rend="italics">coniuratio</hi> as a process of enrolling such special soldiers, as contrasted with a regular levy. But the reason for large numbers at this time may be the failure of the consul in Italy to qualify as commander of Roman troops (see below, xii. 12) and the consequent holding at Rome of Roman levies intended for him.</note> except soldiers and sailors, and that the question of dismissing soldiers and sailors should be put when the envoys who had sent the messenger ahead should arrive from the consul Lucius Aemilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the twenty-fifth day of September, about the <pb id="p.253"/>second hour the envoys entered the city,<note>The envoys seem not to have hurried, or to have been delayed by adverse winds in crossing the Adriatic; Paulus went from Brundisium to Phila in eleven days, with a visit to Delphi included, below, xli. 3.</note> and made<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> their way to the forum, drawing after them a huge crowd of people who met them at every point on their way, and proceeded to escort them. The senate happened to be in the senate-house; the consul presented the envoys there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were kept there just long enough to explain how large the king's forces of infantry and cavalry had been, how many thousand of them had been slain and how many captured, with the loss of how few of our men this great slaughter of the enemy had been accomplished, and how hastily the king had fled; it was thought, the envoys said, that he would make for Samothrace; the fleet was ready to pursue, and it would be impossible for him to slip away either by land or sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On being brought before a meeting shortly thereafter, the envoys related the same facts. Joy broke out anew when the consul proclaimed that all sacred buildings should be opened;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> from the meeting, each citizen went of his own accord to offer thanks to the gods, and all over the city the temples of the immortal gods were filled with a huge throng, not only of men, but of women too.</p> 
				<p>The senate was recalled to the senate-house, voted that thanksgiving for the glorious achievement of the consul Lucius Aemilius should be observed for five days at all the banquet-tables of the gods, and ordered sacrifice offered with the larger victims.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The ships which were moored in the Tiber ready and equipped to be sent to Macedonia, if circumstances <pb id="p.255"/>demanded it, were to be put ashore and housed in<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the ship-sheds; the sailors were to be discharged after receiving their year's pay, and with them, all those who had taken the oath before the consul. It was voted to discharge all soldiers who were in Corcyra, at Brundisium, along the Adriatic, or in the territory of Larinum &mdash;for an army had been distributed among all these places, to enable Gaius Licinius to bring aid to his colleague, if the situation demanded it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At a meeting a thanksgiving was proclaimed to the people for the eleventh of October and the four days following.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Illyricum two envoys, Gaius Licinius Nerva and Publius Decius,<note>In XLIV. xxxii. 4, Perpenna is given as the messenger, instead of these two.</note> announced that the army of the Illyrians had been slaughtered, King Gentius was captured, and Illyricum was under the sway of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For this achievement under the leadership and auspices of the praetor Lucius Anicius, the senate voted thanksgiving for three days. The date was proclaimed by the consul as the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth of November.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Some historians<note>Apparently Polybius XXIX. 19 (7); in XLIV. xiv. 8-xv, Livy, following a Roman source, places the embassy a year too early.</note> relate that the ambassadors of the Rhodians, who had not yet been dismissed after the announcement of victory, were summoned to the senate, as if in mockery of their foolish pride, and that there Agepolis, their chief, spoke as follows:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the envoys had been sent by the Rhodians to bring about peace between the Romans and Perseus, since the war between them was the cause of hardship <pb id="p.257"/>and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> injury to all Greece, and of expense and loss to<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the Romans themselves. The good fortune of the Roman people had been kind to the Rhodians in giving them the opportunity, now that the war had been brought to an end by other means, of congratulating the Romans on their glorious victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was the speech of the Rhodian.</p> 
				<p>The answer of the senate was that the Rhodians had sent that embassy through concern neither for the welfare of Greece nor for the outlays of the Roman People, but on behalf of Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For had their concern been as alleged, their envoys should have been sent when Perseus had led his army into Thessaly and for two years was besieging some Greek cities and alarming others with the threat of attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At that time, there had been not a word about peace from the Rhodians. After they had heard that the Romans had overcome the passes and crossed into Macedonia, and that Perseus was surrounded, then the Rhodians sent an embassy for no other purpose than to snatch Perseus from the impending disaster. With this reply, the envoys were dismissed.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As the consul Aemilius Paulus was encamped near Sirae in the Odomantian territory, as was mentioned <pb id="p.259"/>above,<note>The mention of Sirae has been lost at the end of XLIV.</note> despatches from King Perseus were brought<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> to him by three envoys of no rank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When Paulus perceived them in soiled garb and with tears streaming, it is said that he himself wept for the lot of man, since that king who shortly before, discontented with the kingdom of Macedonia, had attacked the Dardanians and Illyrians and summoned the Bastarnae to his aid, had now lost his army, and, stripped of his kingdom and driven to a small island, was a suppliant, protected by the sanctity of a temple, not by his own powers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But after he read <quote>King Perseus to the Consul Paulus, greeting,</quote> the folly of the man who did not realize the state of his fortunes erased all pity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore, although the body of the letter contained entreaties far from royal, yet that embassy was dismissed without an answer and without dispatches.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Perseus understood what title the conquered must forget; therefore other dispatches, sent under his name without title, requested and obtained the sending of certain persons with whom he might discuss the status and the terms of his new lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Three envoys were sent, Publius Lentulus, Aulus Postumius Albinus, and Aulus Antonius. Nothing was accomplished by that embassy, since Perseus clung with all his might to the title of king, while Paulus urged him to entrust himself and all he had to the discretion and mercy of the Roman People.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these negotiations were under way, the fleet of Gnaeus Octavius put in at Samothrace. He too was attempting to entice the king to surrender now by menaces, now by hope, while the threat of force was kept imminent, when a matter brought about either by chance or plan lent him assistance in his <pb id="p.261"/>undertaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Atilius, a prominent young<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> man, noticing that the people of Samothrace were in meeting, requested the magistrates for permission to address the people briefly. Permission being granted, he asked:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><quote>My hosts of Samothrace, is our understanding correct or false that this island is sacred, and all its soil is revered and unprofaned?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When all agreed that it was as sacred as he believed, he said, <quote>Why then has a murderer polluted it, profaned it with the blood of King Eumenes, and although the preamble to every rite warns away from the holy things those whose hands are not pure, why do you yet permit your sanctuary to be defiled by the blood-stained person of a brigand?</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The story how Evander had nearly succeeded in murdering King Eumenes at Delphi<note>Described in XLII. xv-xvi.</note> had been bruited abroad throughout all the cities of Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Consequently, the Samothracians decided that, apart from the fact that they saw that they and their whole island and shrine were in the power of the Romans, the reproach against them was a just one. They sent Theondas, the chief magistrate of their community &mdash;they call him <quote>king</quote> &mdash;to Perseus to announce that Evander the Cretan was being accused of murder;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that there was a court of theirs established by ancestral custom to try those who were alleged to have brought unclean hands within the sacred precincts of the temple; and that if Evander trusted that he was innocent of the capital charge brought against him,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> he should appear to defend himself, whereas, if he dared not entrust himself to the court, he should free the temple of profanation, and provide for his own safety.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><pb id="p.263"/>
				<p>Perseus called Evander aside and said that he by<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> no means advised him to stand trial, for he would have neither a good case nor sufficient influence. (Behind his words was the fear that Evander, if condemned, would reveal the king as the sponsor of the abominable crime.) What was there left, said Perseus, except to die bravely?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Evander made no open refusal, but saying that he preferred to die by poison rather than the steel, he secretly made ready for escape. When this was reported to the king, he feared that the anger of the Samothracians would turn against him, on the ground that he had caused the guilty party to escape punishment; so he ordered Evander killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When this murder had been hastily perpetrated, it suddenly occurred to Perseus that he had beyond doubt taken on himself the guilt of Evander. The latter had wounded Eumenes at Delphi, he had killed Evander at Samothrace; and so two of the most sacred shrines on earth had been profaned with human blood at his sole instigation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He turned aside accusation on this score by bribing Theondas to report to the people that Evander had committed suicide.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However, when he committed this terrible crime against his pre-eminent remaining friend, who had been tested in so many vicissitudes and had been betrayed because he had not betrayed the king, Perseus turned all hearts against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Each one individually deserted to the Romans.</p> 
				<p>By fleeing they forced the king too, left almost alone, to adopt some plan of flight; finally he appealed to Oroandes the Cretan, who knew the coast of Thrace from having made trading voyages there, to take him aboard a scout-ship and carry him <pb id="p.265"/>to Cotys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There is a harbour Demetrium on a<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> certain headland of Samothrace;<note>A temple of Demeter stood there, of. below, sec. 6. The temple is mentioned in I.G. XII. 8. The promontory of Kamariotissa marks the site approximately.</note> the scout-ship was anchored there. At sun-down the needful equipment was carried to the shore; all the money that could be brought secretly was also carried down.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the middle of the night, the king himself with three companions of his flight went by a back door of the house into a garden next to his bedroom and thence, after scrambling with difficulty over a wall, reached the sea.<note>Perseus' wife accompanied him, according to Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxvi, and was one of the causes of delay, being quite unathletic.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Oroandes had waited just long enough for the money to be brought down, and in the early darkness had weighed anchor and was sailing directly for Crete.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the ship was not found at the harbour, Perseus wandered about for some time on the shore and, finally, fearing the imminent approach of dawn, did not dare to return to the house where he was entertained, but took cover near an out-of-the-way corner on one side of the temple.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Among the Macedonians there were Royal Pages,<note>These pages are also described by Curtius VIII. vi. 2.</note> so-called, sons of the chief men chosen to wait upon the king; this troop, having accompanied the king in his flight had not even then left him, until by order of Gnaeus Octavius, announcement was made by a herald that if the Royal
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Pages and the other Macedonians who were in Samothrace surrendered to the Romans, they would secure their safety, their freedom, and all their possessions which they either had with them, or had left in Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At this word, they all made their way to the Romans, and reported their names to Gaius Postumius, a military tribune. The king's young children were also handed over to <pb id="p.267"/>Octavius by Ion of Thessalonica, and no one was left<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> with the king except Philip, his oldest son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then Perseus surrendered himself and his son to Octavius, railing at his fortune and the gods in whose temple he was, who had done nothing to aid their suppliant.<note>Diodorus XXIX. 28 points out that he had forfeited his claim on the gods by his disloyalty toward his brother.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He was ordered to be placed in the flagship, and what was left of the money was brought there. The fleet immediately sailed back to Amphipolis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thence Octavius sent the king to the consul's camp, sending ahead dispatches to inform the consul that the king was a prisoner and was being brought to him.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thinking that this was a second victory, as indeed it was, Paulus offered sacrifice at this message; he read the letter of the praetor before his assembled council, sent Quintus Aelius Tubero<note>The son-in-law of Paulus, according to Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> v.</note> to meet the king, and ordered the others to remain in full numbers at headquarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So great a crowd never gathered elsewhere for any sight. In the previous generation King Syphax<note>His story is told in XXX. xiii.</note> had been brought as prisoner into a Roman camp, but apart from the fact that he was not comparable either as to his own reputation or that of his nation, he was a mere appendage to the war with Carthage, as Gentius was to this one with Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Perseus was the chief enemy, and not only his own reputation and that of his father, grandfather, and the rest to whom he was related by blood and stock made him a cynosure, but the glory of Philip and Alexander the Great, who made the Macedonians masters of the world, radiated <pb id="p.269"/>from him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Perseus entered the camp in dark-coloured<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> garb, with his son, but unattended by any other of his people whose presence as a sharer of his downfall might have made him more pitiable. He was unable to proceed because of the crowd rushing to gaze at him, until lictors were sent by the consul to clear a path to the headquarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul rose to meet him, though he ordered the others to keep their seats, and advancing a few steps offered his hand to the king as he entered, raised him when he fell at his feet, not allowing him to clasp his knees, brought him into the tent, and bade him be seated opposite the officers called as council.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first question put was, by what wrong had he been driven to make war on the Roman People with such determined enmity as to bring himself and his kingdom into utmost danger?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While all awaited an answer, he gazed silently at the ground for a long time and wept.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then the consul asked again: <quote>If you had received the kingdom as a young man, I should indeed be less surprised that you were unaware how powerful the Roman People is as a friend or as an enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As it is, since you had a part in the war which your father waged with us, and since you were aware of the peace that followed, which we observed with the utmost faithfulness toward him, what reasoning led you to prefer war rather than peace with men whose power in war, whose good faith in peace, you had alike tested?</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When no reply either to the question or the accusation was forthcoming, the consul continued, <quote>However that may be, whether it has occurred through human mistake or chance or law of nature, be of good <pb id="p.271"/>cheer. The misfortunes of many kings and of many<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> peoples have shown that the mercy of the Roman People offers you not only hope, but an almost positive assurance of safety.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>This the consul said in Greek to Perseus; then he continued in Latin to his staff: <quote>You see before you a notable example of the changefulness of human affairs. I say this especially for you, young men. Therefore it is proper to offer no insult or violence to anyone, while one is in favourable circumstances, and not to trust to one's present fortune, since no one knows what evening will bring.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He will be truly a man, in a word, whose spirit is neither deflected from its course by the breath of prosperity, nor broken by misfortune.</quote></p> 
				<p>When the meeting was dismissed, the task of guarding the king was assigned to Quintus Aelius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On that day Perseus was entertained by the consul, and every other token of respect was shown him which could be shown under such circumstances.</p> 
				<p>The army was then released to winter quarters. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amphipolis received most of the troops, the nearby cities the rest.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This was the end of the war between the Romans and Perseus, after four years of steady campaigning, and also the end of a kingdom famed over a large part of Europe and all of Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They reckoned Perseus as the twentieth after Caranus, who founded the kingdom.<note>Justinus XXXII. 2. 6 says the thirtieth king, Eusebius (Sch&ouml;ne I, col. 242), the thirty-ninth. Herodotus VIII. 138, names Perdiccas as the founder of the dynasty.</note> Perseus ascended the throne in the consulship of Quintus Fulvius and Lucius Manlius, and was recognized as king by the senate in the consulship of Marcus Junius and Aulus Manlius; his reign lasted eleven years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Macedonian nation was of no great reputation until the time of <pb id="p.273"/>Philip, son of Amyntas. Later, when it had proceeded<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> to expand under him, it was still confined within the bounds of Europe, though embracing all Greece and part of Thrace and Illyricum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thereafter it overflowed into Asia, and Alexander, in the thirteen years of his reign, first brought under his sway all the well-nigh boundless empire that had belonged to the Persians, and then traversed Arabia and India, where the Indian Ocean embraces the uttermost ends of the earth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At that time the empire and name of the Macedonians was greatest on earth;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> thereafter at the death of Alexander it was torn into many kingdoms, as each leader snatched at resources for his own account, and its strength was dismembered; yet it endured for a hundred and fifty years<note>Polybius XXIX. 21 (6c) gives this figure; it was 155 years from the death of Alexander.</note> from the topmost pinnacle of its fortune to its final end.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When a report of the Roman victory penetrated to Asia, Antenor, who was lying off Phanae with his fleet of scout-ships, crossed from there to Cassandria.<note>This naval activity was described in XLIV. xxix. 1-5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When Gaius Popilius, who was at Delos to protect ships making for Macedonia, heard that the war had been brought to an end in Macedonia and that the enemy scout-ships had left their post, he for his part dismissed the ships of Attalus and proceeded to sail for Egypt to complete the mission
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> on which he had started, so that he might be able to meet Antiochus before he reached the walls of Alexandria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As the ambassadors were sailing past Asia and came to Loryma, a harbour slightly more than twenty miles from Rhodes and situated <pb id="p.275"/>exactly opposite to the city,<note>On the peninsula northward from Rhodes; mentioned by Thucydides VIII. 43, and Strabo XIV. ii. 4 and 14 (652, 655).</note> the chief men of Rhodes<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> met them (for the report of the victory had by now been brought to that city also) with the request that they put in at Rhodes;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for, said the Rhodians, it was a matter touching the reputation and safety of their city that the envoys should personally become acquainted with everything which had been done and was being done at Rhodes, and that they should carry back to Rome facts ascertained by themselves, not popular rumours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After many refusals, they induced the envoys to endure a short delay of their voyage for the sake of the safety of an allied city. After their arrival at Rhodes, the same leaders also dragged them by entreaty before an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The arrival of the envoys increased rather than diminished the fear of the city;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for Popilius rehearsed every hostile word or act during this war either on the part of individuals or of the commonwealth, and being a man of harsh temperament,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> he increased the savage effect of his remarks by his grim face and prosecutor's tone, so that, since he had no reason for a personal quarrel with Rhodes, the people guessed from the bitterness of one Roman senator what the attitude of the whole senate was toward them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The speech of Gaius Decimius was milder, for he laid the blame for many of the offences mentioned by Popilius not at the door of the people as a whole, but at that of a few agitators;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> these, he said, whose tongues were for sale, had written the decrees full of fawning upon the king and had sent those embassies concerning which the Rhodians had always felt as much shame as regret. All these acts, said Decimius, would, if the people's reason was sound, recoil upon the heads of the guilty.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><pb id="p.277"/>
				<p>There was great approval felt for his speech, but no<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> more because he relieved the commons of blame than because he assigned responsibility to the guilty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And so when the leaders of the Rhodians answered the Romans, their speeches were by no means as pleasing when the speaker tried at all costs to extenuate the charges made by Popilius, as when he agreed with Decimius in urging that the responsible persons should expiate their wrong. A decree was therefore passed at once that anyone convicted of saying or doing anything against the Romans in behalf of Perseus should be put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Some had left the city on the arrival of the Romans, others committed suicide. After a delay of not more than five days at Rhodes, the ambassadors left for Alexandria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Rhodians proceeded no less zealously to prosecute trials according to the decree passed in the presence of the Romans. This unflagging zeal in carrying the matter out was produced as much by the mildness of Decimius as by the harshness of Popilius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on, Antiochus had left Alexandria after an unsuccessful trial of the fortifications and had taken control of the rest of Egypt. He left at Memphis the elder Ptolemy<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> Ptolemy VI Philometor; the younger was Euergetes II.</note> whose claim to the throne he was pretending to support with his army, in order that he might attack the winner presently, and led his army off into Syria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ptolemy was well aware of this ulterior motive too, and thought that, as long as his younger brother was cowed by fear of a siege, he might be restored to Alexandria <pb id="p.279"/>with the aid of his sister and without opposition on<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the part of his brother's friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He therefore kept sending, first to his sister, then to his brother and his friends, until he made an amicable settlement with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Suspicion was directed against Antiochus because, though he had turned over the rest of Egypt to Ptolemy, he had left a strong garrison at Pelusium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was evident that the key to Egypt was in Antiochus' hands, so that he could reinvade it when he wished. The upshot of a civil war between the brothers would be that the winner, worn out by the struggle, would be no match for Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This wise reasoning by the elder brother was gratefully accepted by the younger brother and his associates; the sister gave much assistance not only by her advice, but by her entreaties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly, peace was made by general agreement, and the elder Ptolemy returned to Alexandria, without opposition even on the part of the mob,<note>Who had proclaimed the younger brother king.</note> which had suffered throughout the war from a scarcity of all supplies not only during the siege, but after the enemy had left the walls, because nothing came in from Egypt.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>It would have been in order for Antiochus to rejoice at this conclusion had he led his army into Egypt for the purpose of restoring Ptolemy &mdash;the specious plea that he had employed in statements to all the states of Asia and Greece either when he received embassies or sent out messages. But he was so incensed that he prepared for war against the two brothers with much more urgency and bitterness than against the one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He immediately sent a fleet to Cyprus; and in early spring<note>Of <date value="-168">168 B.C.</date>; he had made preparations in 171, XLII. xxix. 5; the first invasion was in 170, the reconciliation of the brothers presumably in <date value="-169">169 B.C.</date> Polybius, on whom Livy based this account, records these events in XXVIII. 19-23; XXIX. 23 (8). 26-7 (7a, 11).</note> he himself advanced <pb id="p.281"/>with his army into Hollow Syria on his way to Egypt.<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Near Rhinocolura envoys from Ptolemy met him, offering thanks for his assistance in recovering Ptolemy's ancestral throne and requesting that he should not undo his act of kindness and rather say what he wanted done than shift from ally to enemy and act by force of arms. Antiochus replied that he would recall his fleet and lead back his army on no other terms than the cession to him of all Cyprus, Pelusium, and the region which lies around the Pelusian mouth of the Nile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He also named a day before which he must receive the report of the execution of his terms.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the time allotted for the truce had expired, Antiochus' officers sailed to Pelusium via the mouth of the Nile, while he marched through the Arabian Desert and, after being received by the inhabitants of Memphis and the rest
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of the Egyptians, partly through good-will and partly through fear, he came down to Alexandria by short marches.<note>Antiochus crowned himself king of Egypt, and issued coins in that capacity, see Naphtali Lewis, <hi rend="italics">Classical Philo-</hi> <hi rend="italics">logy</hi> 44 (1949), pp. 32-3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had crossed the river at Eleusis, a place four miles away from Alexandria, the Roman envoys met him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As they approached, he greeted them and offered his hand to Popilius; whereat Popilius handed him the tablets containing the decree of the senate in writing, and bade him read this first of all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On reading the decree, he said that he would call in his friends and consider what he should do; Popilius, in accordance with the usual harshness of his temper, <pb id="p.283"/>drew a circle around the king with a rod that he<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> carried in his hand, and said, <quote>Before you step out of this circle, give me an answer which I may take back to the senate.</quote> After the king had hesitated a moment, struck dumb by so violent an order, he replied, <quote>I shall do what the senate decrees.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Only then did Popilius extend his hand to the king as to an ally and friend.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Later, when Antiochus had quitted Egypt by the appointed day, and the envoys had also confirmed by their own weighty approval the agreement of the brothers, who with great difficulty had settled on terms of peace, the Romans sailed for Cyprus, whence they sent away the fleet of Antiochus which had already defeated the Egyptian ships in battle.<note>According to Polybius XXIX. 27. 10, this victory of Antiochus' forces was on land.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This embassy gained a great reputation among the nations, because Egypt had clearly been taken away from Antiochus after he had possession of it, and their ancestral kingdom had been restored to the House of Ptolemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The term of one of the consuls of this year was distinguished by a notable victory; the reputation of the other was correspondingly undistinguished, because he did not have the wherewithal for achievement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At the very outset, when he proclaimed a day for his legions to assemble, he entered the sacred enclosure<note>Perhaps a special one laid out for this ceremony.</note> without taking the auspices. When the augurs were consulted on this matter, they declared that the day had been wrongfully set.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consul set out for Gaul, and had a fixed camp near Campi Macri<note>Also mentioned above, XLI. xviii. 5-6.</note> close to Mounts Sicimina and Papinus. Later he spent the winter in the same region with <pb id="p.285"/>the allies of the Latin Name; the Roman legions had<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> remained at Rome, because the day for the assembly of the army was wrongfully appointed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The praetors also went to their provinces, except Gaius Papirius Carbo, to whom Sardinia had fallen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The senate decreed that he should conduct at Rome the court for suits between citizens and aliens, for this also had been allotted to him.<note>Anicius, the commander in Illyricum, had first been assigned as <hi rend="italics">praetor peregrinus.</hi> The praetor for Sardinia was often assigned to special tasks (cf. XXXIX. xxxviii. 3; XL. xxxvii. 4; xliii. 2), while his predecessor, in this case P. Fonteius Capito (cf. XLIII. xv. 3), continued in office; see also below, xvi. 4.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Popilius, too, and the embassy which had been sent to Antiochus returned to Rome. They reported that the disputes between the kings had been settled and the army led out of Egypt into Syria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Afterwards the envoys of the kings themselves arrived. Antiochus' envoys reported that to the king peace had seemed preferable to any conquest, since it was the wish of the senate, and that Antiochus had obeyed the orders of the Roman envoys as if they had been gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then they presented congratulations on the victory, to which the king would have contributed his aid, they said, if any demand had been made upon him.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Ptolemy's envoys<note>The embassy was from both Ptolemies, according to Polybius XXX. 16.</note> offered thanks in the names of the king and Cleopatra together;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> they owed, they said, more to the Roman senate and people than to their own parents, more than to the immortal gods, since they had been freed by the Romans from a most wretched state of siege, and had recovered the ancestral kingdom which they had almost lost.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.287"/>
				<p>The senate's reply to Antiochus was that he had<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> done what was right and proper in obeying the envoys, and that the Roman senate and people were pleased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To the king and queen of Egypt, Ptolemy and Cleopatra, the reply was that the senate was very happy if by its agency something good and beneficial had come to pass, and that the senate would use its best efforts to convince them that the greatest bulwark of their reign was founded on the good faith of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Instructions were given to Gaius Papirius the praetor that he should see that the customary presents were sent to the envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Despatches from Macedonia were then introduced, calculated to redouble the rejoicing over the victory; they reported that King Perseus was a prisoner of the consul.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>After the royal embassies were dismissed, a dispute was heard between envoys from Pisa and from Luna.<note>The colony at Luna was established in <date value="-177">177 B.C.</date>, see XLI. xiii. 5. Luna at this time was reckoned as belonging to Cisalpine Gaul, the boundary of Italy proper running between it and Pisa; in earlier times it had been Etruscan.</note> The Pisans complained that Roman colonists were driving them off their land, whereas the men of Luna declared that the land in question had been assigned to them by the board of three.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The senate sent five men to investigate the facts about the boundary and make a decision, namely, Quintus Fabius Buteo, Publius Cornelius Blasio, Titus Sempronius Musca, Lucius Naevius Balbus, and Gaius Apuleius Saturninus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>From the brothers Eumenes, Attalus, and Athenaeus a joint embassy of congratulation on the victory arrived.<note>Perhaps the same as the embassy mentioned below, xix.</note> When Masgaba, too, the son of King Masinissa, landed from his ship at Puteoli, he was met by Lucius Manlius the quaestor who had been sent with money to meet him, to escort him at <pb id="p.289"/>public expense to Rome. On Masgaba's arrival, a<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> meeting of the senate was at once held for him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There the young man spoke so as to make matters pleasing by their nature even more pleasing by his words. He recalled how much infantry and cavalry, how many elephants, and how much grain his father had sent to Macedonia during those four years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He said that there were two matters which brought a blush to his father's cheeks: first, that the senate had requested through envoys what they needed for the war, and had not ordered it, and secondly, that they had sent him money for the grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Masinissa remembered, said his son, that he held a kingdom won by the Roman People, and that they had increased it and made it many times as great; he was satisfied with the usufruct of the kingdom, and knew that the ownership and title to it were vested in those who had given it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Therefore it was right that they should claim what they wished from him, not request it, nor buy the products of his country that sprang from a soil that was their own gift. Masinissa was and would be satisfied with what the Roman People did not need.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> After Masgaba had set out with this message, he said, horsemen had overtaken him to report that Macedonia had been conquered and to bid him congratulate the senate and point out to them that his father was so rejoiced over this event that he wished to come to Rome and offer sacrifice and thanksgiving to Jupiter, Greatest and Best, on the Capitol; he requested permission from the senate to do this, if they had no objection.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The answer was given to the prince that his father Masinissa was acting as was proper for a good and grateful man, in that he attached to payment due <pb id="p.291"/>for kindness such credit and honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the one hand<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the Roman People had profited by his brave and loyal aid in the Punic War, and on the other, he had secured his kingdom through the good will of the Roman People; after this balancing of favours, he had performed every possible act of friendship in wars against three kings successively.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Joy over the victory of the Roman People was not surprising in a king who had linked with the fortunes of the Romans the whole hazard of his personal fortunes and those of his realm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for thanks to the gods for the victory, let him offer them in his own home; his son would serve as his representative at Rome. The son had also offered sufficient congratulations on his own and his father's behalf. That Masinissa himself should leave his kingdom and go outside of Africa, apart from the fact that it was against his own interests, was also contrary to the public welfare of the Roman People, the senate believed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When Masgaba requested that Hanno, son of Hamilcar, be demanded as hostage in place of . .., the answer was given that the senate considered it by no means just to exact hostages from the Carthaginians according to the judgment of Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The quaestor was ordered to buy gifts for the prince, in accordance with a resolution of the senate, to the amount of one hundred pounds of silver, and to escort him to Puteoli, to provide for all his expenses while he was in Italy, and to hire two ships to convey
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> him and his suite to Africa. Garments were presented to all his suite, both free and slave.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Not very much later dispatches were brought from Masinissa's other son Misagenes, stating that he had been sent with his cavalry to Africa by Lucius Paulus <pb id="p.293"/>after the defeat of Perseus, that on his voyage his<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> fleet had been scattered in the Adriatic, and he had arrived in ill heath with three ships at Brundisium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Lucius Stertinius the quaestor was sent to him with the same gifts which had been given at Rome to his brother, and was instructed to see to it that a house for entertainment . . .<note>From Valerius Maximus V. 1. Id, the following matters seem to have been recounted here: the quaestor was to provide for the care of Misagenes, furnish expense-money for him and his suite, and provide ships for the voyage to Africa; also a pound of silver and 500 sesterces apiece were to be given to each cavalryman; Misagenes died. Presumably also the report of the elections, and something about the activity of the censors, prefatory to the following chapter, was included here. Previous activity of the censors was reported in XLIII. xiv-xvi; XLIV. xvi. 8-10. Cf. also the Summary of this book.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Freedmen had been distributed among the four city tribes except for those who had a son over five years old (these they ordered to be reckoned where they
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had been enrolled at the census immediately previous), and those who had an estate or estates in the country valued at over thirty thousand sesterces . . .<note>The lacuna may have contained mention of the country tribes, in which the freedmen with large holdings were allowed.</note> the privilege of enrolling was granted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Although this arrangement had become established in this way, Claudius said that it was impossible for a censor without a decree of the people to deprive any individual of his ballot, let alone a whole class.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For if, said Claudius, the censor could move a man from his tribe, which was exactly what ordering him to change his tribe meant, he could remove him from all thirty-five tribes, that is, deprive him of citizenship and status as a free man-not determine where he should be enrolled but exclude him from enrolment.<note>Claudius appears to be indulging in hyperbole, since the private rights of a free citizen were not in question.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This was argued between the two censors; finally they resorted to the following solution: they drew lots publicly in the Hall of <pb id="p.295"/>Liberty for one of the four city tribes, to which they<note type="margin">B.C. 168</note> would consign all those who had been slaves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The lot of the Esquiline tribe was cast; Tiberius Gracchus announced that they had decided to enrol all freedmen in this tribe.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>This matter was regarded by the senate as greatly to the credit of the censors. Thanks were voted to Sempronius, for having persisted in a praiseworthy undertaking, and to Claudius, for not interfering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> More men were removed from the senate than by former censors, and more also ordered to sell their horses.<note>Previous instances of severity on the part of these censors are recorded in XLIII. xv. 6; xvi. 1; XLIV. xvi. 8.</note> All alike were by both censors removed from their tribe and made <hi rend="italics">aerarii;</hi> nor was the disgrace of anyone who had been blacklisted by the one relieved by the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the censors asked that their term of a year and a half be prolonged in order that they might, as was customary, see to repairs to buildings and inspect the public works for which they had contracted, the request was vetoed by the tribune Gnaeus Tremellius, because he had not been chosen for the senate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>In this same year Gaius Cicereius dedicated a temple to Moneta on the Alban Mount five years after he vowed it.<note>His vow is recorded in XLII. vii. 1; his triumph, on the Alban Mount, in XLII. xxi. 7. Dio Cassius XXXIX. 20, records as a portent that <quote>a small temple of Juno, on a certain table, facing the east, was turned to the north.</quote> Perhaps the curious mention of a table (<hi rend="italics">trapeza</hi>) is an error due to the association of Juno Moneta with monetary matters, of. the monetary associations of <hi rend="italics">trapeze.</hi></note> In this year Lucius Postumius Albinus was consecrated <hi rend="italics">as flamen</hi> of Mars.<note>The death of the previous <hi rend="italics">flamen</hi> is recorded in XLIV. xviii. 7.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the new consuls Quintus Aelius and Marcus Junius<note>Both these consuls were plebeians, as in <date value="-172">172 B.C.</date>, XLII. x. 9. 172 was the first year in which two plebeians were elected, according to the Fasti Capitolini, C.I.L.2 I. i., p. 25.</note> put to the senate the question of provinces, the Fathers voted that Spain should again <pb id="p.297"/>be made two provinces, after having been one during<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> the Macedonian War;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> also that the same officers, Lucius Paulus and Lucius Anicius, should command in Macedonia and Illyricum until on the advice of senatorial envoys they had made a settlement for these states which had been upset by war, and which were to be given a constitution other than monarchical.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the consuls Pisa and Gaul were assigned with two legions apiece, each legion to be composed of five thousand two hundred infantry and four hundred cavalry.<note>The number sounds like the allied cavalry; a reference to Roman cavalry and allied infantry may have been lost. The usual number of Roman cavalry is 300, see XXII. xxxvi. 3; but the number 400 also appears in XXIII. xxxiv. 13 and XL. xxxvi. 8.</note> The assignments for the praetors were: to Quintus Cassius, the City Praetorship; to Manius Juventius Thalna, the jurisdiction over aliens; to Tiberius Claudius Nero, Sicily; to Gnaeus Fulvius, Hither Spain; to Gaius Licinius Nerva, Farther Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Aulus Manlius Torquatus was assigned Sardinia, but was unable to go to his province, since he was held by vote of the senate to preside over trials for capital crimes.<note>Again the new praetor did not go to Sardinia, see above, p. 284, note 1. For similar special inquiries into crime, cf. XL. xliii. 2; XXXIX. xxxviii. 3; xli. 5. For Spain cf. p. 405, note 1.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The question of the prodigies which had been reported was next put to the senate. The temple of the Household Gods on the Velia had been struck by lightning, as well as two gates and a section of wall in the town of Minervium. At Anagnia there had been a rain of earth and at- Lanuvium a meteor had been seen in the sky; and at Calatia on state-owned land Marcus Valerius, a Roman citizen, reported that blood had trickled from his hearth for three days and two nights.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Especially for this last the Board of Ten was ordered to consult the books; they <pb id="p.299"/>proclaimed to the people a single day of prayer and<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> offered a sacrifice of fifty goats in the forum. Because of the other prodigies, another day of prayer was observed at all the banquet-tables of the gods, sacrifice with greater victims was offered, and the city purified.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Another matter concerning the paying of respects to the immortal gods was the senate's decree that, whereas the enemy had been conquered and the kings Perseus and Gentius along with Macedonia and Illyricum were under the sway of the Roman People, therefore the praetors Quintus Cassius and Manius
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Juventius should see to the presentation at all the banquet-tables of the gods of gifts as great as those given in the consulship of Appius Claudius and Marcus Sempronius because of the victory over King Antiochus.<note>These are mentioned in XXXVI. ii. 2-5; the consuls served in <date value="-185">185 B.C.</date></note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ten commissioners for Macedonia and five for Illyricum were then appointed, on whose advice Lucius Paulus and Lucius Anicius might arrange the settlements.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First those for Macedonia were named: Aulus Postumius Luscus and Gaius Claudius, both ex-censors, Quintus Fabius Labeo, Quintus Marcius Philippus, and Gaius Licinius Crassus, who was Paulus' colleague in the consulship and at that time was in charge of Gaul, his term of command having been extended.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To these ex-consuls were added Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, Servius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Junius, Titus Numisius Tarquiniensis, and Aulus Terentius Varro.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For Illyricum the following were named: Publius Aelius Ligus, an exconsul, Gaius Cicereius and Gnaeus Baebius <pb id="p.301"/>Tamphilus (the latter had been praetor the previous year,<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> the former many years before<note>Five years before, see above, xv. 9.</note> ), Publius Terentius Tuscivicanus, and Publius Manilius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Next the consuls were instructed by the Fathers that, since one of them should relieve Gaius Licinius, who had been appointed commissioner, in Gaul, they ought as early as possible either to agree on their provinces or to draw lots. They accordingly drew lots. Pisa fell to Marcus Junius, Gaul to Quintus Aelius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate voted that before Junius went to his field of activity, he should present to the senate the embassies which had assembled in Rome from all quarters to offer congratulations. Moreover, although men were being sent of sufficient calibre to justify the hope that by their advice the generals would establish
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> nothing unworthy of either the mercy or the high position of the Roman People, yet discussions went on in the senate too as to general considerations, so that the commissioners might carry from home to the generals a full outline of policy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>First of all it was voted that the Macedonians and Illyrians should be given their independence, so that it should be clear to all nations that the forces of the Roman People brought not slavery to free peoples, but on the contrary, freedom to the enslaved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate wished nations which were free to consider that their freedom was assured and lasting under the protection of the Roman People, and that those who lived under kings should feel for the time being that their rulers were milder and more just under the eye of the Roman People, and, if at any time their kings should make war on the Roman People, that the outcome of the war would bring victory to the Romans, but freedom to <pb id="p.303"/>themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was also voted to discontinue the<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> leasing of the Macedonian mines, a source of immense revenue, and of rural estates,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> for these could not be farmed without a contractor, and where there was a contractor, there either the ownership by the state lapsed, or no freedom was left to the allied people.<note>The reasoning is perhaps that of Cato, who favoured Macedonian <quote>freedom,</quote> see Spartianus, <hi rend="italics">Hadrian</hi> 5; for the attitude toward the financiers, cf. XXXII. xxvii. 4; XXXIX. xliv. 8-9; XLIII. xvi. Below, xxix. 11, the specific arrangement for the mines is mentioned: gold and silver mining was prohibited, but iron and copper might be worked. The estates were no doubt those of the king.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was impossible, the senate thought, for even the Macedonians to farm these resources; for where there was booty as a prize for administrators, in that state there would never be a lack of reasons for conspiracies and strife.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Finally, fearing that if there were a common legislature for the nation, some relentless demagogue would turn the freedom given in healthy moderation into the licence which brings ruin, the senate voted to divide Macedonia into four sections, so that each might have its own legislature.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was further resolved that Macedonia should pay to the Roman People half the taxes which they had been accustomed to pay to their kings. Like instructions were given for Illyricum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The details were left to the generals and the commissioners themselves, for which the present discussion would lay a surer foundation of planning.<note>From xii. 9 to this point, Livy seems to have followed Roman annalists; he now draws from Polybius XXX. 1-5.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Among the many embassies from kings, nations, and peoples Attalus, the brother of King Eumenes, especially drew to himself the eyes and <pb id="p.305"/>minds of everyone.<note>According to Polybius, the warmth of this reception suggested to Attalus the possibility of supplanting his brother.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For he was received by those<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> who had served with him in this war in much more cordial fashion than if King Eumenes himself had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Two reasons honourable in outward view brought him to Rome, first the congratulations suitable to the recent victory in which he himself had aided, and second, complaint about the uprising of the Galatians and the disaster suffered thereby, which threatened destruction to the kingdom itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Underneath he cherished a secret hope of honours and rewards from the senate which he could hardly accept without disloyalty to his brother. For there were also certain untrustworthy Roman advisers to stimulate his self-seeking with hope;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the view, they said, held in Rome about Attalus and Eumenes was that the former was a sure friend to the Romans, while the latter was a faithful ally neither to the Romans nor to Perseus; accordingly it could hardly be determined whether the senate would be more disposed to grant his requests for himself or those against his brother &mdash;to
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> such an extent did one and all make every concession to the one, but withhold any from the other.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Attalus was, as the facts showed, one of those men who would desire whatever hope might promise; but the wise advice of one friend tightened the reins, as it were, on his spirit elated by success. Stratius, a physician, was with him, sent to Rome by the uneasy Eumenes precisely to keep an eye on the actions of his brother and to give loyal advice, if he saw any failure in loyalty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This Stratius made his approach to ears already filled and a mind already <pb id="p.307"/>tempted, and by offering well-timed remarks won an almost<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> lost cause; his argument was that different kingdoms had thrived on different things;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the kingdom of Pergamum, being new and not bolstered by any longstanding wealth, was founded on brotherly harmony, because one brother wore the name of king and the distinguishing emblem on his head, but all the brothers ruled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As for Attalus, who was second in age, who did not consider him as a king? And not only because one could see that his present powers were so great, but because it was beyond doubt that he would reign before many
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> days had passed, for the weakness and age<note>Eumenes was in his late fifties at this time.</note> of Eumenes pointed in that direction, since he was at that time without issue (for Eumenes had not at that time acknowledged the son who reigned after him<note>This successor, Attalus III, was born shortly before Eumenes' death, and reigned for 21 years under a regency of his uncle Attalus. (See XLII. xvi. 9 and the note, Vol. XII, p. 339, for the view that Attalus III was actually the son of Attalus II). An illegitimate son of Eumenes, Aristonicus, captured the throne after the death of Attalus III, and fought Rome: cf. Summary LIX.</note> ). What use was there, said Stratius,. in seeking by violence a prize which would automatically fall to him shortly?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Furthermore, the kingdom had been assailed by the fresh tempest of the Galatian uprising, which could hardly be withstood by agreement and harmony in the royal family; but if civil strife were added to the foreign war, no halt could be called. What he was considering was simply preventing his brother from dying as king in order to rob himself of his imminent expectation of the throne.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Even if it were true that either action would bring fame, whether he preserved the kingdom for his brother, or snatched it from him, nevertheless praise for preserving the kingdom, coupled as it was with family loyalty, would still be the better choice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But in as much as one <pb id="p.309"/>alternative was in fact despicable and verging on the<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> murder of kin, what remained in doubt to keep judgment in suspense? Was he in doubt whether to seek for part of the kingdom, or to seize it all?
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> If he took part, both parts would be weakened by disruption of forces and without a doubt exposed to every kind of injury; if he took all, would his elder brother become a private citizen, or an exile at his age and with his weakness of body, or would Attalus in the end order his brother's death?
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> To say nothing of the end of disloyal brothers as told in legend, the fate of Perseus seemed to be a notable example, for as he bowed himself down at the feet of a conquering enemy, he had laid aside in the temple of Samothrace, as if the gods had been there exacting his punishment, that crown which he had seized by means of a brother's murder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The very men, said Stratius, who were egging him on, no friends to him, but foes to Eumenes, would praise his loyalty and steadfastness, if he kept faith with his brother to the end.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This reasoning prevailed on the mind of Attalus. On being presented to the senate, therefore, he offered congratulations on the victory; he explained his services during this war, and those of his brother, such as they were, as well as the revolt of the Galatians<note>They were actually independent, but had been warned by Rome to keep the peace, according to XXXVIII. xl. 1; Polybius XXX. 3, also speaks of a <quote>revolt</quote> (<hi rend="italics">aponoia</hi>).</note> which had recently taken place with great disturbance; he requested that the senate should send envoys to the Galatians, to induce them to lay aside their arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having delivered these messages in the interest of his state, he asked for Aenus and Maronea for himself.<note>Polybius says this request was not granted, because Attalus had disappointed the Roman hope that he would break with his brother.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thus, after <pb id="p.311"/>disappointing the hopes of those who had supposed that<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> he would accuse his brother and seek a division of the kingdom, he left the senate-house. Seldom has anyone else, king or citizen, been heard with as much good will and as much general approval; Attalus was honoured with every mark of attention and gift while he was there, and on his departure he was attended with equal ceremony.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Among the many embassies from Asia and Greece, the envoys of the Rhodians especially drew the city's attention.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For they first appeared in white clothes, as was suitable for those offering congratulations &mdash;and had they worn soiled clothes, they might have offered the appearance of men mourning for the fall of Perseus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But not only had the praetor in the first place undertaken the matter in a novel and dangerous fashion, because he
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> was proposing entirely on his own initiative, without previously consulting the senate or notifying the consuls, to put to the people the question, whether it was their will and command that war should be declared against the Rhodians, whereas previously the senate had always been consulted first about war, and then the question brought before the people
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> on the authority of the senate,<note>There was precedent, however, for action by the assembly over senatorial opposition, see XXI. lxiii. 3; XXXVIII. xxxvi. 8, and the note. A constitutional question is involved: war was regularly declared by the centuriate assembly, the oldest and least democratic gathering; but could the praetor summon this assembly, except for judicial purposes? The decision to relieve Messana which opened the First Punic War is a near parallel, though one faction of the senate led the appeal to the commons (Polybius I. 11. 1-3).</note> but the tribunes also were in the same position, since the custom was that no one should veto a law until opportunity was given to private citizens<note>Not excluding magistrates; Livy takes it for granted that they might address a meeting; for examples, see XXXIV. i. 7; v. 1; XLIII. xvi. 8.</note> to argue for and against the law;

In former times, after the defeat of Carthage, when Philip or Antiochus had been subdued, on our arrival in Rome we came from public entertainment to the senate-house to offer you our congratulations, gentlemen of the senate, and from the senate-house we mounted to the Capitol, bearing gifts to your gods.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Surely you are the same Romans who boast that your wars are favoured of Fortune because they are just, nor do you exult as much in the outcome, because you conquer, as in the beginning, because you never undertake war without good cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The siege of Messana in Sicily made the Carthaginians your enemies, the siege of Athens, the attempted enslavement of Greece and the aid given Hannibal in money and troops made Philip your foe.<note>In XXX. xxvi. 2-4, Livy reports grievances of Greece against Philip and a report of Macedonian aid to Carthage (<date value="-203">203 B.C.</date>); he also reports the presence of a Macedonian force at Zama (XXX. xxxiii. 6), though no mention is made of them during the battle; and later (XXX. xlii. 4-9) the ransom of Macedonian prisoners, said to be mercenaries, is discussed. -See also XXXI. i. 10. But Polybius says nothing about this aid from Macedonia; Livy may, then, be quoting Roman rumour. Philip and Hannibal, while opposing Rome, seem to have been suspicious of each other, and each anxious that the other should not profit by the elimination of Rome.</note>

For the result we obtained by sending envoys to both parties concerning peace was that we <pb id="p.321"/>won no favour from either side, but incurred even<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> accusation and danger from one of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Yet Perseus might truly reproach us, as you cannot, gentlemen of the senate, because we sent to you at the beginning of the war envoys to promise you whatever was needed for the war; we would be ready, we said, as in the former wars, with ships, arms, and young men for every demand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The obstacle to our furnishing these things was of your making, since you for whatever reason spurned our aid at that time.<note>The story of this offer, and of the dismissal of the Rhodians as soon as they appeared at the Roman naval station, is told in XLII. xlv; lvi. 6; and Polybius XXVII. 7(6).</note> Neither therefore have we in any way acted as enemies, nor have we failed in the duty of good allies, but we were prevented from performing that duty by you.

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I shall not pass over the most serious charge against our city in this war: we sent envoys at the same time both to you and to Perseus on the subject of peace;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> this unhappy plan, through a madman, as we heard later, who was spokesman, became something extremely stupid, for he spoke, it is well known, as the Roman envoy Gaius Popilius might have spoken, whom you sent to turn back from war Kings Antiochus and Ptolemy.

						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> You are no more hostile to them than is our state itself, and because they knew this, many of them have either fled or committed suicide; others who have been found guilty by us will be placed in your hands, gentlemen of the senate.

						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> You have waged wars against three kings during these years; let not our slackness in one war be, to our hurt, of more importance than the fact that we fought on your side in two wars.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Take account of Philip, Antiochus, and Perseus as if of the vote of three judges; two acquit us, the third is undecided; suppose that it is for our condemnation; even so, if the Kings were judging us, we should indeed lose our case, but your judgment, gentlemen of the senate, determines whether Rhodes shall exist on earth or shall be destroyed root and branch.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Following a speech to this effect all the envoys again cast themselves down in the posture of suppliants, waving their olive-branches; after some time they were made to rise and left the senate-house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then the roll-call of opinions began. The chief enemies of the Rhodians were those who had been conducting the war in Macedonia as consuls, praetors, or staff-officers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Great aid to the cause of Rhodes was given by Marcus Porcius Cato, who, though of a harsh temperament, on this occasion played the part of a tolerant and mild senator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I shall not include here a pale wraith of this eloquent man by reporting what he said; his own speech is <pb id="p.331"/>preserved in written form, as part of the fifth book of<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> his <quote>Beginnings.</quote><note>Small parts of this speech are reported by Gellius VI (VII) 3, especially 35. 37. 50, where arguments appear which Livy puts into the mouth of the Rhodian. Cato was an antiimperialist, at least as to expansion eastward, which involved contact with what he regarded as the debilitating culture of Greece, so that his attitude in this matter was sincere, not a pose.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The reply to the Rhodians was couched in such form that they were neither declared enemies nor continued to be allies.</p> 
				<p>Philocrates and Astymedes were the leaders of this embassy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was decided that some of them with Philocrates should report to Rhodes about the embassy, while some remained at Rome with Astymedes to keep track of what was being done and inform their people. For the time being orders were given that they should withdraw their governors from Lycia and Caria by a certain date.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These actions were reported at Rhodes; of themselves they would have been grievous, but were turned into a cause for rejoicing, because the Rhodians were relieved of fear of a greater evil, since they had feared war. So they immediately voted a crown of twenty thousand gold pieces. They sent Theodotus,<note>Frequently mentioned by Polybius as a pro-Roman, <hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> XXVII. 14 (11), where the name is given as Theaedetus.</note> the admiral of their fleet, on this embassy. They wanted to ask the Romans for an alliance in such fashion that no decree of the people concerning it should be passed or committed to dispatches, because if they did not obtain their request, the disgrace of an open repulse would be greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The admiral of the fleet alone had the right to negotiate for such a purpose without the passing of any enabling resolution.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>For the Rhodians had for all these years<note>Polybius XXX. 5. 6 says 140 years; the first embassy from Rhodes recorded by Livy in the extant text is over 100 years later, in <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date>, XXXI. ii. 1.</note> maintained their friendship in such a way as not to bind themselves to the Romans by any treaty of alliance, <pb id="p.333"/>precisely for the purpose of not cutting off hope on<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> the part of the kings that they would come to their aid, if need arose, as well as their own hope of reaping a harvest from the good will and good fortune of the kings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At this time they felt that they should by all means seek an alliance, not to protect themselves against other peoples, for they feared no one but the Romans, but to alleviate the Romans' suspicion of themselves.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>At about the same time the Caunians revolted from them, and Mylassa seized the towns of the Euromenses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The spirit of Rhodes was not so broken that they did not perceive that if Lycia and Caria were taken away by the Romans, and the rest of their possessions either freed themselves by revolt or were seized by the neighbours, they would be hemmed in by the shores of a small island of infertile soil, which could by no means support the population of so large a city. Troops were therefore promptly sent and the Caunians compelled to accept their rule, even though forces of Cibyra were called in by the Caunians.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> meanwhile, after taking King Gentius into custody, as previously related,

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After putting these men in charge of Illyricum, Anicius marched into Epirus with the rest of his army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In that region, Phanote the first city surrendered to him, all its population coming

					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Antino&uuml;s and Theodotus were the leading-men of this city, distinguished both by their

					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> defection of the whole people from the Romans.<note>Polybius 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>15 (13) and XXX. 7 says that at the outset of the war, the Epirote leaders, including Antino&uuml;s and the Cephalus mentioned below, wished to keep out of the war, though maintaining their alliance with Rome; but Charops the younger, by traducing them to Rome, compelled them to declare for Perseus in order to avoid arrest by the Romans.</note> Because of their feeling of personal guilt, since there was no hope of pardon for them, these men shut the gates, in order to be buried in the general downfall of their city, and urged the people to prefer death to slavery. No one dared open his mouth against such all-powerful men. At last a certain Theodotus, a youth of equal rank, spoke out, his dread of the Romans outweighing his timidity before the chief men of his city.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/><quote>What is this madness,</quote> said he, <quote>which is goading you, that you make the state an accessory to the crime of two men?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Certainly I have often heard tales of those who met death for the fatherland; but these are the first ever known to believe that the fatherland ought to die for them. Why do we not <pb id="p.337"/>open our gates and accept the overlordship which<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> the world has accepted?</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the crowd concurred with these remarks, Antino&uuml;s and Theodotus charged into the first outpost of the enemy and, exposing themselves to wounds, were there killed; the city was surrendered to the Romans. By similar obstinacy on the part of Cephalus, the leading citizen, Tecmon was closed, but when he was killed, it was recovered by surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Neither Phylace nor Horreum stood up against attack. When order had been established in Epirus, and the troops distributed in winter quarters among suitable cities, Anicius returned to Illyricum, summoned the chief men from all his theatre of operations, and held a conference at Scodra, where the five commissioners from Rome had arrived. There he announced as officer in charge, on the advice of his council, that the Roman senate and people gave the Illyrians their freedom; he would remove his garrisons from all towns, citadels, and forts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only freedom, but tax-exemption as well would be granted, he said, to the people of Issa and Taulantia, and to the Pirustae among the Dassaretii as well as to Rhizon and Olcinium, because they had gone over to the Romans while Gentius was still undefeated. The Daorsi would also be granted tax-exemption, because they had abandoned Caravantius and gone over with their arms to the Romans. On the people of Scodra, the Dassarenses, the Selepitani, and the rest of the Illyrians a tax was laid of half what they had paid to the king. Next, Anicius divided Illyricum into three parts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He made the first of these the region above Pista, the second all the Labeatae, and the third the Agravonitae, Rhizon <pb id="p.339"/>and Olcinium and their neighbours. After<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> announcing this charter for Illyricum, Anicius returned from there into Epirus to his winter-quarters at Passaron.</p> 
				<p>XXVII. While these events were occurring in Illyricum, Paulus sent his son Quintus Maximus, who had by this time returned from Rome, to sack Aeginium and Agassae before the arrival of the ten commissioners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the case of Agassae, the reason was that, although they had surrendered their city to the consul Marcius with a voluntary request for alliance with Rome, they had again gone over to Perseus. The fault of Aeginium was recent; because they did not believe the rumour about the Roman victory, they had cruelly treated as enemies certain soldiers who had entered their city.<note>This seems to be another version, or another phase, of the episode recorded in XLIV. xlvi. 3; if, as seems likely, Aeginium was in north-western Thessaly, its adherence to Perseus was more of a fault; but Paulus seems to have been looking for reasons which would justify the acquisition of plunder by the army. If, as Livy's arrangement implies, but does not make certain, these events occurred a year after the fall of Perseus, the justification for them is thin. Assuming this time interval, however, we may suppose that the arrangements of the senate (xvii. 1) were made with the benefit of advice from Paulus, and that Paulus' sightseeing mentioned below was more in order than it would have been soon after the battle of Pydna.</note> Paulus also sent Lucius Postumius to sack the city of Aenia, because they had maintained resistance more stubbornly than the neighbouring cities.</p> 
				<p>It was about the season of autumn; Paulus decided to employ the beginning of this season travelling about Greece and seeing the sights which are made so famous by repute that they are greater by hearsay than by visual acquaintance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Putting Gaius Sulpicius Gallus in charge of the camp, he set out with no large escort, his son Scipio and Athenaeus, the brother of King Eumenes, serving as his personal aides. He went through Thessaly to Delphi, the <pb id="p.341"/>famous oracular shrine. There he offered sacrifice<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> to Apollo, and when he saw the columns which had been begun at the entrance, on which they were going to place statues of King Perseus, he reserved them for his own statues as conqueror.<note>Polybius XXX. 10. 2 (14) reports the statues of Paulus as actually erected.</note> At Lebadia also he visited the shrine of Jupiter Trophonius;<note>The identification of the oracular hero Trophonius with Zeus seems to be unofficial, though Strabo IX. ii. 38 (p. 414) also makes it. A description of the sanctuary, including the shrine of Hercynna, a nymph of a spring and stream, is given by Pausanias IX. xxxix.</note> there he viewed the mouth of the cave through which those who use the oracle go down to make their inquiries of the gods, and offered sacrifice to Jupiter and Hercynna, whose temple is there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Paulus then went down to Chalcis to see the spectacle of the Euripus and of that great island Euboea which is joined by a bridge to the mainland. From Chalcis he crossed to Aulis, three miles away, with its harbour famous as the anchorage once upon a time for the thousand ships<note>The ships enumerated in Homer's Catalogue are 1186; but the round number appears in Aeschylus, Vergil, and other poets before Marlowe.</note> of Agamemnon's fleet, and its temple of Diana, where the renowned king of kings sought passage to Troy for his ships by bringing his daughter as a victim to the altar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thence Paulus went to Oropus in Attica, where an ancient prophet is worshipped as a god, and there is an old temple made charming by springs and streams around it.<note>The <quote>ancient prophet</quote> was Amphiara&uuml;s, of the Seven against Thebes. His sanctuary was established, according to archaeological evidence, near the end of the fifth century, and became a modest spa, which was favoured by the Romans; in <date value="-73">73 B.C.</date>, Amphiara&uuml;s was officially recognized as a god by the consuls, with Cicero's assistance, and his lands were therefore tax-exempt, see Pausanias I. xxxiv and Fraser's note.</note> Thence he went to Athens, which is also replete with ancient glory, but nevertheless has many notable sights, the Acropolis, the harbours, the walls joining Piraeus to the city, the shipyards, the monuments of great <pb id="p.343"/>generals, and the statues of gods and men &mdash;statues<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> notable for every sort of material and artistry.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After offering sacrifice to Minerva, the Guardian of the Citadel,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> Athena Polias, or Poliouchos; Livy gives her the same title in XXXI. xxx. 9.</note> in Athens, Paulus set out for Corinth and reached it on the second day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The city was then world-famous before its destruction; its citadel and the Isthmus were also sights to see; the citadel rising to a huge height, enclosed by the city wall and flowing with springs, while the Isthmus separated by its narrow passage two neighbouring seas lying toward the sunrise and sunset.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thence Paulus went to Sicyon and Argos, both famous cities; from there he visited Epidaurus, by no means as wealthy a town, but noted for the famous temple of Aesculapius which, at a distance of five miles from the city, is now rich in the traces of gifts of which it has been robbed,<note>Perhaps by Sulla (Pausanias IX. vii. 5), who took the temple-treasures for his soldiers, and reimbursed the god with lands in Boeotia.</note> but then was rich in the gifts themselves which the sick had consecrated to the god as payment for health-giving remedies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Next he visited Lacedaemon, notable not for the splendour of its buildings, but for its discipline and institutions; from there he went up to Olympia via Megalopolis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At Olympia he saw many sights which he considered worth seeing; but he was stirred to the quick as he gazed on what seemed Jupiter's very self.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Therefore he ordered a sacrifice prepared larger than usual, just as if he had been going to sacrifice on the Capitol.</p> 
				<p>In this way he travelled through Greece, raising no question as to how either any individual or any state had felt about the war with Perseus, so as not to <pb id="p.345"/>trouble the minds of the allies by any fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> he was returning to Demetrias, he met a crowd of Aetolians in mourning; on his asking in surprise what was the matter, it was reported to him that five hundred and fifty leading men had been killed by Lyciscus and Tisippus, while the senate was surrounded by Roman soldiers sent by Aulus Baebius, the commander of the garrison; others had been driven into exile, and the property of those killed and of the exiles had been seized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Ordering the accused men to meet him at Amphipolis, he joined Gnaeus Octavius in Demetrias. When a report arrived that the ten commissioners had by now crossed the sea, he gave up everything else and went to them at Apollonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There Perseus came to meet him from Amphipolis &mdash;a. day's journey &mdash;free of any guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Paulus greeted him in kindly fashion but after he arrived in camp at Amphipolis, he is said to have rebuked Gaius Sulpicius severely, first because he had allowed Perseus to roam so far from him through the province, and secondly because he had allowed the soldiers the great liberty of stripping the city walls of tiles, in order to roof over their winter-quarters; Paulus ordered the tiles taken back and the uncovered areas repaired to their previous condition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Perseus and his elder son Philip he turned over to Aulus Postumius and put under guard; Perseus' daughter and his younger son he summoned to Amphipolis from Samothrace and maintained completely in the state of free persons.</p> <pb id="p.347"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the day arrived on which he had<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> ordered ten leading men from each city<note>Typical Roman procedure; so ten leading men are summoned from some Latin colonies in XXIX. xv. 5; the Twelve Tables were also established by a board of ten.</note> to be at Amphipolis, and all official despatches which had been filed anywhere and the royal money to be brought in, Paulus with the ten commissioners took his official seat surrounded by the whole crowd of Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although the latter were used to a royal court, yet the ceremonial of a new master was frightening as it met their eyes &mdash;the consul's bench, his entrance after the way had been cleared, the herald, and the orderly, all things novel to their eyes and ears, which might have inspired terror in allies, to say nothing of conquered enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the herald had commanded silence Paulus announced in Latin the decisions of the senate, as well as his own, made by the advice of his council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This announcement was translated into Greek and repeated by Gnaeus Octavius the praetor &mdash;for he too was present.</p> 
				<p>The terms were: first of all the Macedonians were given their freedom; they were to keep their own cities and lands, to use their own laws, and to elect annual magistrates; they were to pay to the Roman People half the tax which they had paid to their kings.<note>Amounting to 100 talents, according to Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxviii. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next, Macedonia was to be divided into four regions; one, the first section, would comprise the land between the Strymon and Nessus Rivers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> to this region were to be added across the Nessus to the eastward the villages, forts, and towns which Perseus had held except Aenus, Maronea, and Abdera; on this side of the Strymon, too, toward the west there was included all the country of the Bisaltae, including Heraclea, called Sintice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The second region was to be the region bounded on the east by the Strymon River, except <pb id="p.349"/>for Heraclea Sintice, and the Bisaltae, while the<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> western boundary would be the Axius River; this would also include the Paeonians who were settled near the Axius River in an easterly direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The third region was established as that bounded on the east by the Axius, and on the west by the Pene&uuml;s River;<note>What river is meant cannot be definitely determined; the famous Pene&uuml;s of Thessaly is too far south to be even the southern boundary, except at the sea-coast; but since Mount Bora is north-west rather than north of this region, Livy or his informant may have a distorted impression of the limits.</note> to the north Mount Bora forms a barrier; to this region was added that part of Paeonia which stretches along the west bank of the Axius River; Edessa and Beroea fell in the same part. The fourth region was across Mount Bora, part marching with Illyricum, the rest with Epirus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The capitals of the regions, where their assemblies were to meet, were established: for the first region, Amphipolis, for the second, Thessalonica, for the third, Pella, and for the fourth, Pelagonia.<note>This is usually the name of a region, not a city; perhaps Heraclea Lyncestis is meant; it would be appropriately central.</note> In those places Paulus ordered an assembly<note>Perhaps modelled after that of the Achaean League; if not formally restricted to men with a property qualification, it would become so, except for the populace of the capital itself.</note> of each region to be appointed, money to be gathered, and magistrates elected.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Paulus then announced that it had been decided that no one should be allowed the right of marriage or of trading in land or buildings outside the bounds of his own region. Furthermore, the mines of gold and silver were not to be worked, but those of iron and copper were permitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The tax on those who worked the mines was set at half what they had paid to the king. The use of imported salt was banned.<note>Perhaps as a further ban on frequent communication between the regions.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the Dardanians asked for the return of Paeonia, on the ground that it had been theirs and adjoined <pb id="p.351"/>their boundaries, Paulus proclaimed that freedom was<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> being given to all those who had been subjects of Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After refusing them Paeonia, he granted them the right to import salt; he ordered the third region to carry salt to Stobi in Paeonia, and he set a price on it. He forbade the Macedonians to cut ship-timbers, or to permit others to do so.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The regions which bordered on barbarians &mdash;and this was true of all except the third &mdash;were allowed to have armed guards along their frontiers.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The announcement of these arrangements on the first day of the gathering aroused mixed emotions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The unexpected grant of freedom cheered men, as well as the lightening of the annual taxation; but to those who were cut off from trading between regions, their country seemed as mangled as an animal disjointed into parts, each of which needed the other; so unaware were the Macedonians themselves of the size of Macedonia, of how it lent itself to division, and of how self-sufficient each part was.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The assets of the first region are the Bisaltae, men of great courage (they live beyond the Nessus and around the Strymon), soil suitable for many different crops, mines, and the strategic position of Amphipolis, the interposition of which bars off every approach to Macedonia from the sunrise side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The second region has those highly flourishing cities Thessalonica and Cassandrea, and in addition, Pallene, a fertile and fruitful land; facilities for seafaring are also furnished it by the harbours at Torone, Mount Athos, Aenea, and Acanthus, some of which conveniently face Thessaly and the island of <pb id="p.353"/>Euboea, and others the Hellespont.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The third<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> region has the famous cities of Edessa, Beroea, and Pella, and the warlike race of the Vettii, as well as a large population of Gauls and Illyrians, who are industrious farmers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fourth region is inhabited by the Eordaei, Lyncestae, and Pelagonians; added to these are Atintania, Tymphaeis, and Elimiotis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This part of the world is as a whole cold, difficult to cultivate, and harsh; it has inhabitants of temperament like their land. These are also made fiercer by their barbarian neighbours, who now give them training in warfare, now intermingle their practices during peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The partition of Macedonia therefore showed, by separating the assets of the regions, how great the country is as a whole.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the proclamation of the charter for Macedonia, Paulus declared that he would also lay down a law-code,<note>Since the Macedonians were to <quote>use their own laws</quote> (above, xxix. 4), this must refer to a code for the four federal governments, either new or a revision of previous laws to meet the new arrangements and incorporate the Roman stipulations; cf. below, xxxii. 7.</note> and then proceeded to summon the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In this investigation, the question was more which side had favoured the king and which the Romans, than which had done wrong or had been wronged; the assassins were acquitted of guilt; the exile of the expelled was confirmed quite as definitely as the death of the slain; only Aulus Baebius was condemned for furnishing Roman soldiers to help carry out the slaughter.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This outcome of the case of the Aetolians raised to an unbearable pitch of pride the spirits of those in all the states and peoples of Greece who sided with the Romans, and crushed helplessly under their feet any who were in some respect tainted by suspicion of having favoured the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were three sorts of <pb id="p.355"/>leaders in the states, two groups who by fawning<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> upon the Roman power and the friendship of kings respectively gained personal wealth for themselves by tyrannizing over their cities; the middle group alone, opposing both the others, strove to guard independence and constitutionality.<note>Polybius XXX. 6 names three groups, but only of those accused of being anti-Roman; his first group, corresponding to Livy's third, or middle-of-the-road group, wanted the status quo undisturbed; the second wanted a decisive contest between Rome and Perseus, with victory for Perseus; the third group shared the sentiments of the second, and in addition were able to draw their states into open alliance with Perseus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their reward was greater affection from their own people, and less favour in foreign quarters. Carried along on the tide of Roman success, the members of the pro- Roman party were then alone occupying all magistracies and serving as envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These gathered in great numbers both from the Peloponnesus and Boeotia and the other leagues of Greece, and filled the ears of the ten commissioners, saying that not only those who out
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> of vanity openly boasted themselves guests and friends of Perseus, but many more who kept under cover, had sided with the king, and under the guise of preserving independence they had turned the whole organization of the league meetings against the Roman interest;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> these peoples, said their representatives, would not maintain loyalty unless the spirit of the opposition was crushed and the prestige sustained and strengthened of those who had no object in view but the power of Rome.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Names were furnished by these men, and their opponents from Aetolia, Acarnania, Epirus, and Boeotia were summoned by dispatches from the general to follow him to Rome to stand trial.<note>According to Polybius XXX. 13 (10). 11, Paulus did not take the accusations at face-value.</note> Two <pb id="p.357"/>of the board of commissioners, Gaius Claudius and<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> Gnaeus Domitius, set out for Achaia in order to summon men by proclamation on the spot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This they did for two reasons, first because they thought the Achaeans had more confidence and more pride to make them refuse obedience and perhaps also Callicrates and the other informers and purveyors of charges might be endangered;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the second reason for the personal summons was that from the other leagues they had letters of the leaders that had been seized in the royal archives, but no letters from the Achaeans had been found and the charge against them was blind.</p> 
				<p>When the Aetolians had been dismissed, the Acarnanian League was called up. No changes were made concerning them, except that Leucas was removed from the Acarnanian federation.<note>This was a serious matter, however; the town had sometimes served as the meeting-place of the league assembly. The Romans were taking control of the coast.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In the course of more sweeping inquiries as to support of the king, either individual or by political
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> units, the investigation was extended to Asia, and Labeo was sent to destroy Antissa on the island of Lesbos and to move its inhabitants to Methymna, because when Antenor, the king's admiral, had been roaming about Lesbos with his scout-ships, the people of Antissa had received him into their harbour and aided him with provisions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Two men of distinction were beheaded by the consul, Andronicus, son of Andronicus, an Aetolian, because following his father
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> he had borne arms against the Roman People, and Neon of Thebes, who had induced his people to make an alliance with Perseus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the interruption due to these investigations of other
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> peoples, the assembly of the Macedonians was again convened. Concerning the <pb id="p.359"/>constitution of Macedonia it was announced that<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> senators, whom they call <hi rend="italics">synhedri,</hi> were to be chosen, by whose advice affairs of state<note>In each of the four districts.</note> were to be conducted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The names were read of the Macedonian leaders who, it had been decided, were to precede the consul on the way to Italy with their sons of over fifteen years of age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This ordinance, cruel at first glance, soon was seen by the commons of Macedonia to have been enacted in the interests of their freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the names were those of the king's friends and the wearers of the purple, of commanders of armies, of officers in command of ships and garrisons-men accustomed to being humble slaves of the king, but haughty tyrants toward others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some were exceedingly rich, others equalled in expenditure those whose fortunes they could not match;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> all of them used the diet and garments of the court, none had the temperament of a citizen, or would endure the rule of law and the give-and-take of free men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> All, therefore, who had held some office under the king, even those who had served as ambassadors, were ordered to leave Macedonia and travel to Italy; death was the penalty announced for disobedience to this order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Paulus laid down laws for Macedonia with such care as to seem to be giving them not to conquered enemies, but to well-deserving allies &mdash;laws
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> which not even experience over along period, the one best amender of legislation, could prove faulty in actual use.<note>Justinus 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>2. 7, says that these laws <quote>are still in use</quote>, <hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi> in the time of Trogus (first century after Christ), or possibly in that of Justinus himself (second century).</note></p> 
				<p>After the serious business,<note>Livy does not mention the destruction of the fortifications of Demetrias, one of the three <quote>fetters of Greece</quote>, recorded by Diodorus XXXI. 13.</note> Paulus celebrated with great pomp at Amphipolis a festival which had been long under preparation, and to announce which he had sent men to the cities and the kings of Asia, while he himself had given notice to the leading men <pb id="p.361"/>during his tour of the Greek cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For a crowd of<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> all sorts of professionals in the art of entertainment gathered from all over the world, as well as athletes and famous horses;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> moreover there were delegations with sacrifices,<note>What the Greeks called <hi rend="italics">theoriai-official</hi> representatives of their states, who participated by offering sacrifices.</note> and whatever more is usually done at the great games of Greece for the sake of gods or men, was so carried out as to arouse admiration not only for lavishness but for skill in giving shows, at which Romans were then tyros. Banquets for the delegations were also prepared with equal sumptuousness and pains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From mouth to mouth went the saying of Paulus himself, that the man who knew how to conquer in war could also arrange a banquet and organize games.</p> 
				<p>XXXIII. After the festival had been held and the bronze shields loaded into ships, the rest of the arms of all kinds were piled up into a great heap, and the general, after prayer to Mars, Minerva, Mother Lua,<note>Consort or companion of Saturn, she was a destructive power to be placated, cf. VIII. i. 6 and the note, and perhaps Servius on <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi> III. 139 (<hi rend="italics">Luae</hi> emended from <hi rend="italics">Lunae</hi>).</note> and the other gods to whom it is right and lawful to dedicate the spoils of the enemy, with his own hands put the torch to the pile; then each of the military tribunes as they stood round about tossed in fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In that great gathering of Europe and Asia, when such a crowd had assembled partly to offer congratulations and partly for the display, and in the presence of such forces naval and military, a remarkable fact was that supplies were so abundant and grain so cheap that both to individuals and to cities and peoples abundant gifts of such supplies were made by the general, not only for immediate use, but to be taken home with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The eyes of <pb id="p.363"/>the crowd which came were no more drawn to the<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> stage spectacle, the contests of men, or the racing of the horses, than to the collected loot of Macedonia, set out on exhibition, statues, paintings, rare
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> stuffs, and vessels made of gold, silver, bronze and ivory, manufactured with great pains in the palace at Pella, so as to serve not only for immediate show, as did the objects with which the palace at Alexandria was crammed, but for continuous use.<note>A similar triumphal display is recorded in XXVI. xxi. 7-8 (from Syracuse); and the Romans' interest in looted art is expressed in XXXII. xvi. 17 (Chalcis) and XXXVIII. ix. 13 (Ambracia).</note> This booty was loaded on the fleet and given to Gnaeus Octavius to transport to Rome.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After a courteous farewell to the delegates, Paulus crossed the Strymon and pitched camp a mile from Amphipolis; thence he set out for Pella and arrived on the fifth day. Passing by the city to what is called the Pellaeum, he halted for two days, and sent his son Quintus Maximus and Publius Nasica with a portion of the troops to ravage Illyrians who had helped Perseus in the war, ordering the expedition to meet him at Oricum; the consul himself made for Epirus and reached Passaron on the fifteenth day.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not far from here was the camp of Anicius. Paulus sent him despatches, so that there should be no disturbance over what was about to take place, saying that the senate had granted to Paulus' army the booty from those cities of Epirus which had deserted to Perseus. The consul sent centurions to the several cities, who were to say that they had come to remove the garrisons so that the people of Epirus might be free like the Macedonians; ten leading men from each city were summoned to the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These men were instructed <pb id="p.365"/>to have the gold and silver collected at the civic<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then cohorts were sent to all the cities, those bound for the more distant leaving before those for the nearer, so that they would arrive at all the towns on the same day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tribunes and centurions had been instructed as to their mission. Early in the day all the gold and silver was collected; at the fourth hour the soldiers were given the signal to plunder the towns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So great was the booty that a distribution was made of four hundred denarii apiece to the cavalry, and two hundred apiece to the infantry,<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxix. 3, says that only 11 drachmas per soldier were realized, that is, about 13 denarii; this would explain the dissatisfaction of the soldiers mentioned below, but implies a serious and improbable miscalculation on the part of Paulus. In xxx. 1, Plutarch apologizes for Paulus in respect to this action, which is charged to the senate.</note> and one-hundred and fifty thousand persons were removed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The walls of the plundered cities were destroyed; the number of communities was about seventy. All the booty was sold, and from the proceeds the amounts given above were paid to the army.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Paulus went down to the sea at Oricum, having by no means met the expectations of the soldiers, as he had supposed he would; the men were complaining that they had no share in the booty from the king, as if they had fought no campaign in Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On finding at Oricum the troops he had sent with Scipio Nasica and his son Maximus, Paulus embarked his army on ships and crossed to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A few days later Anicius, after waiting for the ships which the army of Macedonia had used, crossed to Italy, first holding an assembly of the remaining Epirotes and Acarnanians, and ordering the leaders, judgment about whom he had reserved for the senate, to follow him to Italy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><pb id="p.367"/>
				<p>While these events were occurring in Macedonia<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> and Epirus, the commissioners who had been sent with Attalus to put an end to the war between the Galatians and King Eumenes, arrived in Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A truce had been declared for the winter; the Galatians on their side had returned to their homes, and the king had gone into winter-quarters at Pergamum and was ill with a serious disease. Early spring called the Galatians into the field, and they had by this time reached Synnada; Eumenes had mustered an army from all sides at Sardis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At that city the Romans learned that Solovettius the Galatian leader was at Synnada, and decided to go there to confer with him; Attalus set out with them, but it was decided that he should not enter the camp of the Galatians, lest tempers be lost during an altercation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Publius Licinius, an ex-consul,<note>Head of this embassy (Polybius XXX. 3) and consul 4 years before, XLII. xxix. 1. Polybius implies that the embassy was not really meant to restrain the Galatians, as shown by the actual results.</note> talked with the prince of the Galatians and reported that he had been emboldened by the appeal to him, so that it was occasion for wonder that the words of Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> envoys had had such weight with those prosperous kings Antiochus and Ptolemy that they at once made peace, whereas with the Galatians Roman words were without effect.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Rome first the captive kings, Perseus and Gentius, were placed in custody with their children, next the horde of other prisoners, and after them the Macedonians who had been ordered to come to Rome, and the leaders of Greece, for these men

Ptolemy sent him instead to Rhodes, but Polyaratus jumped ship at Phaselis, in eastern Lycia, and again at Caunus; then he took refuge at Cibyra, but was finally rounded up and taken to Rome.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After a few days, Paulus himself sailed up the Tiber to the city in a royal galley of immense size, which was driven by sixteen banks of oars,<note>Perhaps the one left to Philip by the treaty of <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date>: XXXIII. xxx. 5.</note> and decorated with the spoils of Macedonia, not only splendid armour, but also royal fabrics. The banks were lined with the crowd which had poured out to welcome him. A few days later Anicius and Octavius arrived aboard their fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A triumph was decreed to all three commanders by the senate, and Quintus Cassius the praetor was assigned the task of arranging with the tribunes of the commons that they should propose to the commons, on motion of the senate, a resolution that the commanders should keep their authority of office on the day on which they rode into the city in triumph.<note>A similar provision for Marcellus' ovation over Syracuse is recorded in XXVI. xxi. 5. For the voting of a triumph over the refusal of the senate, see III. lxiii. 8-11 and the note.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Moderate circumstances are unassailed by envy; that passion always aims at the heights. There was no debate over the triumphs for Anicius and Octavius; but defamation attacked Paulus, to whom the others themselves would have blushed to compare themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had held the soldiers to old-fashioned discipline; he had given them less of the booty than they had hoped for from such lavish royal resources, though had he given rein to their greed, they would have left nothing to be deposited in the public treasury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The whole army of Macedonia, angered at their general, were prepared to be slack in attending the assembly for passing the law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But Servius Sulpicius Galba, who had been military tribune of the <pb id="p.371"/>second legion in Macedonia, and was personally<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> hostile to the general, had egged on the men to appear for voting in full numbers, by buttonholing the men himself and urging them through the soldiers of his legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Let them, said Sulpicius, avenge themselves on their domineering and stingy leader by voting down the proposal concerning his triumph; the city commons would follow the opinion of the soldiers. Paulus had been unable to give them money; but the rank and file were able to award honours. Let him not look for a harvest of gratitude where he had not earned it.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the urging of Sulpicius. When Tiberius Sempronius, tribune of the commons, proposed this resolution on the Capitol, and opportunity was given to citizens to speak concerning the law, hardly anyone came forward to urge passage, since the case seemed quite clear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Suddenly Servius Galba came forward and asked of the tribunes, inasmuch as it was now the eighth hour of the day, and time would not serve for him to show cause why they should not allow Lucius Aemilius to celebrate a triumph, that they should adjourn to the following day, and bring the matter up early, because he needed a full day to present his arguments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the tribunes ordered him to say what he wished on that day, he prolonged the meeting till nightfall with his speaking, recalling and reminding them of the harsh enforcement of military duties; more toil and more danger had been imposed, he said, than the situation demanded; on the other hand, rewards and honours had been without exception restricted; and military service, if success attended this sort of leadership, would be more dreadful and full of hardships in <pb id="p.373"/>wartime, and after victory would moreover be left without<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> funds or honours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The fate of the Macedonians was preferable, said Galba, to that of the Roman soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If they turned out in large numbers on the next day to reject the law, men with authority would be made aware that not everything was under the control of the leader, but something also under that of the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Roused by these utterances, the soldiers next day filled the Capitol with such a crowd that no one else could approach to cast his vote.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the first tribes<note>Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxxi. 1 says that the vote of the first tribe gave the signal for the protest of the senators.</note> called within the enclosure voted against the law, the leaders of the state hastened to gather on the Capitol, crying out that it was an unworthy action to rob Lucius Paulus of his triumph when he had won so great a war; the generals were being helplessly subjected to the insubordination and greed of their men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Even now wrong action was all too often taken for the sake of currying favour; what would happen if soldiers were made the masters of their generals? Each man hurled reproaches on his own score against Galba.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>When this uproar had at last been calmed, Marcus Servilius, who had been consul and master of the horse, requested of the tribunes that they should conduct this balloting anew, and give him an opportunity to speak to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After the tribunes had retired to consider the proposal, overborne by the influence of the leading men, they began to repeat the proceedings, and announced that they would call the same tribes again, once Marcus Servilius and other citizens who wished to speak, had had their say.</p> <pb id="p.375"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then Servilius said: "If it were impossible,<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> fellow-citizens, to determine from anything else how great a general Lucius Aemilius has shown himself to be this one criterion would have sufficed -that although he had in camp such mutinous and unreliable soldiers, as well as a personal enemy of such high rank, so rash, and so eloquent a rabble-rouser, yet Paulus had no breach of discipline in his army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The same strictness of command which now they hate at that time restrained them. Consequently, being kept under old-fashioned discipline, they neither said nor did anything mutinous.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>"As for Servius Galba, if he wished by accusing Lucius Paulus to put his apprenticeship behind him and offer proof of his skill as an orator,<note>Galba became a noted orator, cf. Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi> xxi. 82 and xxii. 86.</note> he should not have interfered with the triumph, which the senate had adjudged to be proper, to say nothing of other considerations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Rather on the day after the triumph was celebrated, when he would see Paulus a private citizen, he should bring accusation and question him according to law,<note>This latter refers to an arraignment of the accused, at which the <quote>question</quote> was whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty.</note> or a little later, when Galba entered upon his first public office, he should summon his enemy to trial and accuse him before the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus there would accrue to Lucius Paulus not only the triumph which is the due reward for his success in gloriously conducting the war, but also punishment, if he had done anything unworthy of his laurels, both new and old.</p> <pb id="p.377"/>
				<p>"But, if you please, Galba wished to tarnish the<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> praises of the man to whom he could ascribe no crime, no guilt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Yesterday he asked for a full day in which to accuse Lucius Paulus; actually he squandered in speaking four hours, all that was left of the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What defendant was ever so guilty that the faults in his life could not be expounded in all those hours? What did Galba say in this time which Lucius Paulus would want to deny, if he were on trial? Let someone, pray, call two meetings for a moment, one of the army of Macedonia, the other unprejudiced and of judgment less impaired by partisanship or hate, a meeting of the whole Roman people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>"Let the defendant be brought first before the meeting in mufti &mdash;the civilians. What would you say before the citizen-body of Rome, Servius Galba?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For all your speech of yesterday would be cut short: 'You were posted on guard too strictly and watchfully; the sentries were inspected too severely and too frequently; you got more work done than formerly, because the general himself was going the rounds to see that it was done; on the same day you made a march and went from the march out to battle;<note>Actually the soldiers had called for battle, and Paulus had refused it, XLIV. xxxvi. 3.</note> even when you had won the battle he did not let you rest &mdash;he led you at once in pursuit of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Although he might have made you rich by dividing the spoil, he is planning to carry the royal treasure in his triumph and deposit it in the treasury.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These statements, though they have a certain sting to provoke the temper of the soldiers, who think that Paulus has catered too little to their lack of discipline and their greed, would just as surely have had no <pb id="p.379"/>power to move the Roman people; for even though<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> the people should not recall the old stories which they heard from their fathers of disasters suffered
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> because generals courted popularity, and of victories won by strictness of command, yet the people surely remember the late Punic War, and what a difference there was between Marcus Minucius the master of horse, and Quintus Fabius Maximus the dictator. And so it would have been clear that the accuser could not open his mouth, and that a defence of Paulus was superfluous.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>"Let us pass over to the other meeting;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and I think I will not address you as 'Citizens,' but as 'Soldiers,' in case this title may at least bring a blush to your cheeks, and instill some scruple against maltreating your general.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Indeed the state of my own feelings is different, when I picture myself speaking before the army, than it was previously, when my speech was directed toward the people of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For what do you mean, soldiers? Is there anyone in Rome except Perseus who does not want the triumph over Macedonia to be celebrated? And are you not ready to tear such an objector to pieces with the same hands with which you conquered the Macedonians? He who prevents you from entering the city in triumph would have prevented you from winning the victory, had he been able.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> You are wrong, soldiers, if you suppose that a triumph is an honour only to the general, and not also to the soldiers and to the Roman People as a whole.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is not the glory of Paulus alone which is at stake in this matter.</p> <pb id="p.381"/>
				<p>"Furthermore, many who did not secure a triumph<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> from the senate celebrated their triumph on the Alban Mount. No one can deprive Lucius Paulus of the glory of bringing the Macedonian war to an end any more than he can deprive Gaius Lutatius of credit for the First Punic War, or Publius Cornelius of that for the Second, or the others who have more recently celebrated triumphs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A triumph will make Lucius Paulus neither greater nor less as a general;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> rather it is the reputation of the soldiers and that of the Roman People as a whole which is at stake in this matter, in the first place that Rome may not gain a reputation for a jealous and ungrateful spirit toward her most distinguished citizens, and seem in this respect to be imitating the people of Athens who in their envy buffet their leading men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Enough of a crime was committed by your ancestors against Camillus &mdash;though they wronged him before his recovery of the city from the Gauls; enough was done by yourselves against Publius Africanus. Let us blush that the home and abode of the conqueror of Africa was at Liternum, and that it is at Liternum that his tomb is displayed.<note>Cf. XXXVIII. liii. 8 and lvi. 3, where Livy says he is following Valerius Antias.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Let Lucius Paulus rival these men in glory, but let him not be their equal in suffering injustice at your hands.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>"Let therefore this disgrace be in the first place blotted out &mdash;a disgrace odious before other peoples, and harmful to ourselves. For who would want to emulate either Africanus or Paulus in a city so ungrateful and so hostile to excellence?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If there were no question of disgrace, and only glory were at stake, what possible triumph does not embody the glory of the Roman name which we all share?
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Are the many triumphs which have been celebrated over the Gauls, <pb id="p.383"/>over the Spaniards, over the Carthaginians spoken of<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> as pertaining merely to the generals themselves, or to the Roman People? Just as triumphs are celebrated, not merely over Pyrrhus or Hannibal, but over the people of Epirus or Carthage, so not Manius Curius or Publius Cornelius alone,<note>There is a reference to the victory of Curius in Summary XIV; Scipio's triumph is mentioned in XXX. xlv.</note> but the Romans celebrated the triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Soldiers indeed are directly interested in the matter, for they too are crowned with laurel, while each man is adorned with the decorations he has been given; they parade through the city invoking the spirit of Triumph by name and singing their own praises and those of their general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If on some occasion the soldiers are not brought back from the field for the triumph, they grumble; and yet even on such an occasion they believe that they are included in the triumph, though absent, because the victory has been won by their hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> If someone should ask you, soldiers, for what purpose you were transported to Italy, and were not dismissed at once when your mission had been completed, if he should ask why you had come to Rome in complete military units, why you were lingering here and were not dispersing, each to his own home, what would you answer but that you wished to be seen celebrating your triumph? Certainly you yourselves ought to have wanted to make a public appearance as conquerors.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Triumphs have been celebrated in recent years over Philip, the father of this king, and over Antiochus; both were still on the throne when the triumph was celebrated. Shall no triumph be celebrated over Perseus, who was taken prisoner and brought with his children to Rome?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nay, if while the other commanders were mounting the Capitol in <pb id="p.385"/>the chariot, arrayed in their gold and purple, from<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> below them Lucius Paulus, a lone citizen in the crowd of civilians, should ask them, ' Lucius Anicius, Gnaeus Octavius, do you consider yourselves more worthy of a triumph, or me? ' they would, I believe, yield him their place in the chariot and for very shame hand their regalia over to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Do you prefer, fellow-citizens, to have Gentius rather than Perseus led in a triumph, and the celebration to be made for an appendage to the war rather than for the war itself?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The legions from Illyricum will also enter the city crowned with laurel, and so will the sailors; shall the legions of Macedonia witness the triumphs of others after their own has been cancelled?

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Shall they be carried to the treasury by night as if stolen? And what is more &mdash;that greatest of shows, royal prisoner of highest birth and greatest riches &mdash;where shall he be displayed to the people who have gained the victory?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Many of us can recall what crowds were drawn by the sight of King Syphax as prisoner, an appendage to the war with Carthage. Shall our prisoner King Perseus, shall the king's sons, Philip and Alexander, names of such potency, &mdash;shall they be removed from the sight of the commonwealth?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lucius Paulus himself, twice consul, conqueror of Greece &mdash;all eyes are eager to behold him entering the city in his chariot; to this end we made him consul, <pb id="p.387"/>that he might bring to an end the war which to<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> nothing less than our great shame had dragged on through four years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he was allotted this field of operations, when he left home, we marked him for victory and triumph with minds that read the future; and shall we deny him a triumph when he has won his victory?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nay more &mdash;shall we rob not only Paulus, but even the gods, of the honour that belongs to them? For it is to the gods too, not only to men, that we owe a triumph.<note>Elsewhere (XXVI. xxi. 3; XXXI. xlviii. 12) Livy makes use of the argument that thanksgivings must be followed by a triumph.</note> Your ancestors made the gods their starting-point in every important enterprise, and likewise resorted to them at the conclusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When consul or praetor, his lictors in their military dress, sets out for his field of action and to war, he proclaims his vows upon the Capitol; when war has ended in victory, he returns in triumph to the same gods on the same Capitol, and brings them the well-earned gifts, as he promised them in his vows.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> No small part of a triumphal procession is formed by the sacrificial animals going ahead, which make it clear that the general is returning with thanksgiving to the gods for success on behalf of the commonwealth.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The total of all the captured gold and silver which was carried in the procession was one hundred and twenty million sesterces, according to the account of Valerius Antias; no doubt a somewhat larger total than this is made up from the number of wagons and the weights of gold and silver in various forms which are mentioned by this same author.<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxxii, mentions 750 vessels, each containing three talents of coined silver.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As much again was either expended in the late war, or scattered during the flight, when Perseus was making for Samothrace, according to the historians; and this fact is the more marvellous, because this huge sum of money was accumulated within thirty years after Philip's war with the Romans, partly from the output of the mines, and partly from other revenues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philip therefore began his war against Rome when he was rather ill-supplied with funds, but Perseus, when he was very rich.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Paulus himself came last in his chariot, showing a magnificent presence not only because of the general dignity of his bearing, but because of his advanced age as well. After the chariot came his two sons, Quintus Maximus and Publius Scipio, among other distinguished men; then came the cavalry by troops, and the units of infantry, rank by rank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Each infantryman received one hundred denarii, each centurion, twice the amount, and each cavalryman, <pb id="p.393"/>three times as much. It is thought that double the<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> amount would have been given to the infantry, and proportionately to the rest, if they had supported Paulus' triumph in the voting, or had cheerfully applauded the announcement of the gift as actually given.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But Perseus was not the only testimony at this time to the state of human fortunes, as he was led in chains before the chariot of his conqueror through the city of his enemies; the conqueror Paulus, in the splendour of his gold and purple, was no less a witness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For of the two sons whom he kept at home as the only heirs of his name, his family rites, and his household, after he had given two other sons to be adopted,<note>See above, XLIV. xxxv. 14 and the note; Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius</hi> xxxv.</note> the younger boy, aged about twelve, died five days before the triumph, and the elder, fourteen years old, died three days after the festivity.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>A few days after these transactions, envoys came from Cotys, King of Thrace, bringing money to ransom his son and the other hostages.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While recollections of the Macedonian triumph remained not only in people's minds, but almost before their eyes, Lucius Anicius celebrated his triumph over King Gentius and the Illyrians on the festival of Quirinus.<note>February 17.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Men saw in each detail a resemblance, but no equality. The commander himself was the lesser, both in public esteem, as an Anicius compared with an Aemilius, and in rank of office, a praetor rather than a consul. Gentius could not be compared to Perseus, the Illyrians to the Macedonians, nor the spoils of the one to those of the other, nor the moneys, nor the gifts to the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But though accordingly the previous triumph outshone this one, yet it was also clear to those who contemplated this one on its merits that it was by no means to be scorned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Within a few days Anicius had overcome the Illyrian people, bold on both land and sea, and confident in their terrain and their fortifications; he had captured the king and all the royal family.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In his triumph he bore through the city many military standards and other booty, as well as the royal furniture, twenty-seven pounds of gold, nineteen pounds of silver, thirteen thousand denarii, and <pb id="p.403"/>one hundred and twenty thousand Illyrian silver-pieces.<note>Probably the <hi rend="italics">victoriati,</hi> of 53 grains, which the Romans later imitated for use about the Adriatic, cf. XLI. xiii. 7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> Before the chariot were led King Gentius with his wife and children, Caravantius the king's brother, and several prominent
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Illyrians. Anicius gave from the booty to each soldier forty-five denarii, double the amount to each centurion, and three times as much to the cavalry; the allies of the Latin Name received as much as the Romans, and the sailors as much as the soldiers. The soldiery followed this triumph in better spirits, and the leader was the subject of many
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> songs. Twenty million sesterces was realized from this booty, according to Antias, besides the gold and silver delivered to the treasury; since it was not clear to me from what source this amount could be derived, I have quoted an historian instead of stating a fact.</p> 
				<p>King Gentius with his wife, his children, and his brother, was taken to Spoletium for safe-keeping, in accordance with a decree of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> senate. The other prisoners were thrown into the prison at Rome. When the people of Spoletium refused to take custody, the royal family was transferred to
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Iguvium. There remained from the Illyrian booty two hundred and twenty scout-ships; as prizes taken from King Gentius they were presented to the people of Corcyra, Apollonia, and Dyrrhachium by Quintus Cassius, in accordance with a decree of the senate.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In that year the consuls merely ravaged the fields of the Ligurians, since the enemy never led out their forces. Without accomplishing anything worthy of note, the consuls returned to Rome to attend to the election of their successors, and on the first day of the elections, declared Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Gaius Sulpicius Gallus elected as consuls. On the next day there were elected as <pb id="p.405"/>praetors Lucius Julius, Lucius Apuleius Saturninus,<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> Aulus Licinius Nerva, Publius Rutilius Calvus, Publius Quinctilius Varus, and Marcus Fonteius.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was an intercalation in this year; the day after the Terminalia was the first day of the intercalary month.<note>See XLIII. xi. 13 and the note on the need at this time for frequent intercalation. This intercalary month began on what would ordinarily have been the twenty-fourth of February.</note> An augur died this year, Gaius Claudius; in his place, the augurs chose Titus Quinctius Flamininus.

				<p>In this year King Prusias came to Rome with his son
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nicomedes. Entering the city with a large train, he proceeded from the gate to the Forum and the judgment-seat of Quintus Cassius the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> praetor. A crowd gathered from all sides; Prusias announced that he had come to bring greetings to the gods who inhabited the city of Rome, and to the senate and the Roman People, and to congratulate them on their victory over King Perseus and King Gentius, and on the extension of their empire by placing the Macedonians and Illyrians under their
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> sway. When the praetor offered to call a session of the senate for him on that very day, if he pleased, Prusias asked for a two-day interval, during which he might visit the temples of the gods, the city, and his friends and
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> guest-friends. There was assigned to him as escort Lucius Cornelius Scipio the quaestor, who had also <pb id="p.407"/>been sent to Capua to meet him; and a house was<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> rented for him, where he and his suite might be well entertained.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>On the third day following, he approached the senate; he offered congratulations on the victory; he recited his services in the war; and he requested permission to fulfill a vow of ten full-grown victims at Rome in the Capitol and one at Praeneste to Fortune. This vow, he said, was for the victory of Rome; and he asked that the alliance with him should be renewed, and that the land taken from King Antiochus, which had been assigned to no one by the Roman People and was being held by Galatians, should be given to
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> him. Last of all, he placed his son Nicomedes under the protection of the senate.</p> 
				<p>He was aided by the good-will of all those who had been commanders in
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Macedonia. Consequently all but one of his requests were granted; as to the land, the answer was that envoys would be sent to look the matter over; if this land belonged to the Roman People and had been assigned to no one, they would consider Prusias most worthy of receiving it as a
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> gift; if, on the other hand, it was shown not to have belonged to Antiochus, and therefore not to have come into the possession of the Roman People, or that it had been presented to the Galatians, then Prusias must pardon the Roman People, if they were unwilling to wrong anyone in the process of making him a
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> present. A gift, said the senate, could not be pleasing even to the recipient, if he knew that the giver would take it away again whenever he
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> pleased. The senate accepted the commission to protect his son Nicomedes. How great was the care with which <pb id="p.409"/>the Roman People guarded the sons of kings was<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> shown, said the senate, by the case of Ptolemy, King of
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Egypt.</p> 
				<p>With this answer, Prusias was dismissed. Gifts were ordered given him of a value of . . .<note>The amount has been lost from the MS.</note> sesterces, and silver vessels of fifty pounds'
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> weight. It was also voted to give to Prince Nicomedes gifts to the same amount as had been given to Masgaba, the son of King Masinissa. It was further voted that the victims and other requisites for sacrifice should be furnished at public expense to the king, just as to Roman magistrates, whether he wished to sacrifice at Rome or
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Praeneste. Also twenty war-vessels from the fleet at Brundisium were to be assigned to his
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> use; until the king should reach the fleet presented to him, Lucius Cornelius Scipio was to escort him uninterruptedly, and to provide for the expenses of the king and his suite, until he boarded ship.</p> 
				<p>They say that the king was wonderfully pleased with this expression of good-will toward himself on the part of the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> People. He refused to have gifts bought for himself, but instructed his son to accept the gift of the Roman People. Such is the account of Prusias given by Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> writers. Polybius reports<note>XXX. 18 (19. 16).</note> that this king was unworthy of the dignity of so high a title; that he was accustomed to meet envoys with his head shaved, while he wore a freedman's cap and called himself the freedman of the Roman People, giving this as his reason for wearing the emblem of this
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> class. Polybius further says that when Prusias entered the senate-house at Rome, he fell down and kissed the threshold of the <pb id="p.411"/>senatehouse, hailed the senate as his saviour-gods,<note>This title (Soter) was adopted by several Hellenistic rulers, notably Ptolemy the First.</note> and<note type="margin">B.C. 167</note> indulged in further speech which conveyed more disgrace to himself than honour to his hearers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>After remaining in the vicinity of Rome no more than thirty days, he set out for his kingdom, and . . .<note>A few lines are missing in the MS. at the end of this book.

				<p>PERSEUS was captured by Aemilius Paulus in Samothrace. When Antiochus, king of Syria, was besieging
					Ptolemy and Cleopatra, the rulers of Egypt, envoys were
					sent to him by the senate to bid him withdraw from the
					king's land. When the message was delivered, he
					answered that he would consider what he would do,
					whereupon Popilius, one of the envoys, drew a circle
					around the king with his rod, and ordered him to give
					an answer before he left the circle. By this harshness,
					Popilius induced Antiochus to give up the war. Embassies of peoples and kings offering congratulations were
					received by the senate; that of the Rhodians, whose
					sympathies had been against the Roman People in that
					war, was shut out. On the following day, when the
					question of declaring war against them was under discussion, the envoys pleaded the cause of their country in
					the senate. They were sent away neither as allies nor as
					enemies. After Macedonia had been organized as a province, Aemilius Paulus celebrated his triumph, although
					his own soldiers strove against it because of too little booty,
					and Servius Sulpicius Galba spoke against it. Perseus
					and his three children were led before the chariot. Paulus'
					enjoyment of this triumph was not unalloyed, but was
					marked by the funerals of his two sons. The death of the
					first preceded his father's triumph, that of the other
					followed it.</p>
				<p>The end of the <hi rend="italics">lustrum</hi> was marked by the censors;
					312,805 citizens were counted.<note>The account of this is lost between chs. xiv. and xv.</note> King Prusias of Bithynia came to Rome to offer his thanks to the senate for the
					victory secured over the Macedonians, and entrusted his
					son Nicomedes to the care of the senate. The king, full
					of flattery, used to call himself the freedman of the
					Roman People.</p>

					<p>The intercalary month regularly began after Feb. 23,
						and consisted of 22 or 23 days, to which were added
						the last five days of February.</p>
					<p>The usual arrangement of the year, established
						according to legend under Numa (Livy I. xix. 6) and
						actually perhaps at the establishment of the republic
						(cf. the <quote>restoration</quote> mentioned by Dionysius,
						<hi rend="italics">Roman Antiquities</hi> III. 36. 4), called for a regular
						moon-year of 355 days, with intercalation of 22 and
						23 days, alternately, every second year. (The
						number of days in the year thus ran 355,377,355,378,
						etc.) A cycle of 24 years was observed, in the
						twentieth year of which the intercalary month had
						only 22 days, not 23, while in the twenty-fourth
						year, the intercalary month was omitted. Thus the
						average error of one day a year in the ordinary
						succession of regular and intercalary years was
						corrected at the end of the 24-year cycle (cf.
						Macrobius I. 13. 13-21).</p>
					<p>This calendar appears to have been in order in
						211-<date value="-10">10 B.C.</date> (cf. Livy XXVII. iv. 1). In <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date>, on
						the other hand, there was an error of 125 days
						(cf. XXXVII. iv. 4 and the note, Vol. X, pp. 300-1).
						An explanation suggested by Unger, Iwan M&uuml;ller's
						Handbuch, Vol. I, 1886, pp. 634-42, who has been
						followed in this note as a whole, is as follows: In
						<date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>, owing to the terror inspired by Hasdrubal's
						invasion of Italy, a change to a sun-year of 365 days
						<pb id="p.88"/>
						was planned in honour of Apollo, cf. the procession<note type="margin">A.U.C. 585</note> in his honour described in XXVII. xxxvii, end, which
						also propitiated Juno the Queen (as moon-goddess?
						-cf. C.I.L. 5, i, 3233 (Verona): IUN(oni) LUN(ae)
						REG(inae) SACR.-a dedication of a freedman, of
						imperial date). Intercalations were accordingly
						omitted till <date value="-192">192 B.C.</date> (cf. Macrobius I. 14, <quote>there was
							a time when all intercalations were omitted for a
							religious reason-propter superstitionem</quote>), but the
						novelty of adding ten days to the standard year
						was also omitted after its first occurrence. We must
						assume that a cycle-end fell within the period of
						fourteen years, so that one intercalation would
						normally have been omitted, leaving six which were
						dropped because of the new arrangement. Six
						intercalations = 135 days, less ten extra days in
						<date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> = 125 days lost from account. In <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date>
						the consul Acilius Glabrio sponsored a law which
						gave the pontiffs a free hand to regulate intercalation
						(Macrobius I. 13. 21), probably to secure the gradual
						correction of the error. The intercalation of the year
						169 may well have been an extraordinary one, as
						well as that of <date value="-167">167 B.C.</date> (XLV. xliv. 3), thus arousing
						the special interest reflected by Livy's mention of
						these events, for he does not mention all the intercalations which must have occurred. The calendar
						could have been corrected by about <date value="-163">163 B.C.</date></p>
