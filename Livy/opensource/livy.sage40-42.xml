				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
					<p>AT least two-thirds of this volume is the
						work of Professor Sage. At the time of his
						death he had prepared the text of Books XL&mdash;XLII
						complete, and had carried the translation through
						ch. xxi. of Book XLII. The General Editors and
						the new editor of this volume have not found it
						necessary to revise the text; in the translation,
						the latter part of which was a first draft, the
						phrasing has been at times altered, and a
						few additional notes to Book XLII supplied.
						Doctor Adalaide J. Wegner, colleague and collaborator of Professor Sage, has kindly supplied
						numerous notes, textual and factual, which were
						planned by Professor Sage but not incorporated
						in his draft of the whole. Beginning with ch. xxii.
						of Book XLII, the new editor has supplied the
						translation and its notes. He regrets his inability
						to furnish such a lucid introductory sketch as
						Professor Sage put at the beginning of his previous volumes. The maps, place-lists for which
						were compiled by the new editor, are intended to
						illustrate every geographical reference in the
						text which allows of graphic treatment; a list of
						peoples and places which cannot be located, except
						for the hints given by Livy, is offered with the
						maps. Kiepert's <hi rend="italics">Atlas antiquus</hi> has been used in
						<pb id="p.viii"/>
						preparing these maps. Kiepert has been followed
						exactly, except that the Maedi are placed farther
						to the north-east than he shows them. The names
						with question-marks are those not given by
						Kiepert; the degree of doubt indicated by the
						question-mark is sometimes slight, but the following are highly conjectural: in Italy, Mutila; in
						Greece, Astraeum, Gitana, the Paroria, Tripolis
						Scaea; on the general map, the Balari and Ilienses
						can only be placed in the mountains of Sardinia,
						probably to the north, and occupy more map-space than they did territory. The map of Rome
						is taken from O. Richter, <hi rend="italics">Topographie der Stadt</hi>
						<hi rend="italics">Rom,</hi> M&uuml;nchen, Beck, 1901 (Iwan M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italics">Handbuch,</hi> III, 3), by kind permission of the publishers.
						The buildings with a question-mark can only be
						placed in the general vicinity indicated, as is done
						in the Richter text. Two Spanish towns on the
						unplaced list are sometimes placed in Farther
						Spain, Aebura being interpreted as Ebora in
						Lusitania, and Certima, as Cartima on the southern
						coast; Munda, according to this interpretation,
						is the site of Caesar's victory in the south. This
						theory assumes an error on Livy's part in placing
						the campaigns described in XL. xxx.&mdash;xxxiii. and
						xlvii.&mdash;l; both editors prefer to hold to the
						manuscript text.</p>
					<p>The following was written by Professor Sage:</p>
					<p>In this volume the textual problem becomes
						more acute since Books XLI&mdash;XLV are preserved,
						and that not entire, in only one manuscript V
						(Codex Vindobonensis Lat. 15). This manuscript,
						belonging to either the end of the fifth century or
						the beginning of the sixth, has suffered serious
						<pb id="p.ix"/>
						losses. In its original form it probably contained
						the entire fifth decade, since the subscription to
						Book XLV now reads <quote>titi livi ab urbe condita
							lib. XLV exp. inc. lib. XLVI feliciter.</quote> The loss
						of the five last books must have occurred before
						the eighth century, for the signature of Theubertus, an eighth-century bishop, appears at the
						close of Book XLV where the manuscript now
						ends. Before the eighth century the first quater
						nion and folios 1 and 8 of quaternions XXX and
						XXXIV were lost. The other losses to the
						manuscript, with the exception of the second
						quaternion, occurred between the time of Theubertus and 1531, when Grynaeus brought out the
						first edition of these books (ed. Frobeniana 1531).
						Some time between 1531 and 1669 the second
						quaternion, containing the text from XLI. 1&mdash;
						XLI. 9. 10 (edic) was lost.</p>
					<p>Critical notes have been supplied upon those
						passages where it has been necessary to use the
						restorations and conjectures of sixteenth-century
						scholars. The apparatus of Giarratano (<hi rend="italics">Titi Livi
							Ab Urbe Condita Libri XLI&mdash;XLV,</hi> Rome 1933)
						furnishes additional suggestions for these passages.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the following year the<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> consuls and praetors drew lots for their provinces. For the consuls there was no province to be decreed except the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The civil jurisdiction fell to Marcus Ogulnius Gallus, that between citizens and aliens to Marcus Valerius, Nearer Spain to Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, Farther Spain to Publius Manlius, Sicily to Lucius Caecilius Denter, Sardima to Gaius Terentius Istra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls were directed to conduct the levies. Quintus Fabius had written from the Ligurian country that the Apuani were meditating rebellion and that there was danger that they would invade the territory of Pisa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As to the Spains also, they knew that the nearer province was in arms and that there was war with the Celtiberians; in the farther province, because the praetor had long been sick, they knew that military discipline had grown slack from easy living and idleness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For these reasons it was determined to enlist new armies, four legions for service against the Ligurians, each to consist of fifty-two hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry, and, in addition thereto, fifteen <pb id="p.5"/>thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry of the<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> allies of the Latin confederacy. These were to be the two consular armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In addition, they were ordered to enlist seven thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry of the allies of the Latin confederacy and to send them to Marcus Marcellus in Gaul, his <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> having been prolonged after his consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were also directed to enroll troops which were to be conducted to the two Spains, four thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry of Roman citizens and of the allies seven thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Also the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Quintus Fabius Labeo among the Ligurians, along with the army which he had, was extended for a year.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The spring was stormy that year. The day before the Parilia,<note>The festival of Pales, a shepherd-divinity, celebrated on April 21, the birthday of Rome.</note> about noon, a heavy storm accompanied by wind came and caused damage to many places sacred and profane, overthrew bronze statues on the Capitoline, tore a door from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> temple of Luna which is on the Aventine, carried it to the rear walls of the temple of Ceres<note>This temple was near the Circus Maximus.</note> and fastened it there, blew down other statues in the Circus Maximus, together with the columns on which they rested, and violently tore loose from their tops the roofs of a number of temples and scattered them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore this storm was turned into a prodigy, and the <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> ordered atonement to be made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the same time atonement was made because news had come from Reate that a mule with three feet had been born and from Formiae<note>It seems unnecessary to assume a lacuna. The two towns were close together and the actual message may have come from Formiae, which was on the main highway.</note> that the temple of Apollo at Caieta had been struck by lightning. By <pb id="p.7"/>reason of these prodigies a sacrifice of twenty<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> fullgrown victims was offered and one day of prayer celebrated.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>During this period it was learned from dispatches from Aulus Terentius the propraetor that Publius Sempronius had died in the farther province after an illness of more than a year. For this reason the praetors were directed to set out earlier for Spain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Then embassies from overseas were introduced into the senate, first those of the kings, Eumenes and Pharnaces,<note>King of Pontus.</note> and of the Rhodians, who were complaining of the slaughter of the people of Sinop&ecirc;.<note>Sinop&ecirc; had been conquered by Pharnaces and her Rhodian allies had undertaken the embassy in her behalf. Sinop&ecirc; had not previously been thought of as within the Roman sphere of interest in Asia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ambassadors from Philip also and from the Achaeans and Lacedaemonians arrived about the same time. After first hearing the report of Marcius, who had been sent to investigate conditions in Greece and Macedonia,<note>Cf. XXXIX. xlviii. 5.</note> answers were given them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The kings of Asia and the Rhodians received the reply that the senate would send commissioners to look into these matters.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With regard to Philip, Marcius had increased the senate's concern: for he admitted that Philip had done what it had demanded, but in such a way that it was clearly evident that he would not continue to do so longer than was necessary.<note>Polybius (XXIV. x (XXIII. ix)) says more explicitly <quote>that he had indeed done all that was enjoined on him, but with great reluctance; and that if he got an opportunity, he would go to all lengths against the Romans</quote> (Shuckburgh's translation).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor was it a secret that he would resort to arms, and that everything that he did and said had this in view.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the first place he moved almost the entire population of citizens, families and all, from the towns along the coast to what is now called Emathia
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and was formerly Paeonia, and the cities he gave as <pb id="p.9"/>homes to Thracians and other barbarians, thinking B.C. 182 that these tribes would be more loyal in a Roman war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This act caused tremendous lamentation throughout all Macedonia, and few, as they left their ancestral homes with their wives and children, kept their grief concealed; and from the columns of migrants curses upon the king were heard, hatred getting the better of their fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king's temper, made fierce by these things, held all men, all places and occasions in suspicion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Finally he began to say publicly that he could not find any real security unless the children of those whom he had executed were arrested, kept under guard, and killed one by one, as occasion offered.<note>Polybius (XXIV. viii a (XXIII. x)) represents him as quoting a verse from the epic poet Stasinus: <foreign lang="greek">nh/pios o(\s pate/ra ktei/nas ui(ou\s katalei/pei,</foreign> <quote>A fool is he who, having slain the father, leaves the sons behind.</quote> Both Polybius and Livy seem to conceive of the fall of Philip in dramatic form and to employ some of the technique of tragedy in their narratives.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This cruelty, dreadful in itself, was made more dreadful by the destruction of one household.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Herodicus, a leading man among the Thessalians, had been put to death many years before; his sons-in-law also had been killed later. His daughters were left in widowhood, each having one small son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Theoxena and Archo were the names of these women. Theoxena, though she had many suitors, disdained marriage:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Archo married a certain Poris, by far the first citizen among the Aeneans,<note>He probably came from Aenea, not Aenus.</note> and after bearing several children, all left quite small, she died in his house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Theoxena, in order that the children of her sister might be brought up in her hands, married Poris; and as if she were the mother of them all, she devoted the same care to her own child and her sister's children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After she received the king's proclamation about the <pb id="p.11"/>arrest of the children of the men who had been put<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> to death, thinking that they would be exposed not only to the mockery of the king but even to the lust of the guards, she turned her
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> thoughts to a deed of horror, and dared to say that she would rather kill them all with her own hand than let them fall into the power of Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Poris, hating even the thought of so dreadful a deed, said that he would take them to faithful friends in Athens and would himself be their companion in exile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They set out from Thessalonica to Aenea to an appointed sacrifice which they make<note>The present account may have been taken over from Polybius, but the festival may still have been celebrated in Livy's time.</note> every year to Aeneas, their founder, with elaborate ceremony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having spent a day there in the ritual feasts, when all were asleep, about the third watch they went aboard a ship made ready in advance by Poris, as if to return to Thessalonica; their plan, however, was to cross to Euboea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But strain as they might in vain against an opposing wind, day caught them near the shore, and the king's troops who were in charge of the guarding of the harbour sent an armed brig to bring back that ship, with strict orders not to return without it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When they were now close to shore, Poris was engaged in urging on the rowers and sailors; sometimes stretching out his hands to heaven, he would pray that the gods would send help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Meanwhile the maddened woman, turning to the crime she had long been planning, mixed the poison and displayed the steel, and placing the cup in sight and drawing the swords, she said, <quote>Death is the one way to freedom. These are the ways to death: by whichever your mind prefers, escape the tyranny of <pb id="p.13"/>the king.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Come, my children, first you who are the<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> elder, take the sword or drain the cup, if you like the slower death.</quote> From the one side the enemy was approaching, from the other the author of death was urging them. One carried off by one death, another by another, still half-living they were thrown into the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then the woman herself, embracing her husband, the partner in her death, threw herself into the sea. The king's troops captured a ship empty of its masters.<note>The episode is not found in Polybius. Livy treats it as almost the turning-point in the tragic action.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The horror of this act added, as it were, a new spark to the resentment against the king, so that people generally were cursing him and his sons; and these curses, heard by all the gods, presently brought it to pass that he himself took violent measures against his own kin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For when Perseus saw that the popularity and honour of his brother Demetrius were, among the Macedonian people, growing every day, as well as his influence with the Romans, thinking that no hope for the throne was left to him except through crime, he turned all his thoughts in that one direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since he believed that by himself he was not strong enough even for what he was planning in his effeminate<note>The implication. seems to be that Perseus was strong enough to plan a murder but not to commit it: if so, he acquired strength later.</note> mind, he began to make trial of individuals among his father's friends with ambiguous remarks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And at first some of them gave the appearance of rejecting any such suggestion, since they placed more hope in Demetrius;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> then, as Philip's hatred for the Romans increased daily, and Perseus nursed it and Demetrius tried with all his might to oppose it, foreseeing the destruction of the young man, off his guard against his brother's trickery, and, thinking that what was bound to happen should be helped along and that the <pb id="p.15"/>aspirations of the stronger should be encouraged,<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> they allied themselves with Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Everything else they put off until the proper time for action: for the present it was decided to enkindle the king in every way against the Romans and to turn him to thoughts of war, to which he had already spontaneously turned his mind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the same time, that Demetrius might day by day become more an object of suspicion, they agreed that they would draw the conversation again and again to Roman topics. Then, when some would poke fun at their manners and customs, others at their achievements, others at the appearance of the city itself, which was not yet made beautiful in either its public or its private sections, others at individual leaders, the young man, being off his guard both because of his love for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Roman people<note>Cf. XXXIX. xlvii &mdash;xlviii. 1 and the note.</note> and because of his rivalry with his brother, by defending the Romans in everything made himself suspicious in his father's eyes and a fair target for
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> attack. And so his father kept him excluded from all his deliberations about Roman affairs: turning entirely to Perseus he considered with him all the plans for the war by day and
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> night. It happened that the agents had returned whom Philip had sent to the Bastarnae to summon aid<note>Cf. XXXIX. xxxv. 4.</note> and had brought from there noble young men and some of royal birth, one of whom promised his sister in marriage to a son of Philip; alliance with this tribe had cheered the spirits of the king. Then Perseus said: <quote>What good do such things
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> do? There is by no means as much protection in auxiliaries outside as there is danger in treachery at home. I do not want <pb id="p.17"/>to say a traitor, but we have in our bosom at least a<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> spy, whose body, after he was a hostage at Rome, the Romans gave back to us but keep his soul
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> themselves. The eyes of almost all the Macedonians are turned towards him, and they say that they will have no other king than the one whom the Romans shall have given
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> them.</quote> Sick as the old man's mind already was, anyhow, it was by these means roused to passion, and he retained
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> these insinuations in his heart rather than in his looks.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It so happened that the time for purifying the army had come, for which there is a ritual of this sort: the fore part of a dog is cut off and placed on the right side of the road, the hind part, with the entrails, on the left; between the parts of the victim, thus divided, the troops are marched.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the head of the column are carried the arms and standards of all the kings from the earliest beginnings of Macedonia, then the present king,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> accompanied by his children, follows, next is the royal cohort and the bodyguard, and the rest, the rank and file of the Macedonians brings up the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The two youthful sons of the king were riding at his sides, Perseus being now in his thirtieth year, Demetrius five years younger, the former in the full strength of young manhood, the latter in its flower, the mature offspring of a father blessed by fortune, had a sound mind but been his.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was the custom when the ceremony of purification was finished to manoeuvre the army and dividing it into battle-lines to clash in a sham battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The princes were assigned as commanders for this mock engagement: yet it was not the imitation of a battle, but they came together just as if it were a struggle for the throne, and many <pb id="p.19"/>wounds were dealt by the pointless weapons,<note>They were used for drill and for exhibitions.</note> nor<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> was anything but iron wanting to make it look like a regular battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The division which was under Demetrius was far superior. When Perseus was angered at this, his shrewder friends rejoiced and said that this was just the thing that would give grounds for accusing the young man.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Each of the two that day held a banquet for his companions who had taken part in the charge with him, after Perseus had refused when invited to dinner by Demetrius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the holiday courteous invitations and youthful jollity encouraged both parties to drinking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There reminiscences of the sham battle and jokes at their opponents were bandied about, so that not even the leaders themselves were spared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When a spy, sent from the party of Perseus to catch remarks, was hovering incautiously too close, he was captured and roughly handled by some young men who happened to be leaving the dining room.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Demetrius, knowing nothing of this occurrence, said, <quote>Why don't we pursue our revels at my brother's, and by our openness and cheerfulness soothe his anger, if any is left from the battle?</quote><note>Livy takes such pains throughout to depict Demetrius as a frank, ingenuous, and even simple youth that one wonders what sources of information he had and what kind of a person Demetrius really was. In Livy's story his simplicity and lack of perception make him an easy prey to Perseus.</note> All shouted out to go, except those who feared immediate vengeance for the spy whom they had beaten.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Demetrius was for taking them also with him, they concealed under their cloaks weapons wherewith to defend themselves if an attack should be made. There can be no secrets in internal strife. Each house was full of spies and traitors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> An informer went ahead to Perseus, bearing the news that four young men <pb id="p.21"/>armed with swords were coming with Demetrius.<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> Although their reason was obvious &mdash;for he had heard that his companion had been beaten by them &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> ordered the door to be bolted in order to make the affair look serious, and from the upper part of the house and the windows that faced the street he kept the revellers, as if they were coming to murder him, from approaching the door.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Demetrius, under the influence of wine, after shouting for a while because he was shut out, returned to his banquet, ignorant of the significance of the whole affair.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day Perseus, as soon as he had the opportunity to see his father, entered the palace with a troubled look and stood in sight of his father, but at a distance, without speaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When his father said <quote>Is it all right with you?</quote> and asked what was the cause of his sadness, he replied, <quote>You may count it as clear gain, I tell you, that I am alive. No longer are we being attacked by my brother with secret plots; he came last night with armed men to my house to kill me, and closing the doors I defended myself against his madness by the walls' protection.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had inspired in his father fear mixed with wonder, he went on: <quote>But if you can give this your attention, I shall cause you to grasp it clearly.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Philip said that he would indeed listen, and immediately ordered Demetrius to be summoned; he also sent for two older men, his friends, who took no part in the youthful rivalries between the brothers and nowadays were rarely at the court, Lysimachus and Onomastus, to serve as his counsellors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While his friends were coming, he walked up and down alone, turning over many things in his mind, while his son stood apart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When it was announced that they had <pb id="p.23"/>come he retired into the interior part of the palace<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> with his two friends and as many bodyguards; he permitted his sons to bring in three unarmed men each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he had taken his seat there, he spoke as follows: <quote>Here I sit, a most wretched father, as judge between my two sons, accuser and accused on a charge of parricide, doomed as I am to discover in my own household the dishonour of either the invention or the commission of a crime.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For a long time, indeed, I had been fearing this threatening storm, when I saw your looks at one another, looks in no wise brotherly, and when I heard certain words.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But sometimes hope entered my mind that your passions might burn out, that your suspicions might be cleared away. I told myself that even hostile nations had laid down their arms and made treaties and that the private quarrels of many had been ended;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I hoped that some day a recollection of your kinship would come to you, of your one-time boyish frankness and mutual intercourse, and finally of my teachings, which I fear that I have recited in vain to unhearing ears.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> How often<note>Polybius (XXIV. viii a (XXIII. xi)) quotes a speech of Philip to the general purport of what follows here.</note> in your presence, hating the examples of discord between brothers, I have reviewed the dreadful fates of those men who had utterly destroyed themselves, their houses, their homes, their kingdoms!
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the other side also I set better examples: the harmonious compact between the pairs of Lacedaemonian kings, beneficial for many ages to themselves and to the state;
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the destruction of the same city after the custom had grown up that each should seize the tyranny for himself. Again I pointed out that the brothers Attalus

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the same time the object that he sought was that his accusation might seem sudden and entirely uncalculated, arising forsooth out of the fear and sudden tumult of last night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But, Perseus, if I was the betrayer of my father and the kingdom, if I had conspired with the <pb id="p.39"/>Romans and other enemies of my father, you should<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> not have waited for the drama of last night, but should long before have impeached me for treason:

					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Do you wish, Perseus, the rule to be applied to the investigation, that whichever of us fears that the other might seem more worthy of the kingship should be judged to have

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> You see, indeed, what sorts of occasions are selected for this murder: times of sport, of feasting, of revelry. Well, what sort of day was it?

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But a mind blinded by the desire to find grounds for accusation, while it tries to make everything seem suspicious, confuses one thing with another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, Perseus, if I wished to kill you with poison at the dinner, what was less suitable than by a stubborn contest and clash to make you angry, so that you would justly refuse, as you did, to come when I invited you to dinner? But when you had in your anger refused, which should I have done?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Should I have tried every means to appease you, that I might find another opportunity, since I had the poison once made ready?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Or should I leap, so to speak, from that plan straight to another, namely, to kill you with a sword, and on that very same day, under the pretence of a revel?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Further, on what line of reasoning, if I believed that it was from fear of death that you avoided my dinner, could I think that after that you would not from the same fear avoid my revel also?</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At the same time the praetors Publius Manlius and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus arrived in their provinces, the former in Farther Spain, which province he had <pb id="p.55"/>held in his first praetorship also,<note>According to XXXIII. xliii. 5, Manlius was in Nearer<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> Spain as an assistant to the consul. This, however, gave him a sort of roving commission, and he operated in Farther Spain as well (XXXIV. xvii. 1 and the note).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the latter in Nearer<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> Spain, where he took over the army from Aulus Terentius: for the farther province had been without a governor since the death of Publius Sempronius the proconsul.<note>Cf. ii. 5 above.</note> The Celtiberians attacked Fulvius Flaccus while he was besieging a Spanish town, Urbicna by name. A number of hard battles were fought there, and many Roman soldiers suffered wounds and death. Fulvius prevailed by stubbornness, since by no attack could he be drawn away from the siege: the Celtiberians, worn out by the repeated battles, withdrew.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When their aid was lost, the city was within a few days captured and plundered; the praetor bestowed the booty upon the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Fulvius, after taking this town, retired into winter-quarters, and Manlius did the same, having merely collected into one place the army which had been scattered and having done nothing else worth mentioning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These were the events of this summer in Spain. Terentius, who had retired from that province, entered the City in ovation. In his procession he carried nine thousand three hundred and twenty pounds of silver, eighty-two pounds of gold and sixty-seven golden crowns.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same year Roman arbitrators who were on the ground took part in a dispute about land-ownership between the Carthaginian people and King Masinissa.<note>Cf. XXXIV. lxii. 15.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gala, the father of Masinissa, had taken it from the Carthaginians; Syphax had driven Gala out of it and later, as a favour to his father-in-law Hasdrubal, had presented it as a gift to the Carthaginians; Masinissa had that year expelled the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The case was argued <pb id="p.57"/>before the Romans with no less ardour of temper<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> than when they fought with arms in the line of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Carthaginians were reclaiming it because it had belonged to their forefathers and had then come again to them from Syphax. Masinissa maintained, first that he had recovered land belonging to his father's kingdom and second, that he was holding it under the law of nations;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he said that he had the advantage both of a good case and of actual possession; he was afraid of nothing else in the dispute except that a sense of shame on the part of the Romans, as they might be reluctant to give the appearance of having favoured an allied and friendly king as against the common enemy of themselves and him, might do him injury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The commissioners did not change the right of possession, but referred the case without prejudice to the senate.<note>The claim of Masinissa must have seemed weak to the commission, which however did not wish to offend him. The ultimate solution to the problem is not known.</note></p> 
				<p>Among the Ligurians nothing more happened. They had in the beginning retired into out-of-theway defiles, then disbanded their army and scattered everywhere to their own villages and strongholds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls also wished to discharge their armies and consulted the senate on the matter. The Fathers directed that one of them should disband his army and come to Rome to conduct the election of magistrates for the coming year, and that the other with his legions should winter at Pisa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was reported that the Transalpine Gauls were arming their young men and it was unknown into what part of Italy the multitude would pour. So the consuls arranged between themselves that Gnaeus Baebius should go to the elections because his brother Marcus Baebius was a candidate for the consulship.<note>The usefulness of a consul under such circumstances had been demonstrated by the Claudii (XXXIX. xxxii. 13).</note></p> <pb id="p.59"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The election of consuls took place: the<note type="margin">B.C. 182</note> successful candidates were Publius Cornelius Lentulus<note>The Fasti give the <hi rend="italics">cognomen</hi> as Cethegus.</note> and Marcus Baebius Tamphilus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next the praetors were chosen, two named Quintus Fabius, Maximus and Buteo, Tiberius Claudius Nero, Quintus Petilius Spurinus, Marcus Pinarius Rusca, Lucius Duronius.</p> 
				<p>When they had been inaugurated, the provinces<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> were assigned by lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Liguria was given to the consuls. Among the praetors, the civil jurisdiction was allotted to Quintus Petilius, that between citizens and aliens to Quintus Fabius Maximus, Gaul to Quintus Fabius Buteo, Sicily to Tiberius Claudius Nero, Sardinia to Marcus Pinarius, Apulia to Lucius Duronius;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the Histrians<note>From xxvi. 2 below it appears that Buteo was in Histria, and from xlii. 1 below that Duronius was in Illyricum later. Livy may be mistaken, or this clause may be misplaced. Cf. Zippel, <hi rend="italics">Die roemische Herrschaft in Illyrium bis auf Augustus</hi> (Leipzig, 1877), 81.</note> were also added because the news had come from Tarentum and Brundisium that the lands along the coasts were endangered by piracy on the part of the ships from across the sea. The Massilians made the same complaint about the ships of the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the armies were decreed &mdash;four legions for the consuls, each to consist of fifty-two hundred Roman infantry, and three hundred cavalry, and fifteen thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry of the allies of the Latin confederacy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the Spains the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of the old praetors was extended, with the armies which they had, and they decreed as reinforcements three thousand Roman citizens and two hundred cavalry and of the allies of the Latin confederacy six thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry. Nor was care for the fleet omitted.<note>As usual at the end of a war, the Romans had neglected the fleet after the defeat of Antiochus, and the ships had been docked. In the light of the information received, provision is now made for launching and manning them. While during the recent wars the fleets had been commanded by <hi rend="italics">legati</hi> or by praetors, <hi rend="italics">duumviri navales,</hi> magistrates chosen only for special occasions, are now named.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <pb id="p.61"/>The consuls were directed to secure the election of a<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> board of two for this purpose, by whom twenty ships, launched from the yards, would be manned by Roman citizens who had been slaves, serving as marines,<note>Roman citizens were not ordinarily assigned to duty at sea.</note> employing free-born citizens only as commanders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The defence of the coast was divided between the duumvirs, ten ships being assigned to each, in such a way that the promontory of Minerva<note>Probably the cape of Sorrento, near Naples.</note> was, so to speak, the joint<note>Literally, the pivot or hinge (on which a door would swing), but, in surveying, a limiting boundary or reference point.</note> between them; thence one should defend the right sector as far as Massilia, the other the left as far as Barium.<note>The modern Bari, on the Adriatic.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many dreadful prodigies were both observed in Rome that year and reported from elsewhere.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the precinct of Vulcan and Concord<note>Cf. XXXIX. xlvi. 5; lvi. 6.</note> there was a shower of blood; and the pontiffs announced that the spears<note>They were probably the <hi rend="italics">hastae Martiae</hi> at Rome (Gellius IV. vi. 1-2). There were similar spears at Praeneste (XXIV. x. 10).</note> had been shaken, and the people of Lanuvium sent word that the image of Juno Sospita had shed tears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The pestilence was so severe in the country and in the villages and rural communities and in the City that Libitina<note>>7 The goddess of funerals.</note> could scarce take care of so many funerals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Being disturbed by these prodigies and deaths, the Fathers decreed, both that the consuls should sacrifice full-grown victims to whatever gods it seemed proper, and that the decemvirs should consult the Books.<note>The Sibylline Books (XXXI. xii. 9 and the note).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> According to their decree one day of prayer was proclaimed at all the banquet-tables of the gods<note>9 Cf. XXXI. viii, 2 and the note.</note> in Rome. On their suggestion also there was both a decree of the senate and an edict of the consuls that for three days <pb id="p.63"/>throughout Italy there should be a supplication and<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> festival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The violence of the plague was so great that when, on account of a rising of the Corsicans and a revolt begun by the Ilienses in Sardinia, it was decided to enlist eight thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry among the allies of the Latin confederacy, whom Marcus Pinarius the praetor should take with him to Sardinia, the consuls reported that so
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> many deaths had occurred among the men and so great was the number of sick that this number of troops could not be raised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The shortage in the number of troops the praetor was directed to make up from the army of Gnaeus Baebius the proconsul, who was wintering at Pisa, and thence to cross to Sardinia.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>To Lucius Duronius, the praetor to whom the province of Apulia had been allotted, has also been assigned an investigation to the Bacchanalia, from which some seeds, as it were, left over from the earlier troubles, had already begun to show themselves in the previous year; but the inquiries had been begun before the praetor Lucius Pupius rather than brought to any conclusion.<note>Cf. XXXIX. xli. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Fathers ordered the new praetor to extirpate the trouble, to prevent it from again secretly spreading furthur.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Also the consuls, with the authority of the senate, brought before the people a law on bribery.<note>The last law to control bribery had been passed in <date value="-358">358 B.C.</date> (VII. xv. 12). No special reason for a new law at this time is known, unless it was the vigorous campaign reported in XXXIX. xxxii. It is not certain whether one law or two passed at this time, and the only clause recorded fixes as the penalty disqualification for holding office for a period of ten years (<hi rend="italics">Scholia Bobiensia,</hi> p. 361).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then they introduced the embassies into the senate, first those of the kings, Eumenes, and Ariarathes of Cappadocia, and Pharnaces of Pontus. No further reply was given to them than that the senate would send men to investigate their differences and give <pb id="p.65"/>judgment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then the representatives of the<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> Lacedaemonian exiles and of the Achaeans were brought in, and hope was held out to the exiles that the senate would write to the Achaeans directing that they be restored.<note>After the settlement effected in <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. xlviii. 2-4) there had apparently been additional banishments of anti-Achaean elements in Lacedaemon.</note> The Achaeans explained to the satisfaction of the Fathers regarding the recovery of Messene and the solution of the problems there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philip, king of the Macedonians, also sent two envoys, Philocles and Apelles, with no particular request to make of the senate, but rather to collect information and make inquiry about those conversations which Perseus had accused Demetrius of holding with the Romans and specifically with Titus Quinctius about the kingship which were prejudicial to the interests of his brother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These envoys the king had sent as neutral and not predisposed to favour either disputant: but as matters turned out they also were servants and helpers of Perseus in his treachery toward his brother.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Demetrius, at first ignorant of everything, except what had been revealed by his brother's wickedness, had no great hope but was not altogether without hope that his father could be appeased;<note>The apparent meaning is that Demetrius was unaware that his brother's intrigues had continued after their hearing before Philip.</note> he trusted less every day to his father's intentions, since he perceived that his father's attention was engrossed by his brother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so, reflecting carefully on everything he said or did, lest he increase the suspicions of anyone, he refrained particularly from all reference to or contact with the Romans, to such a degree that he did not even want them to write to him, because he knew that his father's mind was especially irritated by charges of this kind.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, in order partly to prevent his troops from growing slack through idleness, partly to avert <pb id="p.67"/>suspicion that he was thinking at all about a war<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> with Rome, summoned his army to Stobi in Paeonia and began to lead it into Maedica.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The desire had seized him of climbing to the top of the Haemus mountains, because he had accepted the common opinion that from there could be seen all at once the Pontic and Adriatic seas, the Hister river and the Alps. To have these spread out before his eyes would have, he thought, no small weight in determining his strategy in a war with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Having questioned men who knew the country about the ascent of the Haemus, since it was generally agreed by all that there was no way for an army, but that with a few light troops it could
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> be climbed by a very difficult road, wishing to console his younger son by an intimate talk (he had decided not to take him with him), he first asked him whether, since the difficulty of the journey was so great, he should persist in the plan or abandon it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If after all he should decide to go, he could not forget, in such a situation, Antigonus,<note>Perhaps the general of Alexander the Great; if so, a remote ancestor of Philip.</note> who, when tossed about by a dreadful storm, at a time when he had all his family in the same ship with him, was said to have given his children the warning, which they should both remember for themselves and pass on to their children, that no man should venture to endanger himself and his whole house at once in a doubtful situation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Therefore, he said, remembering that precept, he would not expose both his sons at once to the chance of disaster which confronted them; and since he was taking his older son with him, he intended to send the younger back to Macedonia to furnish some support to his hopes and for the future to guard the kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Demetrius did not fail to <pb id="p.69"/>perceive that he was being banished, in order that<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> he might not be present at the council when the decision would be reached, in sight of the theatre of operations, what routes would lead most directly to the Adriatic sea and to Italy, and what would be the general strategy of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But he had not merely to obey his father but to agree with him, lest he should beget suspicion that he was obeying unwillingly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nevertheless, in order that he might have a safe journey into Macedonia, Didas, one of the king's generals,<note>The usual title used by Livy, though especially in military expressions, is <hi rend="italics">praefectus.</hi> The term <hi rend="italics">praetor</hi> is of course good Roman usage for a provincial governor.</note> who was in charge of Paeonia, was ordered to escort him with a moderately large guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Didas too, like most of the friends of the king, from the time when it began to be clear to everyone to whom, since the king's mind inclined that way, the inheritance of the kingdom would fall, Perseus had associated with the conspiracy for his brother's ruin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the present, he instructed Didas to make for himself, by every form of attention, a place among the intimates of Demetrius, that he might be able to get from him all his secrets and to spy upon his inmost thoughts. Thus Demetrius departed, accompanied by guards whose presence was more dangerous than if he had been travelling alone.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, crossing Maedica first and then the waste lands lying between Maedica and the Haemus, on the seventh march at last came to the foot of the mountain. There he delayed for a day to choose the men whom he should take with him and on the third<note>The day of arrival (the seventh of the march) and the day of rest are the first and second days.</note> day began his journey.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At first there was moderate exertion in the foothills. The farther up they went, they found more and more ground that was wooded and often impassable:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> at last they came to a trail so shaded that by reason of the thickness <pb id="p.71"/>of the trees and the branches interlaced with one<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> another it was barely possible to see the sky.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when they drew near the crest everything was so covered with fog, which is rare in high places, that they were retarded just as if they were marching by night. At last on the third day they came to the summit.<note>The exact situation of this summit (now part of the Great Balkan) cannot be determined, but since it was in Western Thrace or Eastern Macedonia the idea that the Adriatic could be seen from there is absurd. Mela (II. ii. 17), however, says that both seas are visible, and Strabo (VII. v. 1) quotes Polybius to the same effect, but adds that he was mistaken, since the distance was great and there were many intervening objects to obstruct the view.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they descended they did nothing to detract from the common opinion, rather, I suppose, to prevent the futility of the journey from becoming a subject of jest than because the different seas and mountains and rivers could be seen from one place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All were in distress and most of all the king himself, because he was more heavily burdened by age, as a result of the difficulty of the way. When he had sacrificed at the two altars dedicated there to
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> Jupiter and the Sun, he made in two days the descent which had required three for the ascent, fearing most the nightly colds, which, at the time of the rising of the dog-star,<note>This star rose about mid-July (Pliny <hi rend="italics">H. N.</hi> II. 123).</note> were like those of winter.<note>Conceiving of the career of Philip in tragic form again, one may regard this episode as the climax of Philip's folly thus far, or perhaps as a comic interlude to relieve the tragedy. It should be noted that it begins and ends with intimations of the approaching doom of Demetrius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After struggling with many hardships during those days, he found things no easier in camp, where the need was very great, as was to be expected in a country surrounded by deserts on all sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so, delaying only one day, in order to rest the men whom he had taken with him, he hurried, in a march that resembled a flight, into the country of the Dentheleti.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were allies, but on account of their need the Macedonians pillaged them just as if theirs were hostile territory: in their plundering <pb id="p.73"/>they first laid waste the farm-houses far and wide,<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> then even certain villages, not without great shame on the king's part, when he heard the voices of his allies calling in vain upon the gods who protect alliances and upon his own name. Carrying off the grain from there and returning to Maedica, he began to attack a city which they call Petra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He himself encamped on the approach from the plain and sent his son Perseus around with a force of moderate size to attack the city from the higher ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The citizens, since danger threatened them from every quarter, gave hostages and surrendered for the time being:
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> but none the less, after the army retired, forgetting the hostages they abandoned the city and fled to the fortified places and the mountains.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Philip, having wearied his troops with every sort of toil without having attained any result, and with his suspicions of his son increased because of the deceit of Didas, the general, returned to Macedonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Didas, as has been said before, had been sent as escort to Demetrius, and when he had entrapped the ingenuous young man, who was off his guard and not unjustly angry at his relatives, by flattering him and expressing indignation at his lot, volunteering his assistance in every respect, under pledge of loyalty Didas extracted all his secrets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Demetrius was planning flight to the Romans; and it looked as if, by the grace of the gods, an assistant in this plan had been provided in the person of the governor of Paeonia, through whose province he had come to hope that he could safely escape.<note>Paeonia extended as far west as Illyricum.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This plan was at once both revealed to his brother and reported to his father on his brother's authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first a letter was brought to <pb id="p.75"/>him while he was besieging Petra. As a result<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> Herodorus &mdash;he was the foremost of the friends of Demetrius &mdash;was placed under arrest and orders were issued that Demetrius was to be unobtrusively watched.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These things, added to everything else, saddened the king's return to Macedonia. He was indeed moved by these new charges; yet he thought that he ought to wait for the envoys whom he had sent to Rome to find out everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he had passed some months in this anxiety and trouble, at length the ambassadors, who had long before, while still in Macedonia, planned what report they would bring back from Rome, arrived;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> they, in addition to making other serious charges, delivered to the king a forged letter, sealed with a counterfeit signet of Titus Quinctius.<note>Cf. xi. 1 above and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was in the letter a warning against wrong inferences in case the young man, carried away by his desire for the throne, should have held any conversation with himself: Demetrius would do nothing to injure any of his relatives, nor was Quinctius himself one who could seem to sponsor any unfilial scheme.<note>The interpretation is not entirely certain, and the text, although in general it has the support of the MSS., may not be sound: the pronouns especially are curiously employed. The letter purports to be from Quinctius to Philip, and its <hi rend="italics">deprecatio</hi> is designed quite as much to acquit Quinctius of any share in any plot as to warn Philip that a plot exists; the conditional clause <hi rend="italics">si</hi> . . . <hi rend="italics">egisset</hi> is a virtual admission that Demetrius had consulted with Quinctius about the matter. Yet one would expect that the conspirators would treat it as a letter from Quinctius to Demetrius which they had intercepted: the use of the pronouns seems to make this impossible, and the content of the letter is inconsistent with that interpretation. If this were true, one could conclude only that Demetrius had discussed the situation with Quinctius and that the latter had urged the former against taking active measures to secure the throne and especially against involving Quinctius in the plot.</note> This letter furnished confirmation to the charges of Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As a result Herodorus was at once tortured for a long time without betraying anything and died on the rack.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Demetrius was again accused by Perseus before his father. The intended flight through Paeonia was one charge, and the bribery of certain <pb id="p.77"/>persons to be his companions on the journey; the<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> forged letter of Titus Quinctius weighed especially heavily against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nevertheless no severe sentence was openly pronounced upon him, in order that he might rather be killed through guile, and this not out of any consideration for him personally, but in order that his punishment might not expose the plans against the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When Philip himself had a journey to make from Thessalonica to Demetrias, he sent Demetrius, accompanied by the same Didas, to Astraeum in Paeonia and Perseus to Amphipolis to receive the Thracian hostages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Instructions regarding the murder of his son are said to have been given by him to Didas as they separated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Didas either held or pretended to hold a sacrifice, and being invited to its celebration Demetrius came from Astraeum to Heraclea, and it was during this dinner that it is said that the poison was administered.<note>A sacrifice was usually accompanied by a feast.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having drained the cup he immediately perceived it, and presently, when his sufferings began and he had retired to his bedroom from the dining-room, complaining of the cruelty of his father and inveighing against the murderous designs of his brother and the crime of Didas, he was being tortured by his agony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then a certain Thyrsis from Stuberra and Alexander from Beroea were admitted, and putting coverlets over his head and mouth they smothered him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus the innocent youth perished, his enemies being not even contented with a single kind of death for him.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on in Macedonia, Lucius Aemilius Paulus, whose <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> had been prolonged after his consulship, in the beginning of spring led the army against the Ligurian Ingauni.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.79"/>As soon as he had encamped in the enemy's country,<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> ambassadors came to him to spy, although under the guise of seeking peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When Paulus said that he did not negotiate for peace except with people who had surrendered, they did not so much refuse to negotiate as say that they needed time to persuade a rude agricultural tribe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When a truce for ten days was granted for this purpose, they then asked that the soldiers should not cross the mountains nearest the camp in quest of forage and wood: these, they said, were the cultivated parts of their territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they obtained this, they massed their whole army under cover of those very mountains from which they had kept the enemy, and suddenly with a vest host advanced to attack the Roman camp at all the gates at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They continued the attack all day with the greatest violence, so that the Romans did not even have the opportunity to carry forth their standards nor any room to develop their line of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having been packed in the gates, they defended the camp more by blocking the entrances than by fighting. When the enemy had retired at sunset, Paulus sent two troopers to Gnaeus Baebius the proconsul at Pisa, with dispatches to the effect that he had been besieged during a truce and that Baebius should come to his aid as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Baebius had turned his army over to Marcus Pinarius the praetor, who was going to Sardinia:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but he informed the senate by letter that Lucius Aemilius was besieged by the Ligurians, and he wrote to Marcus Claudius Marcellus, whose province was nearest to them, that if it seemed wise to him he should march his army from Gaul against the Ligurians and rescue Lucius Aemilius from siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All these relief <pb id="p.81"/>measures were destined to be late. The Ligurians<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> returned the next day to the camp. Although Aemilius had known that they would come and could have drawn his forces out into battle-line, he held his men within the rampart, so as to drag things out until Baebius and his army could arrive from Pisa.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome the letter of Baebius caused great consternation, the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> greater because a few days later, when Marcellus reached Rome after turning his army over to Fabius, he took away the hope that the army which was in Gaul could be marched against the Ligurians, because the war was on with the Histrians, who were interfering with the establishment of the colony at Aquileia:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Fabius, he said, had already set out for Histria and could not return now that the war had begun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was only one hope of assistance, and that requiring more time than the critical situation permitted &mdash;the possibility that the consuls should make haste to go to their province. Each of the Fathers on his own account cried out that they should do so.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This one change was made: the <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> were placed in the front line and the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi> in <pb id="p.85"/>reserve; Sextus Julius Caesar and Lucius Aurelius<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> Cotta, tribunes of the soldiers, commanded this legion.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The commander in person made the round of the gates to harangue the troops, and with whatever taunts he could find he worked the soldiers up to fighting pitch, now blaming the deceit of the enemy who, after seeking peace and
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> being granted a truce, had come to besiege the camp while the truce was actually in effect, contrary to the law of nations, now showing how shameful it was for a Roman army to be besieged by Ligurians, brigands rather than regular soldiers.

						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A thing that Spaniards, Gauls, Macedonians or Carthaginians did not dare to do a Ligurian enemy now does &mdash;advances against a Roman rampart, of their own accord besets and besieges it:

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The answer to this was a general shout from the troops, that the soldiers were not to blame since no one had given them the order to sally forth: let him <pb id="p.87"/>give the signal and he would soon learn that both<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> Romans and Ligurians were the same as they had been before.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Ligurians had two camps on this side of the mountains. Formerly, all alike used to come forth from them at sunrise, formed and arrayed for battle;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but later on they did not take up arms until they had their fill of food and wine, and then they went out scattered and disorganized, like men who were practically certain that the enemy would not bring out their standards before the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Against an enemy advancing in such disorder, a shout being raised at one time by all who were in the camp, attendants and sutlers alike, the Roman soldiers burst from all the gates at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The attack was so complete a surprise to the Ligurians that they were as frightened as if they had fallen into an ambush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For a brief period there was something resembling a battle: then there was headlong flight and the slaughter of fugitives all around, the signal having been given to the cavalry that they should mount, their horses and permit no one to escape. All were driven in terrified rout into the camps and then stripped of their camps as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> More than fifteen thousand of the Ligurians were killed that day and two thousand three hundred captured. Three days later the whole people of the Ligurian Ingauni gave hostages and surrendered. The pilots and sailors who had been on their pirate ships were sought out and all put in confinement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And Gaius Matienus the duumvir captured thirty-two ships of this kind on the Ligurian coast. To take this news and carry dispatches to the senate, Lucius Aurelius Cotta and Gaius Sulpicius Gallus were sent to Rome, <pb id="p.89"/>with instructions also
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> to ask that Lucius Aemilius,<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> having accomplished the task assigned him as his province, should be permitted to leave it and to bring his soldiers back with him and discharge them.<note>Cf. XXXVIII. 1. 3. Paulus is beginning a campaign for a triumph.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Both requests were granted by the senate, and a three-day period of thanksgiving was decreed at all the banquet-tables of the gods, and the praetor Petilius was instructed to discharge the reserve legions, the praetor Fabius to discontinue the levy among the allies of the Latin confederacy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and it was ordered that the <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus</hi> should write to the consuls that the senate deemed it proper that they should discharge the temporary troops, which had been drafted because of the emergency, at the earliest possible moment.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A colony at Gravisca was founded this year in Etruscan territory, which had once been taken from the people of Tarquinii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Five <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> of land were given each colonist; the board of three who founded it consisted of Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Publius Claudius Pulcher, Gaius Terentius Istra. Drought and crop failures made the year remarkable. For six months, as the story goes, it did not rain at all.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The same year, on the land of Lucius Petilius, a public clerk, at the foot of the Janiculan, while husbandmen were digging up the ground to a greater depth than usual, two stone chests were found, each about eight feet long and four broad, with the lids fastened with lead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Each chest had an inscription, in Latin and Greek letters: one to the effect that Numa Pompilius, the son of Pompo, king of the Romans, was buried there, the other, that the books of Numa Pompilius were inside.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When, on the advice of his friends, the owner had opened the chests, the <pb id="p.91"/>one which carried the inscription about the buried<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> king was found empty, with no trace of a human body or anything else, everything having been destroyed by the wasting action of so many years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the other were two bundles, tied with waxed rope, containing seven books each, not merely whole, but looking absolutely fresh. The seven Latin books dealt with pontifical law,<note>Numa was regarded as the source of the pontificial law.</note> the seven Greek with a system of philosophy which might have been current at that time.<note>The obvious meaning is that the system expounded was simple and practical rather than theoretical and academic; but see the next sentence.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Valerius Antias adds that they were Pythagorean, confirmation of the common belief, which says that Numa was
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> a pupil of Pythagoras,<note>Livy himself did not believe this (I. xviii. 4).</note> being arranged by a plausible invention.<note>Several other accounts of this episode have been preserved indirectly and incompletely: those of Cassius Hemina, Piso and Antias in Pliny (<hi rend="italics">H. N.</hi> XIII. 84-87), and of Varro in Augustine (<hi rend="italics">De civitate dei</hi> VII. xxxiv). It is reported also by Valerius Maximus (I. i. 12), whose account is based on Livy, and by Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Numa</hi> 22), who quotes Antias as his source. These accounts differ as to the number of books found: Piso says seven, Antias twelve, while Hemina (the numeral III sometimes given is a conjecture, rejected by Jan-Mayhoff and by Peter) and Varro do not mention the number. This offers a faint suggestion that Livy followed Piso here, although he agrees rather with Antias as to the contents of the book. Unfortunately Pliny does not relate the whole episode, so that a thorough-going comparison of Livy with the older writers is impossible.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The books were at first read by the friends who were present; soon, after others had read them and they were becoming generally known, Quintus Petilius, the <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus,</hi> desiring to read the books, borrowed them from Lucius Petilius; and there was an acquaintance between them because Quintus Petilius when quaestor had chosen the other as a clerk on his staff.<note>The <hi rend="italics">scribae publici</hi> comprised a distinct class of more or less permanent civil servants who did the clerical work in the administrative offices. This sentence may mean rather that Q. Petilius had secured for L.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When, on reading the important contents, he had observed that much of it was subversive of religion,<note>This characterization seems to be inconsistent with the accepted and the rejected accounts of them in sects. 7-8 above. The Bacchanalian affair had made the Romans unusually sensitive about the preservation of the native religion the hold of which on the people was manifestly weakening. Curiously, however, the pontiffs were not consulted, and only a lay opinion as to the nature of these books was sought.</note> <pb id="p.93"/>he told Lucius Petilius that he intended to throw<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> those books into the fire;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> before he did this he gave the scribe permission to try to see if he thought that he had any legal right or possibility of assistance,<note>In other words, the praetor would countenance an appeal for the <hi rend="italics">auxilium</hi> of the tribunes if the scribe considered that he was suffering the confiscation of legally-held property.</note> if he preferred, to recover those books: he himself would take no offence at such action. The scribe went to the tribunes of the people and by them the case was referred to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The praetor said that he was prepared to give his oath that the books ought not to be read or preserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The senate voted that it seemed sufficient that the praetor promised the oath; that the books should be burned as soon as possible in the <hi rend="italics">comitium;</hi> that compensation for the books, whatever seemed proper to Quintus Petilius the praetor and the majority of the tribunes of the people, should be paid to their owner.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A great war broke out that summer in Nearer Spain.<note>The narrative broken off at xvi. 11 above is resumed.</note> The Celtiberians had mobilized about thirty-five thousand men, a greater number, almost, than ever before. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was governor of this province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Because he had heard that the Celtiberians were arming their young men, he too had brought in from the allies as many auxiliaries as possible, but by no means equalled the enemy in number of men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the beginning of spring he led <pb id="p.95"/>the army into Carpetania and fixed his camp near the<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> town of Aebura, leaving a small garrison in the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A few days later the Celtiberians encamped about two miles away, at the foot of a hill. When the Roman praetor became aware of their arrival, he sent his brother Marcus Fulvius with two troops of allied cavalry to reconnoitre toward the camp of the enemy, with orders to approach as closely as possible to the rampart so as to ascertain how large the camp was; he was to avoid a battle and to withdraw if he saw the hostile cavalry coming out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He acted just as he was ordered. For several days there was no movement beyond the fact that these two troops showed themselves and were then withdrawn when the enemy's cavalry had rushed out of the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Finally the Celtiberians, leaving the camp with their entire force of infantry and cavalry, took their position in a straight line about half-way across the plain which was between the two camps. The plain was entirely flat and suitable for fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There the Spaniards stood waiting for the enemy. The Roman kept his men within the rampart. For four days in succession they on their side held their line in formation on the same ground; the Romans, on their side, made no move.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the Celtiberians rested in camp, because they had no opportunity to fight: only the cavalry rode out to the out-guards, so as to be ready if any move should be made by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Both armies went to the rear of their camps for forage and wood, neither interfering with the other.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman praetor, when he was well assured that the inaction of so many days had created in the enemy the expectation that the Romans <pb id="p.97"/>would not take the initiative, ordered Lucius Acilius<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> with the left squadron and six thousand auxiliaries from the province to march around the hill which was in the rear of the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> thence, when he should have heard the shout, he was to rush down on the camp. They set out at night that they might not be seen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At daybreak Flaccus sent Gaius Scribonius, a commander of allies, with the attached cavalry of the left squadron, up to the rampart of the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> when the Celtiberians saw both that they came nearer and that they were more numerous than usual, all their cavalry poured out of the camp, and at the same time the signal was given to the infantry also to march out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Scribonius, as he had been ordered, as soon as he heard the first din 6f the cavalry, turned his horses and retired to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The more headlong was the pursuit of the enemy. At first the cavalry and soon after the line of the infantry was at hand, possessed by the assured hope that they would capture the camp that day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were not more than five hundred paces from the rampart. And so Flaccus, when he saw that they had been drawn far enough away from the protection of their camp, having formed his army inside the rampart, sallied out in three columns at once, raising a shout not only to increase their own ardour for fighting, but also that the detachment which was in the mountains might hear it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor did they delay to rush down upon the camp as they had been ordered; not more than five thousand men had been left there as a guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Since their own small number and the great number of the enemy and the unexpectedness of the attack had thrown them into a panic, the camp was taken almost without a struggle. When it was captured, <pb id="p.99"/>Acilius ordered fire to be set to it in the place which<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> could be best seen by the fighters.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The rear ranks of the Celtiberians who were in the line of battle were the first to see the flames, and then the word spread through the whole line that the camp was lost and was at that very moment in flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> What inspired terror in them increased the courage of the Romans. Now the shouts of their victorious comrades were falling upon their ears, now the blazing camp of the enemy was in sight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Celtiberians for a while wavered in uncertainty of mind: but since there was no retreat if they were defeated nor any hope anywhere except in battle, they renewed the contest with greater stubbornness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the centre of the line they were hard pressed by the fifth legion; against the left flank, on which they saw that the Romans had posted the provincial auxiliaries of their own race, they advanced with greater confidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now the Roman left was almost being driven back, and would have been had not the seventh legion come to its assistance. At the same time those who had been left on guard in the town of Aebura came up in the very heat of the fight, and Acilius from the rear was drawing near.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For a long time the Celtiberians were cut down between them; those who survived sought flight in every direction. The cavalry, sent out in two columns to pursue them, caused great slaughter. About twenty-three thousand of the enemy were killed that day, four thousand seven hundred captured, with more than five hundred horses and eighty-eight military standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The victory was great but yet not bloodless: of Roman soldiers of the two legions, a little more than two hundred, <pb id="p.101"/>of the allies of the Latin confederacy, eight hundred<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> and thirty, of the auxiliaries from the province, about twenty-four hundred fell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The praetor led the victorious army back into camp, ordering Acilius to remain in the camp of the enemy. On the following day the spoils of the enemy were collected and before an assembly those whose valour had been conspicuous were rewarded.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having transported the wounded to the town of Aebura, he led the legions through Carpetania toward Contrebia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When this town, on being besieged, had asked aid from the Celtiberians and they were slow in coming, not because they dawdled, but because after they had left home they were held up by roads made impassable by continuous rains and by swollen rivers, despairing of assistance from its friends, it surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Flaccus, too, having been driven to do so by dire storms, led his whole army into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Celtiberians, who had set out from home in ignorance of the surrender, when they had at last arrived at Contrebia after crossing the rivers as soon as the rains ceased, seeing no camp outside the walls and concluding that the enemy had either gone around to the other side or retired, carelessly approached the town in scattered bodies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans made a sally against them from two gates and attacking them while they were in disorder put them to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The circumstance which hampered their resisting and standing up to the fight, namely, that they were not advancing in one column or with large numbers grouped in formation around the standards, was itself the cause of safety for the majority in the flight:
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for scattered as they were anyhow over the whole plain, they broke up into groups <pb id="p.103"/>and fled, and nowhere did the enemy surround a<note type="margin">B. C. 181</note> compact mass. Nevertheless about twelve thousand were killed, more than five thousand men captured, with four hundred horses and sixty-two military standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those who came straggling home after their rout, by describing the surrender of Contrebia and their own disaster, prevented the departure of another force of Celtiberians who were coming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> All immediately dispersed to their villages and strongholds. Flaccus, setting out from Contrebia on a raid, led the legions through Celtiberia, capturing many forts, until the greatest part of the Celtiberians had surrendered.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These were the events
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of this year in Nearer
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> Spain. In

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Latin colony of Aquileia
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> was founded the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> same year in the territory of
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the Gauls. Three thousand infantry

					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> hundred, cavalry one hundred and forty.<note>Usually
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> centurions are not considered separately, and the

						<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> allotments differs: cf. 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ix. 8 etc. The colony is populous and the allotments large because of its strategic position and the danger from Gauls and Histrians.</note> The commissioners who founded the colony were Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, Gaius Flaminius, Lucius Manlius Acidinus.<note>For their appointment see XXXIX. lv. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Two temples were dedicated that year, the first to Venus Erycina,<note>Cf. XXX. xxxviii. 10. The vow has not been mentioned, but the senior Porcius was in Liguria in <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. xxxviii. 1).</note> near the Porta Collina; Lucius Porcius Licinus, the son of Lucius, as duumvir dedicated it, and it had been vowed by Lucius Porcius the consul in the Ligurian war; the second to Pietas<note>Livy does not mention the romantic story told by Festus (p. 209), that the temple occupied the site of the house of a woman <hi rend="italics">quae patrem suum</hi> (<hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi> of the Glabrio who vowed the temple) <hi rend="italics">inclusum carcere mammis suis clam aluerit</hi>; Valerius Maximus (V. iv. 7) and Pliny (<hi rend="italics">H.

This <pb id="p.105"/>temple was dedicated by Manius Acilius Glabrio<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> as duumvir; a gilded statue, which was the first of all gilded statues in Italy, he set up there to his father Glabrio.<note>Valerius Maximus (II. v. 1) says that it was an equestrian statue.</note> It was the latter who had vowed this temple on the day he had fought decisively with King Antiochus at Thermopylae, and he had also let the contract under the authority of the senate.<note>Neither vow nor contract has been mentioned before.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>About the same time that these temples were dedicated, Lucius Aemilius Paulus the proconsul triumphed over the Ligurian Ingauni. He carried in his triumph twenty-five golden crowns, but no other gold or silver was displayed. Many chiefs of the Ligurians as prisoners walked before his car. His donatives to his troops amounted to three hundred <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each.<note>The money apparently came out of the treasury.</note> The glamour of the triumph was increased by the arrival of envoys from the Ligurians who asked for perpetual peace; the Ligurian people, they said, had made up their minds never to take up arms except at the command of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Quintus Fabius the praetor, by order of the senate, answered the Ligurians to the effect that this declaration on the part of the Ligurians was nothing new; but it was of the greatest importance to themselves that they should acquire a new disposition, consistent with their words. They should go to the consuls and do whatever was ordered by them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate, he said, would believe a statement from no one except the consuls that the Ligurians were at peace in genuine good faith. There was peace among the Ligurians. In Corsica there was a battle with the Corsicans: the praetor Marcus Pinarius killed about two thousand of them in pitched battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Under the compulsion of this disaster, they <pb id="p.107"/>gave hostages and a hundred thousand pounds of<note type="margin">B.C. 181</note> wax.<note>Cf. XLII. vii. 2. Diodorus (V. xiii. 4) speaks of wax as an important part of the wealth of the island.</note> Thence Pinarius crossed to Sardinia and fought successfully with the Ilienses, a tribe not even to-day entirely pacified.<note>Diodorus (V. xv. 6) says that they retained their freedom <foreign lang="greek">me/xri tw=n kaq' h(ma=s xro/nwn,</foreign> <quote>up to our own times.</quote></note> One hundred hostages the same year were returned to the Carthaginians,<note>According to XXX. xxxvii. 6 they gave only one hundred hostages and in XXXII. ii. 3 the return of that number is recorded.</note> and the Roman people kept the peace for them with regard to not only to themselves but also to King Masinissa, who was holding with an armed guard the land which was in dispute.<note>Cf. xvii. 6 above.</note></p> 
				<p>XXXV. The consuls had a quiet province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcus Baebius, who had been recalled to Rome to hold the elections, announced the choice as consuls of Aulus Postumius Albinus Luscus and Gaius Calpurnius Piso. Next the praetors were elected, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, Lucius Postumius Albinus, Publius Cornelius Mammula, Tiberius Minucius Molliculus, Aulus Hostilius Mancinus, Gaius Maenius. All these magistrates were inaugurated on the Ides of March.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In the beginning of this year, the consular year of<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> Aulus Postumius Albinus and Gaius Calpurnius Piso, the consul Aulus Postumius presented to the senate Lucius Minucius, a lieutenant, and two tribunes of the soldiers, Titus Maenius and Lucius Terentius Massiliota, who had come from Quintus Fulvius Flaccus in Nearer Spain. When they had reported the two victories, the submission of Celtiberia, and the accomplishment of the task assigned as his province,<note>With each occurrence of the phrase in this connection, we approach more closely the point where we must translate simply <quote>the subjugation of the province</quote> in the territorial sense: cf. sect. 13 below.</note> and had added that there was no <pb id="p.109"/>need of the pay which was customarily sent or of
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> transportation of grain for the army for that year, they asked the senate, first, that honour should be paid to the immortal gods by reason of these successes and, second, that Quintus Fulvius, on his retirement from the province, should be authorized to bring away the army whose valiant services both he and many praetors before him had enjoyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In addition to the fact that this was right, it was, they said, even almost necessary that this be done: for the soldiers were so set upon it that it seemed impossible to keep them in the province any longer, and it was probable that they would leave there without orders, if they were not discharged, or, if anyone tried to retain them too strictly, that they would flare up in a dangerous mutiny.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The senate decreed to both consuls the Ligurians as their province. Then the praetors cast lots: Aulus Hostilius received the civil jurisdiction, Tiberius Minucius that between citizens and aliens, Publius Cornelius Sicily, Gaius Maenius Sardinia. Lucius Postumius drew the lot for Farther Spain and Tiberius Sempronius for Nearer Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Since he was to succeed Quintus Fulvius, in order that his province might not be deprived of the veteran army, <quote>I ask of you, Lucius Minucius,</quote> he said, <quote>since you report that the province is subjugated, whether you think that the Celtiberians will keep forever their pledge of loyalty, so that this province can be held without an army. If you can neither undertake nor assert anything to us about the loyalty of the barbarians, and think that under any conditions we must keep an army there, I ask whether you urge the senate to send replacements to Spain, so that only those troops who have completed their terms of service may be <pb id="p.111"/>discharged and the recruits mingled with the veteran<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> soldiers, or to withdraw the veteran legions from the province and enroll and send over new legions, although an army of recruits, being looked down upon by the enemy, can rouse to rebellion barbarians even more fully tamed than these?
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It is easier to talk about than to accomplish-this subjugation of a province fierce by nature and rebellious. A few cities, as at least I hear, which the neighbourhood of the winter-quarters kept most completely under control, have come under our rule and sway; the more remote are in arms.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Since this is so, conscript Fathers, I declare to you here and now that I shall administer my office with the army that is now there; if Flaccus brings back with him his legions, I shall lead the troops into winter-quarters in pacified districts and shall expose no raw troops to a most warlike enemy.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To the question that had been put to him the lieutenant replied that neither he nor anyone else could predict what the Celtiberians had or would have in mind. Therefore he could not deny that it was entirely proper that an army should be sent to barbarians who, even though pacified, were not yet well accustomed to authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But whether it was necessary to employ a new or an old army was for him
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to say who could know how loyally the Celtiberians would abide by the peace and who at the same time could assure himself that the soldiers would remain quiet if they were held longer in the province. If inferences could be drawn as to their views either from what they said to one another or from their exclamations while the commander was addressing them, he said that they had openly proclaimed that they would either keep the <pb id="p.113"/>commander in the province or go to Italy with him.<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This colloquy between the praetor and the lieutenant was interrupted by a motion by the consuls, who judged it proper that their provinces should be provided for<note>The technical term for the equipment and supply of a military force.</note> before the question of an army for a praetor was raised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> An entire new army was decreed to the consuls, two Roman legions for each, with the appropriate cavalry, and of the allies of the Latin confederacy, as great a number as always, fifteen thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry.<note>This number of Latins was normally provided for each consul.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With this army they were directed to make war upon the Ligurian Apuani. The <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Publius Cornelius and Marcus Baebius was prolonged, and they were ordered to hold the province until the arrival of the consuls; then it was directed that they discharge the armies which they had and return to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then the question of an army for Tiberius Sempronius was taken up. The consuls were directed to enlist for him a new legion of fifty-two hundred infantry and four hundred<note>The cavalry contingent is unusually large.</note> cavalry and in addition a thousand Roman infantry and fifty cavalry, and to levy upon the allies of the Latin confederacy for seven thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry. With this army it was the senate's pleasure that Tiberius Sempronius should go to Nearer Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Permission was granted to Quintus Fulvius that those, whether Roman citizens or allies, who had been taken to Spain before the consulship of Spurius Postumius and Quintus Marcius,<note>They were consuls in <date value="-186">186 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. viii. 1).</note> and, moreover, when the new drafts were added, in consequence of which
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> addition there were in the two legions more than ten thousand four hundred infantry and six hundred cavalry and of the allies <pb id="p.115"/>of the Latin confederacy more than twelve<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry, and specifically those whose valiant services Quintus Fulvius had enjoyed in the two battles with the Celtiberians, that all these,

						<p>The sentence is awkward but the general purport is clear. When the old army and the new had been merged, and troops that had been in Spain at least since <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date> had been segregated, any surplus beyond the figures given for the several contingents might be discharged also, priority being given to those who had been decorated or cited in the campaign.</p> 
						<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The mutiny here threatened was avoided (xl. 14 below). One may suspect that to win popularity with his troops Flaccus had encouraged the threats of his troops and had tried to bluff the senate with the prospect
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> of a mutiny.</p></note> if he saw fit, he should bring back with him. Thanksgivings were also decreed because he had conducted the business of the state successfully. The other praetors too
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> were sent to their provinces. The <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Quintus Fabius Buteo in Gaul was prolonged. It was decided that there should be only eight legions that year in addition to the veteran army which was among the Ligurians in the hope of an early discharge. And even this army was with difficulty raised on account of the pestilence which was
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> now for the third year devastating the city of Rome and Italy.<note>Cf. xix. 3 above.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetor Tiberius Minucius died and not much later the consul Gaius Calpurnius, and many other distinguished men of all ranks. Finally the disaster came to be regarded as a portent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gaius Servilius the pontifex maximus was directed to inquire into the manner of averting the wrath of the gods and the decemvirs to look into the Books; the consul was ordered to vow gifts and to give gilded statues to Apollo, Aesculapius and Salus;<note>The combination of Salus with two Greek gods indicates that the Roman Salus is not meant but the Greek Hygieia; the order then probably came from the Sibylline Books.</note> these he vowed and gave.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The decemvirs proclaimed a two day period of prayer for health, not only in the City but in all the rural settlements and communities; all people above the age of twelve, wearing garlands <pb id="p.117"/>and carrying laurel branches in their hands, made<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> the supplication.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover, the suspicion that human guilt was to blame had entered men's minds; and the investigation of the poisonings which had taken place in the City or nearer to it than ten miles was, by decree of the senate, entrusted to the praetor Gaius Claudius, who had been chosen to succeed Tiberius Minuicius, and beyond the tenth milestone throughout the rural settlements and communities, to Gaius Maenius before he departed for Sardinia. The death of the consul was especially suspicious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was said to have been killed by his wife Quarta Hostilia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When indeed her son Quintus Fulvius Flaccus<note>The Flaccus of xxvii. 7 above, not his cousin, who was still in Spain.</note> was proclaimed consul in place of his stepfather, the death of Piso began to cause many more ugly rumours; and witnesses came forth who said that after Albinus and Piso had been declared consuls at an election in which Flaccus had suffered defeat, Flaccus had been upbraided by his mother because this was now the third time<note>The dates of the defeats are not recorded, but he was praetor in <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date> Hostilia (or Livy) does not say how she proposed to insure his success the next time.</note> that his candidacy for the consulship had been refused; let him, she had added, prepare to apply again: within two months she would bring it to pass that he should become consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Among much other testimony bearing on the case, this one speech, being all too well confirmed by the actual result, availed to bring about the conviction of Hostilia.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In the beginning of this spring, while the levy was detaining the new consuls in Rome and then the death of one and the election to choose a new consul in his place had caused delay in all business of state, in the interval Publius Cornelius
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> and Marcus Baebius, who had in their consulship done nothing worth recording, led the army against the Ligurian Apuani.</p> <pb id="p.119"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Ligurians, who had not anticipated<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> a war before the arrival of the consuls in the province, were taken off their guard and surrendered, to the number of about twelve thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First consulting the senate by letter, Cornelius and Baebius determined to move them down from the mountains to lands on the plains, far from home, that there might be no hope of return, thinking that there would be no end to the Ligurian war until this was done. There was public land belonging to the Roman people among the Samnites, which had belonged to the Taurasini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since they wished to transfer the Ligurian Apuani there, they issued an edict that the Ligurian Apuani should come down from the mountains, bringing their wives and children, and should transport all their property with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Ligurians made frequent entreaties through ambassadors that they might not be compelled to leave their household gods, the land in which they had been born, the tombs of their ancestors, and also promised arms and hostages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they met with no success and lacked the strength to fight, they obeyed the edict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There were transferred at public expense about forty thousand freemen with their women and children. One hundred and fifty thousand sesterces<note>The denomination (sesterces and not <hi rend="italics">asses</hi>) is inferred mainly from <hi rend="italics">argenti.</hi></note> of silver were appropriated, with which they could buy what was necessary for their new homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the apportionment of the land and the division of the money, the same Cornelius and Baebius who had made the transfer were appointed.<note>Pliny (<hi rend="italics">H.N.</hi> III. 105) says that these Ligurians were called <hi rend="italics">Corneliani et Baebiani.</hi></note> Nevertheless, at their request, a commission of five was named, on whose advice they might act.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When, after completing <pb id="p.121"/>this task, they had brought back the veteran army,<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> a triumph was voted by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were the first of all to triumph without waging a war.<note>Cf. XXXVII. lx. 6; XXXVIII. xlvii. 5 and the notes.</note> Only the victims were led before the car, since there had been nothing in their triumphs which could be carried, could be led, or could be given to the soldiers.<note>That is, no booty, prisoners, animals, or money.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same year, in Spain, Fulvius Flaccus the proconsul,<note>Not the consul of the year; the proper title would be propraetor.</note> because his successor was slow in arriving in the province, led the army out of winter-quarters and began to devastate the remoter regions of Celtiberia whence the inhabitants had not come to surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By this act he stirred up rather than terrified the spirits of the barbarians; and secretly massing their forces they blocked the Manlian<note>Neither its position nor the reason for its name is known.</note> pass, through which they well knew that the Roman army would march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Gracchus had entrusted to his colleague Lucius Postumius Albinus, who was going to Farther Spain, a message for Quintus Fulvius, instructing him to conduct the army to Tarraco; there he planned to discharge the veterans and assign the replacements and organize the entire army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Also the day, and that quite near, was announced to Flaccus, on which his successor would arrive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The arrival of this news compelled Flaccus, abandoning the plan which he had begun to follow, hastily to lead the army out of Celtiberia, and the barbarians, ignorant of the reason and thinking that he had heard of their revolt and their secret mobilization and was frightened away, on that account occupied the pass more eagerly. When the Roman column at daybreak entered the pass the enemy, suddenly showing <pb id="p.123"/>themselves on two sides, attacked the Romans.<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Flaccus saw this he quelled the first excitement in the column by issuing through the centurions orders that
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> all should halt, each in his own place, and should make ready their arms, and having collected the trains and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the pack-animals in one place, partly by himself, partly through the lieutenants and tribunes of the soldiers, he formed all the forces in line of battle as the time and the place demanded, without any confusion, reminding them that they had to
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> deal with men who had twice surrendered, that an access of villainy and treachery, not of courage and stoutness of heart, had come to them, and that they furnished the Romans an opportunity to make an ignoble<note>If the text is right it must mean that the soldiers had one final chance to distinguish themselves. It will be noted that Fulvius still speaks of the army's return to Rome, although he knew something of the plan of Gracchus.</note> return home glorious and memorable: for they would carry to Rome for the triumph swords bloody with fresh slaughter of the enemy and spoils dripping with gore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The time did not permit him to say more: the enemy was charging and on the extreme flanks the battle was already in progress. Then the battle-lines clashed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was a fierce fight on every side, but the results varied. The legions fought nobly and not less effectively the two squadrons;<note>That is, the Latin allies: cf. XXXI. xxi. 7 and the note.</note> the auxiliaries from the province were hard pressed by men armed in the same way but consisting of a much better class of soldiers, and could not hold their ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the Celtiberians saw that with battle-lines arrayed and in pitched battle they
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> were not a match for the legions, they made a thrust with the wedge, in which manner of fighting they are so powerful that against whatever troops they drive their charge they cannot be checked. Then even the legions were thrown into disorder and the line was almost broken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When <pb id="p.125"/>Flaccus saw this disorganization, he rode on his horse<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> to the legionary cavalry and shouted, <quote>Unless there is some hope of aid in you, now all will be over with this army.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When from all sides a shout was raised asking him why he did not say what he wanted done, and they would execute his orders without delay, <quote>double the squadrons,</quote><note>The phrase <hi rend="italics">duplicate turmas</hi> seems not to occur elsewhere and one can only guess at the precise meaning. Its intention was to increase the striking force of the cavalry charge by making the formation more compact, perhaps by diminishing the intervals between files. The strength of the units could not be increased.</note> he said, <quote>you cavalry of the two legions, and turn your horses loose against the wedge of the enemy, with which they are forcing back our men.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> You will do this with the greater weight if you will give your horses loose rein against them; and this the records say that Roman cavalry have often done and won great glory for themselves.</quote><note>There seems to be no support for this assertion.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They obeyed his order and, dropping their reins, twice, from this side and from that, drove through, causing great slaughter to the enemy and breaking every one of their spears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The wedge having been scattered, in which all their hope had rested, the Celtiberians were in panic, and almost giving up the fight were looking for a place for flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And when the cavalry of the allies saw that the Roman cavalry had performed so memorable an exploit, they too, inspired by the valour of the others, without waiting for an order let their horses loose upon the broken enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then indeed all the Celtiberians were turned to flight, and the Roman commander, seeing the backs of the enemy, vowed a temple to Fortuna Equestris<note>Cf. xliv. 9 below and the note.</note> and games to Jupiter Optimus Maximus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Celtiberians were slaughtered as they scattered in flight through the whole defile. Seventeen thousand of the enemy are reported to have been killed that day, more than <pb id="p.127"/>three thousand seven hundred taken alive, and there<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> were captured seventy-seven military standards and about six hundred horses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The victorious army remained that day in its own camp. The victory was not without loss of soldiers: four hundred and seventy-two Roman soldiers fell, of the allies of the Latin confederacy one thousand and nineteen, and in addition three thousand of the auxiliary troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> So the victorious army, having won once more its former glory, was conducted to Tarraco.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Tiberius Sempronius the praetor, who had arrived two days earlier, went out to meet Fulvius on his arrival and congratulated him on his conspicuous success in defence of the state. In perfect harmony they arranged which soldiers they should discharge and which they should hold in service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then Fulvius embarked the discharged troops on ships and set out for Rome and Sempronius led the legions into Celtiberia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The two consuls led their armies against the Ligurians from different directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Postumius, with the first and third legions, attacked the mountains of Ballista and Letum, and by blocking with guards their narrow passes cut the enemy off from supplies and subdued them because of their complete lack of everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Fulvius, with the second and fourth legions, attacking from the side of Pisa the Ligurian Apuani (those of that people who lived along the Macra river), after receiving the surrender of about seven thousand men, loaded them on boats and sent them along the shore of the Tuscan sea to Naples.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thence they were transferred to Samnium and given <pb id="p.129"/>land among their countrymen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Aulus Postumius<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> destroyed the vineyards and burned the crops of the Ligurians of the mountains until, compelled by the disasters of war, they submitted and gave up their weapons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then Postumius proceeded by boat to explore the coast of the Ligurian Ingauni and Intemelii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Before these consuls<note>The text and the meaning are alike uncertain. By <hi rend="italics">hi consules</hi> one would infer that A. Postumius and Q. Fulvius were meant, but just below A. Postumius is named as the commander of troops at Pisa which belonged to the army of Q. Fulvius. Possibly <hi rend="italics">hi consoles venirent</hi> should have been singular, referring to Fulvius, and the meaning is that Postumius preceded Fulvius to the province and assumed command temporarily of both consular armies. It is also possible that the name A. Postumius in this sentence is an error, or that another man of the name is meant, whom Livy fails to distinguish from the consul. If it is the consul, he took emergency action, notified the proper commander (Fulvius) of the troops concerned, and then proposed the exile of Nobilior.</note> came to the army which was mobilized at Pisa, Aulus Postumius was incommand. The brother of Quintus Fulvius, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior<note>The brother of either Q. Fulvius Flaccus &mdash;the consul of <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date> or the consul of <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date>, who was at this time still in Spain or on the way back
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;should have had the <hi rend="italics">cognomen</hi> Flaccus, unless he had been adopted by some Fulvius Nobilior, and of such an adoption there is no record. There is moreover no Q. Fulvius Nobilior known to have lived at this time. One naturally assumes from Livy's language here that Q. <hi rend="italics">Fulvii</hi> refers to the consul of <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date>, but no brother Marcus is mentioned elsewhere. The consul of <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> had a brother Marcus (xxx. 4 above), but it is not likely that after serving in some unspecified capacity under his brother in Spain in <date value="-181">181 B.C.</date> he should have served as military tribune under his cousin in <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date> in Italy. The consul of <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date>, during his censorship in <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date>, expelled from the senate his own brother, and Valerius Maximus (II. vii. 5, repeated by Frontinus, <hi rend="italics">Strat.</hi> IV. i. 31) asserts that the degradation was due to the discharge of a legion of which he was military tribune. The brother is called simply Fulvius, with no <hi rend="italics">praenomen.</hi> Livy (XLI. xxvii. 2) and Velleius (I. x. 6) likewise refer to the expulsion, the former calling the brother L. Fulvius and the latter Cn. Fulvius; neither gives any explanation of the censor's action. The evidence therefore is so contradictory as to produce hopeless confusion. All one can say is that at this time Livy apparently thought that the tribune was the brother of the consul under whom he served. In this connection, I believe that it has not been pointed out that the other censor of <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date> was the other consul of <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date>, who, in sect. 10 below, procured the banishment of Nobilior. Perhaps he was actually more responsible than his colleague for the degradation. The <hi rend="italics">cognomen</hi> Nobilior remains unexplained on any hypothesis.</note> &mdash;this Fulvius was tribune of the soldiers of the second legion &mdash;during his months<note>The six tribunes in each legion rotated in the command of the entire legion.</note> dismissed the legion, binding the centurions by an oath that they would turn the money in to the quaestors for
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the treasury.<note>This must be the portion of the pay which had not yet been distributed to the troops: cf. sect. 11 below.</note> When this was announced <pb id="p.131"/>to Aulus at Placentia &mdash;for he had happened to go<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> there &mdash;following with the light cavalry the men who had been released, he punished and brought back to Pisa those of them whom he could overtake; as to the rest, he notified
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the consul. On his motion the senate passed a decree that Marcus Fulvius should be banished to Spain beyond New Carthage;<note>This is one of the earliest examples of <hi rend="italics">relegatio.</hi></note> and a letter was given to him by the consul for delivery to Publius Manlius in Farther Spain; the soldiers were ordered to return to
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the standards. As a mark of disgrace it was voted that the legion should receive only six months' pay for that year: the consul was directed to sell the person and property of any soldier who had not returned to the army.<note>The punishment of the soldiers seems relatively too severe, since in general they followed the instructions of presumably competent authority. The action of Nobilior, so far as one can judge, was entirely irregular, even if it was not technically illegal: probably no one had ever considered such an offence as possible and had prescribed no penalty. But the text of the entire chapter is so uncertain that one cannot feel sure that the episode is clearly and correctly interpreted.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same year Lucius Duronius, who had been praetor the year before, returned from Illyricum to Brundisium with ten ships. Thence, leaving the ships in port, he went to Rome, and in the course of his narrative of what he had done there he pointed in no uncertain manner at Gentius, king of the Illyrians,<note>Polybius (XXXII. xviii) calls him more exactly king of the Dalmatians.</note> as the cause of all the brigandage by sea:

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In that year for the first time a motion was proposed by Lucius Villius, tribune of the people, fixing the ages at which each magistracy might be <pb id="p.139"/>sought and held.<note>Livy's account of this important legislation is disappointingly brief. It seems that custom had in the past established a sequence of offices and had regulated the intervals which should separate them. Yet such important questions as re-elections and tenure of two offices simultaneously had required legislative enactment in the past. Such principles as that the people should have the privilege of electing its favourites regardless of technicalities (XXXII. vii. 8-11; XXXIX. xxxix and the notes) had caused great confusion. The <hi rend="italics">lex Villia</hi> established minimum ages for the several magistracies, thus fixing a definite sequence of offices (which developed gradually into the <hi rend="italics">cursus honorum</hi>), and provided that two-year intervals should separate successive offices.</note> From this fact a <hi rend="italics">cognomen</hi> was given<note type="margin">B.C. 180</note> to his family, so that its members were called <hi rend="italics">Annales.</hi>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>To Quintus Fulvius and Lucius Manlius the consuls<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> the same province which their predecessors had held was decreed with the same numbers of troops, infantry and cavalry, citizens and allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the two Spains the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Tiberius Sempronius and Lucius Postumius was prolonged, and they were to keep the same armies which they had;

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius Mucius Scaevola received by lot the civil jurisdiction and also the duty of enquiring into cases of poisoning in the city and within a distance of ten miles from the city, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio that between citizens and aliens, Quintus Mucius Scaevola Sicily, Gaius Valerius Laevinus Sardinia.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Quintus Fulvius the consul said that before he brought up any matter of public business he wished to free himself and the state of an obligation to the <pb id="p.141"/>gods by fulfilling his vows.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As to the cost, the limit was set that a greater sum might not be spent for the games than the amount that had been decreed to Fulvius Nobilior<note>Cf. XXXIX. v. 7-10 and the notes.</note> when he gave his games after the Aetolian war, and it was voted too that he should not invite, compel or accept

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so a darkness which came on suddenly and a violent tempest broke up the Latin festival on the mountain,<note>The Alban mountain: XXXII. i. 9 and the note.</note> and the festival was repeated by decree of the pontiff.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Next the election of censors was held: the successful candidates were Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the <hi rend="italics">pontifex maximus,</hi> and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who had triumphed over the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Between these distinguished men there was a feud, exhibited on many occasions, both in the senate and before the assembly, by numerous bitter quarrels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the election was over the censors, as the custom was from olden times, took their seats on curule chairs by the altar of Mars in the Campus; thither suddenly came the chiefs of the senators, accompanied by a throng of citizens, and one of them, Quintus Caecilius Metellus,<note>Probably the consul of <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>, and so a man of great age and dignity.</note> spoke thus:</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>We have not forgotten, censors, that a little while ago you were placed, by the entire Roman people, in control of our manners, and that we should be both admonished and governed by you, not you by us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nevertheless, it should be pointed out what it is in you two that offends all good men or at least what they would prefer to see modified.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When we look at you singly, Marcus Aemilius and Marcus Fulvius, we find no one in the state to-day whom, <pb id="p.145"/>if we should be recalled to vote, we should wish to<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> have preferred to you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When we look at both of you together, we cannot but fear that you may prove to have been badly mated and that less good may come to the state because you are so eminently pleasing to all of us than harm because each of you displeases the other.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For many years you have been keeping alive a feud, a serious and dreadful thing for you yourselves, and there is danger that from this day it may become more harmful to us and to the state than to you. As to the reasons why we fear this, many occur to me which might be mentioned were it not that passions perhaps not to be appeased beset your minds.<note>I have tried to give a meaning to this passage, although corruption no doubt still remains. If there is a lacuna after <hi rend="italics">dicerentur,</hi> an additional clause like <quote>and which you would yourselves recognize</quote> should be inserted at that point.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We one and all beg you to-day that in this consecrated spot you will end this quarrel,
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> and that you will permit those men whom the Roman people by their votes has associated together, to be associated by us in this restoration of good feeling also; that with one mind and one policy you may choose the senate, review the <hi rend="italics">equites,</hi> hold the census and close the <hi rend="italics">lustrum</hi>;
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that what you will say in almost every prayer you make, 'that this
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> may turn out well and successfully for me and for my colleague in office,' you will truly and with all your hearts desire to be fulfilled, and that you will so act that we men may believe that you also desire that for which you have prayed to the gods. Titus Tatius and Romulus, in whose city they had clashed as enemies in battle in the middle of the Forum, reigned there in harmony.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Not merely feuds but even wars draw to an end; many times from bitter foes men become faithful allies, sometimes even fellow <pb id="p.147"/>citizens.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Albans when Alba was destroyed were<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> transferred to Rome, the Latins and the Sabines were received into citizenship. There was a common saying which had passed into a proverb because it was true, that our friendships should be immortal, but mortal our enmities.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A roar of applause burst out, and then the speech was broken off by the voices of the whole crowd, demanding the same thing and merging into one sound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then Aemilius complained both of other things and particularly because he had twice been kept by Marcus Fulvius from the consulship which was assured him; Fulvius on his side complained that he had always been harassed by Aemilius and that the <hi rend="italics">sponsio</hi> had been proposed to his shame.<note>The <hi rend="italics">sponsio</hi> was a sort of wager at law, each of the parties agreeing that the loser in the contest should pay a stated sum to the winner. The incident here referred to has not been mentioned before, unless it was part of the episode narrated in XXXIX. iv.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Nevertheless each stated that if the other was willing he was ready to put himself in the hands of all the leading men of the state. At the instance of all who were present, they sincerely exchanged hand-clasps and pledges, forgave one another, and ended their feud.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After that, followed by the applause of all, they were escorted to the Capitoline. Both the interest of the leaders in such a situation and the readiness of the censors to yield were notably approved and lauded by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Then, on the demand of the censors that the sum of money which they were to use on public works be assigned them, one year's revenue was decreed to them.<note>Livy has not mentioned a corresponding sum before. The censors of <date value="-169">169 B.C.</date> received the revenue for half a year (XLIV. xvi. 9). There is no translation of the expression into definite figures until <date value="-62">62 B.C.</date> (Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Pompey,</hi> 45), when one year's revenue amounted to 50,000,000 <hi rend="italics">denarii.</hi> Frank (<hi rend="italics">Economic Survey of Ancient Rome,</hi> Baltimore, 1933, I. 152-153) estimates the revenue in <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> as perhaps one-tenth of that sum. He further calculates that the <hi rend="italics">Basilica</hi> <hi rend="italics">Aemilia</hi> (li. 5 below) would have cost 12,000 <hi rend="italics">denarii,</hi> so that a good deal could be done with 5,000,000 <hi rend="italics">denarii.</hi></note></p>

Then, accepting hostages and leaving a garrison, he captured fortresses and burned the countryside until he came to another very powerful town which the Celtiberians call Certima.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, just as he was moving up his siege-engines, ambassadors came from the town, whose speech had the ring of old-fashioned frankness, and they did not disguise the fact that they would fight to the end if they had the strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For they asked that they might be permitted to go to the camp of the Celtiberians to summon aid; if they did not obtain it then they would consult by themselves and apart from the Celtiberians. When Gracchus granted this they departed and a few days later brought with them ten other ambassadors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was the hour of noon. They asked nothing from the praetor at first, except that he should order that they be given something to drink. Having quaffed the first cups they asked for a second drink, to the accompaniment of great laughter on the part of the bystanders at such uncultured natures, ignorant of all etiquette.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the eldest of them said: <quote>We have been sent by our people to ascertain on what in the world it is that you rely in attacking us.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To this question Gracchus replied that he came relying on an excellent army; if they wished to see it, in order to make a more trustworthy report to their people, he would give them the opportunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He ordered the tribunes of <pb id="p.151"/>the soldiers to command all the forces of infantry and<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> cavalry to equip themselves and to march in review under arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After this spectacle the ambassadors were sent away and discouraged their people from sending aid to the besieged city. The townspeople, after vainly building fires on their towers at night, which had been the signal agreed upon, finding themselves destitute of their one hope of assistance, surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Twenty-four thousand <hi rend="italics">nummi</hi> were demanded of them, and forty of their noblest knights, not expressly as hostages &mdash;for they were ordered to do military duty<note>The money was not tribute, since the forty <hi rend="italics">equites</hi> were not hostages, and the status of the city is peculiar.</note> &mdash;yet in the very nature of the situation as a guarantee of loyalty.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From there he next led his troops to the town of Alce, where the camp of the Celtiberians lay from which the ambassadors had recently come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he had harried them with skirmishes for some time, sending his light troops against their outposts, he was daily engaging in battle on a larger scale, that he might draw them all outside their defences.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he saw that what he was seeking had been sufficiently achieved, he ordered the commanders of the auxiliaries that, letting the conflict flag as if they were overcome by superior numbers, they should suddenly turn their backs and flee headlong to the camp; he himself formed his troops inside the rampart at all the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> No long time passed when, as agreed, he saw the column of his own fugitives and behind them, pursuing in loose order, the barbarians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had formed his line within the rampart for just this purpose. And so, waiting only long enough to allow his troops to escape into the camp through an <pb id="p.153"/>open entrance, raising a shout he burst out from all the<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> gates at once. The enemy did not withstand the unexpected attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Those who had come to capture the camp could not even defend their own: for at once they were repulsed and routed, presently driven in terror within the rampart, and finally stripped of their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That day nine thousand of the enemy were killed; three hundred and twenty were taken alive, and a hundred and twelve horses and thirty-seven military standards were captured. Of the Roman army one hundred and nine fell.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this battle Gracchus led the legions to ravage Celtiberia. And while he was carrying and driving off everything everywhere and the tribes were submitting to the yoke, some voluntarily and others in fear, he received the surrender of a hundred and three<note>Polybius (XXVI. iv) puts the number at 300, causing Posidonius (in Strabo, III. iv. 14) to remark mockingly <foreign lang="greek">tou\s pu/rgous kalou=nta po/leis.</foreign></note> towns within a few days and gained an immense amount of booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he turned the column back toward Alce whence he had come, and began to invest that town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The citizens sustained the first assault of the enemy; then, when they were now being attacked, not by arms alone, but also by siege-works, despairing of protecting the town they all retired to the citadel; finally even from there they sent ambassadors out to plead for them and entrusted themselves and all their possessions to the dominion of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Much booty was taken there. Many noble prisoners came into Roman hands, among them two sons and a daughter of Thurrus. He was the chieftain of these tribes and by far the most powerful man of all the Spaniards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After he had heard of the loss of his people he sent to ask for a safeguard if he came to the camp to see Gracchus, and then came. And first he asked whether it was permitted to him <pb id="p.155"/>and his children to live.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the praetor had<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> replied that he should live, he next asked whether it was permitted to serve with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When Gracchus granted this too, <quote>I shall follow you, then,</quote> he said, <quote>against my old allies, since they have disdained to take up arms for me.</quote> Thenceforth he followed the Romans, and with courageous and constant help aided the Roman cause in many places.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ergavica next, a renowned and powerful city, having been terrified by the fall of other peoples around them, opened its gates to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some writers say that these surrenders of towns were not made in good faith: that there was immediate rebellion in every region from which Gracchus had withdrawn his legions, and that later, in a great battle in the Chaunus mountains, he fought with the Celtiberians from daybreak to the sixth hour of the day in pitched battle with heavy losses on both sides;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that the Romans gave no conspicuous indication which would lead one to believe that they were victorious except that the next day they harried the enemy, who remained within the rampart;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that all through that day they collected spoils; that on the third day another and greater battle was fought and this time at length the Celtiberians were undoubtedly beaten and their camp taken and plundered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Twenty-two thousand of the enemy, these writers report, were killed that day and more than three hundred captured, together with an equal number of horses and seventy-two military standards. From that time, they say, the war was over and the Celtiberians kept true peace, not with wavering loyalty <pb id="p.157"/>as before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They write that in the same summer<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> Lucius Postumius also, in Farther Spain, twice fought successfully with the Vaccaei; that he had slain about thirty-five thousand of the enemy and taken their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is nearer the truth to say that he came to the province too late to have been able to accomplish anything that summer.<note>Livy says nothing on his own authority about the campaigns of Postumius, and gives no reasons for his doubt of the accuracy of the accounts which he has just quoted. In his zeal to refute them he overlooks the fact that this was the second summer of Postumius in Spain, and that even in the first summer he had arrived there earlier than Gracchus (xxxix. 3 above).</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Moreover, one of the censors, Marcus<note type="margin">B.C 179</note> Aemilius, asked the senate that money should be assigned to him for the games in connection with the dedication of the temples which he had vowed to Queen Juno and Diana eight years before in the Ligurian war.<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Two days after the censors chose the senate, Quintus Fulvius the consul set out against the Ligurians, making his way with his army across the pathless mountains and crossing the pass of Ballista, and fought a pitched battle with the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he not only conquered them on the field but captured their camp the same day. Three thousand two hundred of the enemy and all this region of the Ligurians surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul transferred the surrendered to lands in the plains<note>That is, in their own territory.</note> and set garrisons over the mountains. Quickly, too, dispatches from the province came to Rome; a thanksgiving for three days was decreed because of these successes, and the praetors sacrificed forty full-grown victims in the course of the thanksgiving.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul, Lucius Manlius, did nothing worth recording among the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The transalpine Gauls, three thousand in number, crossing into Italy and harrying no one in war, asked land from the consuls and the senate, that they might live in peace under the rule of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate ordered them to leave Italy, and instructed the consul Quintus Fulvius to search out and punish the leaders and proposers of the plan to cross the Alps.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same year<note>The narrative of affairs in the east is resumed after having been broken off at xxiv. 8 above.</note> Philip, king of the Macedonians, died, broken down by age and grief at the death of his son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was wintering at Demetrias, <pb id="p.165"/>distressed both by longing for his son and by<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> repentance<note>Diodorus (XXIX. xxv) says of him: <foreign lang="greek">th=| de\ lu/ph| a)diorqw/tws kate/streye to\n bi/on.</foreign></note> of his own cruelty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His mind was further disturbed, firstly by his other son, who was already and beyond doubt the king, both in his own opinion and that of others, the eyes of all being turned upon him, secondly, by the loneliness of his own old age, since some were waiting for his death and others not even waiting for it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All this caused him the more distress, as it did to Antigonus the son of Echecrates, who bore the name of his uncle Antigonus, the guardian of Philip, a man of regal dignity, and renowned also for the famous battle against Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian.<note>Cf. XXXIV. xxviii. 1.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The surname <quote>the guardian</quote><note>Livy's <hi rend="italics">Tutor</hi> does not really correspond to the Greek <foreign lang="greek">Dw/swn</foreign>; <quote>always promising,</quote> which according to Plutarch <hi rend="italics">Coriolanus</hi> 11 was given in mockery. (One is tempted to read <hi rend="italics">Daturum,</hi> which would correspond, for <hi rend="italics">Tutorem</hi> &mdash;E. H. Warmington.)</note> was given him by the Greeks to distinguish him from the other of that
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> name. The younger Antigonus, the son of his brother Echecrates, of all the friends whom Philip had honoured, alone remained uncorrupted, and this loyalty to Philip had made Perseus, under no circumstances a friend, a most deadly
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> foe. Foreseeing in his mind with how great danger to himself the inheritance of the kingdom would fall to Perseus, as soon as he saw that the mind of the king was wavering and that he sometimes grieved at the loss of his son Demetrius, now by listening to him, now by even provoking him to talk of that rash act, with laments of his own he echoed the laments of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Philip. And while the truth, as usually happens, was offering many foretokens of itself, he aided with all his might in bringing everything to light with greater
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> speed. Suspicion had fallen particularly upon Apelles and Philocles as the instigators of the crime, since they had been the ambassadors to Rome and had brought <pb id="p.167"/>the letter, fatal to Demetrius, which bore the name<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> of Flamininus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That the letter was a forgery, the falsification of a scribe, and the seal a counterfeit, was the muttering of all the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But while the facts were suspected rather than established by proof, Xychus<note>Livy speaks as if the name of Xychus were familiar although he has not mentioned him before. He probably follows Polybius closely but omits a cross-reference.</note> by chance encountered Antigonus and was arrested by him and taken to the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Leaving him in the care of guards, Antigonus went to Philip and addressed him thus: <quote>I seem to have understood from many conversations that you will value it highly if you can learn the whole truth about your sons, which of the two was attacked by the other with treachery and ambush. There is one man in all the world who can untie the knot of this uncertainty, and this man, Xychus, is in your hands.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since he happened to come in my way and has been by me brought to the palace, order him to be summoned.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Xychus was brought before the king, he at first denied everything so irresolutely that it was clear that he would be a ready witness under the stimulus of a little terror. He did not endure even the sight of the torturer and the lash, but set forth the whole sequence of events in the crime of the ambassadors and his own service in connection with it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At once men were sent out to arrest the ambassadors, and Philocles, who was at hand, was seized: Apelles, who had been sent in pursuit of a certain Chaereas, hearing of the testimony of Xychus, crossed to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With regard to Philocles there is no certain information: some say that after boldly denying his guilt at first, when he was confronted with Xychus he did not hold out longer, others assert that he even suffered torture while still making denial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Philip's grief was <pb id="p.169"/>renewed and doubled; and he believed that his<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> unhappiness in his children was the greater because the second remained.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Perseus was informed that everything had been discovered he was indeed too strong to consider that flight was necessary: he arranged only to remain far away, being prepared to defend himself against the flames of burning anger while Philip lived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Philip, although disappointed in the hope of seizing his person for punishment, turned his attention to the course which was still open to him &mdash; of seeing to it that Perseus might not, in addition to impunity, also enjoy the profit of his crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He therefore summoned Antigonus, to whom he was indebted in return for his having exposed the murder, and who, he believed, would be a king about whom the Macedonians need by no means be ashamed or abashed, on account of the recent fame of his uncle Antigonus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>Since I have come to such a state, Antigonus,</quote> he said, <quote>that the bereavement which other parents try to avert cannot but seem to be a blessing, the kingdom which I received from your uncle, held in safe-keeping and even made still greater by his courageous and not merely loyal guardianship, it is in my mind to bequeath to you. I have you alone whom I judge to be worthy of the throne.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If I had no one, I should prefer to have it perish and be destroyed to seeing it become for Perseus the reward of his criminal treachery.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I shall believe that Demetrius is raised from the dead and restored to me if I shall leave you, who alone have wept at the death of an innocent man and for my unfortunate mistake, as a substitute for him.</quote> After saying this he did not cease to distinguish him <pb id="p.171"/>with every mark of honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While Perseus was<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> absent in Thrace, Philip canvassed the cities of Macedonia and recommended Antigonus to the chiefs; and if longer life had been his lot there is no question that he would have left Antigonus in possession of the throne. Setting out from Demetrias, he had been delayed for a very long time at Thessalonica.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When he had come from there to Amphipolis he was seized with a severe illness. But it is evident that his sickness was one of the mind rather than of the body;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and that anxiety and loss of sleep, while again and again the shade and ghost of the innocent son whom he had killed pursued him, brought about his death while calling down dreadful curses upon his other son.<note>Livy is probably thinking of such episodes in tragedy as the curse of Oedipus (Aeschylus, <hi rend="italics">Septem,</hi> etc.).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless Antigonus could possibly have been advanced to the throne if he had been present or even if the death of the king had been made public at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The physician Calligenes, who was in charge of his treatment, without waiting for the death of the king, at the first signs that the case was hopeless sent messengers to Perseus, as he had arranged to do, on relays of horses, and until his arrival concealed the death of the king from all who were outside the palace.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus Perseus caught everyone unprepared and ignorant, and grasped the sceptre which he had won by crime.</p> 
				<p>The death of Philip came at a fortunate time for delaying and for diverting strength from the war.<note>The meaning is uncertain. One naturally expects this to mean the war with Rome, since Livy has been so insistent that Philip would himself have begun the war had he lived a little longer, and no one would infer from Livy's narrative that the war did not actually break out until <date value="-171">171 B.C.</date> The episode of the Bastarnae (note particularly the introductory <hi rend="italics">nam</hi>) which follows seems an insufficient cause for so long a delay, and one is tempted to think that Livy was so conscious of the tragic quality of the action that he, like the tragic poet, could ignore the passage of time.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For a few days later the tribe of the Bastarnae,<note>Cf. v. 10 above.</note> after long solicitation, left their homes and with a great <pb id="p.173"/>number of infantry and cavalry crossed the Hister.<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thence Antigonus<note>Not the Antigonus whom Philip had planned to make his heir.</note> and Cotto came on in advance to bring the word to the king: Cotto was a nobleman among the Bastarnae, Antigonus one of Philip's courtiers who had often been sent with Cotto himself to stir up the Bastarnae. When they were not far from Amphipolis, first the rumour and then the authenticated tidings of the death of the king reached them. This event wholly upset the ordered plan of Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But it had been so arranged that Philip was to guarantee to the Bastarnae a safe passage through Thrace and also supplies. In order that he might be able to accomplish this, he had cultivated the chiefs of these districts with gifts, pledging his word that the Bastarnae would cross their territories peaceably.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It had been his intention to destroy the race of the Dardanians and to give the Bastarnae homes on their lands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From this policy there was a double advantage if, in the first place, the Dardanians, a people always most hostile to Macedonia and watchful for occasions unfavourable to the kings, should be destroyed, and, secondly, if the Bastarnae, leaving their wives and children in Dardania, could be sent to plunder Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was a road, he knew, through the country of the Scordisci to the Adriatic sea and Italy; an army could not be led by any other way.<note>It is perhaps easiest to visualize the geographical background by the use of modern place-names, so far as possible. The Bastarnae lived in what is now Bessarabia, on the Euxine north of the Danube delta. Philip planned to march them through northern Bulgaria, thence perhaps by the Morava valley to the Danube and west by the Danube and Save valleys to the country of the Scordisci, west of Belgrade. From there the Save valley with its continuations leads to Fiume, near the head of the Adriatic. The Dardani, among whom homes for them were to be found, lived in or to the east of the Morava valley. From the standpoint of the Bastarnae, a route following the Danube and Save would have been shorter, but then they would have had no contact with Philip. Some sound geographical knowledge, then, underlies Philip's grandiose plan.</note> The Scordisci <pb id="p.175"/>would readily give a passage to the Bastarnae: for<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> they were not very different in either language or manners;<note>The Bastarnae were Germanic, the Scordisci Gallic, but either Philip or Livy may have been misinformed on that point.</note> and they themselves would join forces with them when they saw the Bastarnae going to plunder a most wealthy people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From that point his plans were adapted to any issue: if the Bastarnae were cut to pieces by the Romans, yet the removal of the Dardani and the booty from the remnants of the Bastarnae and the unhindered occupancy of Dardania would be his consolation;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> if on the other hand success attended their venture, while the attention of the Romans was distracted to the war with the Bastarnae Philip would recover his lost possessions in Greece.<note>Philip then stood to gain heavily in any case, with nothing but the trifling investment necessary to purchase the right of way through Thrace.</note> This was the plan of Philip.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At first the Bastarnae marched with their column peacefully inclined. Then, after the departure of Cotto and Antigonus and, not much later, after the receipt of the news of the death of Philip, neither were the Thracians easy to negotiate with nor could the Bastarnae be satisfied with what they could buy nor could they be kept in column without leaving the line of march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In consequence injuries were inflicted on both sides, and as these increased day by day war flared up. Finally, when the Thracians were unable to withstand the strength and numbers of the enemy, leaving the villages in the plains they fell back to a mountain of great height &mdash;they call it Donuca.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the Bastarnae tried to climb it, they were caught, as they attempted in vain to scale the heights of the mountains, by such a storm as that which, as the story goes, destroyed the Gauls as <pb id="p.177"/>they pillaged Delphi.<note>Cf. Justin XXIV. viii. 9-10.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For not merely were they<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> assailed with a deluge of rain and then masses of hail, along with tremendous crashes in the sky and thunders and lightning-flashes blinding their eyes, but also the bolts flashed all about
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> them so that their own bodies seemed to be the targets, and not only the common soldiers but even the chieftains fell stricken on the ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So when in headlong flight in their blindness they were rushing about and falling over lofty cliffs, the Thracians too came upon them in their panic, but they themselves said that the gods were the causes of their flight and that the skies were falling upon them<note>Cf. Arrian, <hi rend="italics">Anab.</hi> I. iv. 8; <foreign lang="greek">e)/fasan</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">oi( Ke/ltoi</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">dedie/nai mh/pote o( ou)rano\s au)toi=s e)mpe/soi.</foreign></note> Scattered by the tempest, as if after a shipwreck, when many of them, half-armed, had returned to the camp whence they had set out, they began to consider what they should do.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then a disagreement arose, some thinking that they should return home, others that they should make their way into Dardania;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> about thirty thousand men, under the command of Clondicus, arrived at the place for which they had set out, the rest of the population returned to Apollonia and Mesembria<note>These cities were on the Thracian coast of the Euxine.</note> by the way they had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Perseus, having gained the throne, ordered Antigonus<note>The Antigonus whom Philip had chosen as his successor.</note> to be put to death; and until he could strengthen his position he sent ambassadors to Rome to renew his father's friendship and to ask that he be called king by the senate. Such were the events of the year in Macedonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>One of the consuls, Quintus Fulvius, triumphed over the Ligurians; this triumph was clearly due to influence rather than to the greatness of his achievements.<note>Cf. the note to xliii. 4 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He carried in the triumph a great quantity of arms taken from the enemy, <pb id="p.179"/>but practically no money. Still he distributed to the<note type="margin">B.C. 179</note> soldiers three hundred <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each to the infantry, twice that sum to the centurions and thrice to the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nothing in the triumph was more noteworthy than that it happened to occur on the same day on which, in the previous year, he had triumphed after his praetorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After the triumph he announced the elections, at which Marcus Junius Brutus and Aulus Manlius Volso were chosen consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The election of praetors, after three had been chosen, was broken up by a storm.<note>Livy omits to mention the first three praetors (under the <hi rend="italics">lex Baebia</hi> this was the year for six praetors). The names of T. Aebutius and another M. Titinius can be recovered from XLI. vi. 5 and ix. 3 respectively. The sixth may have been P. Aelius Ligur.</note> The following day, this being the fourth day before the Ides of March, the other three were elected, Marcus Titinius Curvus, Tiberius Claudius Nero, Titus Fonteius Capito.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The <hi rend="italics">ludi Romani</hi> were repeated by the curule aediles, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and Appius Claudius Cento, by reason of the prodigies which had occurred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The earth shook; in the shrines of the gods, when the <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> was being held, the heads of the gods who were on the couches turned away, and the platter with its lids which had been set before Jupiter fell from the table.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was also interpreted as a portent that the mice tasted the olives.<note>Cf. XXVII. xxiii. 2.</note> To make atonement for them, nothing else was done than to repeat the Games.</p>

				<p>When Philip ordered that the children of the noblemen
					whom he had in prison should be sought out to be put
					to death, Theoxena, fearing for her children, who were
					still young, the lust of the king, placing before them swords
					and a cup which contained poison, advised them to
					escape by death the outrage which now threatened
					them, and when she had persuaded them she also slew
					herself. The rivalries between Perseus and Demetrius,
					the sons of Philip, king of Macedonia, are related; and
					how, by the treachery of his brother and on false charges,
					among them a charge of parricide and of an attempt to seize
					the throne, Demetrius was first accused and finally,
					since he was friendly to the Roman people, put to death
					by poison, and the kingdom of Macedonia, on the death
					of Philip, went to Perseus. The book also contains the
					events among the Ligurians and the victories over the
					Celtiberians in Spain. The colony of Aquileia was
					founded. The books of Numa Pompilius, locked up in
					a stone chest, written in both Greek and Latin, were
					found by the husbandmen on the property of Lucius
					Petilius, a public clerk, at the foot of the Janiculan.
					Since in them there were many things subversive of
					religion, the praetor to whom they had been turned over,
					after reading them, gave his oath to the senate that it
					was against the public interest that they should be read
					and preserved. Under a decree of the senate they were

To oppose the fleet of the Illyrians <hi rend="italics">duumviri navales</hi> had been elected, who, with twenty ships to protect the coast of the upper<note>The Adriatic.</note> <pb id="p.187"/>sea, were to make Ancona the hinge or pivot,<note>Cf. XL. xviii. 8 and the note.</note> so<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> to speak; thence Lucius Cornelius<note>Cf. XL. xlii. 8.</note> was to defend the coast to the right as far as Tarentum, Gaius Furius the coast to the left as far as Aquileia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These ships were sent to the nearest harbour in Histrian territory with transports and a large quantity of supplies, and the consul, following with the legions, encamped about five miles from the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In a short time a market, visited by throngs, was established at the harbor, and from there everything was transported to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And in order that this might be done in greater safety, outposts were established on all sides of the camp: facing Histria there was a permanent post, and an emergency cohort from Placentia stationed there; to a position between the sea and the camp, with the additional mission of protecting water-carriers at the river, Marcus Aebutius, military tribune of the second legion, was ordered to bring two maniples of his troops;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Titus and Gaius Aelius, tribunes of the soldiers, had led the third legion, which was to guard the parties searching for forage and wood, on the road which leads to Aquileia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the same area, about a mile distant, was the camp of the Gauls:<note>Gallic auxiliaries of the Romans: cf. v. 9 below.</note> their chief, Catmelus, was in command of not more than three thousand armed men.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Histrians, as soon as the Romans had moved their camp to the lake of Timavus, themselves took up a hidden position in a spot behind a hill, and thence over byways followed the line of march, prepared for any opportunity;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> nor did anything that took place on land or sea escape their observation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.189"/>When they saw that the outposts in front of the<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> camp were weak, and that the market, filled with an unarmed throng trafficking between the camp and the sea, was provided with no protection on land or on water, they at the same time attacked the two out-guards, the cohort from Placentia and the maniples of the second legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A morning fog had concealed their enterprise; and as this cleared away before the first warmth of the sun, the light now penetrating it to some extent, but as yet, as is usual, not clear and furnishing the beholder a magnified impression of everything, at this time also deceived the Romans and revealed to them a battle-line of the enemy far stronger than it really was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the soldiers from both outposts, terrified by this sight, had fled to the camp with mighty uproar they caused far more panic there than they had brought with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For they could neither explain from what they had fled nor answer any persons who questioned them; and some shouting at the gates was heard, showing that no guards were there to withstand an assault; and the rushing about in the dark, as one man collided with another, had made it uncertain whether or not the enemy was inside the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> One voice was heard, that of men calling them to the sea; this cry, perhaps raised without design by a single man, rang everywhere through the whole camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so a few at first, as if they had been ordered to do this, some armed, the majority unarmed, rushed down to the sea, then larger numbers, finally almost all of them, and even the consul, when, trying in vain to recall the fugitives, he had failed at the end to accomplish anything by orders or authority or entreaties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> One man alone remained, Marcus <pb id="p.191"/>Licinius Strabo, military tribune of the third legion,<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> having along with three companies been left behind by his legion. The Histrians, bursting into the empty camp, when no other armed man had met them, bore down upon him at the headquarters as he was forming his men and encouraging them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A battle began, fiercer than one would expect considering the small number of defenders, and did not stop until the tribune of the soldiers and the men who had made a stand with him had fallen. The enemy, tearing down the general's tent and plundering whatever was there, moved on to the quaestor's quarters, the market, and the <hi rend="italics">via quintana.</hi><note>This street lay in the south-west quadrant of the camp. Along it were booths for the sale of stores.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When they had found there abundance of everything ready and laid out,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> and in the quaestor's quarters couches spread,<note>I.e., for a banquet. Discipline in the camp was not very strict.</note> the chief reclined and began to dine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Presently all the others, forgetting their arms and the enemy, did the same; and since the rather rich fare was strange to them, they greedily loaded their bodies with wine and food.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The state of affairs among the Romans was not at all the same at this moment; on land, on sea there was confusion; the sailors were striking their tents and were hurrying off to the ships the provisions set out on the shore;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the terrified soldiers were rushing to the small boats and into the sea; some of the sailors, in the fear that the ships would be overcrowded, were blocking the onrush of the crowd while others were pushing out the ships from the shore into deep water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then there was a struggle and soon even a battle, marked by the wounding and slaying of soldiers and sailors in turn, until the fleet was removed far from the land by order of the consul, who next began to segregate the armed <pb id="p.193"/>men from the unarmed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were barely<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> twelve hundred out of so great a crowd who had their weapons, and a very few cavalry were found who had brought their horses away with them; the rest were a motley crowd like servants and sutlers, surely destined to be booty if the enemy had bethought himself of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then finally a messenger was sent to recall the third legion and the Gallic contingent, and at the same time from all sides there began the movement back to recover the camp and to wipe out the disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The military tribunes of the third legion ordered foraging parties<note>Cf. <hi rend="italics">supra</hi> ch. i. 7, the <hi rend="italics">pabulatores</hi> and <hi rend="italics">lignatores.</hi></note> to abandon the forage and wood they had collected, directed the centurions to mount two of the older soldiers on each pack-animal whose load had been removed, and the cavalry to take one each of the younger infantrymen with them on their horses: they told them that the legion would win a fair report if by their valour they should recover the camp which had been lost through the panic of the men of the second legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The recovery of the camp would be easy, they said, if the barbarians could be suddenly surprised while engaged with the booty; just as they had taken it, so it could be taken from them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This exhortation was listened to with great enthusiasm on the part of the soldiers. They advanced the standards at full speed, nor did the troops lag behind the standard-bearers. Nevertheless the consul and the troops who were being brought back from the sea reached the rampart ahead of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Lucius Atius, the senior tribune of the second legion, not only urged on the men but also showed them that if the victorious Histrians intended to hold the captured camp with the same arms <pb id="p.195"/>with which they had captured it, they would first<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> have pursued to the sea the enemy, driven from his camp, and then at least have posted guards in front of the rampart; it was very probable that they were lying sunk in wine and sleep.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereupon he directed his guidon-bearer,<note>If <hi rend="italics">suum</hi> is correct, it would imply that either the legion had a standard, as well as each of its maniples, or that the commander had a personal flag; neither of these is known to have been true in the second century, and Livy may have been thinking of the later legion, which did have its own standard.</note> Aulus Baeculonius, a man of tried courage, to carry forward the standard. He replied that if they would follow him he would cause it to happen the more quickly;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and when with a great effort he had hurled the standard over the rampart, he was the first of all to enter the gate.<note>This picturesque feat, only resorted to in extreme emergencies (e.g. XXXIV. xlvi. 12) seems unnecessary if the Histrians were not defending the rampart (iii. 10 above). Livy has perhaps confused or misunderstood sources.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And on another side Titus and Gaius Aelius, military tribunes of the third legion, were coming up with the cavalry. Straightway also came the soldiers whom they had mounted in pairs on the pack-animals, and the consul with the main body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But a few of the Histrians, who had indulged only moderately in the wine, bethought them of flight, for the rest, death was a prolongation of sleep; and the Romans recovered their possessions in their entirety, except for the wine and food that had been consumed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even the sick troops, who had been left inside the camp, when they learned that their comrades were within the rampart, seized their arms and wrought great slaughter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Conspicuous beyond the rest was the performance of a trooper, Gaius Popilius; his cognomen was Sabellus. He, though wounded in the foot and left behind, killed by far the largest number of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> About eight thousand of the Histrians were slain, none <pb id="p.197"/>captured, for rage and passion made the Romans<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> heedless of booty. Nevertheless the chieftain of the Histrians, drunk as he was from the banquet, was hastily placed on a horse by his companions and escaped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of the victors two hundred and thirty-seven fell, more in the flight in the morning than in the retaking of the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It so happened by chance that Gnaeus and Lucius Gavillius Novellus, from Aquileia, coming with provisions and not knowing what had happened, almost stumbled upon the camp which had been taken by the Histrians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they, leaving their belongings, had fled to Aquileia, they filled everything with consternation and confusion, not only at Aquileia, but also, a few days later, at Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> where the report was brought not merely that the camp had been captured by the enemy and that the Romans had fled (as was the case), but also that all was lost and the whole army destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so, as is usually done in times of panic, extraordinary levies were proclaimed not in the City alone but throughout Italy. Two legions of Roman citizens were enlisted and ten thousand infantry with five hundred cavalry were levied upon the allies of the Latin confederacy. Marcus Junius the consul was directed to cross into Gaul and to demand from the states of that province as many soldiers as each could furnish.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time it was decreed that Tiberius Claudius the praetor<note><hi rend="italics">praetor peregrinus</hi> (XL. lix. 5, cf. XL. xxvi. 7).</note> should issue an edict to the soldiers of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> fourth legion and to five thousand foot and two hundred and fifty horse of the allies of the Latin confederacy that they should assemble at Pisa, and that Claudius should defend that province during the consul's absence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and also <pb id="p.199"/>that Marcus Titinius the praetor<note><hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus</hi> (<hi rend="italics">infra</hi> vi. 4).</note> should order the<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> first legion<note>The first and fourth legions would normally have been in Liguria with the other consul. Livy may however mean the first of the two legions just authorized.</note> and an equal number of infantry and cavalry of the allies to assemble at Rimini.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nero in uniform set out for his province at Pisa; Titinius first sent Gaius Cassius, a tribune of the soldiers, to Rimini as commander of the legion and then conducted the levy at Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcus Junius the consul, having gone over from the Ligurians into the province of Gaul, and having immediately levied upon the Gallic states for auxiliaries and upon the colonies for regular troops, arrived at Aquileia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There he was informed that the army was safe, and sending despatches to Rome in order to allay their fears, he himself sent home the auxiliaries which he had levied on the Gauls and set out to join his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At Rome there was great and unexpected joy; the levy was stopped, the soldiers who had taken the military oath were discharged, and the army, which had been suffering from a plague at Rimini, was sent home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Although the Histrians had a strong force in camp not far from the consul's camp, when they learned that the other consul with a new army had arrived they dispersed to their various states. The consuls led the legions into winter-quarters at Aquileia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The alarm in Histria having finally subsided, the senate passed a decree that the consuls should arrange between themselves which should come to Rome to hold the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the tribunes of the people, Aulus Licinius Nerva and Gaius Papirius Turdus, were tearing the absent consul Manlius to pieces in their assemblies and proposing a bill that Manlius should not hold his command after the Ides of March &mdash;for the provincial commands of the <pb id="p.201"/>consuls had already been prolonged for a year &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that he might be able to plead his cause immediately upon his retirement from office, this measure was vetoed by their colleague Quintus Aelius, who after violent arguments prevailed to prevent its passing.<note>The charge against Manlius (vii. 7 below) was that he had left his province of Gaul without permission to undertake the Histrian campaign (cf. i. 1 above). The prorogation of the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> before the elections was irregular and apparently designed to thwart the tribunes' plan of prosecuting Manlius.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At about this time, when Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Lucius Postumius Albinus<note>For their appointment to the Spanish province cf. XL. xlvii. 1.</note> had returned to Rome from Spain, an audience before the senate was granted to them by the praetor Marcus Titinius, to be held in the temple of Bellona so that they might present an account of their achievements, claim the distinctions they deserved and ask that honour should be paid to the immortal gods.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At the same time there was great confusion in Sardinia also, as was learned from dispatches from Titus Aebutius the praetor which had been brought to the senate by his son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Ilienses,<note>Cf. XL. xxxiv. 13 and the note.</note> reinforced by auxiliaries of the Balari,<note>A mountain tribe of Sardinia.</note> had attacked the province while it was at peace, and could not be resisted since the army was weak and had lost a large number of its members as a result of a pestilence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ambassadors of the Sardinians also brought the same news and begged that the senate should send aid to the towns at least &mdash;for the fields had already been abandoned in despair. This embassy and the whole question about what was to be done concerning Sardinia was postponed to the new administration.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>An equally pitiful embassy from the Lycians arrived,<note>Concerning this embassy cf. Polybius XXV. iv. L.C.L. Vol. V, pp. 475 f., especially the finding of the Roman commissioners, sec. 5: <quote>they found that the Lycians had not been handed over to Rhodes as a gift, but rather to be treated like friends and allies.</quote></note> who complained of the cruelty of the <pb id="p.203"/>Rhodians, under whose control they had been placed<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> by Lucius Cornelius Scipio.<note>The assignment of the Lycians to Rhodes was not the work of Scipio but of the commission, acting under orders from the senate, which concluded the treaty with Antiochus only after Scipio had left the province (XXXVII. lv.; XXXVIII. xxxix. 13).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They said that they had been under the dominion of Antiochus; this slavery to the King, when compared with their present situation, seemed glorious liberty. They were not merely as a state oppressed by their government, but private citizens were suffering downright bondage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Their wives and children, they said, were abused; cruelty was wreaked upon their bodies and their backs; their reputations &mdash;a shameful procedure &mdash;were stained and dishonoured; and openly hateful acts were done merely for the sake of displaying an abuse of power, in order to leave no doubt that there was no distinction between themselves and slaves bought with money.<note>With <hi rend="italics">argento parata</hi> cf. Euripides' <hi rend="italics">Alcestis</hi> 675: <foreign lang="greek">Ludo\n h)\ Fru/ga... a)rgurw/nhton se/qen.</foreign> Polybius (XXVI. vii) gives a similar but less emotional account of the treatment of the Lycians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The senate, moved by this appeal, entrusted the Lycians with a letter for the Rhodians, stating that it was not their pleasure that the Lycians should be enslaved by the Rhodians nor any people who had been born in freedom by any other people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the Lycians had been placed under the administrative control and at the same time the protection of the Rhodians on the same conditions as the allied states enjoyed under the guardianship of the Roman people.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then two triumphs over Spain were celebrated in succession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The first was that of Sempronius Gracchus, who triumphed over the Celtiberians and their allies, and the next day Lucius Postumius triumphed over the Lusitanians and other Spaniards in the same district.<note>For the campaigns of Gracchus and Albinus, cf. XL. xlvii ff. There was, according to the <hi rend="italics">Periocha,</hi> a further account in the lost portion of this Book.</note> Gracchus carried in procession forty thousand pounds of silver, <pb id="p.205"/>Albinus twenty thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both distributed as<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> donatives twenty-five <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> each to the infantry, twice that sum to centurions, and thrice to the cavalry; the allies shared on the same terms with the Romans.<note>Cf. XL. xliii. 7 and the note.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>About this time it chanced that the consul Marcus Junius came from Histria to Rome in order to hold the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the tribunes of the people, Papirius and Licinius, had worn him out in the senate with questions as to what had happened in Histria, they finally haled him before an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the consul said in reply that he had spent not more than eleven days in that province, and that what had happened in his absence he, like the tribunes, knew only from report, they continued to pursue the matter, inquiring why in the world Aulus Manlius rather than himself had
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> not come to Rome, in order to render an account to the Roman people of the reason why he had gone from the province of Gaul, which he had obtained from the lot, over into Histria? When, they asked, had the senate decreed that war?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When had the Roman people ordered that war? But, by Hercules, he will say that although the war was undertaken on his own initiative, it was conducted wisely and courageously.<note>The criticism of Manlius is similar to that directed against his brother after the Galatian campaign of <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (especially XXXVIII, xlv.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> &mdash;xlvi).</note> On the contrary, they said, it was impossible to say whether it was undertaken more improperly or prosecuted more imprudently. Two outposts were surprised by the Histrians, a Roman camp captured, and all the infantry and cavalry in the camp slaughtered, the rest, unarmed and routed, the consul himself leading the way, had fled to the sea and the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> ships! As a private citizen Manlius would give account of his actions, since he had refused to do this as a consul.</p> <pb id="p.207"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consular elections were then held.<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> The consuls chosen were Gaius Claudius Pulcher and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. The next day the praetors were elected, Publius Aelius Tubero (for the second time),<note>There was a praetor of this name in <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date> (XXX. xl. 5).</note> Gaius Quinctius Flamininus, Gaius Numisius, Lucius Mummius, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, Gaius Valerius Laevinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The jurisdiction between citizens fell to Tubero, that between citizens and aliens to Quinctius, Sicily to Numisius, Sardinia to Mummius; but this, by reason of the seriousness of the war, was made a consular province. Scipio and Laevinus received from the lot Gaul, divided into two provinces.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On the Ides of March, when Sempronius and<note type="margin">B.C. 178</note> Claudius were inaugurated consuls, a mere mention was made of the provinces of Sardinia and Histria and the enemies in both who had stirred up war in those provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the next day the ambassadors of the Sardinians, whose hearing had been postponed to the administration of the new consuls, were heard, and Lucius Minucius Thermus, who had been a lieutenant of the consul Manlius in Histria, came into the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By them the senate was informed to what extent these provinces were engaged in war.</p> 
				<p>The senate was greatly impressed also by the embassies from the allies of the Latin confederacy,<note>The separate mention of the Samnites and the Paelignians in sect. 8 below indicates that this refers only to the allies in Latium, not in Italy as a whole; cf. <hi rend="italics">ex Latio</hi> in XXXIX. iii. 4.</note> who had wearied both censors and former consuls, and were at length given audience before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The substance of their complaints was that large numbers of their citizens had been rated at Rome and had moved to Rome;<note>For an attempt in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> to correct the same situation, cf. XXXIX. iii. 4-6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but if this were allowed it would come to pass in a very few decades that there would be deserted towns and deserted farms <pb id="p.209"/>which would be unable to furnish a single soldier.<note type="margin">A.U.C. 577</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Similarly the Samnites and Paelignians complained that four thousand families had moved from their territories to Fregellae,<note>Fregellae was a Latin colony. It seems that as residents of Latium moved to Rome, so allies from other parts of Italy migrated to towns with larger privileges, without affecting the quota of troops required from their old homes.</note> nor did either<note>The use of pronouns is peculiar and the text may be corrupt. One would expect a complaint that the quota of Fregellae had not been raised to correspond to its increased population.</note> community furnish fewer soldiers on that account when the levy was made. Moreover, two kinds of fraud had been practised to secure individual transfers of citizenship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The law<note>The meaning is uncertain. Perhaps this ordinance was part of the original compact which governed the relations of Rome and the Latin League. From the fact that there is no reference to it in XXXIX. iii, it might be argued that the law had been passed since <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date></note> granted to any persons among the allies of the Latin confederacy, who should leave<note>The phrase <hi rend="italics">stirpem ex sese</hi> has reference to natural, not adopted sons; the provision is an insurance against a decrease in the number of families in a community.</note> in their home towns offspring of their loins, the privilege of becoming Roman citizens. By the abuse of this law some were injuring the allies, some the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For in the first place, in order to evade the requirement that they should leave offspring at home, they would give their sons to any Romans whatsoever in slavery, on the condition that they should be manumitted and thus become citizens of freedman condition;<note>The procedure is difficult to follow, especially in the light of the preceding sentence. This much is clear, that the father who aspired to become a Roman citizen satisfied the requirement mentioned above by leaving a son behind him; next he transferred that son collusively to some Roman by the legal process of <hi rend="italics">mancipium;</hi> after the father had acquired the Roman citizenship, presumably, the Roman who had purchased the son set him free, whereby the son also became a <hi rend="italics">civis,</hi> though a <hi rend="italics">libertinus,</hi> by reason of his temporary slavery. This method injured the <hi rend="italics">socii,</hi> by depriving them of a family.</note> in the second place, those who had no offspring to leave behind, in order to become Roman citizens adopted children.<note>This passage has been emended in many ways: I have preferred the text of Voigt, mainly on account of its brevity, since the general purport of all is the same (for other suggestions see the apparatus of Giarratano). One may assume that the phrase <hi rend="italics">stirpem ex sese</hi> was found legally ambiguous, and was stretched to include adoptive children. This method injured the Romans, since the law had been evaded, even if not actually violated.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Later, <pb id="p.211"/>disdaining even these pretences of obedience to law, just<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> as they pleased, with no regard to the statute or to the requirement of offspring, they would transfer to the Roman citizenship by migration and recognition in the census.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In order that these things might not occur in future, the ambassadors requested first, that the senate should direct allies to return to their cities; second, that a law should be passed providing that no one should acquire a son or dispose of one for the purpose of changing his citizenship;<note>This clause forbids both the adoption and the mancipatory sale of a son to avoid the older law.</note> third, that if anyone had thus become a Roman citizen, he should not be a Roman citizen. These petitions were granted by the senate.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next the provinces which were at war, Sardinia and Histria, were decreed to the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For Sardinia two legions were ordered to be raised, each of fifty-two hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry; also twelve thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry from the allies of the Latin confederacy, and ten ships of five banks of oars, in case the consul should wish to launch any from the docks. The same number of infantry and cavalry were decreed for Histria as for Sardinia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Also, the consuls were directed to send one legion with three hundred cavalry and five thousand allied infantry and two hundred and fifty cavalry<note>I.e. of the allies, the three hundred being Roman.</note> to Marcus Titinius<note>There were two praetors of this name: only three praetors are listed for the year <date value="-178">178 B.C.</date> in XL. lix. 5.</note> in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Before the consuls drew lots for their provinces, the prodigies were reported: a stone fell from the sky into the grove of Mars in the territory of Crustumerium; a boy whose body was without limbs was born near Rome and a four-legged snake was seen; and at <pb id="p.213"/>Capua also many buildings in the forum were struck<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> by lightning; and at Puteoli two ships were burned by lightning bolts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the midst of the announcement of these occurrences, a wolf was pursued even in Rome by day, after entering by the Porta Collina, and escaped by the Porta Esquilina amid great uproar on the part of the pursuers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By reason of these portents the consuls sacrificed full-grown victims, and for one day a supplication was held at all the banquet-tables of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The sacrifices having been duly completed, the consuls drew for their provinces; Histria fell to Claudius, Sardinia to Sempronius.</p> 
				<p>Then Gaius Claudius, with the authorization of the senate, proposed a law concerning the allies, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> issued a proclamation to the effect that all allies of the Latin confederacy, in the event that they themselves or their ancestors had been registered among the allies of the Latin confederacy in the censorship of Marcus Claudius and Titus Quinctius or thereafter,<note>They were censors in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. lviii. 2).</note> should all return, each to his own state, before the Kalends of November.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The investigation of those who should not have returned in this fashion was decreed to Lucius Mummius the praetor.<note>In viii. 2 above Mummius was allotted Sardinia, but this province had later been transferred to Gracchus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To this law and proclamation of the consul a decree of the senate was added, that a dictator, consul, interrex, censor, or praetor, who was at the time in office or should henceforth be in office,<note>The offices of dictator and interrex were rarely used at this period but were included for completeness, since they might be revived in future.</note> before any one of whom a slave was brought for manumission and for the assertion of his claim to freedom,<note>The two clauses together constitute both the requirements for granting freedom to a slave and the methods to be followed.</note> should require that an oath be given<note>The syntax is obscure, but the sense requires that the oath be given by the <hi rend="italics">manumissor.</hi></note> that the person who was manumitting the slave was <pb id="p.215"/>not manumitting him for the purpose of changing<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> his citizenship;<note>This decree prevents the first method of evasion described in viii. 10 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> in any case in which this oath was not taken, they decreed that the manumission should not take place. These precautions were taken for the future, and orders were issued under the edict of Gaius Claudius the consul [for the return of the allies to their states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The investigation thereof] was ordered [to be conducted under the supervision] of Mummius.<note>Madvig's suggestion as to the last words is followed except at the end, since he requires that the investigation be entrusted to Claudius. Because this contradicts sec. 10 above, I have modified his supplement, with no authority except the desire for a greater measure of consistency.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While all these things were being done at Rome, Marcus Junius and Aulus Manlius, who had been consuls the preceding year, after wintering at Aquileia, in the beginning of spring led the army into the land of the Histrians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> while they were plundering far and wide, grief and indignation at the sight of their ravaged possessions roused the Histrians more than any assured hope that they had strength enough to withstand the two armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the young men from all the communities had rushed together, the army, hastily raised for the emergency, fought at the first clash with greater vigour than perseverance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> About four thousand of them were killed in the battle-line, the rest, abandoning the campaign, scattered in every direction to their states. Then they first sent ambassadors to the Roman camp to ask peace, then the hostages which were demanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When this was known at Rome from the dispatch of the proconsuls, Gaius Claudius the consul, fearing that these occurrences might perhaps deprive him of his province and his army,<note>The senate had earlier prorogued the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Junius and Manlius (vi. 2 above), and the assignment of Histria to Claudius left them without occupation; friction was bound to follow.</note> without <pb id="p.217"/>announcing his vows or clothing his lictors in uniform,<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> notifying only his colleague of everything, set out by night and went off at headlong speed to his province; there his conduct was more rash than his coming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For when, calling an assembly, he had upbraided Aulus Manlius for his flight from the camp (the soldiers, who themselves had begun the flight, listening with hostile ears) and had heaped insults upon Marcus Junius, because he had made himself a partner in his colleague's disgrace, he ended by ordering both to leave the province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they had replied to this that they would obey the command of a consul at such time as he set out from the City in the manner of their forefathers, after public proclamation of his vows on the Capitoline and with his lictors in uniform,<note>The proconsuls take the position that Claudius, having left Rome without performing the usual formalities, has no legal right to command in the province. There may have been no law to this effect, but custom was, in the main, on their side: cf., e.g. XXI. lxiii. 2.</note> Claudius, maddened with rage, summoned the officer who was acting as quaestor for Manlius and demanded from him chains, threatening that he would send Junius and Manlius to Rome in irons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This officer also ignored the command of the consul; and the army standing round about favouring the cause of the generals and hostile to the consul, gave the quaestor courage to disobey.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At last the consul, worn out by the insults of individuals and the jeers of the whole crowd &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> they ridiculed him as well &mdash;returned to Aquileia in the same ship in which he had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thence he wrote to his colleague to issue an edict that such portion of the new troops as had been <pb id="p.219"/>enlisted for the province of Histria should assemble<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> at Aquileia, lest anything delay him at Rome from announcing his vows and setting out from the City in uniform. This was done by his colleague as he requested, and an early date for the muster was proclaimed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Claudius almost overtook his own letter. On his arrival he delivered a speech on the conduct of Manlius and Junius, and after tarrying not more than three days at Rome, with
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> his lictors in uniform and having proclaimed his vows on the Capitoline, he went off to his province with the same headlong speed as before.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days before this Junius and Manlius had begun to assault with all their might the town of Nesattium,<note>This town lay in a northerly direction from Pola.</note> to which the leading men of the Histrians and even their chieftain Aepulo had withdrawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Claudius, bringing up the two new legions and sending away the old army with its commanders, himself invested the town and prosecuted the siege with sheds;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and a river which flowed past the walls and was both a hindrance to the besiegers and a water-supply to the Histrians, after many days' toil he diverted and led off by a new channel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This act, by its miraculous cutting off of the water, terrified the barbarians; but, with no thought of peace even then, turning to the slaughter of their wives and children, in order that so horrible a deed might be in full view of the enemy also, they openly slew them on the walls and cast their bodies down.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the midst of the simultaneous wailing of women and children and the dreadful slaughter, the soldiers scaled the wall and entered the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the chief heard the din of its capture from the <pb id="p.221"/>terrified cries of the fugitives, he stabbed himself<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> with his sword, so as not to be taken alive;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the rest were captured or killed. Next two towns, Mutila and Faveria, were taken by storm and destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The booty, considering the poverty of the people, was greater than they had hoped, and all of it was given to the soldiers. Five thousand six hundred and thirty-two captives were sold at auction. The persons responsible for the war were scourged and beheaded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> All Histria, through the destruction of three towns and the death of its king, was pacified; and all the surrounding tribes gave hostages and surrendered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Toward the end of the Histrian war the Ligurians began to hold councils regarding war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Tiberius Claudius the proconsul, who had been praetor the preceding year, was in command at Pisa with a garrison of one legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate, informed by his dispatches, voted that these same dispatches should be forwarded to Gaius Claudius &mdash;for by now the other consul had crossed to Sardinia &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> added a decree that, since the province of Histria had been subdued,<note>For the progressive development of the meaning of the phrase <hi rend="italics">provincia confecta,</hi> cf. XL. xxxv. 4 and the note.</note> he should, if it seemed wise to him, lead the army against the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the same time, in consequence of the dispatches of the consul, which he had written regarding events in Histria, a thanksgiving for two days was decreed. The other consul, Tiberius Sempronius, also conducted in Sardinia a successful campaign. He led the army into the country of the Sardinian Ilienses.<note>The Ilienses were of a different stock from the Balari; both stocks were included under the common designation Sardi.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Strong reinforcements of the Balari had come to the Ilienses; he fought in pitched battle with both tribes. The enemy was repulsed and routed and stripped of his camp; twelve thousand armed men were slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.223"/>The next day the consul ordered the weapons to be<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> collected, heaped up in a pile and burned as an offering to Vulcan. He led the conquering army back into winter quarters in allied cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And Gaius Claudius, on receipt of the letter of Tiberius Claudius and the decree of the senate, led the legions over from Histria against the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The enemy had advanced into the plains and encamped near the river Scultenna,<note>This river, rising in the Apennines, flowed past Modena, of. Strabo V. i. 12.</note> and there he fought them in line of battle. Fifteen thousand were killed, more than seven hundred captured, either in the battle or in the camp &mdash;for it too was taken &mdash;and fifty-one military standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Ligurians, the remnants left by the slaughter, fled to the mountains, and no armed force showed itself to the consul anywhere as he ravaged the farms in the plains far and wide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Claudius, victorious over two peoples in one year, and having pacified two provinces in his consulship, a thing which had rarely happened, returned to Rome.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Prodigies were reported that year: in the territory of Crustumerium they say that a bird, called <hi rend="italics">sanqualis</hi><note>Festus (p. 317) says that the bird <hi rend="italics">in commentariis auguralibus ossifraga</hi> ('bonebreaker') <hi rend="italics">appellatur.</hi> Pliny (<hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> X. vii. 20) was uncertain as to the meaning of the word <hi rend="italics">sanqualis,</hi> which may have been related to the name of the god Sangus (XXXII. i. 10); cf. Festus 371; <hi rend="italics">quia in Sangi dei tutela est.</hi></note> cut a sacred stone<note>Perhaps a boundary or sepulchral stone or a dedication.</note> with
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> its beak, that in Campania a cow spoke, that at Syracuse a brazen heifer was approached and mounted by a wild bull which had strayed from its herd.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the territory of Crustumerium a day of prayer was held on the actual spot,<note>I.e., at the spot where the portent occurred, not in Rome.</note> and in Campania the cow was consigned to maintenance at the expense of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Atonement was made for the prodigy at <pb id="p.225"/>Syracuse, the gods to whom supplication should be<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> made having been announced by the <hi rend="italics">haruspices.</hi></p> 
				<p>That year occurred the death of the pontiff Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who had been consul and censor.<note>He was consul in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII, xxiv. 1) and censor in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. lviii. 2).</note> In his place was substituted in the priesthood his son Marcus Marcellus. Also in that year a colony of two thousand Roman citizens was established at Luna.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The board of three which established it consisted of Publius Aelius, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Gnaeus Sicinius; the allotment to each colonist was fifty-one and one half <hi rend="italics">iugera.</hi> The land had been taken from the Ligurians; it had belonged to the Etruscans before the Ligurians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Gaius Claudius the consul came to the City: when he had given an account in the senate of his successful operations in Histria and among the Ligurians, on his request a triumph was decreed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He triumphed during his term of office over two peoples at once. He carried in procession in his triumph three hundred and seven thousand <hi rend="italics">denarii,</hi> eighty-five thousand seven hundred and two <hi rend="italics">victoriati.</hi><note>An Illyrian coin originally, worth three-fourths of a denarius; cf. Pliny <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> XXX. iii. 46.</note> Each of the infantry received fifteen <hi rend="italics">denarii,</hi> the centurions twice, the cavalry each thrice that sum. To the allies<note>The custom, at least in recent years, had been to give the Latin allies the same donatives as the Romans (vii. 3 above and the note). The treatment in this case may be part of the general discrimination against them (cf. ix. 9-12 above).</note> a half less was given than to the citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so they followed the car in silence, so that you could perceive that they were angry.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this triumph over the Ligurians was being celebrated, when the Ligurians perceived that not only had the consular army been taken away
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> to <pb id="p.227"/>Rome, but even the legion sent back from Pisa by<note type="margin">B.C. 177</note> Tiberius Claudius, being now freed from fear, secretly mustering an army they crossed the mountains by side roads and came down into the plains, and after devastating the lands around Mutina captured the colony itself by a surprise attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When this was reported at Rome, the senate instructed the consul Gaius Claudius to hold the elections at the earliest possible moment, and after choosing the magistrates for the year to return to the province and rescue the colony from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The elections were held as the senate had decreed. The consuls chosen were Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Hispallus and Quintus Petilius Spurinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next the praetors were elected, Marcus Popilius Laenas, Publius Licinius Crassus, Marcus Cornelius Scipio, Lucius Papirius Maso, Marcus Aburius, Lucius Aquilius Gallus. The <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Gaius Claudius the consul, together with his assignment to Gaul, was extended for a year;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he was also instructed, in order to prevent the Histrians from doing the same thing that the Ligurians had done, to send to Histria the allies of the Latin confederacy whom he had withdrawn from the province by reason of his triumph.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The consuls, Gnaeus Cornelius and Quintus Petilius,<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> on the day of their inauguration, sacrificed each an ox to Jupiter, as is usual, but in the victim which Quintus Petilius sacrificed no head to the liver was found. When this was announced to the senate he was instructed to continue sacrificing cattle until a favourable omen was secured.<note>It was especially fortunate if favourable omens were secured from the first victim (XXXVI. i. 3); if not, the sacrifice was repeated.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate next, when consulted about the provinces, decreed Pisa and the Ligurians as provinces for the consuls; the consul to whom Pisa should have fallen as a <pb id="p.229"/>province<note>Pisa had usually belonged to the Ligurian province, but now was a separate province, cf. XXXVIII. 35. 8.</note> was ordered to
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> return for the elections<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> on the arrival of the time of choosing magistrates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was added to the decree that they should each enroll two new legions and three hundred cavalry; and that each should call upon the allies of the Latin confederacy for ten thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Tiberius Claudius was extended until such time as the consul should have come to the province.<note>Such prorogations were usually thought unnecessary since a commander normally remained until he was relieved, even without orders.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these matters were being discussed in the senate, Gnaeus Cornelius, summoned by a messenger, left the senate-house, and shortly afterward returned with a troubled expression and reported to the Conscript Fathers that the liver of a <hi rend="italics">sescenaris</hi> ox<note>The meaning of the adjective <hi rend="italics">sescenaris</hi> is unknown; and no attempt to emend has been successful.</note> which he had sacrificed had melted away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He added that, scarcely believing the man in charge of the victims when he reported this, he had himself directed that the water be poured out of the kettle in which the entrails were being boiled and had seen all the rest of the entrails complete, but the whole liver had been consumed by an indescribable wasting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the Fathers, already terrified by this portent, the other consul brought additional anxiety by reporting that he had failed to obtain a favourable omen after sacrificing three cattle, as the head of the liver had been missing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate directed him to continue sacrificing full-grown victims until he received a favorable omen. They say that in the case of the other gods they were obtained; to Salus, they say, Petilius could find no good omen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the consuls and praetors drew lots for their provinces. Pisa fell to Gnaeus Cornelius in the drawing, the Ligurians to Quintus Petilius. Of the praetors, Lucius Papirius Maso <pb id="p.231"/>gained by lot the civil jurisdiction; Marcus Aburius<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> that between citizens and aliens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Marcus Cornelius Scipio Maluginensis had Farther Spain and Lucius Aquilius Gallus Sicily. Two asked to be excused from going to their provinces, Marcus Popilius to Sardinia: Gracchus, he said, was pacifying that province;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the praetor Titus Aebutius had been assigned him as an assistant by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That the regular course of business should be interrupted, in the completion of which mere continuity was most effective, was by no means expedient; during a transfer of command and the novitiate of the successor, which had to be devoted to learning things rather than doing them, opportunities for successful operations were often lost.<note>While the argument of Popilius for continued command during a campaign is sound, one wonders what was responsible for the sudden unwillingness to assume provincial duties at this time, when most magistrates were rather too eager for them.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The plea of Popilius was accepted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Publius Licinius Crassus alleged that he was hindered by obligatory sacrifices from going to his province; Nearer Spain had fallen to his lot. But he was ordered either to go or to take oath before the assembly that he was prevented by an obligatory sacrifice.<note>The character of the oath is more explicitly stated in XLII. xxxii. 2, where it appears that as consul Licinius was less constrained by it.</note> When this had been approved in the case of Publius Licinius, Marcus Cornelius also demanded that they should accept his oath, as an excuse for not going to Farther Spain. Both praetors swore in the same formula.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Marcus Titinius and Titus Fonteius the proconsuls were instructed to remain in Spain with the same prerogative of command; it was also ordered that as reinforcements for them three thousand Roman citizens and two hundred cavalry, five thousand <pb id="p.233"/>infantry and three hundred cavalry of the allies of<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> the Latin confederacy should be sent.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Latin festival<note>Cf. XXXII. i. 9 and the note.</note> was held on the third day before the Nones of May, and a religious scruple arose because at the sacrifice of one victim the magistrate of Lanuvium had not prayed for the Roman people,<note>An accidental omission of a phrase from a formula might, in Roman thinking, vitiate the whole formula.</note> the Quirites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When this was reported to the senate and the senate had referred the question to the college of pontiffs, the decree of the pontiffs was that the Latin festival should be repeated, since it had not been correctly performed, and that the people of Lanuvium, to whom was due the necessity of the repetition, should furnish the victims.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their religious fear was increased by the fact that Gnaeus Cornelius the consul fell on his return from the Alban Mount, and, paralyzed in some of his limbs, set out for Aquae Cumanae<note>Possibly the spa near Baiae.</note> and, his illness growing more severe, died at Cumae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But after his death he was removed to Rome and was carried out and buried with an elaborate funeral. He was, in addition to being consul, a pontiff.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul Quintus Petilius, as soon as the auspices permitted, was ordered to hold an election to choose his colleague and to proclaim the Latin festival; the election he declared for the third day before the Nones of August, the festival for the third day before the Ides of August.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At a time when men's minds were already filled with religious fears, to add to them prodigies were reported: at Tusculum, a firebrand was seen in the sky, and at Gabii the temple of Apollo and numerous private houses, at Gravisca the wall and gate, were struck by lightning. The Fathers ordered expiation for these, in a manner to be prescribed by the pontiffs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.235"/>
				<p>While the two consuls were delayed first by<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> religious observances, then one consul by the death of the other and the election and the repetition of the Latin festival, in the meantime Gaius Claudius led the army toward Mutina, which the Ligurians had captured the year before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Within three days from the beginning of the siege he recovered it and restored it to the colonists. Eight thousand of the Ligurians perished there within the walls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and dispatches were at once sent to Rome, in which he not only stated the facts but also boasted that as a result of his valour and good fortune there was no longer an enemy of the Roman people on this side of the Alps, and that a large amount of land had been captured which could be divided individually among many thousands of men.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time also Tiberius Sempronius in Sardinia completely subdued the Sardinians in many successful battles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fifteen thousand men were killed, and all the tribes of the Sardinians who had revolted were reduced to submission. Upon those who had been tributaries before, double taxes were imposed and levied, the rest contributed grain.<note>Sardinia, like Sicily, was organized on the tithe-system of Hiero, but some persons or communities paid in cash. It is not clear whether this increase was a permanent doubling of the rate or a temporary penalty.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now that he had pacified the province and received two hundred and thirty hostages from the whole island, he sent lieutenants to Rome to report these events and to ask the senate that by reason of the successes obtained under the leadership and auspices of Tiberius Sempronius honour should be paid to the immortal gods and that Sempronius himself, on his departure from the province, should be permitted to bring back his army.<note>The last request was a preliminary to an application for a triumph: cf. XL. xxxv. 6 and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate, meeting in the <pb id="p.237"/>temple of Apollo, heard the words of the lieutenants,<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> decreed a thanksgiving for two days, ordered the consuls to sacrifice forty full-grown victims, and directed Tiberius Sempronius the proconsul and the army to remain that year in the province.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then the election for the purpose of filling the one vacancy in the consulship, which had been announced for the third day before the Nones of August, was finished the same day. Quintus Petilius the consul declared Gaius Valerius Laevinus chosen as his colleague, to enter upon his office at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He himself had long been eager for his province, when, fortunately for his ambition, dispatches arrived that the Ligurians had rebelled, and on the Nones of August he set out in uniform [for his province and sent back a letter concerning his achievements there.<note>While I have not ventured to print Vahlen's restoration as part of the text, I have translated its substance.</note> ] The senate, hearing the letter, by reason of the uprising ordered the third legion to set out to join Gaius Claudius the proconsul in Gaul, and the <hi rend="italics">duumviri navales</hi> to proceed with the fleet to Pisa, in order to sail along the coast of the Ligurians, spreading terror by sea as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the same
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> destination, Pisa, the consul Quintus Petilius had also named a rendezvous for his army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And Gaius Claudius the proconsul, hearing of the revolt of the Ligurians, in addition to the troops which he had with him at Parma, raised emergency troops and moved his army to the frontiers of the Ligurians.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The enemy, on the arrival of Gaius Claudius, by whom as commander they recalled that recently at the Scultenna river they had been defeated and put to flight, with a view to defending themselves by the protection of the country rather than by arms against an attack which had turned out <pb id="p.239"/>unhappily<note>Cf. <hi rend="italics">supra,</hi> xii. 8.</note> for them, occupied the two mountains,<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> Letum and Ballista, and in addition surrounded them by a wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Those who were slow in moving from the fields were cut off and destroyed to the number of fifteen hundred; the rest kept within the mountains and not even in their fear forgetting their natural fierceness, they raged against the booty which had been taken at Mutina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The prisoners they slew after mutilating them cruelly; the beasts they butchered, scattered among the shrines, rather than sacrificed according to ritual. Sated with the slaughter of their living plunder, things which were inanimate, utensils of every sort, made for use rather than as ornaments to be looked at, they dashed against the walls.<note>Most editors bracket either <hi rend="italics">ornamento</hi> or <hi rend="italics">in speciem</hi> as a gloss on the other. I have retained both, also the MS. <hi rend="italics">adfligunt</hi> for the commonly accepted conjecture <hi rend="italics">adfigunt;</hi> having finished with human beings they vented their rage upon inanimate objects.</note> The consul Quintus Petilius, fearing lest the war should be finished in his absence, wrote to Gaius Claudius that he should bring the army to meet him in Gaul: he would await them, he said, at Campi Macri.<note>In the territory of Modena.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Claudius, on receipt of the letter, moved his camp from the Ligurian territory and at Campi Macri turned his army over to the consul. Thither a few days later Gaius Valerius, the other consul, came. There, dividing their forces, before they separated the two jointly purified the armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, because they had determined that the two should not approach the enemy from the same direction, they cast lots for the districts to which they should direct their march. It was evident that Valerius cast his lot in accordance with the requirements for auspices, because he was in the consecrated <pb id="p.241"/>space; the augurs later declared that this fault had<note type="margin">B.C. 176</note> existed in the case of Petilius &mdash;namely,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the lot, which had been cast into the urn outside of the consecrated space, had been drawn by him while he was still outside of the consecrated area, although he should have been inside of it.<note>The state of the text and our ignorance of the details of <hi rend="italics">sortitio</hi> prevent our coming nearer than an approximation to the meaning. It is particularly difficult to determine what happened since the error of Petilius was so slight that it escaped detection at the time.</note> From Campi Macri they marched in different directions. Petilius had his camp facing the height of Ballista and Letum, which joins these mountains with a continuous ridge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, while he was encouraging the soldiers before the assembly, not thinking of the double meaning of the word, they said that he used the ominous expression that on that day he would gain Letum.<note>As a common noun, <hi rend="italics">letum</hi> means <quote>death.</quote> Valerius Maximus (I. v. 9) tells the same story: Hodie ego Letum utique capiam.</note> He began to march up the hills in front on two sides at once.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the enemy had repulsed the other, Petilius, in order to restore the wavering line, riding up on his horse, did indeed rally his men from their flight, but he himself, while riding before the standards with too little caution, fell struck with a javelin. But the enemy did not perceive that the commander had been killed, and the few of his own men who had seen it concealed his body with great care, knowing that victory depended on it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The rest of the body of infantry and cavalry dislodged the enemy and took the mountains without their general. About five thousand of the Ligurians were killed: of the Roman army fifty-two fell.

						<p>The loss of nearly an entire quaternion of V (see critical note) makes it impossible to determine the rest of the sentence. Livy's narrative recognizes the rashness of Petilius (cf. especially <hi rend="italics">incautius ante signa</hi> in sec. 4), but the senate seems to have emphasized his bravery when it decreed that the legion was remiss in the performance of its duty, that its year's pay should be withheld and its wages reduced: cf. Valerius Maximus II. vii. 15 (confirmed by the briefer account in Frontinus, <hi rend="italics">Stratagems</hi> IV. i. 46): Graviter senatus tulit, quod Q. Petilium consulem fortissime adversus Ligures pugnantem occidere milites passi essent.

						<p>Sigonius inserted here this sentence quoted by Priscian (see the critical note) from Book XLI. It is obviously concerned with this year, since at no other time covered by this Book did both the regular consuls die in office. It appears that a <hi rend="italics">consul suffectus,</hi> i.e. one elected to fill a vacancy, could not preside at an election. Their only recourse,

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By reason of the <pb id="p.245"/>successes in Gaul and among the Ligurians under the<note type="margin">B.C. 175</note> leadership and auspices of the two consuls, the senate decreed a thanksgiving for three days and ordered the sacrifice of forty victims.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And indeed the Gallic and Ligurian uprising, which had broken out in the beginning of the year, was quickly suppressed with no great effort; now the anxiety as to the Macedonian War beset them, since Perseus was stirring up conflicts between the Dardanians and the Bastarnae.<note>Cf. especially XL. lvii. for Philip's plan to profit by the wars of these peoples.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And the ambassadors<note>This embassy has not been mentioned, since Livy has said little about Macedonian affairs since <date value="-178">178 B.C.</date> He now proceeds to fill up that gap.</note> who had been sent to investigate the situation in Macedonia had already returned to Rome and had reported that war in Dardania was now in progress.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time envoys had also arrived from King Perseus, who were to explain on his behalf<note>Appian, <hi rend="italics">Macedonian Wars</hi> IX. xi. 1 refers to this embassy, which Livy has not mentioned before: <foreign lang="greek">o(de\ Perseus e)te/rous e)/pempe pre/sbeis th\n u(po/noian e)klu/wn.</foreign></note> that he had neither invited the Bastarnae nor was he instigating any of their actions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate neither absolved him of this blame nor charged him with it; they merely ordered that he be warned to take redoubled care to make it appear that he was respecting the treaty which was in force between him and the Romans.<note>Cf. XL. lviii. 9. It would seem that the senate was satisfied with a show of observance of the treaty.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the Dardanians saw that the Bastarnae were not only not leaving their territory, as they had hoped, but were growing more troublesome every day, and were relying on the aid of the neighbouring Thracians and the Scordisci, they decided that they must venture something, even rashly, and all from all sides met in arms at the town which was nearest to the camp of the Bastarnae. It was winter, <pb id="p.247"/>and they had chosen that season in order that the<note type="margin">B.C. 175</note> Thracians and Scordisci might then depart to their own countries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they learned that this had occurred as they had expected and that the Bastarnae were now alone, they divided their forces into two columns, one to march by the straight road to assail openly, the other, led around by an out-of-theway pass, to attack from the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But before they could surround the camp of the enemy the battle took place; and the defeated Dardanians were driven back into the town, which was about twelve miles distant from the camp of the Bastarnae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The victors followed in haste and invested the city, expecting confidently that the next day either the enemy would surrender on account of fear or they would take the town by storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Meanwhile the other column of the Dardanians, which had followed the circuitous route, being ignorant of the defeat of their comrades, captured the camp of the Bastarnae, which had been left without a guard.<note>At this point begins the other large lacuna, due to the loss of almost an entire quaternion of V. The narrative may have included an account of the tragic fate of the Bastarnae, who, returning home after the capture of their camp, were almost all drowned when the ice in the Danube broke while they were crossing (Orosius IV. xx). It must also have introduced Antiochus Epiphanes, long a hostage at Rome, who succeeded his brother on the throne of their father, Antiochus the Great.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so when slaves escaped from Achaea Macedonia was a refuge for them because, since the Achaeans had forbidden the Macedonians to enter their country, they themselves did not dare to cross the frontiers of their kingdom.

				<p><quote>The matter under discussion,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Achaeans, appears to some to be trivial or of only moderate importance, but I for my part consider that a question by far the most serious of all is not only being decided, but somehow or other has been decided. For we who had forbidden to the kings of the Macedonians and to the Macedonians themselves admission to our territories and who knew that the decree was still in force, namely that by which we had made provision that we should not receive the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> ambassadors or the messengers of the kings, through whom the sentiments of some of us might be affected, we, I say, are now listening to the king who, so to say, speaks to us though absent, and (heaven help us!) we even approve his speech. And while wild beasts generally disdain and refuse
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> food offered to entrap them, we, blind fools, are caught by the showy bait of a trifling kindness, and, in the hope of recovering some paltry slaves of the slightest value, permit our very liberty to be undermined and endangered. For who does not see that a way for an alliance with the king is being sought, whereby the Roman treaty, on which our whole fate depends, would be violated? Or is it doubtful to anybody that
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> a war between the Romans and Perseus is inevitable, and that this war, anticipated while Philip was alive and postponed
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> by <pb id="p.263"/>his death, will come after the death of Philip? As you<note type="margin">B.C. 174</note> know, Philip had two sons, Demetrius and Perseus. In birth on his mother's side, in character, in intellect, in influence with the Macedonians, Demetrius far surpassed the other.<note>The picture of Demetrius is in general consistent with that presented in earlier books.</note> But because Philip had set up the throne as a prize for hatred of the Romans, he put Demetrius to death, for no other crime than that he had cultivated
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the friendship of the Romans; Perseus he made king, knowing that he would inherit a war with the Roman people almost before he could inherit the throne. Accordingly, what has he done after his father's death except prepare for war? First, to the alarm of all, he turned the Bastarnae loose into Dardania, and if they had retained this district Greece
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> would have found them neighbours more dangerous than Asia found the Gauls.<note>Cf. XXXVIII. xlvii. 11.</note> Disappointed in that hope, he nevertheless did not abandon his plans for the war; no: if we are willing to speak frankly, he has already begun the war. Dolopia he has overrun with arms, and when they wished to appeal in their disputes to the arbitrament of the Roman people he paid no heed.<note>Cf. xxii. 4 and note above.</note> Next, crossing Oeta, so that he suddenly appeared at the very navel of Greece, he climbed up to Delphi. Toward what, do
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> you think, does this assumption of the right to travel an unaccustomed route tend? Then he traversed Thessaly; but if he did so without injuring in any way men whom he hated, all the
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> more do I fear his scheming. Next he directed a letter to us, under pretence of doing us a service, and bids us consider how we shall not need this service in future, that is, that we shall repeal the <pb id="p.265"/>decree by which Macedonians are excluded from the<note type="margin">B.C. 174</note> Peloponnesus, and again see the king's ambassadors, and hospitalities exchanged with their leaders, and presently Macedonian armies and even the king himself crossing from Delphi (for how great a strait flows between us?<note>The Corinthian Gulf between Cape Rhion on the south and across to Cape Antirrhion on the north is only one and a half miles wide.</note> ) to the Peloponnesus, and shall
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> be mingled with the Macedonians as they arm themselves against the Romans! I vote that we shall decree nothing new but preserve everything as it is, until it shall
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> be reduced to certainty whether our fears are false or justified. If the peace between the Macedonians and the Romans remains inviolate, let us

						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> by alleging that it is being endangered and attacked, although no one is either endangering or attacking it, has brought it to pass that whoever should disagree with him would seem to be speaking against the Romans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And first of all, just as if he had not been here with us, but were either coming from the senate-house of the Roman people or were a sharer in the secrets of kings, he knows everything and reports everything which has been done in concealment.

						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But we who know neither for what reason or in what manner Demetrius died nor what Philip would have done if he had lived, ought to adjust our decision to those events which are taking place in full view.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And we do know that Perseus, having gained the throne, was saluted as king by the Roman people: we hear that Roman ambassadors came to King Perseus and that they were courteously received.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All these things I, for my part, interpret as signs of peace, not war; nor can the Romans be offended if, as we followed them in waging war, we now follow them likewise as sponsors of peace. Why indeed we, alone of men, should wage unrelenting war against the Kingdom of the Macedonians, I do not see. Are we vulnerable because of our very proximity to Macedonia? Or are we, like the Dolopians whom he has just subdued, the weakest of all mortals?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No, on the contrary, by the grace of the gods, either our own strength or the distance which separates us makes us secure.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Grant that we are as much at the mercy of the king as the Thessalians, and the Aetolians; have we no more credit and standing in the eyes of the Romans, we who have always been their allies and friends, than the Aetolians, who but a short time ago were their enemies? Whatever rights exist between the Macedonians and the Aetolians, the Thessalians, the Epirotes, in a word, all Greece, let us also possess.

				<p>When the same persons who had applauded the king's letter applauded this speech, on account of the indignation of the chiefs, that what Perseus did not deem deserving even of an embassy he should secure by means of a letter a few lines long, the decree was
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> deferred. Later on ambassadors were sent by the king, at the time when the council was meeting at Megalopolis, and precautions were taken by the party which feared that the Romans would take
					<milestone unit="section" n="20??"/> offence, that they should not be received.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time the rage of the Aetolians, being turned upon themselves, seemed likely, as they murdered one another, to bring the whole people to extermination.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, as they grew wearied, each faction sent ambassadors to Rome, and of their own accord negotiated with one another regarding the restoration of harmony; this effort, broken up by a new crime, reawakened the old passions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When exiles from Hypata, who belonged to the party of Proxenus, had been promised restoration to their city and a public safeguard had been promised them by Eupolemus,<note>Eupolemus was <hi rend="italics">strategus</hi> in 176-<date value="-175">175 B.C.</date>, and the trouble may have occurred then, not in <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date>, when Livy reports it.</note> the chief of the city, eighty distinguished men, whom Eupolemus with the rest of the population had even gone out to meet on <pb id="p.273"/>their return, although they were received with<note type="margin">B.C. 174</note> courteous addresses and hand-clasps, as they entered the gate appealing in vain to the assurances of safety
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> given and to the gods, were slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In consequence of this a more serious war flared up afresh. Gaius Valerius Laevinus, Appius Claudius Pulcher, Gaius Memmius, Marcus Popilius, and Lucius Canuleius, sent by the senate, had arrived.<note>The relation of the embassy mentioned in xxii. 3 above to this is unknown.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When representatives of both factions spoke before them at Delphi with great contentiousness, Proxenus seemed to outstrip the rest, both in the merit of his cause and in eloquence; a few days later he was poisoned by his wife Orthobula; and she being condemned on that charge, went into exile. The same madness rent the Cretans too.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The arrival of Quintus Minucius the commissioner, who had been sent with ten ships to quell their contentions, then brought them to the hope of peace. But the truce was for six months only; then a much more serious war flared up. The Lycians also at this time were being harassed in war by the Rhodians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the wars which foreign nations waged among themselves and the manner in which they were conducted, it is not worth while to relate in detail, since I carry enough and too much of a burden in describing in full the achievements of the Roman people.<note>Livy's vagueness in relating these events probably indicates a lack of actual knowledge of them. He seems to see no connection even between the last war mentioned and the Lycian embassy which he reported at vi. 8-12 above.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Appius Claudius, after displaying the signal for battle and briefly exhorting the troops, led them out by three gates at once.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> then, as they pressed forward one on another, when they had forced their way out beyond the rampart in order that they might extend their line and form it to meet the flanks of the enemy by which they were being surrounded, they burst out so suddenly that the Celtiberians were unable to withstand the charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Before the second hour they were repulsed; about fifteen thousand were killed or captured, and thirty-two standards were taken.

According to Appian, <hi rend="italics">Syrian Wars</hi> ch. viii. 45, he was released from Rome by his brother Seleucus IV, who sent his son Demetrius to replace Antiochus. The ex-hostage spent some time in Athens on his way home, receiving honours and making himself agreeable, particularly in the matter of the temple of Zeus Olympius, begun under Peisistratus and only finished, in spite of the munificence of Antiochus, by Hadrian. At this time Antiochus probably gave the golden aegis with the Gorgon which Pausanias (V. xii. 4) saw above the theatre.

Before his consulship no one had ever put the allies to any trouble or expense in any respect.<note>But Livy has previously mentioned such expenditures as customary for allies outside of Italy, XXXII. xxvii. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Magistrates were supplied with mules and tents and all other military equipment, precisely in order that they might not give any such command to the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senators generally had private relations of hospitality,<note>Cf. XXXVII. liv. 6 and the note.</note> which they generously and courteously cultivated, and their homes at Rome were open to the guests at whose houses they themselves were wont to lodge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ambassadors who were sent on short notice to any place would call upon the towns through which their route took them, for one pack-animal each: no other expense did the allies incur in behalf of Roman officials.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The anger of the consul, even if it was justifiable, should nevertheless not have found vent <pb id="p.297"/>while he was in office, and its silent
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> acceptance by the<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> Praenestines, whether too modest or too fearful, established, as by an approved precedent, the right of magistrates to make demands of this sort, which grew more burdensome day by day.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of this year the ambassadors who had been sent<note>Cf. XLI. xxv. 5, also xxvii. 4, and xxii. 3.</note> to Aetolia and Macedonia reported that an opportunity to interview King Perseus, since some pretended that he was away, some that he was ill (but both falsely), had not been given them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nevertheless, they said, it had become easily apparent to them that preparations for war were being made and that Perseus would not further put off his resort to arms. The ambassadors also reported that the strife in Aetolia was growing daily, and that the leaders in the disputes could not be restrained by their authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since a Macedonian war was in prospect, before it should be undertaken it was decreed that atonement should be made by reason of the prodigies and the peace of the gods should be sought by the rituals which had been published from the oracular books.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At Lanuvium the vision of a great fleet was said to have been seen in the sky, and at Privernum that dark-coloured wool had grown from the earth, and in the Veientine country about Remens that there had been a shower of stones:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> it was reported that the whole Pomptine region had been covered by clouds, one might say, of locusts; and that in the Gallic land, wherever the plough was driven, fish came forth from the upturned sod.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By reason of these prodigies the oracular books were consulted, and announcement was made by the decemvirs to what gods and with what victims the sacrifices should <pb id="p.299"/>be performed, and it was directed that a period of<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> prayer should be celebrated in atonement for the prodigies and that a second such period should be observed which had been vowed a year before for the sake of the health of the people and that a festival should be held.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly sacrifice was offered in the manner which the decemvirs had published in writing.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same year the temple of Juno Lacinia<note>Concerning this noted temple, cf. XXIV. iii., XXVIII. xlvi. 16, XXX. xx. 6. Valerius Maximus, I. i. 20, <quote>moralizes</quote> the story, telling how Fulvius became mentally unbalanced, and the other severely wounded in Macedonia; cf. below, ch. xxviii. 10-12.</note> was stripped of its roof. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus as censor was building the temple to Fortuna Equestris which he had vowed while praetor in Spain during the Celtiberian war,<note>Cf. XL. xl. 10.</note> striving zealously that there should be no temple in Rome larger or more splendid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Considering that it would add great beauty to the temple if the roof tiles were of marble, he set out for Bruttium and stripped the temple of Juno Lacinia of its tiles up to half their number, thinking that these would be sufficient to cover the building which was now being erected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Ships were made ready to load and transport them, the inhabitants being prevented by the censor's high office from forbidding the sacrilege. When the censor returned the tiles were unloaded from the ships and were being taken to the temple.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although nothing was said as to where they were obtained, yet such an act could not be concealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was accordingly an outcry in the senate: from all sides the demand was made that the consuls should lay the question before that body. But when the censor was summoned and entered the senate and died as a result of hearing that one son had been killed <pb id="p.301"/>house, one and all assailed him to his face far more<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> violently:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the most venerable shrine of that region, a shrine which neither Pyrrhus nor Hannibal had violated, he had not been content with violating but had shamefully robbed it of its covering and well-nigh destroyed it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The top, they said, had been torn from the temple and the bare framing laid open to be rotted by the rains. Was it for this, they demanded, that a censor was chosen to control behaviour? That the magistrate to whom had been entrusted, in the fashion of the forefathers, the duty of enforcing the repair of public shrines and of contracting for their maintenance, was himself roving through the cities of the allies plundering the temples and stripping off the roofs of sacred edifices!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A thing, they continued, which might well seem unworthy if done to private buildings of the allies, he was doing when he destroyed the temples of the immortal gods, and fastening upon
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the Roman people the guilt of impiety, building temples with the ruins of temples, just as if the immortal gods were not the same everywhere, but that some should be worshipped and adorned with the spoils of others!
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When it was clear, before the vote was taken, what the sentiment of the Fathers was, when the motion was put, all unanimously decreed that a contract should be let for carrying the tiles back to the temple and that atonements should be offered to Juno.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Those matters which concerned expiation were scrupulously performed; the contractors reported that the tiles had been left in the court of the temple because no workman could devise a plan for replacing them.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Of the praetors who had gone to the provinces, Numerius Fabius died at Massilia, while he was on <pb id="p.303"/>his way to Nearer Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore, when news of<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> this was brought by ambassadors from Massilia, the senate decreed that Publius Furius and Gnaeus Servilius, who were being replaced, should cast lots and decide between them which should govern Nearer Spain under an extension of his <hi rend="italics">imperium.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The lot was fortunate in that Publius Furius, the same man under whose command that province had been, was selected to remain.</p> 
				<p>The same year, since a considerable part of the Ligurian and Gallic land which had been captured in war was unoccupied, a decree of the senate was passed that this land should be assigned to individuals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For this purpose and in accordance with the decree of the senate, the <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus,</hi> Aulus Atilius, presided at the election as decemvirs of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Gaius Cassius, Titus Aebutius Parrus, Gaius Tremellius, Publius Cornelius Cethegus, Quintus and Lucius Apuleius, Marcus Caecilius, Gaius Salonius, Gaius Munatius. Their allotments to individual citizens were ten <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> each, to allies of the Latin confederacy, three each.<note>Inclusion of allies in such distributions seems to have been unprecedented.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>About the same time that these events occurred, ambassadors from Aetolia came to Rome to report concerning the quarrels and internal strife of the Aetolians,<note>See <hi rend="italics">supra,</hi> ii. 2</note> as well as Thessalian ambassadors bringing news of what was happening in Macedonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Perseus, pondering in his mind the war which had been planned even before his father's death, was striving to win over to himself not only all the states of Greece but also the cities, sending embassies and making promises rather than carrying them out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Moreover, the sympathies of a large proportion of the people were for him, and they were much more <pb id="p.305"/>inclined to favour him than Eumenes, although the<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> acts of kindness and generosity of Eumenes had put all of the cities of Greece and many important personages under obligations to him, and he so conducted himself in his kingdom that the cities which were under his control did not desire to exchange their condition for that of any free state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the other hand, there was the rumour that after his father's death Perseus had killed his wife with his own hand;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that Apelles, once the agent of treachery in the murder of his brother, who for that reason had been sought out for punishment by Philip, he had recalled from exile, after the death of his father, with lavish offers of rewards for performing so splendid a deed, and then had secretly put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A man made infamous by many other murders of citizens and aliens, and worthy of praise for no good quality whatever, was generally preferred by the states to a king so devoted to his relatives, so just to his citizens, so generous to all men, whether because these states were predisposed, on account of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> reputation and dignity of the Macedonian kings, to despise the origin of a kingdom recently formed,<note>The kingdom of Pergamum dated only from Attalus I, father of Eumenes.</note> or because they were eager for a change in their condition, or because they did not wish all things to become completely subject to the Romans.<note>Whether the order of possible explanations is intended by Livy to be climactic, we cannot judge. One suspects that anti-Roman elements, as well as others more purely patriotic, now saw in Perseus their only hope of escape from Roman domination, as once the Greeks had looked to the Romans to save them from Philip.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But it was not the Aetolians alone who were in a state of civil war because of the huge burden of debt, but also the Thessalians; and spreading by contact like a pestilence, the evil had reached even into Perrhaebia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the news came <pb id="p.307"/>that the Thessalians were in arms, the senate sent<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> Appius Claudius as commissioner to investigate and settle these affairs. He, after reproving the leaders of both factions and lightening the burden of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> debts which had been made more grievous by illegal interest, the majority of the creditors who had imposed it having made this concession, provided for the payment of the just debts in ten annual installments. The difficulties in Perrhaebia were settled by the same Appius and on the same basis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcus Marcellus, who was at Delphi about the same time, learned that the Aetolians were pleading their cases in the same belligerent spirit which they had shown in their civil war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When he saw that both sides were contending with reckless violence, he was unwilling, so far as his decree was concerned, either to lighten or to increase the burden of either side; he asked the two in common to refrain from their warfare and to end their quarrels in forgetfulness of the past. By an exchange of hostages they gave assurance of their mutual good faith in their reconciliation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Corinth was designated as the place in which the hostages should be placed in custody.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Delphi and the meeting of the Aetolian council Marcellus crossed to Aegium in the Peloponnesus, where he had called<note>Marcellus, in calling a council, overstepped the bounds set by the senate in <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. xxxiii. 8), but perhaps Livy has not stated the facts exactly.</note> a meeting of the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, having heartily praised the people because they had steadfastly adhered to their old resolution<note>Cf. XLI. xxiii. 1.</note> not to permit the kings of the Macedonians to enter their territory, he made conspicuous the hatred which the Romans felt for Perseus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that this hatred should break out betimes was the <pb id="p.309"/>consequence of the arrival in Rome of King Eumenes,<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> bringing with him a memorandum which he had prepared, after thorough investigation, as to Perseus' preparations for war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> About the same time five commissioners were sent to the king to look into the situation in Macedonia. They were also instructed to proceed to Alexandria for the purpose of renewing the friendship of the Romans with Ptolemy.<note>Ptolemy V (Epiphanes) had been succeeded in <date value="-181">181 B.C.</date> by the boy Ptolemy VI (Philometor), but Livy has not previously mentioned the fact.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The commissioners were the following: Gaius Valerius, Gaius Lutatius Cerco, Quintus Baebius Sulca, Marcus Cornelius Mammula, Marcus Caecilius Denter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From King Antiochus<note>For the Romanizing of Antiochus Epiphanes, cf. XLI. xx. l ff.</note> also came ambassadors about the same time: their chief, Apollonius, when he was given an audience before the senate, made explanations for the king, giving many plausible reasons why he was paying his tribute later than the appointed day;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he had, he said, brought the entire sum with him in order that the king might ask no indulgence except in the matter of the delay. In addition, he said that he was bringing, as a gift, golden vases of five hundred pounds' weight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The king begged that the alliance and friendship which had existed with his father might be renewed with him too, and that the Roman people would give him any orders which were proper to give to a king who was a loyal and faithful ally; he would fail in no performance of duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senate, the ambassador went on, had rendered such services to the king when he was in Rome, the young men such courtesy, that all ranks had regarded him as a king, not as a hostage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The ambassadors received a gracious reply, and Aulus Atilius, the <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus,</hi> was instructed to renew with Antiochus the treaty which had existed with his father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The city quaestors received the tribute, the <pb id="p.311"/>censors the golden vases, and the responsibility was<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> delegated to them of depositing them in whatever temples they saw fit; the ambassador<note>The usual procedure was to give 2000 <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> to each member of an embassy (cf. e.g. xix. 6 below); the last sentence of the chapter may explain the senate's generosity to Apollonius.</note> received one hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">as</hi>-pieces as a gift, and a house, free of charge, was given for his entertainment, and his expenses, so long as he should be in Italy, were provided for by decree.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman ambassadors who had been in Syria had reported that Apollonius stood in highest favour with the king and was most friendly to the Roman people.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following were the events of the year in the provinces: Gaius Cicereius the praetor fought a pitched battle in Corsica; seven thousand of the Corsicans were killed and more than seventeen hundred captured. During that battle the praetor had vowed a temple to Juno Moneta.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Peace was then granted at the request of the Corsicans, and two hundred thousand pounds of wax demanded of them. Having subdued Corsica, Cicereius then crossed into Sardinia. Among the Ligurians also there was a battle near the town of Carystus in the territory of Statellae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thither a great army of Ligurians had assembled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first, at the approach of Marcus Popilius the consul, they kept within their ramparts; later, when they saw that the Roman was about to assault the town, they moved out and formed in line of battle in front of the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor did the consul, since he had sought just this by threatening an assault, delay the engagement. The battle raged for more than three hours in such a way that hope inclined to neither side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, when the consul saw that the Ligurian masses were nowhere shaken, he ordered the cavalry to mount their horses and to charge the enemy at three points at the same time and with all <pb id="p.313"/>possible uproar. A large part of the cavalry<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> penetrated the centre of the line and pushed their way through to the rear of the fighters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As a result, the Ligurians were thrown into a panic; they scattered in flight in all directions, very few returning to the town because there more than anywhere else the cavalry had thrown themselves in the way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Not only had a fight so stubborn destroyed many of the Ligurians, but others also were cut down in their random flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is said that ten thousand men were killed, and more than seven hundred captured, and that eighty-two military standards were brought back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor was the victory bloodless: more than three thousand Roman soldiers were lost, since the front ranks on both sides were slain when neither army gave way.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Ligurians, after this battle, had assembled in one place from their scattered flight, and they saw that a far greater number of their citizens was lost than saved &mdash;for there were not more than ten thousand of them &mdash;they surrendered, without, indeed, making any stipulations;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> nevertheless they had hoped that the consul would treat them with no greater severity than former commanders had shown. But he disarmed them all, demolished their town, and sold them and all their property; then he sent dispatches to the senate reporting his achievement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When Aulus Atilius the praetor had read them in the senate &mdash;for the other consul Postumius was absent, being busy in Campania with surveying the public lands &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> action seemed outrageous to the senate, that the Statellates, who alone of the Ligurians had not made war on the Romans, who even on this occasion had
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> been attacked <pb id="p.315"/>although they had not begun a war, who had entrusted<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> themselves to the good faith of the Roman people, should have been harassed and destroyed with every form of extreme cruelty, that so many thousands of innocent persons, calling upon the Roman people for protection, should have been sold &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> fate which established the worst possible precedent and issued a warning that no one should ever dare in the future to surrender &mdash;and, scattered in every direction, should, though at peace, be slaves to those who had once been downright enemies of the Roman people.<note>A surrender usually assumed that the lives and personal liberties of the surrendered would be respected. Senatorial policy toward the Ligurians had been somewhat vacillating, though never countenancing such severity as that of Popilius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For these reasons the senate decreed that the consul Marcus Popilius should restore to liberty the Ligurians themselves, returning the purchase-price to the purchasers, and should see to it that their property, such of it as could be recovered, should be given back to them; that their arms also should be returned to them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and that all this should be done at the earliest possible moment; and that the consul should not leave his province until he had re-established the surrendered Ligurians in their homes. A truly glorious victory, they added, was won by defeating men in battle, not by torturing the distressed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul turned the arrogance of soul which he had displayed towards the Ligurians to disobeying the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He straightway sent the legions into winter-quarters at Pisa, and himself, angry with the Fathers and enraged at the praetor, returned to Rome; and immediately summoning the senate to the temple of Bellona, he assailed at great length the praetor who, although by reason of the success in
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the war he ought to have put to the senate a motion that honour be paid to the immortal <pb id="p.317"/>gods, had proposed a decree of the senate directed<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> against Popilius and in favour of the enemy, by which he was transferring the consul's victory to the Ligurians and (although himself only a praetor) was almost ordering the consul to be delivered to them:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> therefore he imposed a fine upon the praetor; he begged the Fathers to order that the decree of the senate which had been passed against him
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> should be repealed, and that the thanksgiving which they should have voted in his absence, in consequence of the dispatches which he had sent regarding his victory, should now be decreed in his presence: first, to render honour to the gods; second, to show at least some sign of respect to himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul was attacked by a number of the senators in speeches no less severe than those delivered in his absence, and returned to his province without obtaining either petition.<note>The ultimate fate of the Ligurians is unknown, but it appears that neither senate nor consul could coerce the other, and it is doubtful whether Popilius carried out the instructions. It may be inferred from the election of Popilius' brother as consul that he had some popular support. For the final outcome, see below, xxi.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The other consul, Postumius, spent the summer surveying the public lands, and without seeing his province at all returned to Rome to hold the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He announced the choice of Gaius Popilius Laenas and Publius Aelius Ligus.<note>According to the Fasti Capitolini, this is the first election at which two plebeians were chosen consuls.</note> Next the praetors were chosen: Gaius Licinius Crassus, Marcus Junius Pennus, Spurius Lucretius, Spurius Cluvius, Gnaeus Sicinius, Gaius Memmius (for the second time).<note>The name of Memmius is restored from x. 14 below. To judge from the reading of V (see the critical note), <hi rend="italics">iterum</hi> belongs with Memmius, although no previous praetorship for him is recorded. Sicinius had been praetor in <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. xlv. 2), so that perhaps <hi rend="italics">iterum</hi> has been misplaced. I have not ventured to transpose it.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In that year the <hi rend="italics">lustrum</hi> was closed; the censors were Quintus Fulvius Flaccus and Aulus Postumius <pb id="p.319"/>Albinus; Postumius closed the <hi rend="italics">lustrum.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The number<note type="margin">B.C. 173</note> of Roman citizens listed in the census was 269,015,<note>But the <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> gives 267,231.</note> a somewhat smaller number because the consul Lucius Postumius had proclaimed before an assembly that of the allies of the Latin confederacy who had been obligated, under the edict of Gaius Claudius the consul, to return to their cities, no one should be listed at Rome but all in their own cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The censorship was harmonious and useful to the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All those whom they expelled from the senate or whose horses they took away were transferred to the <hi rend="italics">aerarii</hi><note>Cf. IV. xxiv. 7, and the note.</note> and removed from their tribes; neither censor approved anyone who had been marked for censure by the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fulvius dedicated the temple of Fortuna Equestris which, as proconsul in Spain, he had vowed while fighting with the legions of the Celtiberians, six<note>Cf. above, iii. 1.</note> years after he had vowed it, and he gave theatrical performances for four days and one day in the circus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, decemvir in charge of sacrifices, died that year. To replace him Aulus Postumius Albinus was chosen. Such great clouds of locusts from the sea suddenly appeared over Apulia that they covered the fields far and wide with their swarms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To destroy this pest, so fatal to crops, Gnaeus Sicinius, praetor-elect, was invested with the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> and sent to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Apulia, and assembling a vast crowd of men to collect the locusts, spent a certain amount of time in this way.</p> 
				<p>The beginning of the following year, in the<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> consulship of Gaius Popilius and Publius Aelius, continued the unfinished controversies of the preceding year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Fathers wished the decree of the senate regarding the Ligurians to be resubmitted and re-adopted,<note>This action was necessary since M. Popilius was no longer a consul.</note> and <pb id="p.321"/>the consul Aelius was ready to submit it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Popilius<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> entreated both his colleague and the senate on behalf of his brother, declaring that if they passed any decree he would veto it. Aelius he discouraged from acting; the Fathers, enraged at both consuls alike for that reason, stood by their proposal the more vigorously.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so, when the question of provinces was taken up and Macedonia was sought after, because war with Perseus was now threatening, they decreed the Ligurians to both consuls; they refused to decree Macedonia unless the motion regarding Marcus Popilius were put to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then, when the consuls requested that they be authorized to enlist new armies or reinforcements for the old, both petitions were denied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The praetors also, who were asking for reinforcements for Spain, were refused, Marcus Junius for Nearer Spain, Spurius Lucretius for Farther Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Gaius Licinius Crassus had received the civil jurisdiction from the lots, Gnaeus Sicinius that between aliens, Sicily was assigned to Gaius Memmius, Sardinia to Spurius Cluvius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The consuls, angered at the senate for these reasons, proclaimed the Latin festival for the first available day and announced that they would set out to their province and would transact no public business except that which pertained to the government of the provinces.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Valerius Antias writes<note>Polybius (XXIV. 5) (L.C.L.) and Diodorus (XXIX. xxv) place the embassy of Attalus earlier; it may have been mentioned in some lost portion of Book XLI.</note> that Attalus, the brother of King Eumenes, came as an ambassador to Rome in this same consulship, to lay charges against Perseus and to give an account of his preparations for war. The works of the majority of historians,<note>It is uncertain who these other annalists were. Claudius Quadrigarius was probably one of them. For similar choices by Livy between divergent accounts, cf. V. xlvi. 11, VIII. xviii. 2, XXI. xxviii. 6, and xxxviii. (here Livy uses better principles than elsewhere), XXI. xlvi. 10, XXXVIII. lv. 8, XXXIX. liii (a careful discussion, but see the note, vol. XI., p. 385). Livy seems to have learned historical discretion in the course of his huge task, but never quite attained to scientific criticism of his sources.</note> <pb id="p.323"/>and men whom you would prefer to trust, say that<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> Eumenes himself came.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Eumenes, then, on his arrival in Rome was received with such honours as they believed not only due to his deserts but also commensurate with their own favours which had been heaped upon him in abundance, and was introduced into the senate by the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He said that the reason for his coming to Rome, in addition to his desire to see the gods and men by whose kindness he enjoyed a fortune beyond which he did not venture even to wish for anything, had been to give public warning to the senate that they should take measures against the designs of Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, beginning with the plans of Philip, he spoke of the death of Philip's son Demetrius, who opposed the war with Rome, and mentioned the summoning of the people of the Bastarnae from their homes, relying on whose aid<note>Cf. XL. Ivii. 6-9.</note> Philip was to cross into Italy. While he was revolving such plans in his mind, death had overtaken him, and he had left his kingdom to the one who (he had seen) was most dangerous to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so, Eumenes said, Perseus had long been preparing a war which had been left him as a legacy by his father and handed on to him along with the throne, and had been feeding and nursing it &mdash;it was now very close &mdash;by all possible schemes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Perseus, besides, was strong in the number of his young men, a generation which the long peace had brought forth, was strong in the resources of his kingdom, was strong too in his own youth. While he possessed strength and vigour of body, his mind too had been long trained in the theory and practice of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even from boyhood, in his fathers' tent, he had been made accustomed to wars with Rome, not merely to campaigns against their <pb id="p.325"/>neighbours, and had been sent by his father on many and<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> various expeditions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From the moment he had received the throne, Eumenes went on to say, he had gained, in a marvellous series of triumphs, many things which Philip had been unable to accomplish either by force or by craft, although he had left nothing untried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There had been added to his strength an influence which was usually acquired through a long period of time and by numerous and important services.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For, said Eumenes, all men in the cities of Greece and Asia revered his dignity. In consideration of what services or what generosity such respect was being paid him, Eumenes could not see, or say for certain whether this was happening by reason of a certain good luck or whether &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Eumenes feared to suggest this &mdash;the ill-will felt for the Romans won men over to his cause.<note>We can hardly question that fear of the Romans made many turn to Perseus as a possible source of freedom from Roman control.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Even among the kings he was great in influence and had married the daughter of Seleucus,<note>Cf. Dittenberger, <hi rend="italics">Sylloge</hi> (3rd ed.) 639, a dedicatory inscription to the queen, Laodice, by the people of Delos.</note> not having sought her but rather having been sought; he had given his sister to Prusias, who had begged and entreated for her;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> both marriages had been greeted with congratulations and gifts from countless embassies, and the nuptial processions were accompanied, as it were, by the noblest peoples as sponsors and attendants.<note>Livy has confused Greek and Roman ceremonies. The <foreign lang="greek">numfagwgoi/</foreign> who escorted the bride assume also the (Roman) r&ocirc;le of takers of the auspices. I have tried to suggest the dual meaning in the translation.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Boeotian people, to whom Philip had paid court, could never be induced to sign any treaty of alliance; but now a treaty with Perseus was engraved in three places, one at Thebes, the second at Delium<note>The conjecture of Madvig has been adopted since Delium, conjectured by him, is in Boeotia; the alternative is Delos. The text is uncertain. For Delos as a publicity centre, cf. Polybius XXV. 3: <quote>(Perseus) posted up lists of these (exiles) at Delos, Delphi, and the temple of Itonian Athena.</quote></note> in a <pb id="p.327"/>most revered and celebrated temple, the third at<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> Delphi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the Achaean council, moreover, if the action had not been prevented by a few men who threatened them with the Roman might, matters were almost brought to such a pass that access into Achaea was granted him.<note>Cf. XLIL xxiii.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, by Hercules, the honours of Eumenes himself, of whose services to that people it could hardly be determined whether the public or the private were the greater, had partly been abandoned from disuse and neglect, partly abolished in hostility. Again, who, he asked, did not know that the Aetolians in their internal strife had sought aid, not from the Romans, but from Perseus? Supported by these alliances and friendships, Perseus had such military resources at home that he did not need foreign aid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had made ready a grain supply sufficient for ten years for thirty thousand infantry and five thousand cavalry, so that he could be independent of both his own and the enemy's land in the matter of provisions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He now possessed so much money that he had in readiness pay for ten thousand mercenary troops, for the same period of years, in addition to his Macedonian forces, besides the annual revenue which he derived from the royal mines.<note>Cf. XXXIX. xxiv. 2.</note> Weapons for armies even three times as great had been heaped up by him in his arsenals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now the youth of Thrace was placed under his control, from which he could draw as if from a never-failing spring in case Macedonia should ever be exhausted.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The rest of his speech was exhortation: <quote>I am relating this to you, conscript Fathers,</quote> he said, <quote>not as founded on uncertain rumours and too eagerly accepted because I wished these charges against an enemy to be true, but as ascertained and <pb id="p.329"/>discovered with as much accuracy as if I had been<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> sent by you as a scout to investigate and were reporting what lay before my eyes;
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> nor should I have left my kingdom, which you have made extensive and noble, and crossed so great a sea, in order to diminish your confidence in me by bringing you an idle tale;
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I saw the most famed states of Asia and Greece daily laying bare their judgments more clearly, with the intention, if it were permitted, of proceeding so far presently that they would have no chance to draw back and repent;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I saw Perseus not limiting himself to the kingdom of Macedonia, seizing some places by arms, and by influence and kindness winning over others which could not be subdued by force;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I saw how unjust was the fortune that caused you, while he was preparing war on you, to grant him the security of peace, although to me indeed he seemed to be, not preparing war, but almost waging it.

						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he sent assistance to the Byzantines contrary to the treaty; he made war on Dolopia; he traversed Thessaly and Doris with his army, in order that he might in their civil war aid the worse cause and crush <pb id="p.331"/>the

						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Since you remained passive and acquiescent while he did this, and he sees that Greece has been surrendered to him by you, he feels assured that before he crosses into Italy no armed man will meet him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> How safe or how honourable this is for you is for yourselves to consider; I at least have deemed it to be a disgrace to me that Perseus should come to Italy to bring war before I, your ally, should have come to warn you to be on guard.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Having performed my needful task and, so to speak, absolved and acquitted myself of my trust, what more can I do except pray to the gods and the goddesses that you will look after the interests of yourselves and your state, and of us, your allies and friends who depend upon you?</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This speech made a profound impression upon the conscript Fathers. But at the time no one was allowed to know anything except that the king had been in the senate-house; with such silence was the senate-house closed. Finally, after the war was over, information leaked out as to what the king had said and what response had been made.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Then a few days later an audience before the senate was given to the ambassadors of King Perseus. But the senators' feelings even more than their ears having been prepossessed by King Eumenes, every plea and every excuse of the ambassadors was rejected: and the excessively arrogant demeanour of Harpalus, who was the leader of the embassy, <pb id="p.333"/>exasperated their minds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He said that the king<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> really wished and exerted himself that he should be believed when he pled in his defence that he had neither said nor done anything with hostile intent;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but if he saw that a pretext for war was being all too eagerly sought, he would defend himself with resolution. Mars, he said, was impartial, and the result of war uncertain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>All the cities of Greece and Asia were interested in what the ambassadors of Perseus and what Eumenes had said in the senate; and by reason of his coming, which they believed would provoke some action, most of the cities had sent ambassadors alleging this or that as to their errands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> [And an embassy of the Rhodians was also present in Rome, the leading man in which was insolent, although what he was to say was not devoid of truth];<note>The supplement in brackets is that of H. J. M&uuml;ller (see critical note) and is, like the other supplements which have been suggested, based in part upon Appian, <hi rend="italics">Bel. Mac.</hi> xi. 3 (White, Vol. II, p. 33 of the L.C.L.). The ambassador is not named by Appian.</note> he felt certain that Eumenes had included some charges against their state too, along with his charges against Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so in every fashion, through their patrons and Roman hosts, the envoy sought the opportunity to argue with the king in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When this did not fall to his lot, assailing the king with unrestrained violence, because he had stirred up the Lycian people against the Rhodians and because he was more oppressive to Asia than Antiochus had been, he delivered a speech which was ingratiating and not displeasing to the peoples of Asia &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the popularity of Perseus had spread even there &mdash;but <pb id="p.335"/>was offensive to the senate and useless to the Rhodians<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> and their state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But the conspiracy<note>The attacks of Perseus and the Rhodians were regarded by the Romans as concerted.</note> against Eumenes won for him greater favour with the Romans. And so all honours were conferred upon him and the most generous gifts were bestowed upon him, together with a curule chair and an ivory sceptre.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the embassies had been dismissed, when Harpalus with all possible speed had returned to Macedonia and reported to the king that he had left the Romans not yet, indeed, preparing for war,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> but so unfriendly that it was easily evident that they would not try to delay it, then Perseus likewise, not to mention the fact that he believed that this would be the outcome, was now even eager for war, believing that he was at the height of his power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was more specially incensed at Eumenes; beginning the war with an attempt on his life, he employed Evander the Cretan, a commander of auxiliaries, and three Macedonians who were accustomed to the performance of such crimes, to murder the king, and he gave them a letter to his friend Praxo, a woman high in influence and wealth at Delphi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was generally known that Eumenes was intending to go up to Delphi to offer sacrifices to Apollo. The plotters, led by Evander, going in advance and carefully reconnoitering the ground, were searching for nothing else than a suitable place at which to accomplish their purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As travellers ascend to the temple from Cirrha, before they reach the districts where buildings abound, there was a wall on the left beside a path which stood out only a little distance from the lower courses of the wall, where men could only pass in single file; the right side, in consequence of a land-slide, had fallen away <pb id="p.337"/>to a considerable depth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They concealed themselves<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> behind the wall, building up steps so that they might hurl their missiles, as from a rampart, upon the king as he passed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first he approached from the sea surrounded by a crowd of his friends and courtiers, then the narrowness of the road gradually thinned out the line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they came to that place where they had to walk in single file, the first to enter the path was Pantaleon, a leading citizen of Aetolia, with whom the king had begun a conversation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then the plotters, springing up, rolled down two huge stones, one of which struck the king's head, the other his shoulder; and being stunned he fell from the path down the slope, and many stones were heaped upon him as he now lay prostrate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And the rest, even the crowd of his friends and courtiers, scattered after they saw his fall; Pantaleon on the other hand courageously remained to defend the king.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The assassins might have made a short detour around the end of the wall and have run down to kill the wounded man, but, as if their task was completed, they fled toward the ridge of Parnassus with such speed that when one of them, finding it difficult to keep up with the others on the pathless and difficult ground, was delaying their escape, they
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> in order that no information might be got from him in case he were caught, killed him, their companion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> First the king's friends, then his courtiers and slaves, gathered around his body; lifting him up, still stunned by the blow and unconscious, they nevertheless, from the warmth and the breath which remained in his chest, perceived that he was alive; there was slight hope &mdash;almost no hope at all &mdash;that he would recover.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some of the courtiers, following <pb id="p.339"/>the trail of the murderers, when, wearying themselves<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> in vain, they had reached the ridge of Parnassus, returned without accomplishing anything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Macedonians, although they planned their crime not injudiciously and boldly, yet abandoned their undertaking injudiciously and cravenly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The next day the king, having recovered consciousness, was carried aboard ship by his friends; thence they proceeded to Corinth and from Corinth, the ships having been drawn over the ridge of the Isthmus,<note>Ships were hauled across the Isthmus on a roadway.</note> to Aegina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There his treatment was conducted so secretly, no one being admitted to his presence, that the rumour reached Asia that he was dead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Even Attalus believed it more readily than was worthy of their fraternal harmony; for he conferred with his brother's wife and with the commander of the citadel as if he were now beyond doubt heir to the throne.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Later on this did not escape the knowledge of Eumenes; and although he decided to ignore it and pass over it in silence and to endure it, he yet at their first meeting did not refrain from reproaching his brother for his excessive haste to woo his wife.<note>Stratonice had been childless for over sixteen years; she now became pregnant and in due course bore a son, whom Eumenes, according to Polybius (XXX. 27), had not acknowledged at least five years later, but who subsequently succeeded his legal uncle, Attalus II, as Attalus III. (W. S. Ferguson).</note> To Rome also the report of the death of Eumenes spread.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Gaius Valerius, who had gone to Greece as commissioner to investigate the condition of the region and to enquire into the designs of Perseus,<note>Cf. vi. 5 above.</note> returned from thence, <pb id="p.341"/>and his reports agreed in all respects with the charges<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> brought by Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the same time, too, he had brought with him Praxo from Delphi, whose house had been the shelter of the assassins, and Lucius Rammius of Brundisium, who was the bearer of the following information.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Rammius was a prominent citizen of Brundisium, and he entertained hospitably all Romans, both generals and ambassadors, as well as distinguished personages of foreign states and especially members of princely houses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In consequence he had formed an acquaintance with Perseus, though he was far away; and when a letter roused in him the hope of a more intimate friendship and of great prosperity as a result, he went to visit the king and in a short time began to be regarded as his confidant and to be drawn into his secret conferences to a greater degree than he desired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For by the promise of great rewards the king began to ask of him, since all the Roman generals and ambassadors were accustomed to avail themselves of his hospitality, that he should undertake to poison those about whom Perseus should communicate with him by letter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king said that he was aware that to prepare poison involved a great deal of trouble and risk; that it was prepared with too many persons sharing in the secret; moreover, that its administration was uncertain, whether doses were sufficiently powerful to accomplish the purpose or sufficiently safe to keep the act concealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He promised that he would supply a poison which could not be detected by any symptom, either while being given or after it was given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Rammius, fearing that if he refused he himself would be the first to be a test of the poison, promised that he would do as the king <pb id="p.343"/>wished and departed; nor did he wish to return<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> to Brundisium until he had met Gaius Valerius, who was said to be in the neighbourhood of Chalcis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having first given him this information, by the order of Valerius he came with him to Rome. Being introduced into the senate, he reported what had occurred.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These revelations, added to those which Eumenes had given, brought to pass a speedier declaration that Perseus was an enemy, since they saw that he was not merely preparing a regular war, as a king should, but was also perpetrating crimes of brigandage and poisoning by all sorts of secret means.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The conduct of the war was referred to the next consuls; for the present however, it was decided that Gnaeus Sicinius, the praetor who exercised jurisdiction over cases between citizens and aliens, should enlist troops
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> who should be conducted as rapidly as possible to Brundisium and thence be transported to Apollonia in Epirus as garrisons for the cities on the coast, where the consul to whose lot the province of Macedonia should have fallen might safely put in with his fleet and conveniently disembark his troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Eumenes, who had been detained for some time at Aegina by a dangerous and difficult course of treatment, setting out for Pergamum as soon as he could safely, was preparing for war with the greatest energy, this fresh attack by Perseus, in addition to his former hatred, urging him on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Ambassadors from Rome came there bringing congratulations because he had escaped from so great a danger.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the Macedonian war had been put off for a year and the other praetors had already set out for <pb id="p.345"/>their provinces, Marcus Junius and Spurius Lucretius,<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> to whose lots the Spanish provinces had fallen, after wearying the senate again and again by the same request, at length succeeded in having reinforcements voted to them for the army: they were directed to enlist three thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty cavalry for the Roman legions, and for the allied army five thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These troops were transported to the two Spains with the new praetors.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This same year, since as a result of the investigation conducted by the consul Postumius a great part of the Campanian land, which private individuals had occupied without making due distinction of boundaries, had been recovered for the state, Marcus Lucretius, tribune of the people, published a measure providing that the censors should issue leases for the use of the Campanian land, which had not been done for
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> so many years after the fall of Capua that the greed of private citizens had a free field in which to wander.<note>Cf. i. 6 above and the note.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While the senate was in a state of expectancy (the war having already been determined upon even though not formally declared) as to which kings would follow their friendship and which that of Perseus, ambassadors from King Ariarathes came to Rome, bringing with them his young son:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> their message was that the king sent his son to Rome to be brought up, to the end that even from boyhood he might be accustomed to Roman manners and men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He asked the Romans to receive him, not only under the care of citizens of private station who were his hosts, but as it were under the care and guardianship of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king's embassy was pleasing to <pb id="p.347"/>the Senate; they decreed that Gnaeus Sicinius the<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> praetor should contract for the rental of a house where the prince and his retinue could suitably reside. When ambassadors of the Thracians, the Maedi, the Cepnati, and the Asti,<note>These states were among the Thracian peoples who were not under Macedonian control. Since they lay to the east of Macedonia, they were, from the Roman standpoint, in its rear.</note> sought an alliance and friendship, their request was granted and in addition gifts of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> were presented to each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans were glad that these peoples particularly had joined the alliance because Thrace lay in the rear of Macedonia. But, in order to have full information regarding Asia and the islands also, they sent Tiberius Claudius Nero and Marcus Decimius as commissioners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate directed them to visit Crete and Rhodes, partly to renew friendships, partly to ascertain whether the sympathies of the allies had been excited by King Perseus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In a city which was at the highest pitch of excitement about the new war, during a storm at night the <hi rend="italics">columna rostrata</hi><note>This column, which was adorned with the beaks (<hi rend="italics">rostra</hi>) of captured ships, dated from the year <date value="-254">254 B.C.</date> The similar column of Duilius, a copy of which is preserved, stood in the Forum. There seems to be no further mention of the <hi rend="italics">columna</hi> <hi rend="italics">Aemilia.</hi></note> which had been set up on the Capitoline in the first Punic war in honour of the victory of the consul Marcus Aemilius, whose colleague was Servius Fulvius, was completely destroyed by lightning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This event was regarded as a prodigy and was referred to the senate; the Fathers ordered that the matter should be referred to the <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> and, moreover, that the decemvirs should consult the Books.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The decemvirs reported back that the city should be purified, that a period of supplication and prayer should be held and that <pb id="p.349"/>sacrifices of full-grown victims should be offered both<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> on the Capitoline at Rome and in Campania at the promontory of Minerva; further, that at the earliest possible moment games for ten days should be celebrated in honour of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All these directions were scrupulously obeyed. The <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> pronounced that this omen would turn out for the best, and that an extension of frontiers and the destruction of the enemy were foretold, because those beaks which the storm had overthrown had been spoils taken from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Other occurrences also increased their concern to appease the gods: news had been brought that at Saturnia there were showers of blood in the town on three successive days; that at Calatia an ass with three feet was born and a bull with five cows was killed by a single bolt of lightning; that at Auximum a shower of earth had fallen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By reason of these prodigies also sacrifices were offered and a day of prayer and a festival were celebrated.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls up to this time had not set out to their province<note>The narrative continues from x. 15 above.</note> because they would not yield to the senate in passing a decree regarding Marcus Popilius, and the Fathers were determined to allow no other decree to have precedence over it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The ill-will against Popilius was increased again by dispatches in which he reported that as proconsul he had fought a second time with the Ligurian Statellates and had killed six thousand of them; because of the injustice done in this war the rest of the Ligurian peoples also took up arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then indeed not the absent Popilius alone was reproached in the senate because he had made war on surrendered tribes contrary to justice and right, and had roused <pb id="p.351"/>pacified people to rebellion, but the consuls as well,<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> because they did not go to their province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Prompted by this harmony among the Fathers, Marcus Marcius Sermo and Quintus Marcius Scilla, tribunes of the people, first proclaimed that they would lay a fine upon the consuls if they should not go to their provinces, and then read in the senate the motion which they proposed to offer regarding the surrendered Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was proposed that in case anyone of the surrendered Statellans had not been restored to liberty before the Kalends of August following, the senate should decree on oath<note>Cf. XXVI. xxxiii. 14, XXX. xl. 12. On each of these occasions the matter seems to have been referred by the popular assembly to the senate <quote>with power</quote>; since the senate was in theory only an advisory body (and had on occasion been hostile to the commons), the oath perhaps was meant to bind the senators to the utmost scrupulousness and impartiality in making these delegated and final decisions.</note> what officials should investigate this matter and punish the person by whose malice the aforesaid person had become a slave. Then, on the authorization of the senate, they published this decree. Before the consuls set out, an audience before the senate was granted to Gaius Cicereius, praetor of the preceding year, in the temple of Bellona.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he had set forth his achievements in Corsica<note>Cf. vii. 1-2 above.</note> and had vainly demanded a
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> triumph, he celebrated his triumph on the Alban Mount, which had now become customary<note>This statement cannot be verified from Livy's narrative, in which no triumph <hi rend="italics">in monte Albano</hi> has been mentioned since XXXIII. xxiii. 8. In that passage, the triumphing consul cites the precedent of <quote>many famous men,</quote> but Livy mentions only one, XXVI. xxi.</note> in order to permit the celebration of a triumph without the authorization of the state. The plebeian assembly voted and ordered the Marcian proposal regarding the Ligurians with complete unanimity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In accordance with this legislation the praetor Gaius Licinius consulted the senate as to whom they would choose to investigate under that bill. The Fathers ordered Licinius himself to conduct the investigation.</p> <pb id="p.353"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then at last the consuls set out for their<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> province and took over the army from Marcus Popilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The ex-consul, however, did not dare to return to Rome for fear of having to stand his trial, in the face of an unfriendly senate and still more hostile commons, before the praetor who had put to the senate the question of the investigation directed against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This reluctance of his was met by the threat of another decree sponsored by the tribunes of the people, to the effect that if Popilius did not enter Rome before the thirteenth of November, Gaius Licinius was to determine the facts and pass judgment in his absence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he returned, dragged home by this fetter, he came before the senate amid great ill-feeling.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After he had been assailed there by the attacks of many, a resolution of the senate was passed that those Ligurians who had not been enemies since the consulship of Quintus Fulvius and Lucius Manlius<note>B.C. 179, cf. XL. xliii. 4. The senate reversed itself by this action; previously it had granted triumphs, XL. lix. 1-3, XLI. xiii. 6-8, but now implied that these campaigns had been irregular.</note> should be restored to freedom under the supervision of the praetors Gaius Licinius and Gnaeus Sicinius, and should be given land across the Po by the consul Gaius Popilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Many thousand persons were restored to freedom by this resolution of the senate, and after they had been led across the Po, land was allotted to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marcus Popilius twice stood trial before Gaius Licinius in accordance with the Marcian decree;<note>Cf. above, xxi. 8. Normal procedure required three days in court for each trial.</note> on the third occasion the praetor, overcome by the influence of the absent consul and the entreaties of the house of Popilius, ordered the defendant to appear on the fifteenth of March, the day on which the new magistrates were to enter upon their offices, so that Licinius himself, <pb id="p.355"/>since he would be a private citizen, need not pass<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> judgment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus the decree about the Ligurians was evaded by trickery.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Carthaginian ambassadors were at Rome at that time, and also Gulussa, the son of Masinissa. Between these, great disputes arose before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Carthaginians complained that, besides the land about which envoys from Rome had previously been sent<note>On the disputes between Masinissa and the Carthaginians, perhaps including this one, cf. XL. xvii. 1-6, xxxiv. 14, Polybius XXXI. 21, and Appian, <hi rend="italics">Punic Wars,</hi> VIII. x. Polybius (<hi rend="italics">loc. cit.</hi>) says of previous disputes between these parties that <quote>the Carthaginians always came off second best at Rome, not because they had no right on their side, but because the judges were convinced that it was in their own interest to decide against them</quote> (tr. Paton, L.C.L.).</note> to review the situation on the ground, more than seventy towns and forts in Carthaginian territory had been siezed by force of arms during the past two years by Masinissa; this was a simple matter for him, since he was wholly reckless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Carthaginians, enmeshed in the treaty, had kept quiet, said the envoys, for they were forbidden to campaign beyond their own boundaries;<note>Cf. XXX. xxxvii. 4, Polybius XV. 18. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for, even though they knew that if they were to drive out the Numidians, they would be fighting within their boundaries, they were discouraged by that quite definite article of the treaty by which they were expressly forbidden to wage war against allies of the Roman people.<note>One of the conditions of peace which had been imposed upon the Carthaginians by Scipio had been, according to Appian, <hi rend="italics">Punic Wars,</hi> VIII. 54, <foreign lang="greek">mh/te Massana/ssh| mh/te a)/llw| (Pwmai/wn fi/lw| polemei=n,</foreign> cf. below, xxv. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But now the Carthaginians could no longer endure Masinissa's arrogance, cruelty and greed. They, the envoys, had been sent to beg the senate to grant one of the following three requests: either that the Romans should impartially draw the line between the possessions of their royal ally and those of the Carthaginian people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> or that they should permit the Carthaginians to protect themselves by a <pb id="p.357"/>righteous and proper war against unjust invasion; or,<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> as a last resort, if favouritism outweighed truth with the Romans, that they should decide once and for all what gift of the possessions of others they wished to be given to Masinissa; the Romans would surely be more moderate in their giving, and the Carthaginians would know what they had given;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for the Numidian himself would set no limit except in accordance with his own pleasure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If they were granted none of these requests, and some fault had been incurred by them since the peace granted them by Publius Scipio, let the Romans rather inflict punishment upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They preferred a safe slavery under Roman masters to a freedom exposed to the injustices of Masinissa; lastly, it was better for them to perish once than to drag out their existence at the whim of a most bitter torturer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With this speech they prostrated themselves in tears, and as they couched on the ground won as much ill-feeling against the king as pity for themselves.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate voted to ask Gulussa what he would reply to these charges, or, if he preferred to explain this first, on what business he had come to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gulussa replied that it was not easy for him to discuss matters on which he had no instructions from his father, nor had it been easy for his father to give instructions, inasmuch as the Carthaginians had not given notice as to what they intended to discuss, or even that they were going to Rome in the first place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had held a secret council of the leading men in the temple of Aesculapius<note>Aesculapius is the Graeco-Roman equivalent of the Carthaginian god Esmun; for another alleged secret conference in this temple, cf. XLI. xxii. 2.</note> for several <pb id="p.359"/>nights, about which no news had leaked out except<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> that envoys with secret instructions were being sent to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This had been the occasion of his father's sending him to Rome, in order that he might beg the senate not to believe the enemies of both peoples when they brought charges against Masinissa, whom they hated for no other reason than his unwavering loyalty toward the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After these addresses from both parties, the senate, when questioned<note>By its presiding officer, the City Praetor.</note> on the subject of the requests of the Carthaginians, ordered the following answer to be given:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was the decision of the senate that Gulussa should depart at once for Numidia and report to his father that he should send envoys as soon as possible to the senate to answer the complaints of the Carthaginians, and that he should announce this to the Carthaginians, so that they might come to argue the matter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate had done and would do whatever it could to honour Masinissa, but justice it did not hand over to favouritism.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It wished land to be in the possession of the rightful owner, and its purpose was not to set new boundaries, but to maintain the old.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After conquering the Carthaginians, the Romans had granted them both their city and their territory, not in order to rob them unjustly in peace of what they had not taken under the laws of war. With this reply the prince and the Carthaginians were dismissed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Gifts were given to both embassies according to custom<note>Cf. above, vi. 11, and the note.</note> and the other duties of hospitality were courteously observed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time there returned Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, Appius Claudius Cento and Titus Annius Luscus, the envoys sent to Macedonia to <pb id="p.361"/>demand reparations<note>A traditional phrase for the first step in breaking off relations and declaring war; for the traditional practice of early Rome of which this is a reminiscence cf. I. xxxii. 5-13; on the revised practice of the times here under discussion cf. XXXVI. iii. 7-12.</note> and denounce the treaty of<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> friendship with King Perseus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These envoys inflamed the hostility which the senate had felt of its own accord toward Perseus by telling, one after another, the things which they had seen and heard; they had seen, they said, preparations for war going forward with the utmost vigour through all Macedonian cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they had come to the court, for many days an opportunity of meeting the king was denied them; finally, when, having actually despaired of a conference, they had departed, then at last they had been recalled from their journey and brought before him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The gist of their speech had been as follows: a treaty had been made with Philip, and renewed with Perseus himself after his father's death, in which he was explicitly forbidden to lead his army beyond his own territory, and also forbidden to assail in war the allies of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next the envoys had explained in detail the whole series of ascertained facts which the Fathers had recently heard Eumenes recount in the senate. Moreover, the king had held at Samothrace for many days a secret conference with embassies from the states of Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For these violations, the envoys informed the king, the senate thought it right that reparation be made, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> that possessions which the king held contrary to the regulations of the treaty be returned to the Romans and their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The king<note>The following description of Perseus' attitude does not agree with Livy's account of his diplomacy later (below, chapters xxxvi and xxxix). We may suspect that the latter comes from Polybius, and is more accurate; the account here, the substance of which appears also in Appian, <hi rend="italics">Macedonian Wars,</hi> IX. xi, may be derived from some intensely Roman writer, who wanted to justify the forcing of the war by Rome.</note> had at first replied to these statements ungraciously, being inflamed with anger, had charged the Romans with greed and arrogance, and had yelled that <pb id="p.363"/>embassies kept coming one after another to spy upon<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> his words and actions, because they thought it right that he should do and say everything at their beck and call;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> finally, after shouting a long wordy harangue, he had ordered them to return the next day, since he wished to give them a reply in writing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then the following written statement had been given them: the treaty made with Perseus' father was in no way binding on him; he had endured its renewal, not because he approved of it, but because immediately on assuming the kingship he had had to endure anything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If the Romans wished to make a new treaty with him, some agreement as to terms should first be reached; if they could bring themselves to make a treaty on terms of equality, he for his part would see what he should do and they for theirs, he supposed, would take care of the interests of their state. After delivering this message, Perseus had begun to hurry out, and the dismissal of everyone from the palace had begun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thereupon the envoys had denounced the friendship and alliance. Angered at this utterance, Perseus had stopped and in a loud voice had enjoined upon them to leave the borders of his realm within three days. Accordingly they had set out; no sign of hospitality or courtesy had been shown them during their stay or as they departed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Next the envoys of the Thessalians and Aetolians were heard. In order that the senate might know as soon as possible what military commanders the state was to use, it
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> was voted that dispatches be sent to the consuls to request that whichever of them could do so should come to Rome for the election of magistrates.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls had accomplished for the state <pb id="p.365"/>during this year nothing which is particularly worth<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> mentioning. It was considered more useful to the state that the thoroughly aroused Ligurians should be restrained and calmed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>While war with Macedonia was awaited, Issaean envoys brought suspicion also on Gentius, king of the Illyrians, both by complaining that he had ravaged their territory, and also by reporting that the Illyrian king was in harmony with the Macedonian; that they were concerting plans for war against the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that Illyrian spies, ostensibly an embassy, had been sent to Rome at Perseus' suggestion to get information of what was going forward.<note>Gentius was not in fact definitely attached to Perseus, cf. below, xxix. 11 and xxxvii. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These Illyrians were called before the senate: when they said that they had been sent by the king as envoys to clear him of any charges which might be brought by the Issaeans, they were asked why in that case they had not approached a magistrate, in order to receive lodging and official entertainment<note>Cf. XXVIII. xxxix. 19.</note> according to custom, and indeed in order that their arrival and their purpose might be known.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they hesitated in their answer, they were bidden to leave the senate-house; the senate refused to reply, as they would to envoys, to men who had not requested to be presented to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was decided to send envoys to the king to inform him of the complaints made by Rome's allies, with the message that the senate considered that he was acting unjustly in not refraining from wrong to these allies of theirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On this embassy were sent Aulus Terentius Varro, Gaius Plaetorius and Gaius Cicereius.</p> 
				<p>From Asia the envoys, who had been sent round to the several allied kings,<note>Cf. above, xix. 7-8.</note> returned and reported that <pb id="p.367"/>they had met Eumenes at Aegina, Antiochus in<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> Syria and Ptolemy at Alexandria. All had received overtures from the embassies of Perseus but remained nobly loyal and had promised to accomplish everything which the Roman people might command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The envoys had also visited the allied city-states; they had found all of them loyal except Rhodes, which was wavering and steeped in Perseus' plots. Envoys of Rhodes had come to Rome to clear the city of the charges which they knew were generally being bandied about;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> however, it was decided not to hold a meeting of the senate for them until the new consuls should have entered on their office.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate decided not to postpone the preparations for war. To Gaius Licinius the praetor was given the task of repairing and making ready fifty of the old quinqueremes which were stored in the ship-yards at Rome<note>For the reverse of this process, cf. XLV. ii. 9.</note> and might still be usable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If these were insufficient to make up the number, he was to write to his colleague Gaius Memmius in Sicily to repair and fit out the ships in Sicily, so that they could be sent as soon as possible to Brundisium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Gaius Licinius the praetor was ordered to enroll, from among Roman citizens of the class of freedmen, sailors for twenty-five ships;<note>Cf. XXIV. xi, XXXII. xxiii. 9, XXXVI. ii. 15, XL. xviii. 7.</note> Gnaeus Sicinius was to order an equal number for twenty-five ships from the allies; the same praetor was to raise eight thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry<note>Smaller numbers for the force which Sicinius actually had in Macedonia are given below, xxxvi. 8 (cf. Zonaras IX. 22).</note> from the allies of the Latin <pb id="p.369"/>Name.<note>The phrase <hi rend="italics">socii Latini nominis</hi> has previously been translated <quote>Latin allies</quote> (Foster) and <quote>allies of the Latin confederacy</quote> (Sage). These allies were at this time a class of citizens having no political rights at Rome, but having private rights (rights of trade and marriage); they lived in selected communities all over Italy, and, in later times, also in the provinces; there was no longer any necessary connection with Latium; these allies were simply Class B citizens.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To receive this soldiery at Brundisium and<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> send it to Macedonia, Aulus Atilius Serranus, who had been praetor the preceding year, was chosen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In order that Gnaeus Sicinius the praetor should have an army ready to cross over, Gaius Licinius the praetor, on authorization of the senate, wrote to Gaius Popilius the consul to order both the second legion, which was the longest in service in the Ligurian country, and four thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry of the allies of the Latin Name to be at Brundisium on the thirteenth of February.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With this fleet and this army Gnaeus Sicinius was instructed to hold the theatre of operations in Macedonia until his successor should arrive, his term of command being prolonged for a year. All these orders voted by the senate were vigorously carried out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thirty-eight quinqueremes were launched from the ship-yards; Lucius Porcius Licinus was put in command to take them to Brundisium; twelve were sent from Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To purchase grain in Apulia and Calabria for the fleet and army three commissioners were sent, Sextus Digitius, Titus Juventius, and Marcus Caecilius. Gnaeus Sicinius the praetor set out from Rome in military dress, and on arriving in Brundisium found everything in readiness.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Almost at the end of the year Gaius Popilius the consul returned to Rome, somewhat later than the senate had advised, for they had thought it to the interest of the state, since so great a war was impending, that magistrates be elected as early as <pb id="p.371"/>possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so it was in no favourable mood that<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> the Fathers listened to the consul as in the temple of Bellona he discussed his accomplishments among the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were frequent outcries and questions as to why he had not restored to freedom the Ligurians crushed by his brother's injustice.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The consular elections were held on the day for which they had been proclaimed, the eighteenth of February.<note>On the date of the elections, cf. XXXVIII. xlii. 2, XL. lix. 5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls elected were Publius Licinius Crassus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. On the following day there were elected as praetors Gaius Sulpicius Galba, Lucius Furius Philus, Lucius Canuleius Dives, Gaius Lucretius Gallus, Gaius Caninius Rebilus and Lucius Villius Annalis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To these praetors there were assigned as provinces two judgeships in Rome, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia, so that for one there was an unassigned position, at the disposal of the senate.<note>For such roving commissions, cf. XXXV. xx. 7 (consul), XXXV. xli. 6 (praetor in command of the fleet, area of operations discretionary) XXVII. xxii. 3 and XLIV. xvii. 10.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls-elect were instructed by the senate that, on the day of their entering upon their office, they were to pray, after due sacrifice of full-grown victims, that, in the war which the Roman people were intending to wage, the outcome might be favourable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the same day the senate decreed that Gaius Popilius the consul should vow that games for ten days be dedicated to Jupiter, Greatest and Best, and that gifts be given to all the banquet-tables of the gods<note>Cf. XXXVI. ii. 2.</note> if for ten years the state should remain in unchanged fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As the senate had decreed, the consul made on the Capitol the vow that games be held and gifts <pb id="p.373"/>given from as large an appropriation as the senate,<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> with a quorum of one hundred and fifty, might decree. Lepidus the chief pontifex dictated the words as this vow was taken.</p> 
				<p>In this year there died of the priests of the state Lucius Aemilius Papus, of the Board of Ten for Ritual, and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus the pontifex, who had been censor the year before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He died a disgraceful<note>Burial was refused those who hanged themselves, according to a law which dates from a very early period (Servius on <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi> XII. 603).</note> death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Of his two sons, who were at that time serving in the army in Illyricum, it was reported that one had been killed and one was stricken with a severe and dangerous disease. Grief and fear together overwhelmed the father's mind; slaves who entered his bedroom in the morning found him hanging in a noose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was thought that after his censorship he was not wholly himself; a common rumour had it that the wrath of Lacinian Juno over the robbing of her temple<note>Cf. above, iii.</note> had unbalanced his mind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In Aemilius' place on the Board of Ten Marcus Valerius Messalla was substituted; in Fulvius' place as pontifex Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, a man quite young for a priesthood, was chosen.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the consulship of Publius Licinius and<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> Gaius Cassius, not only the city of Rome and the land of Italy, but also all kings and states both in Europe and in Asia, had turned their minds to concern over the war between Macedonia and Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Eumenes was urged on by his former enmity and quite as much by his fresh anger, because through the king's crime he had been almost slaughtered like a beast for sacrifice at Delphi.<note>Cf. above, xvi. and the note. For the plot against Eumenes as an occasion of the war cf. Polybius XXII. 18 and XXVII. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Prusias, the king of Bithynia, <pb id="p.375"/>had determined to refrain from arms and await the<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> outcome; for, he thought, the Romans for their part could not think it right that he should take up arms against his wife's brother, and, as for Perseus, if he conquered, reconciliation might be effected with him through his sister.<note>Cf. above, xii. 3, and Appian, <hi rend="italics">Mithridatic Wars,</hi> XII. i. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Ariarathes, the king of Cappadocia, apart from the fact that he had promised aid directly to the Romans, was from the time of his alliance in marriage with Eumenes in harmony with the latter in all plans for peace or war.<note>Cf. XXXVIII. xxxix. 6; on Ariarathes' pro-Romanism, above, xix. 3-6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Antiochus was indeed threatening the kingdom of Egypt, in scorn of the youth of the king and the sluggishness of his guardians;<note>Cf. Polybius XXVII. 19; Ptolemy VI Philometor was about 16 at this time, having succeeded to the throne in <date value="-181">181 B.C.</date> His tutors were Eulaeus and Lenaeus; the former is accused of cowardice by Polybius XXVIII. 21.</note> and he expected, by raising disputes about Hollow Syria,<note>The district of Damascus, and extending to the north, between Lebanon and Antilebanon; it had first belonged to Seleucus, was conquered by Ptolemy Philadelphus in 280 and held by Egypt till 218; it was retaken by Antiochus the Great in 201-198, and given by him as dowry for his daughter Cleopatra, mother of the reigning Ptolemy.</note> to have a cause for war and to wage it without obstacle while the Romans were busied with the Macedonian war;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> however, for this war he had zealously promised everything to the senate through his envoys, and personally to the envoys of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ptolemy because of his age was at that time still under the control of others; his guardians were both preparing war against Antiochus, in order to clear their title to Hollow Syria, and were promising the Romans everything for the war with Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Masinissa was helping the Romans with grain and was preparing to send to the war troops with elephants under command of his son Misagenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> However, he had plans ready for any outcome, and arranged as follows: if victory should be on the side of the Romans, <pb id="p.377"/>then his own situation would remain unchanged,<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> nor should he make any move to expand, for the Romans would not permit violence to be used against the Carthaginians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> if the powers of Rome, which then were sheltering the Carthaginians, should be broken, all Africa<note>As used here, the name covers only the north-western part of the continent.</note> would be his.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Gentius, king of the Illyrians, did not so much determine which side he would favour, as succeed in becoming an object of suspicion to the Romans, and seemed to be about to join the one or the other through impulse more than reasoning.<note>Cf. above, xxvi. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Thracian Cotys,<note>Polybius XXVII. 12 speaks highly of Cotys' ability; he was counter-balanced by other Thracians, cf. above, xix. 7; for his help to Perseus, cf. below, li. 10.</note> king of the Odrysae, secretly sided with Macedonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these were the feelings of the kings about the war, among the free groups and peoples, the commons everywhere were almost all, as usual, for the worse side, being inclined toward the king and the Macedonians; among the leading men one might notice conflicting interests.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some were so enraptured with the Romans as to undermine their own influence by their unrestrained partizanship;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> a few of them were attracted by the justice of Roman rule, most were moved by the thought that if they displayed some especial service for the Romans they would become powerful in their own states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Another group were toadies to the king; some, because of debt and despair of their own fortunes if no change should occur, were driven headlong to the overturning of everything. Some were upset by their own windy instability of character, since the breeze of popular favour turned in Perseus' direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A third group, which was also the worthiest <pb id="p.379"/>and wisest,<note>Livy's apparent lack of pro-Roman bias at this point probably results from his having taken this material from Polybius, who was active in one of the groups which believed in the balance of power.</note> if merely a choice of a dominating<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> superior were offered them, preferred to be under the Romans rather than under the king;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but if they had a free choice of destiny in this respect, they wished neither side to become the more powerful through the downfall of the other, but rather that, the strength of both sides being unexhausted, peace on terms of equality should continue; thus the situation of the free states with respect to the two powers would be most advantageous, since one power would always protect the weak against wrongdoing by the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With these sentiments they watched silently from a safe position the contests of the partisans of either side.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In accordance with a decree of the senate, the consuls, on the day of their inauguration, offered sacrifices of full-grown victims at all the temples in which a banquet for the god is usually spread during the greater part of the year; thereupon, feeling assured that their prayers were approved by the immortal gods, they reported to the senate that due sacrifice and prayer for the war had been made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The diviners<note>These diviners (the Latin term <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> has previously been used) observed all manner of signs, especially the entrails of sacrificial animals; their art was originally Etruscan (cf. V. xv. 1).</note> gave the following report: If any new enterprise should be begun, it should be speeded on; victory, triumph, and enlargement of the realm were forecast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Fathers, with the wish that it might be well and of good omen and fortune for the Roman people, instructed the consuls to present on the first possible day to the people, assembled in their <pb id="p.381"/>Hundreds,<note>The founding of the <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata</hi> was ascribed to Servius Tullius in <date value="-578">578 B.C.</date> It was the second in age of the Roman assemblies; by this time, it was the older and more dignified of the assemblies actually held, having elective and judicial functions as well as the legislative ones which it shared with the <hi rend="italics">comitia tributa.</hi></note> the resolution that, whereas Perseus, son of<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> Philip, King of Macedonia, contrary to the treaty made with his father Philip and renewed with himself after the death of his father, had invaded allies of the Roman people, had devastated their land and seized their cities, and whereas he had entered on plans for preparing war against the Roman people, and had assembled arms, soldiers and fleet for the said purpose, resolved that, unless he offered satisfaction in these matters, war against him be undertaken.<note>A much-mutilated inscription (Dittenberger, <hi rend="italics">Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum,</hi> 3rd ed. No. 643) has been discovered, containing a letter of the senate to the Delphic Amphictyony, which has been restored as setting forth the grievances of the Romans against Philip as related here and below by Livy, as well as by other authors.</note> This resolution was passed by the people.</p>

The special arrangement was made for the district of Macedonia that, although to the legions of the other consul five thousand two hundred infantry per legion were allotted in accordance with old custom, for Macedonia six thousand infantry<note>Cf. XLIII. xii. 3-4 and XLIV. xxi. 8 for the extra strength of these legions; in XXXV. ii. 4, a strength of 6200 is mentioned; however, Polybius (III. cvii. 11 and VI. xx. 8) states that the normal strength of the legion was about 4000 infantry, and emergency strength, about 5000, which suggests that Livy may be using inflated figures here.</note> were ordered to be enrolled and for both forces three hundred cavalry in each legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Also the number for the force of allies was <pb id="p.383"/>increased for the one consul; he was to take over to<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> Macedonia sixteen thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry besides the six hundred cavalry under the command of Gnaeus Sicinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For Italy twelve thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry of the allies were judged sufficient. The following privilege was also granted to the Macedonian allotment, that the consul might at his discretion enroll former centurions and soldiers up to fifty years of age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In connection with the tribunes of the soldiers, an innovation was made that year because of the Macedonian war, a change brought before the commons by the consuls in accordance with a resolution of the senate, namely, that tribunes of the soldiers should not be chosen by vote for this year but that the consuls and praetors
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> should exercise their judgment and choice in appointing them.<note>The election of tribunes of the soldiers had been the rule since <date value="-309">309 B.C.</date> (<hi rend="italics">supra</hi> IX. xxx. 3). Later half were elected, half appointed (XLIII. xii. 7 and XLIV. xxi. 2-3).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Commands were divided among the praetors as follows: it was decided that the praetor whose lot it was to go where the senate determined should go to the fleet at Brundisium and there inspect the sailors; after discharging any who were unfit, he was to enroll replacements from among freedmen, and see to it that two-thirds should be Roman citizens and one-third allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was voted to instruct the praetors who should draw Sicily and Sardinia, in order that provisions from these provinces might be conveyed to the fleet and legions, that they should impose a second tithe<note>Cf. XXXVII. 1. 9.</note> on the Sicilians and Sardinians, this grain to be transported to the army in Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Sicily was drawn by Gaius Caninius Rebilus, Sardinia by Lucius Furius Philus, Spain by Lucius Canuleius, the jurisdiction over citizens by Gaius Sulpicius Galba, that over aliens by Lucius Villius Annalis; <pb id="p.385"/>the lot placed Gaius Lucretius Gallus at the senate's<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> disposal.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Between the consuls there was an outburst of sarcasm rather than a great dispute concerning the assignment of their provinces. Cassius said he would choose Macedonia without the lot and that his colleague could not, without perjury, cast lots with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For when Licinius had been praetor,<note>Cf. XLI. xv. 10.</note> that he might not have to go to his province, he had sworn before an assembly that he had sacrifices in a fixed place and on fixed days which could not be duly performed in his absence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> sacrifices could no more be duly performed in the absence of a consul than in the absence of a praetor, unless the senate thought it best to take notice of Publius Licinius' wishes as consul, rather than of the oath he had taken as praetor; however, said Cassius, he would submit himself to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the matter was laid before the Fathers, inasmuch as they thought it would be arrogant on their part to withhold a province from the man from whom the Roman people had not withheld the consulship,<note>For a somewhat similar verdict, cf. XXXII. vii. 11.</note> they ordered the consuls to cast lots.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Macedonia fell to Publius Licinius, Italy to Gaius Cassius. Next the legions were allotted; the first and third were to cross to Macedonia, the second and fourth to remain in Italy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The consuls were conducting the levy with by far more painstaking care than usual. Licinius was also enrolling the veteran soldiers and centurions; likewise many enlisted voluntarily, because they saw that those who had served in the former Macedonian campaign or against Antiochus in Asia had become <pb id="p.387"/>rich.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the military tribunes who were<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> appointing centurions were assigning men as they came,<note>Former rank was not renewed at re-enlistment; however, it was no doubt taken into account by enlisting officers; this incident may have been a turning-point, as in later times rank was regularly held over on re-enlistment.</note> twenty-three veterans who had held the rank of chief centurion<note>The forward, or ranking, centurion of the first maniple of the reserve formation (<hi rend="italics">triarii</hi>) was so called; it is not certain whether the rear centurion of this maniple (<hi rend="italics">primus pilus posterior</hi>) would also be included; <hi rend="italics">duxerant</hi> suggests his exclusion. Cf. Polybius VI. 24.</note> on being named appealed to the tribunes of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Two of these magistrates, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and Marcus Claudius Marcellus, referred the matter back to the consuls; for, they said, the investigation belonged to those to whom the levy and the war had been committed; the other tribunes said they would investigate the matter of the appeal, and if wrong was being done, they would come to the aid of their fellow-citizens.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The investigation took place at the benches of the tribunes; thither came Marcus Popilius, the ex-consul, as counsel for the centurions, the centurions themselves, and the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the request of the consul that this investigation take place before an assembly, the people were summoned to an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On behalf of the centurions Marcus Popilius, who had been consul two years before, addressed the people as follows: These soldierly men had ended their regular military service and had also ended their physical vigour because of both age and unremitting labour; however, they offered no objection to contributing their services to the state. This one request they did make, that they should not be assigned ranks lower than those they had held during their regular service.<note>In the army contemplated there were not, however, enough such positions to go around.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Publius <pb id="p.389"/>Licinius the consul ordered to be read the decrees<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> of the senate, first that in which the senate authorized the war against Perseus, then that in which it resolved that as many former centurions as possible be enrolled for this war, and no exemption from service be granted to anyone under fifty-one years of age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then he made the request that, in a new war, at so little a distance from Italy, against a very powerful king, the people should not hinder the military tribunes who were holding the levy or prevent the consul from assigning such rank to each man as was to the best interests of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If there were any doubtful point in this matter, let them refer it back to the senate.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the consul had said what he wished, Spurius Ligustinus, one of the men who had appealed to the tribunes of the people, asked of the consul and the tribunes that he be permitted to address a few words to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With everyone's permission he is said to have spoken as follows:</p> 
				<p>"I, Spurius Ligustinus of the tribe of Crustumina,<note>The district of this tribe lay just north of Rome; it was perhaps a new tribe in <date value="-495">495 B.C.</date>, cf. II. xxi. 7.</note> come of Sabine stock, fellow-citizens. My father left me an acre<note>This was less than the standard minimum of two <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> for landed property; Ligustinus was therefore technically a <hi rend="italics">proletarius,</hi> and no doubt needed his military career as a means of livelihood.</note> of land and a little hut, in which I was born and brought up, and to this day I live there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When I first came of age, my father gave me as wife his brother's daughter,<note>Marriage of first cousins was at times not recognized as legal at Rome; it is not clear whether this was a rustic irregularity, or an indication of the lapse of any such impediment at this time. Cf. Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Philippics,</hi> II. 99 (Antony made such a marriage), Tacitus, <hi rend="italics">Annals,</hi> XII. 6 (regarded as unprecedented), Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Roman Questions,</hi> 6 (a recent innovation).</note> who brought with her nothing but her free birth and her chastity, and <pb id="p.391"/>with these a fertility which would be enough even<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> for a wealthy home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> We have six sons, and two daughters, both of whom are now married. Four of our sons have assumed the toga of manhood,<note>That is, were over sixteen or seventeen; the man's toga, except for senators, was plain white; the boy's had a purple border-stripe.</note> two wear the boys' stripe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I became a soldier in the consulship of Publius Sulpicius and Gaius Aurelius.<note><date value="-200">200 B.C.</date>, cf. XXXI. v. 1.</note> In the army which was taken over to Macedonia I served two years as a private soldier against King Philip; in the third year, for my bravery, Titus Quinctius Flamininus made me centurion of the tenth maniple of the advance formation.<note>The advance formation (<hi rend="italics">hastati</hi>) was the lowest in rank of the three main subdivisions of the legion, and the tenth maniple the lowest in rank in the formation; from his subsequent status, it seems likely that Ligustinus was given the forward centurionship (<hi rend="italics">prior</hi>), not the very lowest in the legion, the rear (<hi rend="italics">posterior</hi>). For the origin of these subdivisions of the legion, cf. VIII. viii. 5-13; Polybius VI. 21. 6-23.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After the defeat of Philip and the Macedonians, when we had been brought back to Italy and discharged, immediately I set out for Spain as a volunteer soldier with Marcus Porcius the consul.<note><date value="-195">195 B.C.</date>, cf. XXXIII. xlii. 7 and xliii. The consul was the famous Cato the Censor. Ligustinus had returned to Italy before his commander Flamininus, who returned at the same time that Cato came back from Spain.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No one, of all the generals now living, was a keener observer and judge of bravery, as those know who have had experience of him and other leaders, too, through long service. This general judged me worthy to be assigned as centurion of the forward first century of the advance formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For the third time I enlisted, again voluntarily, in the army which was sent against the Aetolians and King Antiochus.<note><date value="-191">191 B.C.</date>, cf. XXXVI. i. ff.</note> By Manius Acilius I was given the rank of centurion of the forward first century of the main formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When King Antiochus had been driven out and the Aetolians beaten, we were brought back to Italy; and twice <pb id="p.393"/>after that I was in campaigns where the legions<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> served for a year. Then I campaigned twice in Spain, once when Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was praetor,<note><date value="-181">181 B.C.</date>, cf. XL. i. 1, xvi. 7-10, xxx &mdash;xxxiii, xxxvi. 10-11 and xxxix &mdash;xl.</note> and again when Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus held
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that office.<note><date value="-180">180 B.C.</date>, cf. XL. xxxv. 2, xl. 14.</note> I was brought home by Flaccus along with the others whom he brought with him from the province for his triumph because of their bravery;<note>Cf. XL. xliii. 4-7.</note> I went back to the province because Tiberius Gracchus
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> asked me. Four times within a few years I held the rank of chief centurion; thirty-four times I was rewarded for bravery by my generals; I have received six civic crowns.<note>For saving the life of a Roman citizen.</note> I have done twenty-two years of service in the army, and I am over fifty
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> years old. But if all my years of service had not been completed and my age did not yet give me exemption, still, since I could give you four soldiers in my place, Publius Licinius, it would be fair to
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> discharge me. But I should like you to accept these things that I have said on my side of the case; for my part, as long as anyone who is enrolling armies considers me fit for service, I will never
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> beg off. Of what rank the military tribunes think me worthy is for them to decide; I shall see to it that no one in the army surpasses me in bravery; and that I have always done so, both my generals and those who have served with me
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> are witnesses. It is fair for you too, fellow-soldiers, even though you are within your rights in this appeal, since, when you were young you never did anything against the authority of the magistrates and the senate, now also <pb id="p.395"/>to submit to the consuls and the senate, and to<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> consider every place honourable in which you will be defending the state."</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had said this, Publius Licinius the consul praised him at some length and took him from the assembly to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There also thanks were expressed to him by authorization of the senate, and the military tribunes gave him for his bravery a chief centurionship in the first legion. The other centurions gave up their appeal and obediently responded to the levy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In order that the magistrates might set out sooner for their provinces, the Latin Festival was held on the first of June;<note>But according to the Julian calendar, this would have been some date in April; the calendar divergence at this period can be checked by eclipses of the moon in <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. iv. 4) and in 168 (XLIV. xxxvii. 8).</note> and after this ceremony had been completed the praetor Gaius Lucretius, having sent ahead everything needed for the fleet, set out for Brundisium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Besides those armies which the consuls were raising, the task was given the praetor Gaius Sulpicius Galba of enrolling four city legions of the regular number of infantry and cavalry, and of choosing for them from the senate four military tribunes as commanders;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he was to order from the allies of the Latin Name fifteen thousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry, this force to assemble at a place which the senate should determine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the request of the consul Publius Licinius, to his army of citizens and allies there were added auxiliary troops, two thousand Ligurians, archers from Crete &mdash; the number which the Cretans sent on request is not certain &mdash;and also Numidian cavalry and elephants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <pb id="p.397"/>For this purpose there were sent as envoys to<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> Masinissa and the Carthaginians Lucius Postumius Albinus, Quintus Terentius Culleo and Gaius Aburius. It was also decided that three envoys should go to Crete, Aulus Postumius Albinus, Gaius Decimius and Aulus Licinius Nerva.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same time envoys from King Perseus arrived. It was decided not to admit them to the city, since the senate had decreed and the people had ordered war with their king and the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On being presented before the senate in the temple of Bellona they spoke as follows: King Perseus wondered why armies had been carried across to Macedonia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> if he might persuade the senate to recall them, the king would make amends at the discretion of the senate for any wrongs done to their allies, of which they might complain. Spurius Carvilius, who had been sent back from Greece by Gnaeus Sicinius for this very purpose, was in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had complained of Perrhaebia's having been stormed by force of arms,<note>But below, ch. liii. 8, Perseus takes Perrhaebia all over again. Livy's account here of the king's actions shows that the tale of Perseus' belligerence, as previously told, is a Roman invention to justify the forcing of the <quote>irrepressible conflict</quote> by Rome.</note> of the capture of several Thessalian cities,<note>In XLI. xxii. 6 and xxiii. 14 only a peaceful tour of Thessaly is mentioned; by comparing below, ch. xlii. 1 and lxvii. 9-11, we may gather that at least three Thessalian cities struck up an alliance with Perseus as the result of this visitation; but <quote>capture</quote> is a Roman exaggeration.</note> and of other things which the king was either doing or about to do, the envoys were ordered to make a reply thereto.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After they hesitated, saying that they had no further instructions, they were ordered to report to the king that the consul Publius Licinius would shortly be in Macedonia with an army; let the king, if giving satisfaction was his purpose, send envoys to <hi rend="italics">him.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.399"/>There was no further reason, the senate declared,<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> for his sending envoys to Rome; for none of them would be permitted to pass through Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After they were thus dismissed, instructions were given to Publius Licinius the consul to order them to depart from Italy within eleven days, and that he should send Spurius Carvilius to guard them until they boarded ship.<note>Livy repeats this account below ch. xlviii. 3, there following Polybius. It should be noted that the events next related actually precede those which Livy has been describing. Appian IX. xi. 5-9 mentions two embassies, the second of which is, as here, sent out of Italy. Both Appian and Polybius (XXVII. 6) say that all Macedonians were ordered to leave Italy, but on thirty days' notice, which was also given the ambassadors (cf. Livy, below).</note> These things took place at Rome before the consuls took the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By this time<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> Gnaeus Sicinius, who before giving up his office had been sent ahead to Brundisium to the fleet and army, had transported to Epirus five thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry<note>The number is smaller than that given above in xxvii. 3, and perhaps derives from Polybius.</note> and had encamped near the Place of the Nymphs<note>Strabo VII. v. 8, describes this as <quote>a rock that gives forth fire, and beneath it flow springs of warm water and asphalt &mdash; probably because the clods of asphalt in the earth are burned by the fire. And nearby, on a hill, is a mine of asphalt; and the part that is trenched is filled up again in the course of time, since, as Poseidonius says, the earth that is poured into the trenches changes to asphalt.</quote> (tr. H. L. Jones, L.C.L.) Nymphs dancing about the fire appeared on coins of Apollonia. A convent preserved the religious association in recent times. The asphalt deposits are still worked, and leakage of gas sometimes supplies the fire.</note> in the territory of
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Apollonia. Thence he sent tribunes with two thousand soldiers to hold forts of the Dassaretii and of the Illyrians, since these people themselves requested garrisons, in order that they might be better protected against attack by their neighbours the Macedonians.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days later, Quintus Marcius, Aulus Atilius, Publius and Servius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Decimius, who had been sent as envoys to Greece, brought a thousand infantry with them to Corcyra; there they divided among themselves both the districts they were to approach, <pb id="p.401"/>and the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Decimius was sent to<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> Gentius, king of the Illyrians; if he saw that the king had any regard for friendship with the Roman people, he was ordered to try also to induce him to become an ally in the war.<note>On Gentius' state of mind, cf. above ch. xxix. 11, contradicting ch. xxvi. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Lentuli were sent to Cephallania, so that they might cross to the Peloponnese and before winter make the circuit of the coast of the westward sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To Marcius and Atilius, the task of making the circuit of Epirus, Aetolia and Thessaly was assigned; after that, they were ordered to investigate Boeotia and Euboea, and then to cross to the Peloponnese; there they agreed to meet the Lentuli.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Before they left Corcyra, a letter from Perseus was brought them, in which he asked what reason the Romans had for either sending troops over to Greece or garrisoning cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was decided not to answer him in writing, but to say to the king's messenger, who had brought the letter, that the Romans were acting for the protection of the cities themselves. As the Lentuli went about the towns of the Peloponnese, exhorting all cities indiscriminately
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> to aid the Romans against Perseus with the same good will and loyalty with which they had assisted them first in the war against Philip, then in that against Antiochus, they aroused an unfriendly murmur in the assemblies, because the Achaeans were angered that they, who had
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> offered every assistance to the Romans from the first beginnings of war against Macedonia,<note>Not quite true; in the First Macedonian War, the Achaeans opposed the Romans, cf. XXVII. xxxii, XXIX. xii. 14; they joined the Romans early in the Second Macedonian War, XXXII. xxiii. 1-3. On the Eleans, cf. XXXVI. xxxv. 7.</note> should be placed on a level with the peoples of Messene and Elis, who in <pb id="p.403"/>the war with Philip the Macedonian had been enemies<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> of the Romans and later had borne arms for Antiochus against the Roman people, and, having been recently assigned to the Achaean League, were complaining that they were being handed
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> over as spoils of war to the victorious Achaeans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcius and Atilius went up to Gitana, a town of Epirus, ten miles from the sea, called a conference of Epirotes, and were heard with great and universal approval;<note>The leaders of Epirus belonged to the <quote>wisest</quote> class who favoured a balance of power, and neutrality, as nearly as might be inoffensive to Rome, in the war. The story of how this policy was disturbed by intrigues of Charops, a young man on the make, is told by Polybius (XXVII. 15) but not by Livy.</note> and they sent four hundred native young men to the Orestans<note>A tribe on the border of Macedonia and Epirus; they were made independent of Macedonia in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date>, cf. XXXIII. xxxiv. 6.</note> to be a guard for those who had been freed from the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thence the Romans proceeded to Aetolia, and, after a stay of a few days there, while a general was being elected in place of the one who had died, upon the election of Lyciscus,<note>Polybius XXXII. 4, does not give this leader a good character; cf. Livy XLV. xxviii. 7.</note> who, it was quite certain, favoured the Roman side, the envoys crossed to Thessaly. There Acarnanian envoys and Boeotian exiles came to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Acarnanians were ordered to report that an opportunity had presented itself to them of making amends for the acts of hostility done by them against the Roman people because they had been deceived by the kings' promises, first in the war with Philip, then in that with Antiochus.<note>Cf. XXXI. xiv. 9, XXXIII. xvi. 3-4, XXXVI. xi. 8 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If, when they had ill deserved it, they had experienced the mercy of the Roman people, let them by deserving well experience the Romans' generosity. The Boeotians were reproached <pb id="p.405"/>for having entered into an alliance with Perseus.<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they placed the blame on Ismenias, the leader of the opposite faction, and said that certain cities had been drawn into the affair against their will, Marcius replied that this was about to be made clear; for they were about to give the individual cities an opportunity of providing for their own welfare.<note>Cf. below ch. xliii. 7 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A council of the Thessalians was held at Larisa.<note>This Thessalian League had been set up under Roman auspices, cf. XXXIII. xxxiv. 7 and XXXIV. li. 6.</note> Both parties found there a pleasant opportunity to express their thanks, the Thessalians for the Romans' gift to them of freedom, and the Roman envoys for the vigorous help from the Thessalian confederacy, first in the war with Philip and again later in that with Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By this mutual recital of benefits the minds of the gathering were fired to vote everything which the Romans wished.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Following this council, envoys came from King Perseus, relying especially on the personal guest-friendship which existed between his father and the father of Marcius. Beginning with a mention of this relationship, the envoys asked that he give the king the opportunity of coming to confer with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcius said both that he had been told by his father that a relationship of amity and hospitality had existed with Philip, and also that he had been by no means forgetful of this relationship when he undertook this embassy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As for a conference, if he were in sufficiently good health he would not think of deferring it; as it was, they would come, as soon as he was able, to the Peneus river, at the crossing between Homolium and Dium,<note>That is, at the northern end of the Vale of Tempe.</note> after sending ahead messengers to inform the king.</p> <pb id="p.407"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And for the time being Perseus retired<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> from Dium to the interior of his kingdom, a faint breath of hope presenting itself, because Marcius had said he had undertaken the embassy on Perseus' account; a few days later they met at the spot agreed upon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The royal retinue was large, a crowd, both of friends and attendants, thronging about him. With no less a train came the envoys, for many escorted them from Larisa, besides the embassies of certain cities which had assembled at Larisa and wanted to report home facts which they had heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was a desire, natural to mankind, to see the meeting of a famous king and the envoys of the people foremost in the whole world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they stood in sight of each other, with the river between, there was a brief delay for exchange of messages, as to which party should cross over. The one group felt that some consideration was due to the dignity of the king, the other group, to the reputation of the Roman people, especially since Perseus had sought the conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A jest from Marcius also influenced the undecided: <quote>Let the younger,</quote> said he, <quote>cross over to his elders, and</quote> &mdash;for his own personal<note>The <hi rend="italics">cognomen</hi> was sometimes a personal name, or accepted nickname, sometimes an inherited name indicating a branch of the clan or <hi rend="italics">gens;</hi> in this case, the name dated back at least to Marcius' grandfather, who triumphed in <date value="-281">281 B.C.</date> Most Marcii had Rex as surname.</note> name was Philip &mdash;<quote>the son to his father.</quote> This solution easily recommended itself to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then another problem arose, as to how large an escort should cross with him. The king thought it proper to cross with his entire suite; the envoys bade him either to come with three attendants, or, if he should bring over so large a train, to give hostages that there would be no treachery during <pb id="p.409"/>the conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He gave as hostages Hippias and<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> Pantauchus, his leading friends, whom he had also sent as envoys. However, hostages were not desired so much as a pledge of good faith, as to show the allies that the king was meeting with the envoys on no terms of equality.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The greetings were not like those of enemies, but welcoming and kindly, and when seats had been placed, they sat down.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For with what, if I should be a defendant to-day under your laws, could either the informer at Brundisium or Eumenes charge me, so that they might seem truly to accuse me rather than to revile me?

Nor could I find anyone superior as a tool in crime to Rammius, whom I had never seen previously nor was to see afterwards!
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even for the Thebans, who, it is known, perished by shipwreck, and for the murder of Arthetaurus I must give an accounting! In this latter case, however, no charge is brought against me except that his assassins went into exile in my kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The unfairness of this situation I shall not protest, on condition that you too agree that whenever exiles betake themselves to Italy or Rome you will confess <pb id="p.415"/>that you were sponsors of the crimes for which they<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> have been condemned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If both you and all other peoples will protest against this, I too shall be among the others. And, heavens, what use is there for exile to be allowed to anyone, if there is to be nowhere room for the fugitive?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> However, as soon as I had learned, on advices from you, that these men were in Macedonia, I had them searched out, ordered them to depart from my kingdom, and banished them forever from my territory. And these charges have been made against me as if I were a prisoner at the bar; the other charges are made as against a king, and are such as to involve interpretation of the treaty between you and me.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For if it is written in the treaty that I may not be permitted to protect myself and my kingdom, even if someone attacks me, then I must confess that, inasmuch as I have defended myself with arms against Abrupolis, an ally of the Roman people, the treaty has been broken. But if, on the other hand, it is both permitted by the treaty and is arranged by the law of nations that arms may be beaten back by arms, what, pray, was it proper for me to do when Abrupolis devastated the confines of my kingdom even to Amphipolis, and carried off many free persons, a great abundance of slaves, and many thousand cattle?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Should I have kept quiet and suffered, until he came armed to Pella and into my palace?

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Moreover, if it were proper for me to give an accounting, I could not seem, I will not say to you and your allies, but even to those who do not approve harsh and unjust exercise of authority even over slaves, to have exceeded justice and virtue in punishing them; inasmuch as they killed Euphranor, the governor placed over them by me, in such fashion that death would have been the lightest of vengeance for him.</p>

Cf. above, n. 2, p. 397.</note> by a way near which is Delphi, I went up to Delphi to offer sacrifice in order to pay vows long overdue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And to this charge &mdash;that the accusation may be greater &mdash;is added the further charge that I went with an army; as if indeed it was in order to seize cities, as I now am complaining of your doing, and to place garrisons in the citadels.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But Eumenes had not as yet come to Rome as accuser, in order by slandering and distorting everything to arouse general suspicion and hatred and to try to persuade you that it is impossible for Greece to be free and to enjoy your bounty as long as the kingdom of Macedonia is intact.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This argument will be brought around full circle; soon there will be one to charge that Antiochus was to no avail driven beyond the range of Taurus; a far worse tyrant over Asia than Antiochus had been exists in Eumenes; your allies cannot take their ease as long as the palace of Pergamum stands; that looms like a citadel over the heads of neighbouring states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I am aware, Quintus Marcius and Aulus Atilius, that these charges which have either been made by you or answered by me are such as the ears and minds of the hearers are, and that it does not so much matter what I have done or with what intent as how you will receive the action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I am confident that I have done no wrong knowingly and that if I have done anything through an unintentional slip, I can be corrected and bettered by this rebuke.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Certainly I have done nothing irreparable, nor such that you should think it must be avenged by war and arms; or else the fame of your mercy and poise has been spread abroad among the nations all in vain, if for such causes, which are hardly worthy of complaint and protest, you rush to arms and declare war on your royal allies."</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When applause had followed this speech, <pb id="p.421"/>Marcius proposed his sending envoys to Rome;<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> since the king believed that every recourse should be tried to the very last and no hope be overlooked, the rest of the conference was on means of safety for the envoys' journey.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although for this a request for a truce was clearly essential and Marcius was eager for it and was seeking for nothing else at the conference, he granted it grudgingly and as a great favour to the petitioner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the Romans had nothing thoroughly ready for war at this time, neither army nor leader, while Perseus, had not an idle hope of peace blinded his counsels, would have had everything ready and on hand and could have begun the war at a time most favourable to himself and inopportune for the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>From this conference the Roman envoys, relying on the truce as security, at once set out for Boeotia.<note>Cf. Polybius XXVII. 1-2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In that region there already had begun to be disturbance as certain peoples departed from association in the common council of the Boeotians, after the report had come that the envoys had answered that it would become evident which peoples for their own part disliked the forming of an alliance with the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> First envoys from Chaeronia, then from Thebes, met the Romans while still on the way, asserting that they had not been present in the council in which this alliance had been voted; the Roman envoys, giving them no answer for the time being, ordered them to follow them to Chalcis. At Thebes a great dispute arose from a different rivalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The party beaten in the election for general and the Governors of Boeotia, by way of avenging their <pb id="p.423"/>rebuff, gathered a mob and passed a vote at Thebes<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> that the Governors be not received in the cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The exiles all departed to Thespiae; from there &mdash; for they had been received without hesitation &mdash;they were recalled, by a change of sentiment, to Thebes and passed a decree that twelve men who though private citizens had held an assembly and council should be punished by exile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Next, the new general &mdash;he was Ismenias, a man of rank and power &mdash;by decree in their absence condemned these men to death. They fled to Chalcis; thence they set out to the Romans at Larisa<note>Cf. above xxxviii. 5.</note> and brought a charge of alliance with Perseus against Ismenias; from this dispute, they said, the contest had arisen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Envoys of both factions came at that time to the Romans, both the exiles and accusers of Ismenias, and Ismenias himself.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the party arrived at Chalcis, a thing very pleasing to the Romans occurred, for the chief men of the other states each by their own particular decree rejected the alliance with the king and associated themselves with the Romans; Ismenias thought it proper to put the Boeotian League in the care of the Romans.<note>As Polybius XXVII. 1. 2-3 points out, this was unacceptable to the Romans, who wanted to destroy the Boeotian League (cf. 6 below).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon a dispute arose, and save that he escaped to the headquarters<note>The exact meaning of <hi rend="italics">tribunal</hi> (usually, an official platform) here is uncertain; Polybius 1. 6 speaks of <foreign lang="greek">di/qura</foreign> (lit. double doors) translated <quote>porch</quote> by Paton, L.C.L.</note> of the Roman envoys, Ismenias lacked little of meeting his death at the hands of the exiles and their partisans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thebes itself, the capital of Boeotia, was also in a great uproar, as some urged the city toward the king, <pb id="p.425"/>others toward the Romans; and a mob from Coronea<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> and Haliartus had assembled to defend the vote of alliance with the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But due to the steadfastness of the chief men<note>According to Polybius XXVII 1. 9 Olympichus of Coronea swung over to the Roman side, and carried the assembly with him; Livy trusts the upper classes, and suspects the worst of the commons, cf. e.g. above ch. xxx. 1; the attitude is that adopted by the Romans as a principle of provincial management.</note> in demonstrating by the disasters which had befallen Philip and Antiochus how great was the might and good fortune of the Roman State, the commons were at length overcome and voted to cancel the alliance with the king, besides sending to Chalcis those who had been sponsors of sanctioning the friendly relations to make amends to the envoys, and ordering that the city be recommended to the care of the envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcius and Atilius heard the Thebans with joy and recommended both to these and severally to the various others that they send envoys to Rome to renew friendly relations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> First of all they ordered that the exiles be restored, and condemned by their own decree the sponsors of alliance with the king.<note>According to Polybius XXVII. 2. 8-9, Ismenias and Dicetas were imprisoned and committed suicide; Neon, the third pro-Macedonian leader, escaped to Macedonia.</note> Thus having obtained their fondest desire, the disruption of the Boeotian League, they set out for the Peloponnese after summoning Servius Cornelius to Chalcis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> An assembly was called for them at Argos;<note>Cf. Polybius, <hi rend="italics">loc. cit.,</hi> 11.</note> there they asked nothing of the Achaean League but the contribution of one thousand soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This garrison was sent to guard Chalcis<note>Chalcis was one of the three <quote>fetters of Greece,</quote> cf. XXXI. xxiii. 11-12, XXXII. xxxvii. 3, XXXIII. xxxi. 4 and 11, XXXV. xxxiv. 4.</note> until the Roman army could be brought over to Greece. Marcius and Atilius, having accomplished their mission in Greece, as winter came on returned to Rome.</p> <pb id="p.427"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thence an embassy had been sent during<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> this time to Asia and among the islands.<note>Polybius XXVII. 3. This is perhaps the same embassy mentioned above, ch. xix. 7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were three envoys, Tiberius Claudius, Spurius Postumius and Marcus Junius. These went about exhorting the allies to undertake war against Perseus on the side of the Romans; and the richer any given city was the more painstakingly they negotiated there, because the lesser cities would follow the leadership of the greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Rhodians were considered of the greatest importance in everything, because they could not only embrace the war, but assist in it, too, with their forces, since forty ships had been made ready, on motion of Hegesilochus; this man, who held the chief magistracy &mdash;their own title is <hi rend="italics">prytanis</hi><note>This officer seems to have been chief executive for six months, two <hi rend="italics">prytaneis</hi> being in office for the year, cf. Polybius XXVII. 7. 2 and XXIX. 10.</note> &mdash;had
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> by numerous speeches won over the Rhodians to give up the hope, which they had repeatedly discovered to be idle, of currying favour with kings, and to keep the alliance with Rome, the only alliance in the world at that time which was secure whether through power or trustworthiness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> War with Perseus, said Hegesilochus, was imminent; the Romans would call for the same naval force which they had recently seen in the war with Antiochus, and previously in that with Philip.<note>Cf. XXXI. xlvii. 3; XXXII. xvi. 6; XXXVI. xlv. 5; XXXVII. ix. 5; xxii. 1-2; xxx for participation by the Rhodians in Roman campaigns.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Rhodians would be in a panic over the sudden need to prepare a fleet at the time it should be sent, if they did not begin to refit their ships and equip them with sailors. This they must do with the greater vigour in order to <pb id="p.429"/>refute by the proof of actions the accusations brought<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> by Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Aroused by these arguments, they displayed to the Roman envoys on their arrival, so that it might be evident that they had not waited to be urged, a fleet of forty ships prepared and equipped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This embassy, moreover, had great weight in winning the allegiance of the states of Asia. Decimius alone returned to Rome without accomplishing anything, and disgraced by the suspicion of having even solicited bribes from the Illyrian kings.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Perseus had returned to Macedonia from his conference with the Romans, he sent to Rome envoys about the terms of peace outlined with Marcius; also to Byzantium and Rhodes . . . he gave the envoys [letters] to present.<note>Names of other cities may have fallen out; <quote>letters</quote> is an obvious inference from the context.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the letters the same sentiments were expressed to all, namely, that he had conferred with envoys from Rome; what he had heard and what he had said had turned out to be such that he might seem to have had the better of the discussion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Before the Rhodians<note>With this chapter cf. Polybius XXVII. 4.</note> the envoys added that the king was sure there would be peace; for at the suggestion of Marcius and Atilius envoys had been sent to Rome. If the Romans continued to stir up war contrary to the treaty, then the Rhodians must strive with all their resources of friendly influence to bring peace again; if they did not succeed with their entreaties, they must act to prevent authority and power over everything coming into the hands of a single people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was to the interest both of all states and especially of the Rhodians, in proportion as they were outstanding <pb id="p.431"/>among other states in position and resources;<note>Polybius, <hi rend="italics">loc. cit.,</hi> puts at this point a loftier reason &mdash;that the Rhodians especially valued their own independence and the freedom of Greece: <foreign lang="greek">o(/sw| ga\r plei=on o)re/gontai th=s i)shgori/as kai\ parrhsi/as kai\ diatelou=si prostatou=ntes... th=s tw=n a)/llwn (Ellh/nwn e)leuqeri/as.</foreign></note> <note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> these blessings would be enslaved and in bondage, if there were no recourse to anyone but
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the Romans. The friendly hearing given to the letter and the words of the envoys was greater than the weight they had in changing the Rhodians' minds; the influence of the better<note>Polybius uses the corresponding adjective <foreign lang="greek">tou= belti/onos</foreign>; such adjectives are likely in Greek and Roman literature to connote the conservative aristocracy, or upper class.</note> party began to be
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the stronger. The reply as voted was that the Rhodians hoped for peace; if there were war, the king must not expect or ask anything of the Rhodians which would destroy between them and the Romans the ancient friendship, cemented by many great services in peace
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and war. On the way back from Rhodes,<note>A separate embassy, according to Polybius.</note> the envoys also approached the cities of Boeotia, not only Thebes but also Coronea and Haliartus, for it was believed that their desertion of the alliance with the king and adhesion to the Romans had been forced upon them against
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> their will. The Thebans were not at all moved, although, both for the condemnation of the chief men and the restoration of the exiles, they were angry with
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Romans.<note>Polybius XXVII. 5 does not mention the Thebans, but speaks of the embassy going to This be, as well as Coronea and Haliartus. In view of this, and of the apparently unchallenged dominance of the pro-Roman party at Thebes (cf. sees. 9-10 below), it seems certain that Livy, either because of a faulty MS., or because of his own slip, read <foreign lang="greek">Qh/bas</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">Qi/sbas</foreign> in Polybius, and should not have brought Thebes in at this point.</note> The peoples of Coronea and Haliartus, through some inborn prejudice in favour of kings, sent envoys to Macedonia asking for a garrison, by which they might protect themselves against the reckless insolence of
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the Thebans. To this embassy the king's reply was, that because of the truce made with the Romans he could not send them a garrison; however, <pb id="p.433"/>he advised them to protect themselves as best they<note type="margin">B.C. 172</note> might against the injustice of the Thebans in such a way as not to offer the Romans an excuse for harshness against them.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Marcius and Atilius had arrived in Rome, in the Capitol they reported about their embassy, emphasizing nothing as a greater achievement than the deception of the king by the truce and the hope of peace.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> However, with the time consumed by the truce, the war would be waged on even terms; he would be in no way better prepared, and the Romans would start the war better equipped in everything. Also they had subtly disrupted the Boeotian League, they said, so that the Boeotians could no longer be joined by any common action to the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These actions a large part of the senate approved as having been done with great wisdom; the older men and those mindful of ancient custom said they did not recognize in this embassy the ways of Rome.<note>Livy's central theme is the old Roman character and its decline and fall (Preface, 9); his patriotism does not blind him to certain lapses from the traditional standard, cf. e.g. IX. xi; cf. also Diodorus XXX. 7.</note></p>

For this reason they entered into a convention among themselves to use against each other neither secret missiles nor those discharged from a distance, and considered that it was only a hand-to-hand battle at close quarters which was truly decisive. Hence they preceded war by a declaration and when they intended to do battle gave notice of the fact and of the spot to which they would proceed and array their army. But at the present they say it is a sign of poor generalship to do anything openly in war. Some slight traces, however, of the ancient principles of warfare survive among the Romans.

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Atilius was instructed to call on Gnaeus Sicinius for two thousand soldiers to accomplish this mission. Publius Lentulus too &mdash;he had returned from Achaea &mdash;was

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With these preparations made, although<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> plans for making war had been determined upon, yet it was decided to receive the envoys before the senate.<note>A different account of the same event, above, ch. xxxvi. 1-8; this later account follows Polybius, XXVII. 6, <foreign lang="greek">pa/lai prodieilhfo/tes u(pe\r tou= polemei=n</foreign> and cf. Diodorus, XXX. 1.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nearly the same statements as had been made at the conference by the king were presented by his envoys. The charge of setting an ambush for Eumenes was both their chief concern and at the same time &mdash;for the situation was obvious &mdash;the least plausibly refuted; the rest of what they had to say was mollification.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the envoys were not heard by spirits which could be either enlightened or moved. <pb id="p.439"/>The stern order was given them to depart from the<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> walls of Rome at once, and within thirty days from Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then to the consul Publius Licinius, to whom Macedonia had fallen as province, the order was given that he should appoint the first possible day for the army to assemble.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Gaius Lucretius the praetor,<note>Cf. above, ch. xxxv. 3.</note> whose duty was the command of the fleet, left the city with forty quinqueremes; for it had been decided to keep at the city several of the refitted ships for various purposes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The praetor sent his brother Marcus Lucretius on in advance with one quinquereme, with orders to meet the fleet at Cephallania with the ships received from the allies according to treaty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After taking on one trireme from Rhegium, two from Locri, four from the district of Uria,<note>Apparently the territory of the Sallentini in the extreme <quote>heel</quote> of Italy, although Uria is an inland town; there was also a Uria nearer the Adriatic in northern Apulia.</note> he coasted along Italy past the farthest cape of Calabria and crossed the Ionian sea to Dyrrhachium.

Gaius Lucretius the praetor set out from Naples, passed through the straits<note>Of Messina.</note> and made the crossing to Cephallania in five days.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During these days, as it happened, the consul Publius Licinius, after announcing his vows on the Capitol, set out from the city in military dress.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Such a departure is always indeed conducted with great solemnity and pomp; it particularly draws the eyes and minds of men when they escort a consul going against an enemy great and famous either for bravery or for good fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For not only care in paying their respects, but also eagerness for the spectacle brings crowds to see their leader, to whose command and wisdom they have entrusted the whole welfare of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon there steals over their minds a thought of the calamities of war, and how uncertain is the outcome of fortune and how impartial the god of war &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> thought of reverses and successes, of what disasters have often occurred through the ignorance and rashness of leaders, of what gains, on the other hand, prudence and courage have produced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What mortal knows, men think, which kind of mind and fortune belongs to this consul whom we are sending to war? Shall it be in swift triumph, as he climbs the Capitol with a conquering army toward those gods from whom he now takes his leave, that we shall see him, or are we to give that joy to the enemy?<note>For similar scenes, cf. XXVII. xl, XXIX. xxvi, XLIV. xxii. 17.</note> To King Perseus in particular, against whom the consul was going, fame had come from the brilliance of the Macedonian nation in war and from Philip, the king's father, whose reputation sprang from many successful achievements and, besides, even from the war with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, too, Perseus' own name, because of the expectation of war with him, <pb id="p.443"/>never from the time he mounted
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the throne had<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> ceased to be on men's lips. With such thoughts, men of all classes escorted the departing consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Two ex-consuls were sent with him as military tribunes, Gaius Claudius and Quintus Mucius<note>Consuls in 177 and <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date> respectively; for Mucius' part in the campaign, cf. below, ch. lviii. 13, and lxvii. 9, where he has been promoted to <hi rend="italics">legatus.</hi></note> and three noted young men, Publius Lentulus and two named Manlius Acidinus &mdash;one was the son of Marcus Manlius, the other of Lucius Manlius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With these the consul left for the army at Brundisium and crossing thence with all his forces, pitched camp near the Place of the Nymphs<note>Cf. above, ch. xxxvi. 6 and n. 3.</note> in the territory of Apollonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days before, after the envoys returning from Rome had cut off hope of peace, Perseus held a council. There a contest of opposing views took place for a time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were those who thought that either a tribute should be paid, if it were imposed, or part of their territory yielded, if this form of fine were inflicted &mdash;or, finally, that anything else which must be endured for the sake of peace should not be rejected, nor should the king risk staking himself and his kingdom on a cast with so great a forfeit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If his hold on the kingdom remained quite undisputed, the passage of time might bring, they thought, many means not only of recouping his losses but of making him positively an object of fear to those whom he now feared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> However, by far the majority held a bolder opinion. No matter what he should have yielded, they declared, along with it he would immediately have to yield his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the Romans were not in want of money or territory, but <pb id="p.445"/>understood that not only all human affairs, but in<note type="margin">B.C 171</note> particular the greatest of kingdoms and empires, were subject to many vicissitudes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans, said these advisers, knew that they had shattered the power of the Carthaginians and had set upon their necks a very powerful royal neighbour;<note>Masinissa.</note> Antiochus and his line had been driven beyond the range of Taurus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> only the kingdom of Macedonia remained, both near in situation, and such that, when in any way its good fortune began to fail the Roman people, it might seem able to inspire its kings with the spirit of their ancestors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While his strength was intact, Perseus ought to make up his mind whether, after being stripped, by concession after concession, of his resources, and thrust from his kingdom, he would prefer finally to beg of the Romans Samothrace<note>Perhaps in anticipation of the actual flight of Perseus thither, cf. XLIV. xlv. 15, XLV. v; as a sacred island, Samothrace was particularly appropriate as an asylum.</note> or some other island, where as an untitled survivor of his own kingdom he might grow old amid scorn and poverty, or whether, armed in defense of his power and high position, he would either, in a fashion worthy of a
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> brave man, endure whatever the fortune of war might bring, or as conqueror free the world from Roman domination. It would be no more astounding for the Romans to be driven from Greece than for Hannibal to have been driven from Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor in truth could they see how it was consistent to resist with the utmost vehemence a brother who was wrongly laying claim to the kingdom, and then, when the kingdom had been securely won, to yield it to aliens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Finally this discussion about peace and war was based on the universally accepted view that nothing is more disgraceful than to have yielded a kingdom without a struggle, nor anything more <pb id="p.447"/>glorious than to have made trial of fortune to the<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> utmost in defense of rank and crown.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This conference was held at Pella, in the ancient palace of the Macedonians. <quote>Let us, then,</quote> said Perseus, <quote>wage war, since this seems best, with the kindly help of the gods,</quote> and sending dispatches to his officers he drew all his forces together at Citium, a city of Macedonia.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There all the forces of Macedonians and foreign auxiliaries had already assembled. He pitched camp before the city and drew up all the soldiers on the plain; the total of all was forty-three thousand under arms; about half of these were phalanx-men;<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then there were two thousand chosen from all the force of light infantry<note>For <hi rend="italics">caetrati</hi> cf. XXXI. xxxvi. 1 and the note, also XXVIII. v. 11. These <quote>peltasts</quote> (the Greek term) first came into use in the Peloponnesian War, and were made important by Iphicrates of Athens early in the fourth century; they were conspicuous, as here, in the army of Alexander the Great. They were armed with helmet, shield, long spear and sword.</note> for their strength and the vigour of their youth; this unit the Macedonians called the Guard;<note>Cf. Polybius V. 65.2, 84. 7; Arrian, <hi rend="italics">Anabasis,</hi> II 8.3, III. 11. 9.</note> its commanders were Leonnatus and Thrasippus, Eulyestans.<note>The name of this people is not found elsewhere, and is probably corrupt.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The leader <pb id="p.449"/>of the other light infantry, about three thousand men,<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> was Antiphilus of Edessa. The Paeonians from the districts both of the Mountainside<note>Cf. XXXIX. xxvii. 10.</note> and of the Strymon Valley &mdash;these places march with Thrace &mdash; and the Agrianes,<note>Regular auxiliaries of the Macedonians, cf. XXVIII. v. 12, XXXIII. xviii. 9, Arrian, I. 1. 11, etc.</note> with an admixture, besides, of Thracian settlers, also supplied a contingent of nearly three thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Didas the Paeonian, who had killed young Demetrius,<note>Cf. XL. xxii. 15 &mdash;xxiv; Didas was governor of Paeonia.</note> had armed and mustered
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> them. There were also two thousand Gauls<note>Either from Asia Minor, or, more probably, from Pannonia (northern Jugoslavia).</note> under arms; their commander was Asclepiodotus from Heraclea of the Sintians; three thousand free Thracians were under their own commander. About an equal number of Cretans followed native leaders, Susus of Phalasarnae and Syllus of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Knossus. Leonides too, the Lacedaemonian, commanded five hundred from Greece, a mixed group of men. He was said to be of the royal blood, an exile, condemned by a full council of the Achaeans because of dispatches to Perseus which had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> intercepted. Lycon the Achaean was commander of the Aetolians and Boeotians, who amounted in all to not more than five hundred. Of these auxiliaries, made up of so many peoples and tribes, the total under arms came to about twelve thousand. Of cavalry, the king had assembled three thousand from all
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Macedonia. To Citium had come Cotys,<note>Cf. above xxix. 12 and the note.</note> son of Seuthes, king of the tribe of the Odrysae, with one thousand picked cavalry and about an equal number of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> infantry. Thus the total of the whole army was thirty-nine thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry. It was generally agreed that, <pb id="p.451"/>except for the army which Alexander the Great took<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> over to Asia,<note>Livy's estimate of Alexander's available strength in IX. xix. 5 was not so large.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The twenty-sixth year was passing, since peace had been granted to Philip at his request;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> throughout all that time unmolested Macedonia had both produced offspring, a large number of whom were of military age, and yet, in minor wars with her Thracian neighbours, of a sort to give training rather than to produce weariness, had been unremittingly in arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Also the long planning for war with Rome, first by Philip, then by Perseus, had brought it about that everything was ready and at hand.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The array of the review was set briefly in motion (not however in a regular manoeuvre<note>Cf. XL. vi. 5-7.</note> ), so that they might not seem to have merely stood under arms; the king summoned them, in arms as they were, to an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He himself stood on a platform, having about him his two sons, the elder of whom, Philip, was by birth his brother, by adoption his son, while the younger, whom they called Alexander, was his own.<note>Cf. Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius Paullus,</hi> xxxiii. 3-4 and xxxvii. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He cheered the soldiers on to the war; he recited the wrongs done by the Roman people to his father and himself; the former had been driven by all sorts of outrages to fight back, but had been overtaken by fate during preparations for the war;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to Perseus himself envoys had been sent at the same moment as soldiers for the seizing of the cities of Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then through a treacherous conference, by means of a pretence of reorganizing peace, the <pb id="p.453"/>winter had been wasted, so that the Romans might<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> have time for preparation; now the consul was coming with two Roman legions, each of which contained six thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry, and about the same number of allied infantry and cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Supposing that there were added to this force auxiliaries from the kings, Eumenes and Masinissa, there would be not more than thirty-seven thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now that they had heard the numbers of the enemy let them consider their own army, how much it excelled in numbers and in type of soldiers, how much they, trained in the arts of warfare from boyhood, disciplined and hardened in so many wars, excelled these recruits hastily enrolled for this war. The auxiliaries of the Romans were Lydians, Phrygians,<note>The state, however, supplied arms in case of need, and in wartime presumably had replacements in its arsenals, cf. XXIX. xxii. 3.</note> and Numidians; their own, Thracians and Gauls, the most warlike of all nations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their enemies had such arms as each poverty-stricken soldier might have acquired for himself,<note>Traditionally regarded as effeminate and slavish by Greeks and Romans; the Lydians were said to have been made un warlike, to prevent uprisings, by Cyrus the Great; on advice of their ex-king Croesus, he had forbidden them arms and made them become merchants and musicians (Herodotus I, 155). Cf. XXXVIII. xvi. 13, and the note.</note> the Macedonians had arms taken from the royal arsenals, laid up through so many years by his father's care and expenditure. Provisions for the enemy would come not only from a long distance, but subject to all the accidents of seafaring; he himself had stored up both money and grain, not counting the revenue from the mines, for a ten years' war.<note>So also Justinus, XXXII. 1. 3: Perseo . . . decennis belli sumptus a patre paratus in thesauris et horreis erat.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Everything which, by the beneficence of the gods and by the prudence of the king, was to be made ready the Macedonians had in abundant plenty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> they must have, too, the spirit <pb id="p.455"/>which their ancestors had possessed, who, having<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> subdued all
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> Europe, had crossed to Asia and opened up with their arms a whole world unknown even to rumour, and had not ceased their conquests, until, within the barrier of the Indian Ocean,<note>The <quote>Red Sea</quote> usually meant to a Roman the Persian Gulf, but cf. below, <hi rend="italics">ultimis Indiae oris;</hi> the Indian Ocean had perhaps no separate name current in Livy's day; Roman seafaring in those waters came later.</note> there was nothing left for them to conquer. But now, by Hercules, fortune had proclaimed a contest, not for the farthermost shores of India, but for the possession of Macedonia itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When the Romans had been waging war with his father, they had held out the plausible pretext of the freedom of Greece; now openly they sought to enslave Macedonia, that there might be no king neighbouring the Roman empire, that no people famed in war might keep its arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All these things they must surrender to haughty masters, along with their king and kingdom, if they wished to cease waging war and do the bidding of others.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although throughout all the speech there had been often enough outbursts of applause, at that moment indeed such an outcry arose from those who were at once enraged and threatening, while some of them bade the king be of good cheer, that he put an end to his speech, merely ordering them to prepare for a
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> march, for it was reported that the Romans had already moved camp from the Place of the Nymphs. After dismissing the assembly he turned to hearing embassies from the cities of Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These groups had come in order to promise funds for the war, each according to its ability, and grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To all thanks were expressed and the offers refused; <pb id="p.457"/>they were informed that the royal stores were<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> sufficient for these purposes. Only wagons were ordered, to carry the catapults and a huge supply of missile weapons which was ready and other martial equipment.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then setting out by way of Eordaea<note>The route chosen led west, then south, avoiding mountain narrows as far as possible, and taking the western pass to the Tripolis.</note> with the whole army, after camping at the lake called Begorritis, the king advanced on the next day into Elimea to the Haliacmon river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then crossing the mountains which they call Cambunian by a narrow pass, he came down to Azorus, Pytho&uuml;s and Dolich&ecirc;; the inhabitants call them Tripolis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These three towns, after brief hesitation because they had given hostages to the people of Larisa, nevertheless, overcome by immediate fear, yielded in surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After reassuring speeches to these, Perseus, not doubting that the Perrhaebians also would do the same . . .<note>Perhaps only the name of the city (Malloea? cf. below, ch. lxvii. 7) is missing.</note> at once on his arrival received the surrender of the city with no delay on the part of the inhabitants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Forced to besiege Cyretiae, he was repulsed the first day by a sharp rally of fighters at the gates; on the next day, by attacking with all his forces, he received before nightfall the surrender of everyone.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mylae, the next town, being so fortified that their hope that the defences were impregnable made the inhabitants overbold, considered it insufficient to shut its gates to the king, but also assailed him and the Macedonians with saucy insults.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This impertinence both made the enemy more vehement in the attack and fired the citizens, through despair of obtaining pardon, to defend themselves more vigorously.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore for three <pb id="p.459"/>days with great spirit on both sides the city was<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> attacked and defended. The numbers of the Macedonians were easily sufficient to undertake the battle in relays; the townspeople, guarding the walls day and night without relief, were worn out not only by wounds but also by wakefulness and unbroken toil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When on the fourth day ladders were lifted against the walls on all sides and also the gate was attacked with greater violence, the townspeople, after thrusting back the assault on the walls, rallied to guard the gate and made a sudden sally against the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> this being more the result of heedless rage than of genuine confidence in their strength, the small number of weary men, routed by fresh opponents, turned tail and in their flight let the enemy in through the open gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thus the city was captured and sacked; even the free persons who survived the slaughter were sold. After the town had been in large part torn down and burned, Perseus, departing, moved his camp to Phalanna<note>Perseus now turns east, then north-east.</note> and thence on the next day arrived at Gyrton.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he heard that Titus Minucius Rufus and Hippias, general of the Thessalians, had entered that town with a garrison, he passed by without even trying an attack and received the submission of Elatia and Gonnus because the inhabitants were frightened by his unexpected arrival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Both towns are in the narrows by which Temp&ecirc; is approached, especially Gonnus. Therefore he left this town both protected by a stronger garrison of cavalry and infantry and fortified in addition by a triple ditch and a rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He himself having advanced to Sycurium decided to await there the approach of the enemy; at the <pb id="p.461"/>same time he ordered his army to gather grain<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> everywhere in the adjoining hostile territory. For Sycurium is in the foothills of Mount Ossa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This mountain by its southern slope commands the plains of Thessaly, and to the rear, Macedonia and Magnesia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To these advantages of position are added the greatest healthfulness and an abundance of unfailing water, since numerous springs surround it.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman consul, being on his way to Thessaly with his army during these same days, first made a rapid march through Epirus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> then, after he crossed into Athamania, a land of rough and almost pathless terrain, with great difficulty by small roads he barely got through to Gomphi;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> while his men and horses were in trouble, and since he commanded a novice army, if the king had opposed him with a force advantageously arrayed as to time and place, even the Romans do not deny that they would have fought with great loss to themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After their arrival at Gomphi without opposition, besides the joy of having negotiated a dangerous pass, scorn of enemies who were so ignorant of their own advantages also came to them.<note>This criticism ignores the difficulties which Perseus would have suffered had he tried to oppose the Romans in Athamania; in the mountains his strongest arm, the phalanx, was useless, and his cavalry might well have been hobbled; the problem of supplies and communications would have been complicated by the mountains between him and Macedonia; and his strategic flank would have been wide open to hostile Thessaly. His actual march left him with direct communication with Macedonia, the flanking passes to the west guarded, and ground before him level enough for his type of fighting.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After sacrifice duly performed and a distribution of grain to the soldiers, the consul, delaying a few days to rest beasts and men, on hearing that the Macedonians were wandering scattered through Thessaly and that the territory of the allies was being plundered, led his now sufficiently refreshed soldiery to Larisa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When about three miles distant <pb id="p.463"/>from there, at Tripolis &mdash;they call it Scaea &mdash;above the<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> Pene&uuml;s river he pitched camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During this same time Eumenes arrived at Chalcis with a fleet, accompanied by his brothers Attalus and Athenaeus, his brother Philetaerus having been left at Pergamum for the protection of the kingdom. From Chalcis he came with Attalus and four thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry to the consul; at Chalcis two thousand infantry were left under the command of Athenaeus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Also the other auxiliaries of the Romans assembled at Tripolis from all the peoples of Greece everywhere, many of whom &mdash; so small were they &mdash;have come to oblivion. The people of Apollonia sent three hundred cavalry and one hundred infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From the Aetolians there came the equivalent of one squadron,<note>About 500 men.</note> the total force of cavalry of the whole league, and of the Thessalians, whose entire cavalry force had been hoped for, not more than three hundred horsemen<note>Below lviii. 14, there are 400 present.</note> were in the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Achaeans contributed of their young men, mostly with Cretan armament,<note>I.e. as slingers and other light troops.</note> about fifteen hundred.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the same time Gaius Lucretius too, the praetor who commanded the ships at Cephallania, ordering his brother Marcus Lucretius to make for Chalcis around Malea with the fleet, himself embarked on a trireme, sailing for the Corinthian Gulf in order to be the first in the field in Boeotia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His voyage was somewhat slow because of his bodily weakness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcus Lucretius, on his arrival at Chalcis, hearing that Haliartus was being besieged by Publius Lentulus,<note>4 Roman garrison-commander at Thebes, in charge of Boeotia, cf. above xlvii. 12. Haliartus commanded the pass between eastern and western Boeotia.</note> sent a messenger <pb id="p.465"/>to order him in the name of the praetor to depart<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> from there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The commissioner, who had undertaken this enterprise with the Boeotian young men of the party supporting the Romans, departed from the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The raising of this siege gave room for another new siege; for immediately Marcus Lucretius with the naval force, ten thousand men-at-arms, and in addition the two thousand king's men who were under Athenaeus, blockaded Haliartus; and while they were preparing also to assault it, the praetor joined them from Cre&uuml;sa.<note>The port of Thespiae, on the Corinthian Gulf.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At about the same time ships from the allies also assembled at Chalcis &mdash;two Carthaginian quinqueremes, two triremes from Heraclea on the Euxine, four from Chalcedon, as many from Samos, and also five quadriremes from Rhodes.<note>Cf. Polybius XXVII. 7. 14-16.</note> These, since there was no naval warfare in any quarter, the praetor sent back to the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quintus Marcius also came to Chalcis with ships, after capturing Alop&ecirc; in Phthiotis and attacking Larisa which is called Cremast&ecirc;.<note>I.e. <quote>Hanging Larisa,</quote> cf. above xlii. 1, and below lxvii. 10.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>While this was the situation in Boeotia, and Perseus, as has been said above, had his permanent camp at Sycurium, after all the grain had been brought in from the fields round about, he sent a force to devastate the territory of Pherae, thinking that thus he might catch the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> Romans drawn a rather long distance from their camp for the purpose of aiding the cities of their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he discovered that they had not stirred at all because of this raid, he divided all the booty at least, only the human beings excepted &mdash;it consisted chiefly of all sorts of livestock &mdash;among his soldiers for feasting.</p> <pb id="p.467"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then about the same time both the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> and the king held a council to consider how to open the campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The spirits of the king's men had risen when the devastated area of Pheraean territory had been yielded to their side by the enemy; and so they advised going thence at once against the enemy's camp and giving him no further time for delay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans also were aware that their delay was being roundly criticized among their allies, who were especially incensed that aid had not been given the Pheraeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While they were conferring as to what to do &mdash;for Eumenes and Attalus were present in the council &mdash;an alarmed messenger reported that the enemy was at hand with a large column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The council was dismissed and the signal for arming immediately given. Meanwhile it was decided to send out from the king's auxiliary troops a hundred<note>If this number is right, a somewhat larger force was actually sent, cf. below &sect; 7.</note> cavalry and an equal number of javelin-throwers on foot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At about the fourth hour of the day Perseus ordered the ranks of the infantry to halt at a distance of a little over a mile from the Roman camp; he himself led the way with the cavalry and light-armed force; Cotys too and the leaders of the other auxiliaries went on with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were less than half a mile from the camp when enemy cavalry came in sight; there were two squadrons made up mostly of Gauls<note>I.e. Galatians from Asia Minor.</note> &mdash;Cassignatus was the commander &mdash;and of light-armed troops about one hundred and fifty Mysians and Cretans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The king halted, not being sure how large the enemy forces were. Then he sent from the column two troops of Thracians and two of Macedonians with two cohorts each of Cretans and Thracians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Since they <pb id="p.469"/>were equally matched as to numbers and from<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> neither the one side nor the other were reinforcements sent up, the battle ended in a draw. Of Eumenes' men about thirty were killed, among whom Cassignatus, leader of the Gauls, fell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And for the time being Perseus led back his forces to Sycurium; on the next day at about the same hour to the same place the king brought up his troops, followed by wagons with water; for the journey of twelve miles was all waterless and exceedingly dusty; it was clear that they would have fought under the handicap of thirst if the battle had begun at the first sight of the foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the Romans kept quiet, even withdrawing their outposts within the rampart, the king's men also returned to camp. This they did during several days, hoping that the Roman cavalry would attack the rear of their departing column;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> then after a fight had begun, when they had lured them too far from camp, they could easily, wheresoever they might be, turn the tide of battle by their superior power in cavalry and light troops.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the attempt failed of success, the king moved his camp nearer the enemy and fortified it at five miles' distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From there at dawn he drew up his battle-line of infantry in the usual place and led all his cavalry and light troops to the camp of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The sight of dust nearer to them and from a larger force than usual caused alarm in the Roman camp. At first they hardly believed their sentry's report, because regularly on previous days the enemy had never appeared before the fourth hour; this time it was at sunrise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then as doubt vanished at the shouting and dashing <pb id="p.471"/>back from the gates of a larger number of men, a<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> great confusion arose. The tribunes, prefects and centurions rushed to headquarters, the rank-and-file each to his own tent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Less than half a mile from the rampart Perseus drew up his men about the hill which they call Callinicus.<note>I.e. of Glorious Victory.</note> King Cotys was in charge of the left wing with all his tribesmen; light-armed troops, placed between, divided the units of cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the right wing were Macedonian cavalry, and Cretans interspersed among their troops; Midon of Beroea was in charge of the latter force, Menon of Antigonea commanded the cavalry and the formation as a whole.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Next to the wings were posted the royal cavalry and mixed units of the picked auxiliaries of many nations;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Patrocles of Antigonea and Didas the governor of Paeonia were in command of these.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king was in the centre of the whole line; around him was what they call the Guard, and the sacred squadrons<note>This name (cf. below lxvi. 5, XLIV. xlii. 2) is not used by other extant writers; it might mean the <quote>royal squadron</quote> of Cavalry Companions (Arrian, <hi rend="italics">Anabasis,</hi> III. 11. 8) which was also called <hi rend="italics">agema</hi> (<quote>Guard</quote>), cf. Antiochus' Horse-Guard, XXXVII. xl. 6 and 11, especially if the <hi rend="italics">agema</hi> here mentioned was the Foot-Guard of peltasts (above li. 4, and the note). Sage's note on Antiochus' Guard (<hi rend="italics">loc. cit.</hi>) suggests that <hi rend="italics">sacrae alae</hi> defines <hi rend="italics">agema</hi> here. The name <quote>sacred</quote> may have been used on analogy with the Sacred Band of Thebes under Pelopidas, cf. Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Pelopidas,</hi> xviii.</note> of the cavalry. Before him he placed the slingers and javelin-throwers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> each band attained to the number of four hundred; Ion of Thessalonica and Artemon, a Dolopian, he put in command of these. Thus the king's men were arrayed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After the Roman infantry had been drawn up within the rampart, the consul likewise sent out all his cavalry with the light troops; they were arrayed before the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the right wing the commander was Gaius Licinius Crassus, the brother of the consul, with all the Italian cavalry, <pb id="p.473"/>and the light infantry of the legions<note>These were not unlike the Greek peltasts, but used more as mere skirmishers, cf. XXVI. iv (this represents the first time they were used for an important service), XXX. xxxiii. 3, XXXI. xxxv. 5. The <hi rend="italics">velites</hi> disappear from the Roman army not long after this time, as foreign auxiliaries replace them. For their arms, cf. Polybius VI. 22.</note> intermingled;<note type="margin">B.C 171</note> on the left Marcus Valerius Laevinus had the allied cavalry from the peoples of Greece and the light troops of the same nation; the centre, however, Quintus Mucius held with the picked &Eacute;lite Cavalry.<note>These were selected from the rest of the cavalry as the fittest, cf. Polybius, VI. 26. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Before the standards of the centre were arrayed two hundred Gallic cavalry and three hundred of Eumenes' Cyrtian<note>Nomad brigands from the Kurd country in northwest Persia, cf. XXXVII. xl. 9.</note> auxiliaries. Four hundred Thessalian cavalry were placed at a short distance beyond the left wing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> King Eumenes and Attalus with all their forces were posted behind, between the rear line and the rampart.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Drawn up in very nearly this fashion and with numbers of cavalry and light troops about even on both sides, the lines clashed, the battle beginning with the slingers and javelin-throwers, who were in advance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First of all the Thracians, like beasts of prey long held behind bars, charged so vigorously with a great shout upon the Roman right wing, the Italian cavalry, that this people, courageous by nature and through experience in war,<note>Apparently exceptions to the rule of inexperience, above Iv. 3.</note> was thrown into
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> confusion . . . spears to attack the infantry . . .<note>The words introducing the account of the mel&eacute;e have entirely disappeared; the sense and construction of the three isolated words is not clear; some scholars restore two more words, <quote>phalanx,</quote> and <hi rend="italics">rumpiis</hi> (long Thracian spears, cf. XXXI. xxxix. 11) which do not seem to fit the context. (So E.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Perseus, charging the centre of the line, thrust back the Greeks with his first attack;<note>Livy fails to mention the Roman &Eacute;lite Cavalry, either out of confusion, or because weakness in the Aetolian contingent at this point was regarded as the cause of the whole Roman debacle, cf. below lx. 9.</note> in the rout of these when the enemy pressed heavily from the rear, the Thessalian cavalry, which had been in support, away a short distance from the left wing and beyond the melee, though at first spectators of the conflict, were later, when the decision had been reached, of the greatest use.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For, retreating gradually with formation intact, after they had joined the auxiliaries of Eumenes, with him they both provided a safe retreat between their units for their allies scattered in flight, and when the enemy pressed on in less close order, they even risked advancing and met many of the fugitives half-way. Nor did the king's men, now themselves scattered in a general pursuit, dare to close in battle with an enemy in formation and advancing steadily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While the king, victorious in the cavalry battle, was crying out that if he had helped with a slight impulse a decisive victory would have been won, the phalanx also arrived appropriately at the very moment of his urging;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hippias and Leonnatus had brought the phalanx up swiftly on their own initiative, in order not to fail the bold beginning, after they had received the report that the cavalry had won their battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While the king was wavering between hope and fear of attempting so great a feat, the Cretan Evander, whom the <pb id="p.477"/>king had used as his tool at Delphi in the ambushing<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> of Eumenes,<note>Cf. above xv. 3 ff.</note> on seeing the column of infantry with their standards advancing, ran to the king and pressed the warning that he should not be so puffed up by good fortune as to stake his whole enterprise rashly on a needless throw of the dice;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> if, satisfied with his success, he should rest for that day, either he would have a basis for
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> an honourable peace or an abundance of such allies in war as would follow the lead of fortune, in case he should prefer to fight. To this advice the mind of the king was more inclined.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so, praising Evander, he ordered a withdrawal, and that the column of infantry should return to camp, while for the cavalry the signal for returning should be sounded.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That day there fell on the Roman side two hundred cavalry, and hardly less than two thousand infantry; about six hundred were captured.<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Aemilius Paullus</hi> ix. 2, gives the loss in dead as 2500; in <hi rend="italics">Sayings of Romans</hi> 197 F (L.C.L., <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi> III., p. 173) the total dead and captured are given as 2800, as here.</note> Of the king's men, however, twenty cavalrymen and forty infantrymen were killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the victors returned to camp, all indeed rejoiced, but above the others the swaggering joy of the Thracians was conspicuous; for they returned bearing with songs the heads of their enemies impaled on spears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the Roman side there was not only gloom because of their lack of success, but also fear that the enemy might immediately attack the camp. Eumenes advised the consul to move his camp across the Pene&uuml;s, so that he might have the river as a fortification while the soldiers were recovering their shattered morale. The consul was affected by the disgrace <pb id="p.479"/>of admitting timidity; but being overcome by reason,<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> he led his troops across in the dead of night and fortified a camp on the farther bank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king came up next day to harass the enemy with battle, and, after finding out that the camp
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> had been placed in safety across the river, admitted that he had indeed been at fault in not having pressed home the previous day his attack against the conquered, but that a somewhat greater mistake was that he had been inactive during the night;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for even if he had not stirred one other man of his forces, he could, by an attack of the light troops, have to a great extent destroyed the enemy's troops while they were in confusion as they crossed the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the Romans indeed the immediate fear was removed, since they had a camp safely placed; but the loss, among other things, of reputation particularly disturbed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And in the conference before the consul each in his own defence assigned the blame to the Aetolians; the beginning, they said, of the flight and panic had been made by them; the other allies from the peoples of Greece had also followed the rout of the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Five chiefs of the Aetolians, who were the first said to have been seen turning their backs, were sent to Rome.<note>Polybius, XXVII. 15. 14, regarded the charge against the Aetolians as a piece of party politics originated by their countryman, the general Lyciscus, and foolishly believed by he Romans. Cf. Appian, <hi rend="italics">Macedonian Wars,</hi> IX. xii: <foreign lang="greek">Aitww=n de\ kai\ e(te/rwn (Ellh/nwn kateyeu/sato w(s prw=tw trape/ntwn.</foreign></note> The Thessalians were praised before an assembly, and their leaders were even rewarded presents for valour.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To the king were brought the spoils of the slain enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of these he gave as gifts, to some the noteworthy arms, to others horses, and to some few prisoners. There were over fifteen hundred shields; coats of mail and breastplates made up a total of <pb id="p.481"/>over a thousand; of helmets, swords and missiles<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> of all sorts the number was somewhat greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These gifts, splendid and agreeable in themselves, were augmented by the words of the king, which he pronounced before the army summoned to assembly.</p> 
				<p><quote>You have advance notice of the outcome of the war!
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> You have routed the better part of the enemy, the Roman cavalry, in which they used to boast that they were unconquered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For among the Romans the cavalrymen are the leading young men,<note>Cf. II. xx. 10-11, IX. xiv. 14-16, X. xxviii. 7, and Polybius VI. 20. 9; but not all the cavalry were young men of high rank, cf. XXX. xviii. 15, where the <hi rend="italics">equites illustres</hi> are specially mentioned, and XXXIX. xxxi. 16; the transition from a cavalry composed of noble citizens to one composed of foreign auxiliaries was at this time under way.</note> the cavalry is the training-school for the senate; from it their consuls are chosen to be among the Fathers; from it they select their generals: it is the spoils of these men which we have recently divided among you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And no less a victory have you over the legions of the infantry, which, escaping from you by a night retreat, filled the river everywhere with the panic of shipwrecked swimmers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But it will be easier for us as we pursue the conquered to pass over the Peneiis than it was for them in their panic; once we have crossed, we shall immediately attack their camp, which we would have captured to-day if they had not fled;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> or if they wish to decide the issue by battle in the open, look for the same outcome of the infantry fight as took place in the clash of the cavalry.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Both those who had conquered, wearing on their shoulders the spoils of the slain enemy, eagerly heard their own praises, anticipating a happy outcome in the future because of what had happened, <pb id="p.483"/>and also the infantry,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> fired by the glory which others<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> had won, especially those of the Macedonian phalanx, hoped for themselves also an opportunity both of achieving some service for the king and of winning a like glory from the enemy. The assembly was dismissed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Next day the king set out from there and pitched camp at Mopselus. This is a hill looming up before Temp&ecirc; and halfway as one goes from Larisa to Gonnus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Romans, not departing from the bank of the Pene&uuml;s, transferred their camp to a safer place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Misagenes the Numidian arrived with a thousand cavalry, an equal number of infantry, and in addition twenty-two elephants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As during these days the king was holding a council concerning his general policy, now that his overboldness resulting from success had subsided, some of his friends took courage to advise him to use his good fortune as a basis for an honourable peace rather than, led astray by idle hope, to throw himself into irrevocable disaster. To impose restraint on success and not to trust too much to the calm of his present fortune, they said, was the way of a wise man and one who was deservedly fortunate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Let him send to the consul men to renew the treaty on the same terms as those on which his father Philip had received peace from the victorious Titus Quinctius.<note>Cf. XXXIII. xxx; on Perseus' policy, cf. Polybius XXVII. 8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The war could not be ended more gloriously than with so memorable a fight, nor could a
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> more well-founded hope of lasting peace present itself than that which would make the Romans, shaken by the loss of a battle, more moderate in framing the treaty. But <pb id="p.485"/>if then too the innate stubbornness of the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> should scorn fair terms, gods and men would be witnesses both of Perseus' moderation and of his opponents' stiff-necked haughtiness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king's mind was never averse to such counsels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so as the opinion was approved by the assent of the majority, envoys were sent to the consul; they were heard in the presence of a full council. They asked for peace, promising that Perseus would pay the Romans as much tribute<note>Strictly speaking, Philip had paid a war-indemnity, not a tribute.</note> as
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> Philip had promised, and that he would yield with all speed the cities, land and places which Philip had yielded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So far the envoys. When after the withdrawal of the envoys the matter was discussed, Roman steadfastness<note>Examples of this Roman virtue may be found in XXII. lxi. 1 and 13, cf. <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi> xxxvii. 3.</note> carried the day in the council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The custom of that age was to wear in misfortune the aspect of success and to be of temperate disposition in successes. It was decided to reply that peace would be granted on condition that the king should give to the senate the unconditional right of deciding on a general policy concerning the king himself and concerning all Macedonia.<note>Cf. Polybius XXVII. 8. 7-10. <quote>It was unanimously decided (by the Roman council) to give as severe a reply as possible, it being in all cases the traditional Roman custom to show themselves most imperious and severe in the season of defeat, and most lenient after success. That this is noble conduct every one will confess, but perhaps it is open to doubt if it is possible under certain circumstances. In the present case, then, their answer was as follows. They ordered Perseus to submit absolutely, giving the senate authority to decide as they saw fit about the affairs of Macedonia</quote> (tr. Paton, L.C.L.).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the envoys reported these terms, to those ignorant of the Roman character their obstinacy was portentous, and many advised against any further reference to peace;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> for soon, they said, the Romans would of their own accord seek what they scorned when offered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Perseus <pb id="p.487"/>feared this very haughtiness &mdash;thinking that it<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> sprang from confidence in their strength-and, increasing the sum of money, if perchance he might buy peace for a price, he did not cease to test the purpose of the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After the latter would make no change in the terms of his first answer, Perseus, giving up hope of peace, returned to Sycurium from whence he had set out, intending to try anew the fortunes of war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="63"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The report of the cavalry battle, as it spread abroad throughout Greece, laid bare the inclinations of the inhabitants. For not only partisans of Macedonia but many who were indebted to the Romans for huge benefits, and some few who had felt the violence and tyranny of Perseus, received
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> this news gladly, for no other reason than the morbid eagerness which the mob feels in athletic contests also &mdash;the eagerness to cheer on the worse and weaker party.<note>Polybius XXVII. 9 illustrates this sentiment with an anecdote of the Olympic Games: <quote>The phenomenon was very like what happens in boxing contests at the games. For there, when a humble and much inferior combatant is matched against a celebrated and seemingly invincible athlete, the sympathy of the crowd is at once given to the inferior man. They cheer him on, and back him up enthusiastically; and if he manages to touch his opponent's face, and gets in a blow that leaves any mark, there is at once again the greatest excitement among them all. They sometimes even try to make fun of the other man, not out of any dislike for him or disapproval but from a curious sort of sympathy and a natural instinct to favour the weaker. If, however, one calls their attention at the right time to their error, they very soon change their minds and correct it. This was what Clitomachus did, as is told. He was considered to be a quite invincible boxer, and his fame had spread over the whole world, when Ptolemy, ambitious to destroy his reputation, trained with the greatest care and sent off the boxer Aristonicus, a man who seemed to have a remarkable natural gift for this sport. Upon this Aristonicus arriving in Greece and challenging Clitomachus at Olympia, the crowd, it seems, at once took the part of the former and cheered him on, delighted to see that some one, once in a way at least, ventured to pit himself against Clitomachus. And when, as the fight continued, he appeared to be his adversary's match, and once or twice landed a telling blow, there was great clapping of hands, and the crowd became delirious with excitement, cheering on Aristonicus. At this time they say that Clitomachus, after withdrawing for a few moments to recover his breath, turned to the crowd and asked them what they meant by cheering on Aristonicus and backing him up all they could. Did they think he himself was not fighting fairly, or were they not aware that Clitomachus was now fighting for the glory of Greece and Aristonicus for that of King Ptolemy? Would they prefer to see an Egyptian conquer the Greeks and win the Olympian crown, or to hear a Theban and Boeotian proclaimed by the herald as victor in the men's boxing-match? When Clitomachus had spoken thus, they say there was such a change in the sentiment of the crowd that now all was reversed, and Aristonicus was beaten rather by the crowd than by Clitomachus</quote> (tr. Paton, L.C.L.).</note></p>

				<p>At the same time in Boeotia Lucretius the praetor<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> was assaulting Haliartus with the utmost violence; and although the besieged had no reinforcements from outside except the younger men of Coronea, who had entered the walls at the beginning of the siege, and there was no hope of aid, yet they held out alone more by spirit than by strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For they kept making frequent sallies against the siege-works and as the ram was brought up they pressed it to earth, weighing it down now with huge stones,<note>Cf. XXXVIII. v. 4.</note> now with a mass of lead, and if they were at any point unable to turn aside the stroke, they built, in place of the destroyed wall, a new one of slapdash construction by hastily assembling stones from the very debris of the collapse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Since assault by siege-works was too slow, the praetor ordered ladders distributed among the maniples, intending to attack the wall everywhere, as it were in a ring, with the thought that his numbers would suffice the more surely for this purpose because, on the side where the swamp<note>The margin of Lake Copa&iuml;s.</note> girds the city, attack was neither important nor possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the side where two towers and the section of wall which had been between them had collapsed, he himself brought up two thousand picked troops so that at the same moment that he tried to scale the wreckage, as a rally of the townspeople took place to oppose him, the walls stripped of defenders might at some point or other be captured by the ladders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With no slackness the townsfolk <pb id="p.491"/>prepared to ward off his assault. For on the area<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> strewn with wreckage they tossed dry bundles of brush and standing by with blazing torches threatened that they would fire this barrier, so that, barred off from the enemy by the blaze, they might have time to put an inner wall in the way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This preparation of theirs was hindered by chance; for such a rain suddenly poured down that it made the firing of the brush difficult and put out what had been fired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so a passage lay open through the smoking twigs which were dragged aside and with all the citizens intent on the defense of one spot the walls too were taken by ladders in several places at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the first confusion of the city's capture the elders and the beardless whom chance brought in the way were cut down everywhere; the men-at-arms fled to the citadel; and the next day, when no ray of hope remained, on surrendering they were sold at auction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These were, moreover, about twenty-five hundred. The adornments of the city, statues and paintings and whatever costly booty there was, were taken to the fleet; the city was razed to the ground.<note>Strabo IX. 2. 30 notes: <quote>Haliartus no longer exists, having been destroyed in the war with Perseus, and the Athenians have the territory as a gift of the Romans..</quote> This is probably incorrect, as an inscription has been found indicating the existence of a community here subject to Athens.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="64"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things in Boeotia were being <pb id="p.493"/>accomplished, Perseus remained a few days in camp<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> at Sycurium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he heard there that the Romans were hastily bringing in reaped grain from the fields round about, and then, each before his own tent, was clipping the ears with his sickle, so that the grain might be threshed out more cleanly, and that they had made great piles of straw throughout the whole camp, the king thought that this was a time suitable for a conflagration, and ordered torches and pitch-pine
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> and fire-spears of tow smeared with pitch<note>Cf. XXI. viii. 10; XXXVIII. vi. 2.</note> to be prepared, and with this equipment set out at midnight, so as to make a surprise attack at dawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Vainly the first outposts were overwhelmed; by their uproar and panic they roused the rest, and the signal was given to take arms at once; at the same time the soldiery was posted on the rampart and at the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then indeed, in shame at the rash and foolish beginning of an attack on the camp, Perseus at once wheeled his line around and ordered the baggage to go first, then the infantry to move out; he himself with the cavalry and light troops halted to form the rear-guard, thinking that the enemy would, as actually happened, pursue to harass the last units from behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was a short struggle particularly of the light troops against skirmishers; the cavalry and infantry returned without disturbance to camp.</p> 
				<p>After reaping the crops round about, the Romans moved their camp to Crannon, an untouched territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There while they were remaining in camp with a feeling of safety, both because of the distance and the difficulty of the almost waterless road between Sycurium and Crannon, suddenly at dawn on <pb id="p.495"/>commanding hills the king's cavalry with the light troops<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> was sighted and caused a great uproar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They had set out from Sycurium during the middle of the previous day; just before dawn they had left the column of infantry in the nearest plain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Perseus halted a while on the hills, thinking that possibly the Romans might be enticed to a cavalry struggle; after they would not budge, he sent a horseman to order the infantry to return to Sycurium; he presently followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Roman cavalry followed at a moderate distance, so that they might at any point be able to attack scattered or straggling men, but after they saw that the enemy was retreating in a body, keeping to his formations and ranks, they also returned to camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="65"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Sycurium the king, disliking the length of the journey, moved his camp to Mopselus; and the Romans, having reaped the harvests of Crannon, moved to the fields of Phalanna.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the king learned from a deserter that there the Romans were reaping, wandering everywhere through the fields with no armed guard, he set out with a thousand cavalry, and two thousand of the Thracians and Cretans, and since he marched with as great speed as he could attain, in a scattered column, he fell without warning upon the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Wagons with their teams, many of them loaded, were captured to the number of quite a thousand, and about six hundred men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He gave the booty to three hundred Cretans to guard and bring to camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he himself, recalling from the slaughter far and wide the cavalry and the rest of the infantry led them against the nearest guard detachment, thinking that with no great struggle it could be crushed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Pompeius, <pb id="p.497"/>military tribune, was in command; he withdrew<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> the soldiers, who were dismayed by the sudden arrival of the enemy, to a nearby hill, intending to defend himself by the strength of the position since he was no match in numbers and power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There when he had gathered his soldiers in a circle, so that with their close-packed shields they could protect themselves from the blows of arrows and javelins, Perseus, with his men-at-arms surrounding the hill, ordered some to try the ascent from all sides and join battle at close quarters, others to hurl weapons from a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A terrific threat surrounded the Romans, for when massed they could not thrust back those who were struggling up the hill, and whenever they broke ranks by charging forward, they were exposed to javelins and arrows. They suffered particularly from the dart-slings.<note>Cf. Polybius XXVII. 11. Another kind of elaborate sling is described in XXXVIII. xxix. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This was a new kind of weapon, invented in that war. A sharp iron two spans long was set in a wooden shaft of half a cubit, a finger in thickness;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> around this latter three short fir-wood <quote>feathers,</quote> like those usual on arrows, were attached; the sling had in the middle two unequal thongs; when the slinger swung and spun it by the strap with an extra effort, the missile, shaken loose, shot out like a ball.<note>I.e. the usual leaden sling-bullet.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When with this and with every other sort of weapon part of the soldiers had been wounded and it was no longer easy for the weary men to hold up their weapons, the king urged them to surrender, gave them his guaranty, at times offered rewards. But no one's <pb id="p.499"/>mind could be bent to surrender, when in<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> unhopedfor fashion hope dawned upon men who had already determined to die.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For when a few of the foragers, taking refuge in the camp, reported to the consul that the guard was surrounded, he, moved by the danger of so large a number of citizens &mdash;for there were about eight hundred, and all Romans &mdash;with the cavalry and light troops (there were added the new auxiliaries, the Numidian infantry, cavalry and elephants) marched out of camp and instructed the military tribunes that the legionary units were to follow. He himself, adding the light infantry of the legions to strengthen the light-armed auxiliaries, marched ahead to the hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Eumenes, Attalus, and Misagenes, the prince of the Numidians, covered the consul's flanks.<note>interpret this phrase in the military sense, though a similar phrase is used to refer to personal escort, cf. XXXII. xxxix. 8, XL. vi. 4.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="66"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the first standards of their fellows came in sight of the beleaguered, the spirits of the Romans indeed were revived from the depths of despair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Perseus, whose best course of all would have been to be satisfied with his chance success in capturing and killing a certain number of foragers, and not to waste time besieging the guard,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> or, as second best, after trying the latter enterprise too in some fashion, when he became aware that he had no strength on his side, to depart unscathed while he might &mdash;Perseus, puffed up by success, both awaited the approach of the enemy himself and sent men hastily to summon the phalanx;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> this being brought up later than circumstances required and in haste, would have come in confusion from its <pb id="p.501"/>forced march against men in formation and ready.<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> The consul, arriving first, immediately joined battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first the Macedonians stood fast; then, as they were in no respect equally matched, with a loss of three hundred infantry and twenty-four of their finest cavalrymen from the squadron which they call sacred,<note>Cf. above, n. 2, p. 470.</note> among whom also fell Antimachus the squadron commander, they attempted to retreat. However, the march was almost more of a hurly-burly than the battle itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While the phalanx, summoned by an alarmed messenger, was being hastily led up, first meeting the column of prisoners and the wagons laden with grain in some narrows, it was stuck.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thereupon there was great turmoil on both sides, with no one waiting till somehow or other the column should be disentangled, but with the men-at-arms hurling the obstructing wagons down the steep slope &mdash;for the road could not otherwise be cleared &mdash;and the draft-animals, as they were goaded, lashing out at the crowd.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Hardly had they freed themselves from the disorganized column of prisoners when they ran into the king's column and the routed cavalry. Then indeed the shouting of those ordering a retreat also produced an alarm almost like a complete disaster, so that if the enemy, daring to enter the narrows, had pursued farther, a great loss might have been incurred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul, having picked up the guard from the hill and being satisfied with a moderate success, led his troops back to camp. There are those who declare that a great battle was fought on that day, that eight thousand of the enemy <pb id="p.503"/>were killed, among them Sopater and Antipater,<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> officers of the king, that there were taken alive about two thousand and eight hundred, and that twenty-seven military standards were taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor was the victory bloodless, they say; more than four thousand and three hundred of the consul's army fell, and five standards of the left squadron were lost.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="67"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This day both revived the spirits of the Romans and dismayed Perseus, so that after a few days' delay at Mopselus, more especially to attend to the burial of the soldiers who had been lost, having left a sufficiently strong garrison at Gonnus he retreated to Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A certain Timotheus, one of the royal governors, he left with a small force at Phila, with orders to make overtures from near-by to the people of Magnesia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the king arrived at Pella, he sent his army into winter quarters and himself left with Cotys for Thessalonica.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There a report arrived that Autlesbis, a chieftain of the Thracians, and Corragus, Eumenes' governor,<note>Cf. XXXVIII. xiii. 3; Eumenes held Gallipoli and adjacent south-eastern Thrace, cf. XXXIX. xxvii. 5.</note> had made an attack on the territory of Cotys and had captured the district called Maren&ecirc;.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore Perseus thought best to send Cotys back to protect his own, and marked his departure by great gifts. He paid two hundred talents,<note>Since the reckoning is given in Greek money, Livy seems to have followed Polybius here. On the stingines of Perseus, of. below, XLIV. xxvi., Polybius, XXIX. 8, 2-9, 13.</note> a half-year's pay, to the cavalry, although he had planned at first to give a full year's amount.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After the consul heard that Perseus had set out, he moved camp to Gonnus, in case he might be able to take the town. Placed in the entrance to Temp&ecirc; itself, the town offers a very securely closed door to Macedonia and a sally-port to Thessaly favourable <pb id="p.505"/>to the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since both because of its<note type="margin">B.C. 171</note> situation and its strong garrison the city was impregnable, the consul abandoned the undertaking. Having turned aside to Perrhaebia, after capturing Malloea at the first assault and sacking it, and recovering the Tripolis and the rest of Perrhaebia, he returned to Larisa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence having sent Eumenes and Attalus home, he assigned winter quarters in the nearest Thessalian cities to Misagenes and the Numidians, and scattered a portion of his army throughout all Thessaly in such a way that all had comfortable winter quarters and formed a protection for the cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His staff-officer Quintus Mucius<note>Cf. above, n. 1, p. 443.</note> he sent with two thousand to hold Ambracia. All the allies from the Greek states except the Achaeans he dismissed. With a part of his army he set out into Phthiotic Achaea,<note>Cf. above, ch. xlii. 1, lvi. 7.</note> razed to the ground Pteleum, which had been abandoned by the flight of its inhabitants, and received Antronae by voluntary surrender of the inhabitants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then he brought his army up to Larisa. The city was abandoned; the whole population had taken refuge in the citadel; the consul advanced to attack this.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> First of all the Macedonians, the king's garrison, departed in fear; deserted by these, the townsfolk immediately capitulated. Then as the consul debated whether he should first attack Demetrias or take a look at the situation in Boeotia, the Thebans, harassed by the people of Coronea, called him to Boeotia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In answer to their entreaties, since for winter quarters<note>Cf. XXXIII. xxvii. 5.</note> the district was more suitable than Magnesia, he marched into Boeotia.</p>

				<p>The censor Quintus Fulvius Flaccus stripped the
