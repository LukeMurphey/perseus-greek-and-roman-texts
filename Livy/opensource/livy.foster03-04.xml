			<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
				<p>THE Latin text of Vols. II. to IV. (comprising
					Books III.-X.) has been set up, like that of Vol. I.,
					from the latest revisions of the Weissenborn-Mueller
					edition with German notes, except that the <hi rend="italics">Periochae</hi>
					have been reprinted from the text of Rossbach
					(1910). But the spelling is that adopted by Professors Conway and Walters in their critical edition
					of Books I.-V. and Books VI.-X. (Oxford, 1914 and
					1919), which is the source also of most of the rather
					numerous readings which differ from those of the
					Weissenborn-Mueller text, and has furnished besides
					the materials from which the textual notes have
					been drawn up. I have aimed to record every
					instance where the reading printed does not rest on
					the authority of one or more of the good MSS., and
					to indicate the provenience of the emendation. In
					addition to the symbols used by the Oxford editors,
					I have employed <foreign lang="greek">W</foreign> to designate such of the good
					MSS. as are not cited specifically for some other
					reading, and <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> to designate one or more of the late
					MSS. or early printed texts.</p>
				<p>Besides the translations mentioned in the preface
					to Vol. I. (those of Philemon Holland, George
					<pb id="p.viii"/>
					Baker, and Canon Roberts) I have had by me the
					anonymous version printed in London in 1686, in
					folio, <quote>for Awnsham Churchill at the Black Swan
						in Ave-Mary Lane, near Paternoster Row.</quote></p>
				<p>I am also indebted to the following editions of
					parts of Livy: Book III. by P. Thoresby Jones,
					Oxford, 1914; IV. by H. M. Stephenson, Cambridge, 1890; V. by Leonard Whibley, Cambridge,
					1910; V.-VII. by Cluer and Matheson, Oxford,
					1904; VI. by F. H. Marshall, Cambridge, 1908;
					IX. by W. B. Anderson, Cambridge, 1909, and by
					T. Nicklin, Oxford, 1910. The commentaries of
					Weissenborn-Mueller and Luterbacher have, of
					course, been constantly consulted.</p>
				<p>B. O. F.</p>
				<p>In the second impression of this volume a number
					of misprints and one or two errors of translation have
					been corrected. I wish to thank Prof. G. R. Noyes of
					the University of California, and Mr. O. J. S. Satchel
					of the Boys' High School, Kimberley, South Africa,
					for the notes of errata with which they very kindly
					furnished me.</p>

			<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AFTER the capture of Antium, Titus Aemilius and<note type="margin">B.C. 467</note> Quintus Fabius were elected consuls. This was that 467 Fabius who had been the sole survivor of his family destroyed at the Cremera.<note>See 2.1. 11.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In his former consulship Aemilius had already supported the assignment of land to the plebs. Consequently, when he entered a second time upon the office, not only had the agrarians begun to have hopes of a law, but the tribunes, who had often tried to carry the measure against the opposition of the consuls, now took it up in the belief that with the co-operation of a consul it could certainly be made good; and the consul continued of the same mind.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The possessors of the land, comprising a large proportion of the patricians, complained that the head of the state was openly supporting tribunician policies and making himself popular by a generosity exhibited at other men's expense; they thus diverted the resentment awakened by the whole affair from the tribunes to the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A bitter struggle was impending, when Fabius, by a proposal which neither side found injurious, set the <pb id="p.5"/>matter right.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Under the leadership and auspices of<note type="margin">B.C. 467</note> Titus Quinctius, as he pointed out, a considerable territory had been conquered the year before from the Volsci; Antium, a well-situated maritime city, could be made the seat of a colony; in this way the plebs would obtain farms without causing the landholders to complain, and the state would be at harmony.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This suggestion was adopted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As commissioners for distributing the land Fabius appointed Titus Quinctius, Aulus Verginius, and Publius Furius, and it was ordered that those who wished to receive grants should give in their names. There at once appeared the fastidiousness which usually attends abundance, and so few persons enrolled that Volscian colonists were added to fill out the number; the rest of the populace preferred demanding land at Rome to receiving it elsewhere.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Aequi begged Quintus Fabius, who had invaded their country, to grant them peace; and broke it themselves by a sudden raid on Latin territory.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quintus Servilius, being sent against the Aequi<note type="margin">B.C. 466-465</note> in the following year &mdash;when he and Spurius Postumius were consuls &mdash;made a permanent camp in the Latin country, where the army was attacked by a pestilence which deprived it of the power to act.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war dragged on into its third year, the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Titus Quinctius. To Fabius was given the command against the Aequi, without the customary drawing of lots, since he had been victorious over them and had granted them peace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Setting out in the full expectation that the glory of his name would bring the enemy to terms, he sent envoys to their national council and bade them announce that Quintus Fabius the consul said that <pb id="p.7"/>he had brought peace from the Aequi to Rome, and<note type="margin">B.C. 466-465</note> was then bringing war from Rome to the Aequi in the same right hand, now armed, which he had formerly given them in friendship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whose faithlessness and perjury were responsible for this, the gods were even then witnesses, and would presently punish the offenders. Yet however that might be, he would himself prefer that the Aequi should even now freely repent, instead of suffering the penalties of war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If they did so, they could count on a safe refuge in the clemency they had already proved; but if they rejoiced in perjury, it was rather with the angry gods than with their enemies that they would be at war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So far were these words from having the slightest effect on anyone, that the envoys narrowly escaped violation, and an army was dispatched to Algidus against the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the arrival of this news at Rome, the insult, rather than the danger, brought the other consul out from the City. And so two consular armies approached the enemy, drawn up in line of battle, that they might instantly engage them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But since it happened to be near the end of the day, a man called out to them from an outpost of the enemy, <quote>This, Romans, is making a parade of war, not waging it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When night is about to fall, you draw up your battle-line; we need more hours of daylight for the struggle which is close at hand. To-morrow at sunrise form your battle-line again; there will be opportunity for fighting, never fear!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Galled by these words the troops were led back to their camp to await the morrow; the night would be a long one, they felt, that must intervene before the combat. Meanwhile they refreshed themselves with food and <pb id="p.9"/>sleep. When it grew light next morning, the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 466-465</note> army took the field, some time before the enemy. At last the Aequi too came out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The battle raged fiercely on both sides, for the Romans fought with exasperation and hatred, while the Aequi were conscious that the danger in which they were involved was due to their own fault, and this, with their despair of ever being trusted again, incited them to the last degree of daring and exertion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nevertheless they were unable to withstand the attack of the Romans. And yet, when they had been defeated and had fallen back to their own territory, the warlike soldiers, their spirit as little inclined to peace as ever, complained against their generals for having staked the cause on a pitched battle, a species of fighting in which the Romans excelled;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the Aequi, they said, were better at pillaging and raiding, and a number of scattered bands could make war more effectively than the great mass of a single army.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Leaving a garrison, therefore, in their camp, they crossed the Roman border in so headlong an incursion as to carry terror even to the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Moreover, the unexpectedness of the inroad added to the alarm, for nothing could have been apprehended less than that an enemy who was defeated and almost shut up in his camp should be thinking of a raid;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and the country people who in their fright came tumbling in through the gates told not of pillaging nor of small bands of raiders, but, exaggerating everything in their senseless fear, cried out that whole armies of the enemy were close at hand and rushing on the City in a serried column.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The very vagueness of these rumours led to further <pb id="p.11"/>exaggeration as the bystanders passed them on to others.<note type="margin">B.C. 466-465</note> The running and shouting of men as they called <quote>To arms!</quote> was almost like the panic in a captured city. It chanced that the consul Quinctius had returned from Algidus to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This circumstance allayed men's fears, and when the confusion had been stilled, he indignantly reminded them that the enemy they dreaded had been conquered, and posted watches at the gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then convened the senate, and in accordance with a resolution which the Fathers passed, proclaimed a suspension of the courts.<note>The <hi rend="italics">iustitium</hi> also involved the closing of shops and a general suspension of business.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After that he set out to defend the frontier, leaving Quintus Servilius as prefect of the City, but did not meet with the enemy in the field. The other consul campaigned with great success.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Knowing where the enemy would come, he fell upon them when they were weighed down with the booty which incumbered their advancing column, and caused them bitterly to rue their pillaging. But few of them escaped the ambush, and the spoils were all recovered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So the suspension of the courts, which had lasted four days, was lifted on the return of the consul Quinctius to the City.</p> 
			<p>The census was then taken and Quinctius solemnized the concluding purification.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There are said to have been registered 104,714 citizens, besides orphans and widows. In the Aequian country there was no memorable action after that; the people retired to their towns, and permitted their farms to be burnt and ravaged. The consul made a number of forays with his army throughout the enemy's territory, and returned to Rome with great renown and huge spoils.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next consuls were Aulus Postumius<note type="margin">B.C. 404</note> <pb id="p.13"/>Albus and Spurius Furius Fusus. (Some writers<note type="margin">B.C. 464</note> spell the name Fusius instead of Furius, which I note lest anybody should regard as a substitution of one man for another what is really only a matter of names.)<note><hi rend="italics">Fusius</hi> is in fact only an earlier form of <hi rend="italics">furius.</hi> By <date value="-300">300 B.C.</date> intervocalic <hi rend="italics">s</hi> had developed into <hi rend="italics">r.</hi> Livy is puzzled by the same thing in chap. viii.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was no doubt but that one consul would make war on the Aequi, and these accordingly appealed to the Ecetranian Volsci for help. It was eagerly granted them &mdash;such was the rivalry between these nations in inveterate hatred of Rome &mdash;and the most vigorous preparations were made for war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Hernici perceived, and warned the Romans, that Ecetra had gone over to the Aequi. Suspicion already rested on the colony of Antium, on the ground that a large body of men, escaping from the place at the time of its capture, had taken refuge with the Aequi;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and in fact they fought with the greatest spirit all through the Aequian war; afterwards, when the Aequi had been shut up in their towns, this company dispersed, returned to Antium, and won over the colonists, who were even then at heart disloyal to the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The plot was not yet ripe when their proposed defection was reported to the senate, and the consuls were instructed to summon the leaders of the colony to Rome and inquire what was going on.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These men made no objection to coming, but on being introduced into the senate by the consuls returned such answers to the questions they were asked that they were under a stronger suspicion when dismissed than they had been on their arrival.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>War was from that moment regarded as certain. Spurius Furius, one of the consuls, having received that command, set out against the Aequi. In the country of the Hernici he found the enemy engaged <pb id="p.15"/>in marauding, and being ignorant of their strength,<note type="margin">B.C. 464</note> because they had never all been seen together, rashly offered battle with an army which was no match for theirs in numbers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the first attack he was repulsed and withdrew into his camp. Nor did this end his danger, for both that night and the following day his camp was so vigorously hemmed in and assaulted that not even a messenger could be got off to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Hernici reported the defeat and blockade of the consul and his army, striking such terror into the hearts of the senators that they passed a decree which has always been held to signify the direst necessity: that Postumius, the other consul, should be commissioned to see to it that the republic took no hurt.<note>The <hi rend="italics">ultimum senatus consultum</hi> conferred dictatorial powers on the consul, and amounted to declaring a state of martial law.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was deemed wisest that the consul himself should remain in Rome, to enroll all who were capable of bearing arms; and that a proconsul, Titus Quinctius, should be sent, with an army of the allies, to relieve the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In order to fill out this army the Latins and the Hernici and the colony of Antium were commanded to furnish Quinctius with <quote>emergency-men,</quote> as they used then to term hastily-levied auxiliaries.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was much man&oelig;uvring during the days that followed, and many attacks were delivered in one place or another, for the enemy, having a preponderance of numbers, set about harassing the Roman forces in many places, with the expectation that they would prove unequal to all the demands that were made upon them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> at the same time that they were besieging the camp, a part of their army was sent
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to devastate the Roman fields and to attack the City itself, should an opportunity offer.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lucius Valerius was left to defend the City, while the consul <pb id="p.17"/>Postumius was sent out to protect the frontier from<note type="margin">B.C. 464</note> pillage. There was no relaxation anywhere of vigilance or effort; watches were set in the City, outposts were established before the gates, and troops were posted on the walls; and, as was necessary in the midst of such confusion, the courts were suspended for several days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In camp meanwhile the consul Furius, having begun by submitting tamely to the blockade, caught the Aequi off their guard, and made a sortie by the decuman gate.<note>The <hi rend="italics">porta decumana</hi> was normally in the west wall, in these wars usually farthest from the enemy, hence its use in this surprise attack.</note> He might have pursued the enemy, but stopped for fear the camp might be assailed from the opposite quarter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The lieutenant Furius, a brother of the consul, was carried a good way off by his charge, nor did he observe, in the ardour of pursuit, either that his friends were retiring or that the enemy were moving up to attack him in the rear. His retreat was thus cut off, and after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to force his way back to the camp, he perished, fighting bravely.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul too, upon learning that his brother was surrounded, set his face towards the battle and plunged into the midst of the mellay, with more rashness than prudence; for he received a wound, and was barely rescued by the men about him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This misfortune dismayed his own troops and quickened the courage of the enemy, who were so inspirited by the death of the lieutenant and the wounding of the consul that from that moment no force could withstand them, and the Romans were driven into their camp and again besieged, being no match for their opponents either in confidence or strength. The very existence of the army would have been imperilled, had not Titus Quinctius come up with the foreign troops, the Latins and Hernici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <pb id="p.19"/>He found the Aequi intent on the Roman camp, and<note type="margin">B.C. 464</note> truculently displaying the head of the lieutenant. Attacking them in the rear, while the besieged, in answer to a signal he had given them from afar, were making a sally from the camp, he intercepted a large body of them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There was less carnage but a more headlong rout in the case of the Aequi who were in Roman territory. These men were dispersed and collecting booty when they were attacked by Postumius at several points where he had opportunely stationed troops.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The pillagers, fleeing in a disordered crowd, fell in with Quinctius, who was returning from his victory with the wounded consul; whereupon the consular army splendidly avenged the consul's wound and the slaughter of the lieutenant and his cohorts. Heavy losses were inflicted and sustained on both sides at that time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is hard to make a trustworthy statement, in a matter of such antiquity, as to just how many fought and how many fell;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> yet Valerius Antias ventures to specify the totals, saying that the Romans lost five thousand eight hundred in the country of the Hernici; that of the Aequian marauders who were roaming about and pillaging within the Roman borders two thousand four hundred were slain by Aulus Postumius, the consul; and that the rest of the expedition, which stumbled upon Quinctius as they were driving off their booty, got off by no means so lightly, for their killed amounted, so he says, with minute particularity, to four thousand two hundred and thirty.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>When the army had returned to Rome, and the suspension of the courts was ended, the heavens were seen to blaze with numerous fires, and other <pb id="p.21"/>portents either were actually seen or were due to<note type="margin">B.C. 464</note> the illusions of the terror-stricken observers. To avert these alarms a three days' season of prayer was ordered, and during this period all the shrines were crowded with a throng of men and women beseeching the pardon of the gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After that the cohorts of the Latins and the Hernici were thanked by the senate for their energetic service and sent home. A thousand men from Antium who had come too late to help, when the battle was over, were dismissed, almost in disgrace.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The elections were then held, and Lucius<note type="margin">B.C. 463</note> Aebutius and Publius Servilius were chosen consuls. On the first of August, then the beginning of the year, they entered office.<note>The official year began at various times in different periods, until, in <date value="-153">153 B.C.</date>, the 1st of January was adopted.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was the sickly season, and chanced to be a year of pestilence both in the City and in the country, for beasts as well as men; and the people increased the virulence of the disease, in their dread of pillage, by receiving flocks and country-folk into the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This conflux of all kinds of living things distressed the citizens with its strange smells, while the country-people, being packed into narrow quarters, suffered greatly from the heat and want of sleep; and the exchange of ministrations and mere contact spread the infection.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans could scarce endure the calamities which pressed hard upon them, when suddenly envoys from the Hernici appeared, announcing that the Aequi and the Volsci had joined forces and established a camp in their territory, from which base they were devastating their land with an enormous army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Not only did the reduced numbers of the senate show their allies that the nation was prostrated by the pestilence, but they also returned a melancholy answer to <pb id="p.23"/>their suit, that the Hernici, namely, with the help<note type="margin">B.C. 463</note> of the Latins, must defend their own possessions; for the City of Rome, in a sudden visitation of divine displeasure, was being ravaged by disease; if there should come any respite from their suffering, they would help their friends, as they had done the year before and on every other occasion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The allies departed, bearing home, in return for their sad tidings, a reply that was even sadder, since it meant that their people must sustain by themselves a war which they could hardly have sustained with the powerful assistance of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No longer did the enemy confine themselves to the country of the Hernici; they proceeded thence to invade the Roman fields, which had been made desolate even without the violence of war. Encountering no one there, not even an unarmed man, and passing through a country wholly destitute not only of defenders but also of cultivation, they came to the third milestone on the Gabinian Way.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Death had taken Aebutius, the Roman consul; for his colleague Servilius there was little hope, though he still breathed; the disease had attacked most of the leading men, the greater part of the senators, and almost all of military age, so that their numbers were not only insufficient for the expeditions which so alarming a situation called for, but were almost too small for mounting guard.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The watchmen's duty was performed by those of the senators themselves whose years and strength admitted of it; the rounds were made and the watches supervised by the plebeian aediles;<note>The plebeian aedileship had been created at the same time as the plebeian tribuneship, but was not mentioned by Livy at ii. xxxiii. 2.</note> into their hands had passed the supreme control, and the majesty of consular authority.</p> <pb id="p.25"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this helpless plight, without a leader and<note type="margin">B.C. 463</note> without strength, the commonwealth was saved by its tutelary gods and the good fortune of the City, which inspired the Volsci and Aequi with the spirit of plunderers rather than of soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For they were so far from entertaining any hope of approaching, not to speak of capturing, the walls of Rome, and the distant sight of her roofs and beetling hills so damped their ardour, that the entire army began to
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> murmur, and to ask why they should waste their time in desolate and abandoned fields, where bodies of beasts and men lay rotting and there was no booty, when they might be invading an unspoiled country, the land of Tusculum, abounding in wealth; so they suddenly pulled up their standards, and passed by cross-roads through the Labican fields to the hills of Tusculum, and on that point all the impetus and fury of the war converged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Meanwhile the Hernici and Latins, moved not by pity alone but by shame, if they should fail to oppose the common enemy, advancing in force against the City of Rome, and should bring no assistance to their besieged allies, united their armies and proceeded to the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Failing to find the enemy there, but following the report and traces of his march, they met him as he was coming down from the Tusculan valley into that of Alba. There they engaged the invaders on far from equal terms, and their loyalty to their friends was for the moment not attended with success.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In Rome the ravages of the disease were no less fatal than those of the sword had been amongst her allies. The surviving consul died; and death took other famous men, the augurs Marcus Valerius and <pb id="p.27"/>Titus Verginius Rutulus, and the head curio,<note>Each of the thirty wards, or <hi rend="italics">curiae</hi> (an account of their origin is given at I. xiii. 6), had a priest called a <hi rend="italics">curio,</hi> to preside over its religious ceremonies.

				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> as for the base rabble, the violence of the plague stalked at large amongst them; until the senate, finding no help in man, sent the people to the gods in prayer, commanding them to take their wives and children and supplicate Heaven for forgiveness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus summoned by the state's authority to do what each was impelled to by his own distress, they crowded all the shrines. Everywhere were prostrate matrons, sweeping the floors of the temples with their hair, while they besought the angry gods to grant them pardon and end the pestilence.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After that, little by little, whether it was<note type="margin">B.C. 462</note> that the gods had been persuaded to forgive or that the sickly season was now past, those whose disease had run its course began to regain their health; and men's thoughts now turned to the commonwealth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Several interregna had expired, when Publius Valerius Publicola, three days after being made interrex, declared the election to the consulship of Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus and Titus Veturius Geminus &mdash;or Vetusius, if that was his name.<note>See note on chap. iv. &sect; 1.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the 11th of August they took office, the nation being by that time so strong that it was able not only to defend itself, but even to assume the offensive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, when the Hernici reported that the enemy had crossed their borders, they were promptly offered assistance. Two consular armies were enlisted; Veturius was sent to carry the war into the country of the Volsci;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> while Tricipitinus, having been appointed to secure the territory of the allies from inroads, proceeded no further than the land of the Hernici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Veturius in his first battle defeated and routed his opponents; Lucretius, while <pb id="p.29"/>encamped among the Hernici, was eluded by a<note type="margin">B.C. 462</note> company of raiders, who marched over the mountains of Praeneste and thence down into the campagna; there they laid waste the Praenestine and Gabinian fields; and from the latter district turned towards the hills about Tusculum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The City of Rome itself received a great fright, more on account of the surprise than from any lack of resources for defence. Quintus Fabius was in charge of the City. Arming the young men and disposing his defences, he made everything secure and tranquil.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so the enemy, having laid hold of the plunder in their immediate neighbourhood, did not venture to approach Rome, but making a detour, set out towards home. The farther they got from the hostile City the less was their anxiety, till they came unexpectedly upon Lucretius the consul, who having already marked their line of march, had drawn up his troops and was eager to fight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The spirits of the Romans were therefore prepared for their task, while the enemy were stricken with a sudden panic on being attacked, though by somewhat inferior numbers. The Romans completely routed the great multitude, and driving them into deep valleys, from which escape was difficult, surrounded them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There the Volscian name was almost blotted out. Thirteen thousand four hundred and seventy fell in the battle and the flight, seventeen hundred and fifty were taken alive, and twenty-seven military standards were brought in, as I find recorded in certain annals; and though there may be some exaggeration of the numbers, it was beyond question a great slaughter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The victorious consul, in possession of enormous spoils, returned to the permanent camp he had <pb id="p.31"/>occupied before. Then the consuls encamped<note type="margin">B.C. 462.</note> together, and the Volsci and Aequi united their shattered forces. The ensuing battle was the third of that year. Fortune bestowed the victory where she had done before; the enemy were routed, and even lost their camp.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rome was thus restored to her former condition, and the success of the campaign at once occasioned disturbances in the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gaius Terentilius Harsa was tribune of the plebs that year. Thinking that the absence of the consuls afforded the tribunes an opportunity for action, he employed some days in complaining to the people of the pride of the patricians, and inveighed especially against the authority of the consuls, as a thing excessive and intolerable in a free state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For it was only in name, he said, that it was less hateful than that of a king;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> in reality it was almost crueler, since in place of one master they had now got two, who possessed an unregulated and unlimited power, and while free themselves and without restraint, brought to bear all the terrors of the law and all its punishments upon the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That they might not for ever have this licence, he was about to propose a law providing for the appointment of five men to write out the statutes pertaining to the consular power;<note>Terentilius probably aimed at restricting the power of the patricians by a codification of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the laws, not merely those, as Livy seems to think, which limited the authority of the consuls. The Fasti refer to the similar board actually created ten years later, as <hi rend="italics">decemviri consulari imperio legibus scribundis</hi> (<quote>decemvirs with consular authority for writing the laws</quote>), and Livy has perhaps misunderstood some such phrase in the annalist he was here following.</note> such authority over them as the people had granted the consuls they should enjoy, but they should not make a law of their own whims and caprices.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When this measure had been promulgated, the Fathers were alarmed lest they might be humbled, in the absence of the consuls; the prefect of the City, Quintus Fabius, convened the senate, and attacked the measure and its author himself with <pb id="p.33"/>such bitterness that if both the consuls had been<note type="margin">B.C. 462</note> present to outface the tribune there was nothing they could have added to his threats and denunciations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Terentilius, he said, had laid an ambush and watching his opportunity had attacked the state. If the angry gods had given them a tribune like him the year before, when they were suffering from war and disease, it would have been impossible to save the situation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finding both consuls dead, the citizens plague-stricken, and confusion everywhere, he would have proposed a law to do away with consular government, and would have led the Volsci and the Aequi to besiege the City. Pray what did he desire?
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Was he not at liberty, if the consuls had committed any act of pride or cruelty against a citizen, to call them into court and accuse them where the judges would be the very men against one of whom the injury had been done?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was not the authority of the consul but the power of the tribune that he was making hateful and intolerable; this power had been reconciled and brought into harmony with the senate, but was now being degraded again to its former evil state. Yet he would not supplicate Terentilius to abandon the course on which he had embarked.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>It is you other tribunes,</quote> he cried, <quote>whom we beg to reflect, as a matter of the last importance, that your power was obtained for the purpose of assisting individuals, not for the destruction of us all; that you were elected tribunes of the plebs, not enemies of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To us it is a source of sorrow, to you of odium, that the state should be attacked in the absence of its defenders. You will be diminishing, not your authority, but your unpopularity, if you plead with your colleague <pb id="p.35"/>to postpone the question, as it stands, until the<note type="margin">B.C. 462</note> arrival of the consuls. Even the Aequi and the Volsci, when disease last year had carried off the consuls, refrained from pressing a cruel and pitiless war against us.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The tribunes pleaded with Terentilius, and the measure having been ostensibly postponed, but in reality killed, the consuls were immediately summoned.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucretius returned with vast spoils and far<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> greater glory; and this he increased, on his arrival, by exposing all the booty in the Campus Martius, where it lay for three days, that every man might identify and carry off what belonged to him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The other things, for which no owner appeared, were sold. That the consul had earned a triumph all agreed; but the matter was put off, for the tribune was urging his law, and this was a question of more importance in the eyes of Lucretius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The measure was debated several days, not only in the senate but before the people. Finally the tribune gave way to the majesty of the consul and desisted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The general and his army then received their meed of honour; Lucretius triumphed over the Volsci and the Aequi, and his own legions followed the triumphal chariot. The other consul was permitted to enter the City in an ovation,<note>The ovation was a lesser triumph, granted for a comparatively easy or bloodless victory.</note> without soldiers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the following year the Terentilian law was brought up again by the entire college and menaced the new consuls, to wit, Publius Volumnius and Servius Sulpicius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This year the heavens were seen to blaze, and the earth was shaken with a prodigious quake. That a cow had spoken &mdash;a thing which had found no credence the year before &mdash;was now believed. Among other portents there was even a rain of flesh, <pb id="p.37"/>which is said to have been intercepted by vast numbers<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> of birds flying round in the midst of it; what fell to the ground lay scattered about for several days, but without making any stench.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The two commissioners for sacred rites consulted the Sibylline Books, where it was predicted that there was danger to come from a concourse of foreigners, lest they attack the highest places of the City, and blood be shed; amongst other things was a warning to avoid factions. The tribunes charged them with trying to hinder their law, and a violent struggle was impending; when lo!
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;that the same cycle of events might recur each year &mdash;the Hernici announced that the Volsci and the Aequi, despite the losses they had sustained, were again fitting out their armies; that Antium was the centre of the enterprise; that at Ecetra Antian colonists were holding public meetings; and that the Antiates were the head and sinews of the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After listening to this report, the senate decreed a levy, and directed the consuls to divide between them the direction of the war, so that one might operate against the Volsci, the other against the Aequi.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The tribunes openly and loudly protested in the Forum that the Volscian war was a prearranged farce, and that the nobles had employed the Hernici to act a part in it: they no longer used manhood even, to suppress the liberty of the Roman People, but cajoled and tricked them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Inasmuch as the almost total destruction of the Volsci and Aequi made it incredible that they should be going to war on their own initiative, new enemies were trumped up, and a loyal and neighbouring colony was traduced.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was against the innocent Antiates that war was being declared; it was being <pb id="p.39"/>waged against the Roman plebeians, whom the<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> consuls would load with arms and lead out of the City in hot haste, exiling and banishing citizens to avenge themselves upon the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By these means &mdash;and they need not think that anything else had been intended &mdash;the law was already defeated, unless, while the situation was still intact, while they were at home, while they still wore the toga, they should guard themselves against expulsion from the City and submitting to the yoke.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> If they proved courageous, help would not be wanting; the tribunes were all of one mind. There was no fear of foreign foes, no danger; the gods had seen to it the previous year that they might defend their liberties in safety. To this purport the tribunes.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the consuls, on the other hand, had placed their chairs in full sight of the tribunes, and began to hold the levy. The tribunes hastened to the place, drawing the people after them. A few were cited, as if by way of a test, and immediately a riot began.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As often as a lictor arrested a man on the consul's order, a tribune would command that he be released; in every case it was not a man's right that determined his conduct, but the confidence he had in his strength; and one had to make good by force what one meant to do.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Precisely as the tribunes had borne themselves in preventing the levy, so did the senators in blocking the law, which was brought forward every day the comitia could be held.<note>There was required to be an interval of twenty-four days (<hi rend="italics">trinum nundinum</hi>) between meetings of the comitia.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The quarrel broke out when the tribunes had ordered the people to separate,<note>For the purpose of forming by centuries, in order to vote.</note> since the patricians would not permit themselves to be removed. And yet the older nobles for the most part took no share in an affair which was not to be <pb id="p.41"/>guided by wisdom, but had been committed to<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> rashness and impudence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To a considerable extent the consuls too kept aloof, lest they should expose their dignity to some affront in the general confusion.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>There was a young man, Caeso Quinctius, emboldened not only by his noble birth but also by his great stature and physical strength; and to these gifts of the gods he had himself added many honours in the field, and also forensic eloquence, so that no citizen was held to be readier, whether with tongue or with hand.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this man had taken his place in the midst of the band of senators, towering above his fellows as though wielding all the might of dictators and consuls in his voice and strength of body, he would sustain unaided the attacks of the tribunes and the fury of the rabble.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> His leadership often drove the tribunes from the Forum and ignominiously routed the plebeians; the man who crossed his path came off bruised and stripped; so that it was clear that if things were allowed to go on in this way the law was beaten.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Finally, when the other tribunes had already been pretty well cowed, one of their college named Aulus Verginius summoned Caeso to stand trial on a capital charge.<note>A capital charge if proven carried with it loss of <hi rend="italics">caput, i.e.</hi> <quote>the full legal status of a Roman citizen.</quote> (See Greenidge, <hi rend="italics">Roman Public Life,</hi> p. 31.) From chap. xii. &sect; 6, it appears that a sentence of banishment rather than death was anticipated in the present instance.</note> The man's fierce nature was rather aroused by this than terrified; and he continued all the more bitterly to resist the law, to harry the plebs, and to assail the tribunes as if in actual warfare.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The accuser permitted the defendant to storm, and to fan the flames of popular resentment, while furnishing fresh materials for the charges which he intended to bring against him; meanwhile he continued to urge the law, not so much from any hope of carrying it as to provoke Caeso to <pb id="p.43"/>recklessness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In these circumstances it was Caeso alone,<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> as being a suspected character, who got all the blame for many a rash word and act which proceeded from the young aristocrats.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nevertheless the law continued to meet resistance. And Aulus Verginius kept saying to the plebeians: <quote>I suppose you see now, Quirites, that you cannot at the same time have Caeso for a fellow-citizen and obtain the law you desire?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And yet why do I say <hi rend="italics">law</hi> It is <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi> he is thwarting; in all the Tarquinian house was no such arrogance. Wait till this man becomes consul or dictator, whom you see lording it over us while a private citizen, by virtue of his strength and impudence!</quote> There were many who agreed with him; they complained of the beatings they had received, and freely urged the tribune to see the business through.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The day of the trial now drew near, and it was clearly the general opinion that liberty depended on Caeso's condemnation. Then at last he was obliged, though greatly disdaining such a course, to sue for the support of individuals.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was accompanied by his friends, the chief men of the state. Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, who had thrice been consul, rehearsed the many honours which had come to
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> himself and his family, and declared that neither in the Quinctian clan nor in the Roman state had there ever been such native qualities, so early ripening into manly worth; Caeso had been his best soldier, and had often fought under his own eyes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Spurius Furius testified that Caeso had been sent to him by Quinctius Capitolinus, and had come to his aid when he was in a dangerous plight; that there was no single person whose services he considered to <pb id="p.45"/>have been more effectual in saving the day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> Lucretius, the consul of the year before, in the splendour of his new-won renown, shared his glory with Caeso, told of the young man's combats, and recounted his wonderful exploits on raids or in the field of battle;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he earnestly advised the people to prefer that a distinguished youth, endowed with every advantage of nature and of fortune, and sure to be an important factor in the affairs of any state which he might join, should rather be their own than the citizen of another nation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those qualities in him which gave offence, impetuosity and rashness, were diminishing each day, as he grew older: that in which he was deficient, namely prudence, was daily increasing. They should suffer a man of his greatnesshis worth maturing as he outlived his faults &mdash; to grow old in the possession of his citizenship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The young man's father, Lucius Quinctius, surnamed Cincinnatus, was among his advocates. He did not dwell on Caeso's praises, lest he should add to his unpopularity; but, craving indulgence for his errors and his youth, he begged them to acquit the son as a favour to the father, who had offended no man either in word or deed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But some turned away from the petitioner, through either embarrassment or fear; while others complained of the injuries which Caeso had inflicted on themselves or their friends, and showed by their harsh replies how they meant to vote.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was one charge, besides the general dislike of him, which bore hard upon the accused.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcus Volscius Fictor, who had been a tribune of the plebs a few years before, had certified that shortly after the epidemic had been in the City he <pb id="p.47"/>had fallen in with a band of young men swaggering<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> through the Subura.<note>A populous street lying in the hollow between the Quirinal and the Viminal on the one hand, and the Esquiline on the other.</note> There a brawl had arisen, and his elder brother, who had not yet fully recovered from the disease, had been felled by a blow from Caeso's fist; he had been picked up halfalive and carried home, and his death, Volscius considered, had resulted from this hurt; yet under the consuls of previous years he had been unable to avenge that wicked crime.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As Volscius shouted out this story, men became so excited that Caeso had nearly perished by the fury of the people. Verginius gave orders to seize the fellow and throw him into prison.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The patricians resisted force with force. Titus Quinctius cried out that a man who had been charged with a capital crime and whose day of trial was at hand ought not to suffer violence, uncondemned and unheard. The tribune answered that he did not propose to punish him uncondemned, but that he should keep him in prison notwithstanding, till the day of trial, that the Roman People might have it in their power to punish a homicide.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The other tribunes, on being appealed to,<note>The tribunes had been created to protect plebeians against the oppression of the nobles, but there were several other occasions when patricians did not disdain to avail themselves of their help. See II. lvi. 5; ix. xxvi. 16.</note> asserted by a compromise their prerogative of protection:
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they forbade the imprisonment of the accused, but declared it to be their pleasure that he be produced for trial, and that money be pledged to the people in the event of a failure to produce him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> How great a sum was proper to be guaranteed was a doubtful point; it was referred to the senate, and Caeso was detained in custody till the Fathers could be consulted. They voted that sureties should be furnished, and fixed the responsibility of one surety at 3,000 asses; how many sureties should be given they left the tribunes to determine.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They decided <pb id="p.49"/>on ten, and with this number of sureties the<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> accuser admitted the accused to bail. Caeso was the first that ever gave sureties to the people. Being allowed to leave the Forum, he departed that night and went into exile amongst the Etruscans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the day of trial, when it was pleaded that he had gone into voluntary exile, Verginius nevertheless attempted to hold the comitia, but an appeal was taken to his colleagues, who dismissed the assembly.<note>Verginius wished to try Caeso <hi rend="italics">in absentia,</hi> but his colleagues, by adjourning the meeting, acquiesced in the view that a defendant had the right to avoid conviction by going into voluntary exile. In similar cases the tribes subsequently passed a resolution the effect of which was to give to this voluntary exile the binding force of a legal sentence (xxv. iv. 9; xxvi. iii. 12).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The money was exacted from Caeso's father without pity, so that he was obliged to sell all that he had and live for some time on the other side of the Tiber,<note>The <hi rend="italics">Trastevere</hi> was not incorporated in the City till Augustus made of it his fourteenth region.</note> like one banished, in a certain lonely hovel.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This trial and the promulgation of the law<note>The Terentilian Law. See chap. ix.</note> kept the citizens in a turmoil: from foreign wars there was a respite.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The tribunes, assuming that the rebuff sustained by the patricians in Caeso's exile had given themselves the victory, believed the law to be as good as passed; and so far as the older senators were concerned, they had indeed relinquished their grasp upon the government;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but the juniors, especially those who had been of Caeso's fellowship, grew more bitter against the plebs, and their courage ran as high as ever. Yet they greatly promoted their cause by tempering their fury with a kind of moderation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the first attempt after Caeso's exile to pass the law, they were organized and ready, and fell upon the tribunes with a great army of clients, as soon as the tribunes gave them an excuse by attempting to remove them; in such wise that no single patrician came off with any <pb id="p.51"/>conspicuous share of glory or unpopularity, and the<note type="margin">B.C. 461</note> plebeians complained that a thousand Caesos had sprung up in the place of one.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the intervening days on which the tribunes took no action about the law, nothing could have been more peaceable or quiet than these same youths. They would salute plebeians courteously, converse with them, invite them to their houses, assist them in the courts, and permit the tribunes themselves to hold their other assemblies without interruption. They never displayed arrogance towards any one, either openly or in private, except when the law came up; at other times they were democratic.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By avoiding so much as an offensive word, to say nothing of any sort of violence, they managed little by little, with gentleness and tact, to disarm the hostility of the plebs. By such arts the law was evaded for an entire year. And yet not only did the tribunes carry through their other measures without opposition, but they were even re-elected for the following twelvemonth.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The state was less distracted when the<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> consuls Gaius Claudius, the son of Appius, and Publius Valerius Publicola assumed control. No new difficulty had come in with the new year;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> anxiety to pass the law on the one side, and on the other the dread of having to accept it, occupied the thoughts of the citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The more the younger patricians tried to ingratiate themselves with the plebs, the more sharply were they opposed by the tribunes, who endeavoured by bringing charges against their adversaries to make the plebeians suspect them: A conspiracy had been formed; Caeso was in Rome; plans had been laid to kill the <pb id="p.53"/>tribunes and massacre the plebs; the elder patricians<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> had intrusted the younger men with the task of abolishing the tribunician power from the commonwealth, that the state might have the same aspect it had worn before the occupation of the Sacred Mount.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Also men feared the Volsci and Aequi, whose attack was by this time almost a regular and stated custom of annual recurrence; and a new and unexpected danger sprang up nearer home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Exiles<note>Livy implies that Coriolanus and Caeeo were not the only citizens who had been compelled to leave Rome during the quarrels between senate and plebs.</note> and slaves to the number of twenty-five hundred, led by Appius Herdonius, the Sabine, came by night and seized the Capitol and the Citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They at once put to the sword those in the Citadel who refused to conspire and take up arms with them. Some escaped in the confusion and ran down terror-stricken into the Forum. Alternating cries were heard, <quote>To arms!</quote>and <quote>The enemy is in the City!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls were afraid either to arm the plebs or to leave them unarmed, not knowing whence this sudden attack upon the City had come, whether from without or from within, from the hatred of the plebs or the treachery of slaves. They tried to still the uproar, and sometimes by their efforts made it the greater; for the trembling, panic-stricken multitude could not be controlled by authority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless they gave out arms, not to everybody, but only so far as to insure, in the uncertainty regarding their foe, that there should be a fairly dependable defence for any emergency. Filled with concern, and wondering who their enemy was and what his numbers, they employed the rest of the night in disposing pickets at suitable points throughout the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then came daylight and disclosed the nature of the war and its <pb id="p.55"/>leader. From the Capitol Herdonius was calling the<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> slaves to freedom; he had undertaken, he said, the cause of all the wretched, that he might bring back to their native land the exiles who had been wrongfully expelled, and release the slaves from their heavy yoke; he had rather this were done with the approval of the Roman people: if there were no hope in that quarter, he would call in the Volsci and the Aequi and leave no desperate measure unattempted.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The situation became clearer to the senators and the consuls. Still, besides the dangers with which they were publicly threatened, they were afraid that this might be a ruse of the Veientes or the Sabines, and that while there were so many enemies within the City, Sabine and Etruscan levies might presently combine for an invasion;<note>Caeso had taken refuge with the Etruscans (chap. xiii. &sect; 8)</note>

				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Men's fears were many and various; above all the rest stood out their dread of the slaves. Everybody suspected that he had an enemy in his own household, whom it was safe neither to trust, nor, from want of confidence, to refuse to trust, lest his hostility should be intensified; and it seemed hardly possible that even co-operation between the classes should arrest the danger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So greatly did other evils overtop and threaten to engulf them that no one feared the tribunes or the plebeians; that seemed a milder mischief, and springing up, as it always did, when other troubles were quieted, appeared now to have been lulled to sleep by the foreign peril.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But in fact it bore down almost <pb id="p.57"/>more heavily than anything else upon their sinking<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> fortunes. For so frenzied were the tribunes that they asserted it was no war which had taken possession of the Capitol, but an idle mimicry of war, got up to divert the minds of the plebeians from thinking about the law; the patricians' friends and retainers would depart, when the passing of the law showed them how useless had been their insurrection, even more silently than they had come.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They then convened an assembly to carry the measure through, having called the people away from their service as soldiers. Meantime the consuls were holding a meeting of the senate, where more fear of the tribunes was manifested than the night-attack of the enemy had caused.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since the tribunes forbade them to arm against Appius Herdonius, let them order an attack on Publius Valerius the consul; he would not fear to deal with tribunes as the founder of his family<note>Publius Valerius, son of Volesus (I.

				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was evident that there would soon be an appeal to force, and that the enemy would be afforded the spectacle of mutiny among the Romans. 'Yet it was equally impossible for the law to be carried and for the consul to go up into the Capitol.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Night put an end to the struggle. The tribunes retired as darkness fell, fearing the armed strength <pb id="p.61"/>of the consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the instigators of insurrection<note type="margin">B.C. 46</note> were once out of the way, the Fathers went about among the plebs, and mingling with the different groups, talked to them in a strain adapted to the crisis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They warned them to have a care into what straits they brought the nation: It was not between patricians and plebeians that the conflict lay; patricians and plebeians alike, the Citadel of the City, the temples of the gods, and the guardian deities of the state and of private citizens, were being surrendered to enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Such were the means employed in the Forum to allay dissension. Meanwhile the consuls, lest Sabine or Veientine enemies might be afoot, had set out to make the round of the gates and walls.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That same night Tusculum received tidings of the capture of the Citadel, the seizure of the Capitol, and the general disorder in the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Mamilius was then dictator at Tusculum. He at once convoked the senate; and having introduced the messengers, expressed an earnest conviction that they ought not to wait till ambassadors should come from Rome requesting help;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> her perilous and critical situation spoke for itself &mdash;the gods of their alliance and the obligations of their treaty called on them to act. Heaven would never bestow on them an equal opportunity to earn the gratitude of so powerful and so near a state, by doing it a service.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate resolved to help. The young men were enrolled, and arms were issued. As they marched towards Rome in the early dawn, the Tusculans, who were seen a long way off, were taken for enemies; it looked like an invasion of the Aequi or the Volsci.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the alarm proved groundless, they were <pb id="p.63"/>received into the City, and marched in column down<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> into the Forum. There they found Publius Valerius, who had left his colleague to protect the gates and was marshalling his army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The personal influence of the man had prevailed. He had assured the people that when the Capitol should be won back and peace restored in the City, if they would permit him to point out to them the mischief which lurked in the law the tribunes were proposing, he would remember his forefathers and the surname with which he had, as it were, inherited from those forefathers the charge of caring for the people, nor would he interfere with the council of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Following him as their leader, despite the idle efforts of the tribunes to restrain them, they advanced up the Clivus Capitolinus, accompanied by the troops from Tusculum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was a contest between the allies and the citizens, which should obtain the honour of recovering the Citadel. The leader of each party urged on his followers. The enemy now began to quake with fear, having no great confidence in anything but their position. As they stood there quaking, the Romans and their allies assailed them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They had already burst into the vestibule of the temple, when Publius Valerius was killed, as he was directing the attack in the van. Publius Volumnius, a former consul, saw him fall. Charging his men to cover up the body, he threw himself into the consul's place. In the ardour and enthusiasm of the soldiers so important an event passed unnoticed; and they had won the victory before they realized that they were fighting without their leader.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Many of the exiles stained the temples with their blood; many were taken alive; Herdonius was slain. Thus the Capitol <pb id="p.65"/>was regained. The captives, according as they were<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> free or slave, paid the penalty appropriate in each case to their condition; the Tusculans were thanked; the Capitol was purged and ceremonially purified.

			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When peace had been established, the tribunes began to urge the patricians to fulfil the promise made by Publius Valerius; and to urge Gaius Claudius to absolve the manes of his colleague from deceit, and allow the law to be discussed. The consul refused to permit discussion of the law, until he should have accomplished the election of a colleague.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These disputes continued up to the time when the comitia met to fill the vacant consulate. In December, thanks to extraordinary zeal on the part of the patricians, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, Caeso's father, was declared consul, to enter upon the office at once.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The plebs were filled with dismay at the prospect of a consul incensed against themselves and strong in the favour of the senate, his own worth, and his three sons, none of whom was inferior to Caeso in courage, while they surpassed him in using wisdom and restraint when the need arose.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Cincinnatus, having taken up the magistracy, harangued the people incessantly from the tribunal; yet was no more vehement in repressing the plebs than in castigating the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was owing, he declared, to the apathy of that order that the tribunes of the plebs, whose tenure was now become permanent, exercised such a tyranny of speech and accusation as might be expected in a disordered household, but not in the public affairs of the Roman <pb id="p.67"/>People. With his son Caeso, manhood,<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> steadfastness, and all the qualities which honour youth in war and in civil life had been driven from Rome and put to rout.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Garrulous, seditious, sowers of discord, obtaining office &mdash;by the most wicked practices &mdash;for a second and even a third term, the tribunes led as lawless a life as kings. <quote>Did Aulus Verginius,</quote> he cried, <quote>because he was not in the Capitol, deserve less punishment than Appius Herdonius? Nay, somewhat more, if one were disposed to be fair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Herdonius had one thing to his credit: by professing himself an enemy, he as good as warned you to arm; the other, denying the existence of a war, took away your arms and exposed you unprotected to your slaves and exiles. And did you &mdash;without offence to Gaius Claudius and the dead Publius Valerius be it said, &mdash;did you carry your standards against the Capitoline Hill before clearing these enemies out of the Forum? I am ashamed in the sight of gods and men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When foes were in the Citadel, foes in the Capitol, when the captain of slaves and exiles, profaning everything, was quartered in the very shrine of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, it was Tusculum &mdash;not Rome &mdash;where the first sword was drawn. It was a question whether Lucius Mamilius, the Tusculan general, or Publius Valerius and Gaius Claudius, the consuls, would free the Roman Citadel; and we who until then did not allow the Latins to touch their weapons, even in their own defence, though they had an enemy within their borders, had now, unless the Latins had armed of their own free will, been taken captive and destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Is this, tribunes, what you mean by helping the plebs, &mdash;to deliver them over unarmed to be slaughtered by the enemy? Why, <pb id="p.69"/>if the humblest man belonging to your plebs, a part<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> of the people which you have sundered, as it were, from the rest and made a country of your own and a state apart, &mdash;if
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> one of these, I say, had announced that his slaves had armed and seized his house, you would have thought yourselves bound to help him; was Jupiter Optimus Maximus, beset by the swords of exiles and slaves, too mean to merit any man's assistance?
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And do these tribunes demand that they be held sacred and inviolable, in whose eyes the very gods are neither the one nor the other? So! Weighed down with crimes against gods and men you assert that you will carry through your law this year! Then, by Heaven, it was an evil day for the nation when I was chosen consul, far more evil than when Publius Valerius the consul fell, &mdash;if indeed you carry it!
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> First of all then, Quirites,</quote> he concluded, <quote>I and my colleague are resolved to lead the legions against the Volsci and the Aequi. We are somehow fated to enjoy the favour of the gods in larger measure when warring than when at peace. How dangerous these peoples would have been, had they known that the Capitol was seized by exiles, we may more profitably conjecture from the past than ascertain by trying it.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul's speech had moved the plebs, and the senators took courage, believing that the state was on its feet again. The other consul, more spirited in co-operation than invention, had been quite willing that his colleague should take the lead in initiating such weighty measures; but in carrying them out he claimed for himself a share of the duties of the consulship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then the tribunes, jeering at what they termed the idle words of <pb id="p.71"/>Cincinnatus, proceeded to inquire how the consuls were<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> going to lead out an army, when no one would permit them to hold a levy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>But we have no need of a levy,</quote> said Quinctius, <quote>for when Publius Valerius gave arms to the people for the recovery of the Capitol, they all made oath that they would assemble at the bidding of the consul and not depart without his order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> We therefore command that all you who took the oath report to-morrow, armed, at Lake Regillus.</quote> Whereupon the tribunes, seeking to release the people from their obligation, resorted to a quibble: Quinctius had been a private citizen at the time when they bound themselves by the oath.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But there had not yet come about that contempt for the gods which possesses the present generation; nor did everybody seek to construe oaths and laws to suit himself, but rather shaped his own practices by them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly the tribunes, as there was no prospect of thwarting the design, concerned themselves with retarding the departure; the more so since a story was about that the augurs had been commanded to present themselves at Lake Regillus, there to inaugurate a place where the auspices could be taken and matters brought before the people, to the end that whatever had been enacted at Rome &mdash;thanks
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to the violence of the tribunes &mdash;might there be repealed by the comitia; everybody, they said, would vote as the consuls wished; for there was no appeal when one was more than a mile from the City, and the tribunes, if they should come there, would be subjected, amongst the rank and file of the citizens, to the consular authority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These were terrifying rumours, but far the greatest terror that preyed <pb id="p.73"/>upon their spirits was this, that Quinctius repeatedly<note type="margin">B.C. 460</note> declared that he would hold no consular election; the disease of the commonwealth was not one that could be cured by ordinary remedies; the nation needed a dictator, that whoever went about to disturb the state might learn that the dictatorship knew no appeal.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate was in the Capitol. Thither came the tribunes with the troubled plebs. The multitude loudly besought protection, now of the consuls, now of the senators. Yet they could not move the consul from his purpose, until the tribunes had promised that they would submit to the authority of the Fathers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul then brought up the demands of the tribunes and the plebs, and the senate resolved that neither should the tribunes proceed with the law that year, nor the consuls lead the army out of the City; that as regarded the future, it was the sense of the senate that for magistrates to succeed themselves and for the same tribunes to be re-elected was contrary to the general welfare.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls acquiesced in the authority of the Fathers; the tribunes, in spite of the protests of the consuls, were returned to office. Then the patricians also, that they might yield in no respect to the plebs, would themselves have re-elected Lucius Quinctius consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At no time during the entire year did the consul express himself with greater vehemence. <quote>Can I wonder,</quote> he cried, <quote>if your influence with the people, Conscript Fathers, is unavailing?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> You yourselves impair it, when, because the people have disregarded the senate's resolution regarding successive terms, you desire to disregard it yourselves, that you may not lag behind <pb id="p.75"/>the multitude in rashness; as if to be more<note type="margin">B.C.430</note> inconstant and more lawless were to possess more power in the state. For surely it is more fickle and light-minded to nullify one's own decrees and resolutions, than those of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Pattern yourselves, Conscript Fathers, after the thoughtless crowd; and do you, who ought to set others an example, err rather by the example of those others, than permit them to follow yours and do right. But I, with your leave, will not imitate the tribunes, nor suffer myself to be named consul against the senate's resolution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As for you, Gaius Claudius, I urge that you too restrain the Roman People from this lawlessness; and for my own part be assured I shall not feel that your action has stood in the way of my election, but that my renown has gained by my refusal of the office, and that the odium which threatened me from its continuation has been removed.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They then united in an edict that no one should vote for Lucius Quinctius for consul; if any man should do so they would disregard his vote.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls elected were Quintus Fabius<note type="margin">B.C. 459</note> Vibulanus (for the third time) and Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis. The census was taken that year, but there were scruples against performing the lustral sacrifice, on account of the seizure of the Capitol and the slaying of the consul.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The consulship of Quintus Fabius and Lucius Cornelius was a stormy one from the very beginning of the year. The tribunes egged on the plebs; the Latins and the Hernici reported that a great attack was being launched by the Volsci and the Aequi, and that Volscian levies were already at Antium. There was much apprehension too lest the colony <pb id="p.77"/>itself should revolt; and the tribunes were hardly<note type="margin">B.C. 459</note> prevailed upon to allow the war to have precedence.<note><hi rend="italics">i e.</hi> over their law.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the consuls divided the commands, appointing Fabius to take the legions to Antium, and Cornelius to defend Rome, lest some part of the enemy, in accordance with the Aequian custom, should make a foray.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Hernici and the Latins were bidden to furnish soldiers, as by treaty bound; two-thirds of the army were allies, one-third citizens. When the allies had reported on the appointed day, the consul encamped outside the Porta Capena. Thence, after purifying the army, he set out for Antium, and took up a position at no great distance from the town and the standing camp of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There the Volsci, not daring to give battle &mdash;for the Aequian army had not yet come up &mdash;sought to protect themselves, without fighting, behind their rampart. The next day Fabius, instead of mingling allies and citizens in one line of battle, drew up the three nations in three separate armies, about the enemy's works, taking the centre himself with the Roman legions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then commanded them all to wait for the signal, that the allies might act with the citizens in beginning the fight, and in retreating, if he should sound the recall. He also stationed the cavalry belonging to each division behind its first line.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Advancing thus in three sections he surrounded the camp, and attacking sharply on every side, dislodged the Volsci, who were unable to sustain his charge, from their intrenchments. Passing over these, he drove the frightened rabble before him in one direction and cleared the camp of them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As they dispersed in flight, the cavalry, who had found it difficult to surmount the rampart and had hitherto been mere <pb id="p.79"/>spectators of the battle, having now a clear field<note type="margin">B.C. 459</note> before them played their part in the victory by cutting off the fugitives.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Great was the slaughter inflicted on the enemy as they attempted to escape, both in the camp and outside the works; but the booty was still greater, since they had barely been able to carry away their arms. If the forests had not covered the flight, their army would have been utterly destroyed.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this battle was being fought near Antium, the Aequi had sent forward the flower of their troops, and by a surprise attack at night, had captured the Tusculan citadel. The rest of their army they stationed at a short distance from the walls of the town, in order to induce the enemy to extend his forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The news of these events being speedily carried to Rome and thence to the camp at Antium, had the same effect upon the Romans as if it had been announced that the Capitol was taken, &mdash; so fresh in their recollection was the service done them by the Tusculans, and so strongly did the similarity of the risk which their allies now ran seem to call for repayment of the assistance they had given.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Letting everything else go, Fabius quickly conveyed the plunder of the camp to Antium, and leaving there a moderate garrison, hastened by forced marches to Tusculum. The soldiers were allowed to take nothing but their arms and such bread as happened to be at hand;<note>The soldiers ordinarily carried a ration of corn.</note> supplies were sent them from Rome by the consul Cornelius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The fighting at Tusculum lasted for some months. With a part of his army the consul laid siege to the camp of the Aequi; a part he had given to the Tusculans to use in recovering the citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The place could <pb id="p.81"/>never be entered by assault; but the enemy were<note type="margin">B.C. 459</note> finally driven out by hunger. Having thus reduced them to extremities, the Tusculans took away their arms, and stripping them to the tunic, sent them under the yoke. As they were ignominiously fleeing homeward, the Roman consul overtook them on Mount Algidus, and slew them, every man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The victor led his army back to Columen &mdash;this is the name of a place<note>Unidentified. Dion. Hal., x. xxi., calls the town Algidum.</note> &mdash;and went into camp. The other consul too, now that the defeat of the enemy had removed all danger from the walls of Rome, set out himself from the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus at two points the consuls invaded the enemy's borders, and with keen rivalry devastated the lands of the Volsci on the one hand, and those of the Aequi on the other. I find in a good many writers that the Antiates revolted that same year; and that Lucius Cornelius the consul conducted the war and took the town. I should not venture to affirm it for a certainty, since there is no mention of the matter in the older historians.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This war was no sooner finished, than the patricians were alarmed by one waged against them at home, by the tribunes, who cried out that the army was dishonestly kept afield &mdash;a trick intended to frustrate the passage of the law; which, notwithstanding, they had undertaken and proposed to carry through.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Still, Lucius Lucretius, the prefect of the City, obtained the postponement of any action by the tribunes until the consuls should have come.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There had also arisen a new cause for disquiet. Aulus Cornelius and Quintus Servilius, the quaestors, had summoned Marcus Volscius to trial, on the charge that he had been guilty of undoubted perjury <pb id="p.83"/>against Caeso.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For it was becoming generally known,<note type="margin">B.C. 459</note> from many witnesses, first, that the brother of Volscius after having once fallen ill had not only never appeared in public, but had not even got up from his sick-bed, where he had died of a wasting disease which lasted many months;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and secondly, that within the period to which Volscius, in his testimony, had referred the crime, Caeso had not been seen in Rome; for those who had served with him affirmed that he had often during that time been in their company at the front, without taking any furlough.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To prove this contention, many persons offered Volscius to refer the question of fact to a private arbitrator. Since he did not dare proceed to arbitration, all these things, pointing in one direction, made the condemnation of Volscius as certain as that of Caeso had been made by Volscius's evidence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The tribunes delayed matters by refusing to allow the quaestors to hold an assembly for his trial until one should first have been held to consider the law. So both affairs dragged on till the arrival of the consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they had entered the City in triumph<note>Livy seems here to have accepted the account of the late annalists which he had suspected in chap. xxiii. 7. An extant inscription (<hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> xv. 44) commemorating the triumph of Fabius over the Aequi and Volsci and that of Cornelius over the Antiates shows that his suspicion was unfounded,</note> with their victorious army, nothing was said about the law, and many people thought the tribunes had been daunted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the tribunes were seeking a fourth term of office &mdash;for the end of the year was now at hand &mdash;and had diverted their efforts from the law to the contest for the election. And though the consuls strove quite as vehemently against the re-election of the incumbents to the tribuneship, as if a law were being urged which had been promulgated to curtail their own majesty, the contest resulted in victory for the tribunes.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>That same year the Aequi sought and obtained <pb id="p.85"/>peace. The census, which had been begun the year<note type="margin">B.C. 459</note> before, was completed; and this, they say, was the tenth lustral sacrifice performed since the founding of the City. There were enrolled 117,319 citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This year the consuls won great renown, at home and in the field; not only had they brought about peace with other nations, but at home also, though the state was not yet harmonious, yet it was less troubled than at other times.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Minucius and Gaius Nautius were<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> chosen to be the next consuls, and inherited the two causes left over from the preceding year. As before, the consuls obstructed the passage of the law, and the tribunes the trial of Volscius; but the new quaestors were men of superior force and influence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcus Valerius, son of Manius, and grandson of Volesus, shared the magistracy with Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, who had thrice been consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Capitolinus, since it was beyond his power to restore Caeso to the Quinctian family and the greatest of her young men to the state,<note>Livy here assumes that Caeso is dead, and possibly thinks of him as having perished with Herdonius.</note> waged war, as justice and loyalty demanded, on the false witness who had deprived an innocent man of the power to plead his cause.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Verginius was the most active amongst the tribunes in working for the law. The consuls were allowed two months' time to inspect the measure, that having explained to the people what hidden mischief was being proposed they might then permit them to vote. The granting of this breathing-space brought tranquillity to the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the Aequi did not suffer it to remain long at rest; breaking the treaty <pb id="p.87"/>which they had made with the Romans the year<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> before, they intrusted the command of their forces to Cloelius Gracchus, at that time by far the most eminent man in their state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Under this man's leadership they invaded the territory of Labici, and from there the territory of Tusculum, with fire and sword, and, loaded with booty, pitched their camp on Algidus. To this camp came Quintus Fabius, Publius Volumnius, and Aulus Postumius, envoys from Rome, to complain of the wrongs done and demand restitution, as provided in the treaty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Aequian general bade them recite the message of the Roman senate to the oak, saying that he would meantime attend to other matters. (The oak, a mighty tree, overhung head-quarters and with its dense shade afforded a cool resting-place.)
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon one of the envoys said, as he departed, <quote>Let both this sacred oak and whatever gods there are hear that the treaty has been broken by you; and let them attend now to our complaints and presently support our arms, when we shall avenge the simultaneous violation of the rights of gods and men.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the return of the envoys to Rome, the senate ordered one consul to lead an army to Algidus, against Gracchus, and to the other assigned the task of devastating the territories of the Aequi. The tribunes sought in their usual fashion to prevent the levy, and might perhaps have held out against it to the end; but suddenly a fresh alarm supervened.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A great body of Sabines made a hostile incursion almost to the walls of Rome, wasting the fields and terrifying the citizens. Thereupon the plebeians willingly enlisted, and despite the unavailing protests of the tribunes, two large armies were <pb id="p.89"/>enrolled. One of these Nautius led against the<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> Sabines.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Pitching his camp at Eretum, lie sent out little expeditions, chiefly nocturnal raiding parties, and so liberally repaid on their own fields the depredations of the Sabines, that the Roman territories in comparison seemed scarcely to have been touched by war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Minucius had neither the same good fortune nor equal spirit in conducting his campaign; for he encamped not far from the enemy, and without having suffered any considerable defeat, kept timidly within his breastworks. When the enemy perceived this, their audacity was heightened, as is usually the case, by their opponents' fear, and they attacked the camp by night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Failing to accomplish anything by open force, they next day surrounded the place with earthworks; but before these could be thrown up on every side of the camp and so shut off all egress, five horsemen were sent out through the enemy's outposts and carried to Rome the news that the consul and his army were beleaguered. Nothing more surprising or unlooked-for could have happened.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so the alarm and consternation were as great as if it had been the City, not the camp, which the enemy were investing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They sent for the consul Nautius; but deeming him unequal to their defence, and resolving to have a dictator to restore their shattered fortunes, they agreed unanimously on the nomination of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>What followed merits the attention of those who despise all human qualities in comparison with riches, and think there is no room for great honours or for worth but amidst a profusion of wealth. The sole hope of the empire of the Roman People, Lucius <pb id="p.91"/>Quinctius, cultivated a field of some four acres<note>Strictly speaking, a trifle less than three acres, since the <hi rend="italics">iugerum</hi> contained only 28,800 square feet.</note> across<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> the Tiber, now known as the Quinctian Meadows, directly opposite the place where the dockyards are at present.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There he was found by the representatives of the state. Whether bending over his spade as he dug a ditch, or ploughing, he was, at all events, as everybody agrees, intent upon some rustic task.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After they had exchanged greetings with him, they asked him to put on his toga, to hear (and might good come of it to himself and the republic!) the mandates of the senate. In amazement he cried, <quote>Is all well?</quote> and bade his wife Racilia quickly fetch out his toga from the hut.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he had put it on, after wiping off the dust and sweat, and came forth to the envoys, they hailed him Dictator, congratulated him, and summoned him to the City, explaining the alarming situation of the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A boat was waiting for him, provided by the state; and as he reached the other side his three sons came out to receive him; after them came his other kinsmen and friends; and after them the greater part of the senate. Attended by this throng and preceded by his lictors he was escorted to his house.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The plebeians too were gathered in great numbers; but they were by no means so rejoiced at the sight of Quinctius, because they thought that not only was his authority excessive, but that the man was even more dangerous than the authority itself. That night nothing more was done than to keep a watch in the City.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day the dictator, coming before dawn into the Forum, named as his master of the horse Lucius Tarquitius, a man of patrician birth, but one who had served as a foot-soldier because of <pb id="p.93"/>poverty, though in war he had been esteemed by<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> far the best of the Roman youth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With his master of the horse the dictator appeared before the people; proclamed a suspension of the courts; ordered the shops to be closed all over the City; and forbade anybody to engage in any private business.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then commanded all those who were of military age to come armed, before sunset, to the Campus Martius, bringing each enough bread to last five days, and twelve stakes;<note>The Roman soldier usually carried three or four stakes, to use in making a palisade.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> those who were too old for war he ordered to prepare food for their neighbours who were soldiers, while the latter were getting their arms in order and looking for stakes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the young men ran this way and that in search of stakes, and every one took them from the nearest source, nor was anyone interfered with; and all presented themselves promptly as the dictator had commanded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, having drawn up their column so as to be ready for fighting as well as for marching, if need were, the dictator himself led the legions, the master of the horse his cavalry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In each division were spoken such words of encouragement as the occasion called for: Let them mend their pace; there was need of speed, that they might reach the enemy's camp in the night; a consul and a Roman army were being besieged, and it was now the third day of their investment; what each night or day might bring forth was uncertain; a single instant was often the turning-point of a great event.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The soldiers also, in complaisance to their commanders, cried out to one another, <quote>Make haste, standard-bearer!</quote> <quote>Follow me, men!</quote> At midnight they came to Algidus, and perceiving that they were now close to the enemy, halted.</p> <pb id="p.95"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the dictator, having ridden about<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> and observed, as well as he could for the night, the extent of the camp and its shape, directed the military tribunes to make the soldiers throw down their packs in one place, and return, with arms and stakes, to their proper ranks. They did as he commanded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, keeping the order of the march, he led out the whole army in a long column and surrounded the enemy's camp, commanding that at a given signal the troops should all raise a shout, and that after shouting every man should dig a trench in front of his own position and erect a palisade. The signal followed close on the announcement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The men did as they had been bidden. Their cheer resounded on all sides of the enemy, and passing over their camp, penetrated that of the consul; in the one it inspired panic, in the other great rejoicing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans, congratulating one another that it was their fellow-citizens who shouted, and that help was at hand, on their own part began to threaten the enemy with attacks from their pickets and outposts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul said that they ought to act without delay; the shout not only signified that their friends were come, but that they had begun to fight; and it would be surprising if they were not already assailing the enemy's camp from without. He accordingly bade his men stand to arms and follow him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was night when they entered the battle; with a cheer they gave the legions of the dictator to know that on their side as well the issue had been joined.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Aequi were already preparing to resist the work of circumvallation, when the attack was begun upon their inner line. Lest a sortie should be made through the midst of their <pb id="p.97"/>camp, they turned their backs on those who were<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> entrenching, and faced the attacking forces; and, leaving the others free to work all night, they fought till break of day with the soldiers of the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At early dawn they had already been shut in by the dictator's rampart, and were scarcely maintaining the battle against one army. Then the troops of Quinctius, who had at once, on completing the works, resumed their weapons, assailed the rampart of the Aequi. Here was a new battle on their hands, and the other not yet in the least abated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At this, hard-driven by a double danger, they turned from fighting to entreaties, and on the one hand implored the dictator, on the other the consul, not to make the victory a massacre, but to take their arms and let them go. The consul referred them to the dictator, who in his anger added ignominy to their surrender.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He commanded that Cloelius Gracchus, their commander, and the other captains, be brought to him in chains, and that the town of Corbio be evacuated. He said that he did not require the blood of the Aequi; they might go; but, that they might at last be forced to confess that their nation had been defeated and subdued, they should pass beneath the yoke as they departed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A yoke was fashioned of three spears, two being fixed in the ground and the third laid across them and made fast. Under this yoke the dictator sent the Aequi.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having taken possession of the enemy's camp, which abounded in all sorts of supplies &mdash;for he had sent them out with nothing but their tunics &mdash;he
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> gave all the booty to his own troops exclusively, rebuking the consular army and the <pb id="p.99"/>consul himself in these terms: <quote>You shall have no<note type="margin">B.C. 458</note> share, soldiers, in the spoils of that enemy to whom you almost fell a spoil; and you, Lucius Minucius, until you begin to have the spirit of a consul, shall command these legions as my lieutenant.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So Minucius abdicated the consulship, and remained, as he was ordered to do, with the army.<note>Livy thinks of Cincinnatus as removing (or perhaps only suspending) Minucius from the consulship, in virtue of his superior authority. In <date value="-509">509 B.C.</date> (II. ii. 7 ff.) Lucius Tarquinius had been compelled to resign by his colleague Brutus and other leading men.</note> But so tame and submissive was the temper of this army now towards a better commander, that, considering rather the benefit they had received at his hands than the humiliation, they voted the dictator a golden chaplet of a pound in weight, and when he departed, saluted him as their protector.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At Rome the senate, being convened by Quintus Fabius, the prefect of the City, commanded Quinctius to enter the gates in triumph, with the troops that accompanied him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Before his chariot were led the generals of the enemy; the military standards were borne on ahead; after them came the soldiers, laden with booty. It is said that tables were spread before all the houses, and the troops, feasting as they marched, with songs of triumph and the customary jokes, followed the chariot like revellers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On that day Lucius Mamilius the Tusculan was granted citizenship, with the approval of all.<note>The first recorded instance of the bestowal of citizenship in requital of service done the state.</note> Cincinnatus would at once have resigned his office, had not the trial of Marcus Volscius, the false witness, caused him to delay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The awe in which the tribunes held the dictator prevented them from interfering with the trial. Volscius was condemned and went into exile at Lanuvium. On the sixteenth day Quinctius surrendered the dictatorship which he had received for six months. During that period the consul Nautius fought a successful engagement at Eretum with the Sabines, who in addition to the <pb id="p.101"/>devastation of their fields now suffered this new<note type="margin">B. C, 458</note> disaster. Fabius was sent to Mount Algidus to succeed Minucius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the close of the year there was some agitation for the law on the part of the tribunes; but since two armies were abroad, the senators insisted that no proposal should be laid before the people; the plebs were successful in electing the same tribunes for the fifth time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is said that wolves were seen on the Capitol, pursued by dogs; because of which prodigy the Capitol was purified. Such were the events of this year.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next consuls were Quintus Minucius<note type="margin">B.C. 457</note> and Marcus Horatius Pulvillus, At the beginning of the year, though foreign relations were peaceful, at home there were dissensions, inspired by the same tribunes and the same law;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and they would have proceeded to even greater lengths &mdash;so inflamed were men's passions &mdash;had it not been announced, as if designedly, that the garrison at Corbio had perished in a night-attack made by the Aequi.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls convoked the senate, and were directed to make a summary levy and lead the army to Mount Algidus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From that moment the quarrel over the law was laid aside, and a fresh dispute arose, concerning the levy; in this consular authority was in a fair way to be defeated, by the help of the tribunes, when a new alarm was reported: that a Sabine army bent on pillage had descended upon the Roman fields, and was thence approaching the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This was such staggering news that the tribunes permitted the enrolment of troops; yet not without having obtained an agreement that since they had themselves been baffled for five years,<note>They had not been able to pass the <hi rend="italics">Lex Terentelia.</hi></note> and the existing tribunate was an insufficient protection to the plebs, ten tribunes <pb id="p.103"/>should in future be elected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To this the patricians<note type="margin">B.C. 453</note> were compelled to agree, only stipulating that they should not thereafter see the same men tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The tribunician election was held immediately, lest when the war was over this promise too might be broken, as the others had been. In the thirty-sixth year from the first plebeian tribunes ten men were elected, two from each class,<note>The lowest class, paying no <hi rend="italics">tributum,</hi> had no representation.</note> and it was enacted that they should be chosen thus thereafter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The levy was then held, and Minucius marched against the Sabines, but did not find the enemy. Horatius, after the Aequi, having put the garrison at Corbio to the sword, had also captured Ortona, fought a battle with them on Mount Algidus, killed many men, and drove off the enemy, not only from Algidus, but from Corbio and Ortona. Corbio he razed because of its betrayal of the garrison.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcus Valerius and Spurius Verginius<note type="margin">B.C. 456-454</note> succeeded to the consulship. Affairs were quiet both at home and abroad; but there was a shortage in the corn-supply, due to excessive rains. A law was passed opening up the Aventine to settlement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The same tribunes of the plebs were returned; and in the following year, when Titus Romilius and Gaius Veturius were consuls, they took occasion to urge the law in all their speeches: They were ashamed, they said, of the futile increase in their numbers, if this measure was to lie disregarded during their own two years of office, precisely as it had done throughout the five preceding years.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Just when this agitation was at its height, there came a disquieting report from Tusculum that the Aequi were in Tusculan territory. Men were ashamed, in view of the recent service of that nation, to delay in sending aid. Both 103 <pb id="p.105"/>consuls were dispatched with an army; and finding<note type="margin">B.C. 456-454</note> the enemy on their usual ground, Mount Algidus, they there engaged them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Above seven thousand of the enemy were slain; the rest were put to flight; and immense spoils were taken. These the consuls sold, owing to the impoverished condition of the treasury. Nevertheless, their action made them unpopular with the army, and it also furnished the tribunes with an occasion for impeaching the consuls before the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly when they laid down their office and Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus Aternius became consuls, they were brought to trial; Romilius by Gaius Calvius Cicero, a plebeian tribune, Veturius by Lucius Alienus, an aedile of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both were condemned, greatly to the indignation of the patricians; Romilius was fined 10,000 asses, Veturius 15,000. And yet this disaster to their predecessors did not diminish the energy of the new consuls; they said that it was possible that they should themselves be condemned, but that it was not possible that the plebs and the tribunes should carry their law.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then the tribunes, discarding the law, which, in the time it had been before the people, had lost its vitality, began to treat more moderately with the patricians: Let them at last put an end, they said, to these disputes; if the plebeian measure were not agreeable to them, let them permit framers of laws to be appointed jointly from both the plebs and the nobility, that they might propose measures which should be advantageous to both sides, and secure equal liberty.<note>See chap. ix. &sect; 5 and note. Apparently the codification contemplated by Terentilius was to have been in the hands of a plebeian board.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The patricians did not reject the principle; but they declared that no one should propose laws unless he were a patrician. Since they were agreed in regard to the laws, and <pb id="p.107"/>only differed about the mover, they sent Spurius<note type="margin">B.C. 456-454</note> Postumius Albus, Aulus Manlius, and Publius Sulpicius Camerinus on a mission to Athens, with orders to copy the famous laws of Solon, and acquaint themselves with the institutions, customs, and laws of the other Greek states.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No foreign wars disturbed the quiet of<note type="margin">B.C. 453-452</note> that year; but even more quiet was the year that followed, when Publius Curiatius and Sextus Quinctilius were consuls, for the tribunes preserved an unbroken silence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was due in the first place to their waiting for the commissioners who had gone to Athens, and for the foreign laws; in the second place two terrible misfortunes had come at the same time, famine and pestilence, baneful alike to men and beasts. The fields were left untenanted; the City was emptied by incessant funerals; many distinguished families were in mourning.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The flamen of Quirinus, Servius Cornelius, died, and the augur Gaius Horatius Pulvillus, in whose place the augurs elected Gaius Veturius, the more eagerly because of his condemnation by the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Death took the consul Quinctilius, and four tribunes of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The numerous losses made it a gloomy year; but Rome's enemies did not molest her.</p> 
			<p>The next consuls were Gaius Menenius and Publius Sestius Capitolinus. In this year likewise there was no foreign war, but disturbances arose at home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The commissioners had now returned with the laws of Athens. The tribunes were therefore the more insistent that a beginning should be made at last towards codification. It was resolved to appoint decemvirs, subject to no appeal, and to have no other magistrates for that year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whether plebeians should <pb id="p.109"/>be permitted a share in the work was for some time<note type="margin">B.C. 453-452</note> disputed; in the end they yielded to the patricians, only bargaining that the Icilian law about the Aventine and the other sacred laws<note>The reference is especially to the law establishing the tribunate (II. xxxiii. 1). The violation of a <hi rend="italics">sacrata lex</hi> entailed outlawry on the offender.</note> should not be abrogated.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the three hundred and second year<note type="margin">B.C. 451</note> from the founding of Rome the form of the polity was changed again, with the transfer of supreme authority from consuls to decemvirs, even as before it had passed from kings to consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was not so remarkable a change, because it did not last long. For the luxuriant beginnings of this magistracy took on too rank a growth; and in consequence it soon died down, and the custom was resumed of entrusting to two men the name and authority of consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The decemvirs chosen were Appius Claudius, Titus Genucius, Publius Sestius, Lucius Veturius, Gaius Julius, Aulus Manlius, Publius Sulpicius, Publius Curiatius, Titus Romilius, and Spurius Postumius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To Claudius and Genucius, the consuls-elect for that year, the new office was given in compensation for the other; and to Sestius, one of the consuls of the year before, because he had brought the measure before the senate against his colleague's will.<note>A circumstance which Livy did not notice in chap. xxxii.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next to these were honoured the three envoys who had gone to Athens, not only that the office might serve to reward them for so distant a mission, but also in the belief that their knowledge of foreign laws would be useful in compiling a new code. The other four filled up the number.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is said that old men were chosen for the last places, that they might make a less vigorous opposition to the measures proposed by the rest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The guiding hand in the whole magistracy was that of Appius, thanks to the favour of the <pb id="p.111"/>plebs; and so novel a character had he assumed,<note type="margin">B.C. 451</note> that from being a harsh and cruel persecutor of the plebs, he came out all at once as the people's friend, and caught at every breath of popularity.<note>This sentence and the reference to Claudius's years and honours in chap. xxxiii. &sect; 3 seem inapplicable to a young man, and it is probable that the decemvir was, in reality, the consul of <date value="-471">471 B.C.</date> (see II. lvi. 5), not the nephew of C. Claudius, as Livy thought (chap. xxxv. &sect; 9), which would make him the <hi rend="italics">son</hi> of the consul of 471.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sitting each one day in ten they administered justice to the people. On that day he who presided in court had twelve fasces;<note><quote>Fasces</quote> is here equivalent to <quote>lictors.</quote></note> his nine colleagues were each attended by a single orderly. And while they maintained an unparalleled harmony amongst themselves &mdash;a unanimity sometimes prejudicial to the governed, &mdash;they treated others with the utmost fairness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As proof of their moderation, it will suffice to note a single example. Though they had been chosen to a magistracy from which there was no appeal, yet when a corpse was found buried in the house of Publius
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Sestius, a patrician, and produced before the assembly, and the man's guilt was as clear as it was heinous, Gaius Julius the decemvir summoned Sestius to trial, and appeared before the people to prosecute a man of whose guilt he was the lawful judge, surrendering his own prerogative that he might add to the liberty of the people what he subtracted from the power of the magistracy.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this prompt justice, as pure as though derived from an oracle, was being meted out impartially by the decemvirs to the highest and the lowest, they were also busily engaged in framing laws.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Men's expectations were running high, when they set up ten tables, and summoning the people <pb id="p.113"/>to assemble, commanded them &mdash;with a prayer that<note type="margin">B.C. 451</note> the result might be prosperous, favourable, and fortunate, for the commonwealth, for themselves, and for their children &mdash;to go and read the proposed statutes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They themselves, they said, so far as the capacities of ten men could forecast the event, had equalized the rights of all, both high and low; but there was greater efficacy in the capacities and counsels of many.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Let them consider each single point in their own minds, then discuss it with their fellows, and lastly state in public what excess or shortcoming there was in the several articles;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the Roman People should have only such laws as their unanimity might fairly be considered not only to have passed, but to have proposed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When it appeared that the laws had been sufficiently amended, in the light of the opinions that men expressed concerning each separate section, the centuriate comitia met and adopted the Laws of the Ten Tables; which even now, in this great welter of statutes piled one upon another, are the fountain-head of all public and private law.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Afterwards the opinion was general that there lacked two tables, by the addition of which a corpus, so to speak, of all the Roman law could be rounded out. The hope of filling this lack made people desirous, when election day drew near, of choosing decemvirs again.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The plebs, besides the fact that they hated the name of consul quite as much as that of king, had already ceased to require even the help of the tribunes, since the decemvirs yielded to one another when an appeal was taken.<note>This sentence supports Mommsen's view that the new legislation was intended originally to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> for tribunician intercession a limitation of the consular power by written law.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But when the comitia for the election of decemvirs had been announced to take place in <pb id="p.115"/>fourand-twenty days,<note>A <hi rend="italics">nundinum</hi> contained 8 days. The name (novem = nine) came from the Roman way of counting the Sunday, as it were, with the old week, as well as the new.</note> there was a great outburst of<note type="margin">B.C. 451</note> canvassing;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> even the chief men in the state &mdash;from fear, I doubt not, that if they left the field this great power might fall into unworthy hands &mdash;solicited men's votes and humbly begged for an office which they had themselves opposed with all their influence, from those plebeians with whom they had contended.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The risk of losing his position, at his time of life, and after holding the offices he had held, acted as a spur to Appius Claudius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> One would not have known whether to reckon him among the decemvirs or the candidates. He was at times more like one who sought a magistracy than like one who exercised it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He vilified the nobles; praised all the most insignificant and low-born candidates; and surrounding himself with former tribunes, like Duillius and Icilius, bustled about the Forum, and through them recommended himself to the plebs; till even his colleagues, who had been singularly devoted to him until then, looked askance at him and wondered what this could mean.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was evident there could be nothing genuine about it; so proud a man would certainly not be affable for nothing; excessive self-abasement and mingling with private citizens were not so much the marks of one who was in haste to retire from office as of one who sought the means of re-election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Open opposition to his desires being more than they dared venture, they endeavoured by a show of complaisance to lessen its intensity; and unanimously appointed him, as their youngest colleague, to preside at the election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This was a trick, that he might be unable to declare himself elected, a thing which none but tribunes of the plebs (and even there the precedent was most <pb id="p.117"/>vicious) had ever done. But Appius, strange as it<note type="margin">B.C. 451</note> may seem, having promised, with a prayer for Heaven's blessing, to convene the comitia, turned the obstacle into an opportunity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He effected by collusion<note><hi rend="italics">Coitio</hi> is an understanding between two candidates whereby the stronger transfers a part of his support to the weaker, in order to defeat a third candidate.</note> the defeat of the two Quinctii, Capitolinus and Cincinnatus, of his uncle Gaius Claudius, a steadfast champion of the aristocratic cause, and of other citizens of the same exalted rank; and declared the election of decemvirs who were no match for these men in excellence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His own name he announced among the first, a thing which good citizens condemned with as perfect unanimity, now it was done, as they had before believed he would not dare to do it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> With him were elected Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis, Marcus Sergius, Lucius Minucius, Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, Quintus Poetelius, Titus Antonius Merenda, Caeso Duillius, Spurius Oppius Cornicen, Manius Rabuleius.<note>Dion. Hal. XI. xxiii. says that Poetelius, Duillius, and Oppius were plebeians, as were probably Antonius and Rabuleius as well. But Livy tells us (IV. iii. 17) that they were all patricians.</note></p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Appius now threw off the mask he had<note type="margin">B.C. 450</note> been wearing, and began from that moment to live as his true nature prompted him. His new colleagues too he commenced, even before they entered upon office, to fashion after his own character.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Every day they met together without witnesses. The tyrannical designs which they there adopted they matured in secret. They now no longer sought to conceal their pride; they were difficult of access, and surly towards those who sought to speak with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thus they carried matters until the Ides of <pb id="p.119"/>May,<note>May 15th.</note> at that time the traditional date for<note type="margin">B.C.450</note> beginning a term of office. So then, when they had taken up their duties, they signalized the first day of their administration by a terrible threat. For whereas the former decemvirs had kept to the rule that only one should have the fasces, and that this regal emblem should pass from one to another in rotation, so that each should have his turn, they suddenly appeared in public, every man with his twelve fasces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A hundred and twenty lictors crowded the Forum, and before them, bound up in the rods, they carried axes. And indeed the decemvirs explained that there had been no reason for removing the axe, since the office to which they had been chosen was without appeal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They seemed like ten kings; and the terror they inspired, not only in the humblest citizens but in the leaders of the senate, was intensified by the belief that the decemvirs were merely seeking a pretext and an opening for bloodshed, so that if anybody should pronounce a word in praise of liberty, either in the senate or before the people, the rods and axes might instantly be made ready, were it only to frighten the rest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For besides that there was no help in the people, the right of appeal having been taken away, they had further agreed not to interfere with each other's decisions; whereas their predecessors had allowed their judgments to be revised upon appeal to one of their colleagues; and certain cases which might have been held to be within their own competence they had referred to the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For a brief period the terror was shared equally by all; but little by little its full force began to fall upon the plebs. The patricians were left unmolested; humbler folk were dealt with <pb id="p.121"/>arbitrarily and cruelly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was all a question of persons,<note type="margin">B.C. 450</note> not of causes, with the decemvirs, since influence held with them the place of right. They concocted their judgments in private, and pronounced them in the Forum. If anybody sought redress from another decemvir, he came away regretting that he had not accepted the decision of the first.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Moreover a report had got out, though it was not vouched for, that they had not only conspired for present wrongdoing but had ratified with an oath a secret agreement amongst themselves not to call an election, but by means of a perpetual decemvirate to hold the power they had once for all acquired.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The plebeians then fell to searching the<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> countenances of the patricians, and would catch at the breath of freedom in that quarter where they had so feared enslavement as to have reduced the state to its present plight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The leading senators hated the decemvirs and hated the plebs. They could not approve of the things that were being done; still they believed them to be not undeserved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had no desire to help those who in their greedy rush for liberty had fallen upon servitude, preferring that their wrongs should even be multiplied, that disgust at their actual situation might in the end arouse a longing for the two consuls and the former status of affairs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And now the greater part of the year had passed, and the two tables of laws had been added to the ten of the year before; nor was there any further business to make the decemvirate necessary to the republic, so soon as those statutes too should have been enacted in the centuriate assembly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> People were anxiously looking forward to the time when the comitia for the election of consuls should <pb id="p.123"/>be announced. The plebeians felt only one<note type="margin">B.C. 419</note> concern: how were they ever going to restore the tribunician power (their bulwark of liberty) which had been suspended?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Meanwhile there was no mention of an election. And the decemvirs, who had at first exhibited themselves to the plebs in the society of former tribunes, because this had
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> been thought a recommendation to the people, had now assumed a retinue of young patricians. Their bands blocked the tribunals. They bullied the plebs and plundered their possessions; for success attended the strong, no matter what they coveted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And now they ceased even to respect a man's person; some they scourged with rods, others they made to feel the axe; and, that cruelty might not go unrequited, they bestowed the victim's property upon his slayer. Corrupted by these wages, the young nobles not only made no stand against wrong-doing, but frankly showed that they preferred licence for themselves to liberty for all.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Ides of May came. Without causing any magistrates to be elected, the decemvirs, now private citizens, appeared in public with no abatement either of the spirit with which they exercised their power or the insignia which proclaimed their office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But this was unmistakable tyranny. Men mourned for liberty as for ever lost; nor did any one arise, or seem likely to do so, in its defence. And not only had the people themselves lost heart; but they had begun to be despised by the neighbouring nations, who could ill brook the existence of imperial power where there was no liberty.<note>Rome enjoyed no hegemony over Sabines and Aequians at this time, though Livy evidently thinks she did.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Sabines made an incursion with a large force into Roman territory, which they <pb id="p.125"/>everywhere laid waste. Having safely driven off their<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> booty, comprising men and beasts, they withdrew their army, which had ranged far and wide, to Eretum. There they established a camp, hoping that the want of harmony at Rome would interfere with the levying of troops. Not only the messengers who came, but the flight of the country-people, who thronged the City, inspired a feeling of dismay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The decemvirs considered what they had best do; for they were left in the lurch by the hatred of the patricians on the one side and of the plebs on the other.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Moreover Fortune sent an additional alarm. The Aequi came from another quarter and encamped on Algidus, and from there raided the lands of Tusculum. Tusculan envoys brought tidings of these acts, and besought protection. The fright which this occasioned drove the decemvirs, now that the City was hemmed in between two simultaneous wars, to consult the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They ordered the Fathers to be summoned to the Curia, though they were not ignorant how great a storm of unpopularity was brewing:
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the devastation of the land and the dangers which impended would be laid by everybody at their doors; and this would lead to an attempt being made to abolish their magistracy, unless they presented a united resistance, and by sharply exercising their power upon the few really daring spirits, put a stop to the efforts of the rest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the crier's voice was heard in the Forum, calling the senators to meet the decemvirs in the Curia, it was like an innovation, so long had they disregarded the custom of consulting the senate, and it aroused the attention of the plebs, who wondered what in the world could have happened, that after so long an interval they <pb id="p.127"/>should be reviving a forgotten usage; the enemy and<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> the war deserved men's gratitude, if anything whatever was being done which was usual in a free state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Men looked about in every corner of the Forum to discover a senator, and seldom recognized one anywhere; then their glances rested on the Curia and the decemvirs sitting there alone.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Meantime the decemvirs themselves explained the Fathers' failure to assemble as owing to the universal detestation of their rule; the commons as due to their having no authority, being private citizens, to convoke the senate: a beginning, it seemed, was already being made towards the recovery of freedom, if the plebs would join with the senate; and if, even as the Fathers were refusing, when summoned, to attend the session, so they, for their part, would reject the levy. Such were the murmurs of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Of senators there was scarce one in the Forum, and there were but few in the City. In their resentment at the situation they had withdrawn to their farms and were absorbed in their private affairs, disregarding those of the nation; for they felt that they were secure from insult only so far as they removed themselves from contact and association with their tyrannical masters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When on being cited they failed to appear, officers were sent round to their houses, for the double purpose of exacting fines and of ascertaining whether their recalcitrancy were deliberate. They reported that the senators were in the country. This was more pleasing to the decemvirs than if they had announced that the Fathers were in town and repudiated their authority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They commanded them all to be summoned, and proclaimed a meeting of the senate for the following day. This session <pb id="p.129"/>was somewhat better attended than they had<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> themselves expected. Whereupon the plebs concluded that liberty had been betrayed by the senators, since those who had already gone out of office and were mere private citizens, save for the force they exercised, were obeyed by them as though they had the authority to command.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But their obedience in coming to the senate-house was greater, we are told, than their submissiveness in the expression of their views.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It is related that Lucius Valerius Potitus, after Appius Claudius had proposed his motion and before the senators were called upon in order for their opinions, demanded leave to speak on the state of the nation; and when the decemvirs tried with threats to prevent his doing so, stirred up a violent commotion by declaring that he would go before the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With equal spirit, it is said, did Marcus Horatius Barbatus enter the dispute, calling them ten Tarquinii, and warning them that the Valerii and the Horatii had been leaders in the expulsion of the kings.<note>Livy did not mention Horatius in his account of the expulsion of the kings, but he is named by Dion. Hal. IV. lxxxv. Here Livy and Dion. Hal. (XI. v.), are in agreement, and are perhaps following the account of Licinius Macer.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor was it the name, said he, which had then disgusted men, since by this name Jupiter was duly called; and Romulus, the founder of the City; and the successive kings; and it had even been retained for religious rites as a solemn title.<note>See II. ii. 1.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No, it was the pride and violence of the king which men had hated in those days; and if these qualities had then been intolerable in a king, or the son of a king, who would endure them in so many private citizens?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Let them beware lest by denying men freedom of speech in the Curia they should set them a-talking outside the Curia as well. He could not see, he continued, how, as a private citizen, he was <pb id="p.131"/>less entitled to assemble the people for a speech<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> than they were to convene the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they liked they might learn by making the experiment how much stronger indignation was in the vindication of a man's own liberty than was ambition in defence of unjust power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The decemvirs talked of a Sabine war, as if any war were more important to the Roman People than war with those who, though they had been appointed to propose statutes, had left no law in the state; who had done away with elections, with annual magistracies, with the succession of new governors &mdash;the only means of equalizing liberty; &mdash;and who, though private citizens, had the rods and the power of kings.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Following the expulsion of the kings there had been patrician magistrates; later, after the secession of the plebs, plebeian magistrates had been elected. Of what party, he asked, were they? Of the popular party? Pray what had they done through the agency of the people? Of the aristocratic party? When they had held no meeting of the senate for close upon a year, and were now so conducting it as to suppress discussion of the national welfare?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Let them not trust too much to other men's fears; the things men were enduring now seemed more grievous to them than the things they feared.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Horatius was thus declaiming, the decemvirs were at a loss to know how far they could afford either to resent or to overlook it; nor could they make out what the upshot was likely to be.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But Gaius Claudius, the uncle of Appius the decemvir, made a speech, approaching more nearly to entreaty than expostulation, in which
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> he implored him in the name of his own brother's and his father's departed <pb id="p.133"/>spirits to remember rather the civil society in which<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> he had been born than the wicked compact he had entered into with his colleagues.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This he begged much more for Appius's own sake than for the sake of the nation; indeed the nation would demand its rights in spite of the decemvirs, if they did not accord them voluntarily; but a great struggle usually aroused great passions, and he shuddered to think what these might lead to.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although the decemvirs wished to prevent discussion of anything but the subject they had introduced, they were ashamed to interrupt Claudius, who accordingly brought his speech to a conclusion, with the proposal that the senate should take no action.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Everybody accepted this as meaning that Claudius held the decemvirs to be private citizens; and many of consular rank signified their approval, without discussion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Another motion, ostensibly harsher, but in reality somewhat less drastic, directed the patricians to assemble and proclaim an interrex. For by passing any measure whatsoever they declared those who presided over the senate to be magistrates; whereas they had been rated as mere citizens by him who advised the senate against adopting any resolution.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus the cause of the decemvirs was already collapsing, when Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis, brother of Marcus Cornelius the decemvir, who had purposely been reserved to be the last speaker among the ex-consuls, defended his brother and his brother's colleagues by feigning anxiety about the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He said he wondered by what fatality it had come about that the decemvirs were being attacked solely, or at least chiefly, by those who had sought election to that office;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> or why it was that during <pb id="p.135"/>the many months in which the state had been at<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> peace nobody had raised the question whether regular magistrates were at the head of affairs, and only now, when the enemy were almost at their gates, were men sowing political dissension; unless it was because they thought that in troubled waters it would be harder to discern what was going on.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the rest, was it not right that when men's attention was taken up with the larger concern, all prejudgment of so important a matter should be eliminated? He therefore proposed, concerning the charge brought by Valerius and Horatius that the official term of the decemvirs had expired on the day before the Ides of May, that they should first conclude the impending wars and restore the state's tranquillity, and then refer the question to the senate for settlement;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and that Appius Claudius should at once make up his mind to recognize that he must explain, regarding the comitia which he had held for the election of decemvirs &mdash;being one himself &mdash;whether they were chosen for one year or until the missing laws should be enacted.<note>Apparently the decemvirs were technically within their rights in claiming that they held office until the tables were ratified by popular vote.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For the present he thought they should pay no attention to anything but the war. If the current rumours about it seemed to them to be false, and if they supposed that not only the couriers but the Tusculan envoys also had brought them idle stories, he suggested that they send out scouts to investigate and return with more certain information.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But if they trusted both couriers and envoys, a levy should be held at the earliest possible moment; and the decemvirs should lead the armies whither it seemed good to each of them, giving precedence to no other business.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The younger senators were about to force <pb id="p.137"/>this motion through on a division, when Valerius and<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> Horatius, in a second and more impassioned outburst, demanded that they be permitted to speak about the state of the nation. They would address the people, they said, if they were restrained by a faction from speaking in the senate; for neither could private citizens prevent them, whether in the senate-house or in an assembly, nor would they yield to the emblems of a fictitious authority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon Appius, thinking the moment was at hand when, unless he opposed their violence with equal boldness, his
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> authority was doomed, cried out, <quote>It will be safer not to utter a word except on the subject of debate!</quote> And when Valerius asserted that he would not be silenced by a mere citizen, he sent a lictor to arrest him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Valerius was imploring the citizens for help, from the threshold of the Curia, when Lucius Cornelius, throwing his arms about Appius, and feigning to be concerned for the other man,<note>He pretended concern for Valerius, but was really prompted by a wish to further the ends of Appius, by preventing an undesirable test of men's temper.</note> stopped the quarrel. At his request Valerius was permitted to say what he wished. But liberty went no further than speech; the decemvirs made good their design.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even the ex-consuls and the elder senators, in consequence of their lingering hatred of the tribunician power, which they thought the plebs regretted much more keenly than they did the authority of the consuls, almost preferred that at some later time the decemvirs should voluntarily abdicate than that hatred of them should lead to another rising of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If gentle measures should restore the government to the consuls, without any popular outcry, they might, either through the intervention of wars, or through the moderation of the consuls in the exercise of their power, bring the plebeians to forget the tribunes.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.139"/>
			<p>The senators permitted in silence the proclamation<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> of a levy. The young men answered to their names, since the authority of the decemvirs was without appeal. When the legions were enrolled, the decemvirs settled among themselves who ought to go to the front and who command the armies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Chief among the ten were Quintus Fabius and Appius Claudius. The war at home seemed more important than that abroad. The violence of Appius was, they thought, more adapted to quell disturbances in the City; while Fabius was of a character deficient in steady rectitude rather than actively bad.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For this man, once pre-eminent in civil and in military affairs, had been so altered by the decemvirate and by his colleagues that he chose rather to be like Appius than like himself. To him was intrusted the war in the Sabine country, and Manius Rabuleius and Quintus Poetelius were given him as colleagues.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcus Cornelius was sent to Mount Algidus, with Lucius Minucius, Titus Antonius, Caeso Duillius, and Marcus Sergius. Spurius Oppius they assigned to Appius Claudius, to help him in looking out for the City; and they gave them the same powers as had been exercised by the entire board.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The business of the nation was managed no better in the field than at home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The only fault of the generals was that they had made the citizens detest them; the rest of the blame belonged to the soldiers, who, that nothing might anywhere prosper under the command and auspices of the decemvirs, permitted themselves to be beaten, to their own disgrace and that of their commanders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their armies were routed, both by the Sabines near Eretum, and on Algidus by the Aequi. From Eretum they <pb id="p.141"/>fled in the silence of the night, and intrenched<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> themselves near the City, between Fidenae and Crustumeria, on elevated ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the enemy followed them up, they nowhere ventured to fight in the open field, but defended themselves by the position and their rampart, not by bravery and arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The disgrace on Algidus was worse, and a worse disaster was sustained; even the camp was lost, and stripped of all their baggage, the soldiers fled to Tusculum, to subsist by the loyalty and compassion of their hosts, &mdash;which nevertheless did not fail them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To Rome came such alarming reports that the patricians, laying aside now their hatred of the decemvirs, voted to establish watches in the City, and commanded all who were of an age to bear arms to guard the walls and do outpost duty before the gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They decreed that arms should be dispatched to Tusculum, and reinforcements, and that the decemvirs should descend from the Tusculan citadel and hold their troops in camp; that the other camp should be transferred from Fidenae to Sabine territory, so that by taking the offensive they might frighten the enemy into abandoning his design to besiege the City.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To the disaster suffered at the hands of the enemy the decemvirs added two shameful crimes, one committed in the field, the other at home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Siccius<note>Surnamed Dentatus, and known, according to Aulus Gellius (II. xi.) as the Roman Achilles. Dion. Hal. (XI. xxv. f.) tells the story at greater length and somewhat differently.</note> was serving in the Sabine campaign. Taking advantage of the hatred entertained for the decemvirs, he would scatter hints, in secret conversations with the common soldiers, that they should elect tribunes and secede.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So the generals sent him to look out a place for an encampment; and instructed the men whom they assigned to share his expedition to set <pb id="p.143"/>upon him when they had got to a suitable spot,<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> and kill him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He died not unavenged. For he laid about him, and several of the assassins fell, for he was very strong, and though surrounded, defended himself with a courage equal to his strength.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The others reported at the camp that they had fallen into an ambuscade, and that Siccius had perished, fighting valiantly, and with him certain soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first their report was believed; afterwards a cohort set out, by permission of the decemvirs, to bury the slain; and finding that none of the bodies there had been despoiled, and that Siccius lay armed in the midst, with all the bodies facing him, while the enemy had left no dead nor any indication of having withdrawn, they brought back the corpse, and declared that Siccius had certainly been murdered by his own men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The camp was ablaze with indignation, and it was resolved that Siccius should be carried to Rome forthwith; but the decemvirs made haste to give him a military funeral at the public cost. The soldiers sorrowed greatly at his burial, and the worst reports were current about the decemvirs.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This outrage was followed by another, committed in Rome, which was inspired by lust and was no less shocking in its consequences than that which had led, through the rape and the death of Lucretia, to the expulsion of the Tarquinii from the City and from their throne; thus not only did the same end befall the decemvirs as had befallen the kings, but the same cause deprived them of their power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Appius Claudius was seized with the desire to debauch a certain maiden belonging to the plebs. The girl's father, Lucius Verginius, a <pb id="p.145"/>centurion of rank, was serving on Algidus, a man<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> of exemplary life at home and in the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His wife had been brought up in the same principles, and his children were being trained in them. He had betrothed his daughter to the former tribune Lucius Icilius, an active man of proven courage in the cause of the plebeians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> She was a grown girl, remarkably beautiful, and Appius, crazed with love, attempted to seduce her with money and promises. But finding that her modesty was proof against everything, he resolved on a course of cruel and tyrannical violence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He commissioned Marcus Claudius, his client, to claim the girl as his slave, and not to yield to those who demanded her liberation, thinking that the absence of the maiden's father afforded an opportunity for the wrong.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As Verginia was entering the Forum &mdash;for there, in booths, were the elementary schools &mdash;the minister of the decemvir's lust laid his hand upon her, and calling her the daughter of his bond-woman and herself a slave, commanded her to follow him, and threatened to drag her off by force if she hung back.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Terror made the maiden speechless, but the cries of her nurse imploring help of the Quirites quickly brought a crowd about them. The names of Verginius her father and of her betrothed Icilius were known and popular. Their acquaintance were led to support the girl out of regard for them; the crowd was influenced by the shamelessness of the attempt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> She was already safe from violence, when the claimant protested that there was no occasion for the people to become excited; he was proceeding lawfully, not by force.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then summoned the girl to court. She was advised by her supporters to 145 <pb id="p.147"/>follow him, and they went before the tribunal of<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> Appius. The plaintiff acted out a comedy familiar to the judge, since it was he and no other who had invented the plot: The girl had been born, said Marcus, in his house, and had thence been stealthily conveyed to the home of Verginius and palmed off upon him as his own;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> he had good evidence for what he said, and would prove it even though Verginius himself were judge, who was more wronged than he was; meanwhile it was right that the hand-maid should follow her master.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The friends of the girl said that Verginius was absent on the service of the state; he would be at hand in two days' time if he were given notice of the matter; it was unjust that a man should be involved in litigation about his children when away from home;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> they therefore requested Appius to leave the case open until the father arrived, and in accordance with the law he had himself proposed, grant the custody of the girl to the defendants,<note>Dion. Hal. (XL. iv.) mentions Icilius and Numitorius as offering to be Verginia's <hi rend="italics">indices, i. e.</hi> to put in a claim to interim custody of the girl, till the suit determining her status should be decided.</note> nor suffer a grown maiden's honour to be jeopardized before her freedom should be adjudicated.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Appius prefaced his decision by saying that it was evident how much he favoured liberty from that very law which the friends of Verginius made the pretext for their claim;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but the law would afford liberty a sure protection only if it varied neither with causes nor with persons; for in the case of others who were claimed as free, the demand was legal, since any one might bring an action: in the case of one who was under the authority of a father there was no one else to whom the master ought to yield the custody;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> accordingly he decreed that the father should be summoned, and that meanwhile the <pb id="p.149"/>claimant should not relinquish his right, but should<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> take the girl in charge and guarantee that she should be produced at the coming of him who was called her father.<note>Appius argued that Verginia was either the slave of his client or under her father's control, and in neither case free, so that an action for recovering her freedom did not lie, and it was merely a question of title between Verginius and Marcus Claudius.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Against the injustice of the decree, though many murmured their disapproval, there was not a single man who dared to stand out; when Publius Numitorius, the girl's great-uncle,<note>Some take <hi rend="italics">avus</hi> literally, as <quote>grandfather.</quote> See chap. liv. 11, note.</note> and her lover Icilius, arrived on the scene.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When a path had been opened for them through the throng, since the crowd believed that the intervention of Icilius would be particularly effectual in resisting Appius, the lictor cried that the case had been decided, and as Icilius began to protest, attempted to thrust him aside.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even a placid nature would have been incensed by so violent an insult. <quote>You must use iron to rid yourself of me, Appius,</quote> he cried, <quote>that you may carry through in silence what you desire should be concealed. This maiden I am going to wed; and I intend that my bride shall be chaste.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So call together all your colleagues' lictors too; bid them make ready rods and axes: the promised wife of Icilius shall not pass the night outside her father's house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No! If you have taken from the Roman plebs the assistance of the tribunes and the right of appeal, two citadels for the defence of liberty, it has not therefore been granted to your lust to lord it over our children and our wives as well!
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Vent your rage upon our backs and our necks: let our chastity at least be safe. If that shall be assailed, I will call on the Quirites here present to protect my bride, Verginius will <pb id="p.151"/>invoke the help of the soldiers in behalf of his only<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> daughter, and all of us will implore the protection of gods and men;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> nor shall you ever repeat that decree of yours without shedding our blood. I ask you, Appius, to consider earnestly whither you are going.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Let Verginius decide what to do about his daughter, when he comes; but of one thing he may rest assured: if he yields to this man's claim, he will have to seek a husband for her. As for me, in defence of the freedom of my bride I will sooner die than prove disloyal.</quote></p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The crowd was deeply moved and a conflict appeared to be imminent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The lictors had surrounded Icilius, but had nevertheless gone no further than to threaten him, since Appius declared that it was not a question of Verginia's defence by Icilius, but of a turbulent fellow, who even now breathed the spirit of the tribunate, seeking an opportunity to stir up strife.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He would furnish him no excuse for it that day; but that he might know now that the concession had not been made to his own wantonness but to the absent Verginius, to the name of father, and to liberty, he would not pronounce judgment that day nor deliver a decision; he would request Marcus Claudius to waive his right and suffer the girl to remain at large until the morrow;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but unless the father should appear the next day, he gave notice to Icilius and to those like Icilius that the proposer of his law would not fail to support it, nor the decemvir be wanting in firmness; and in any case he should not call together his colleagues' lictors to repress the instigators of sedition, but rest content with his own.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The time for accomplishing the wrong having <pb id="p.153"/>been postponed, the girl's supporters went apart by<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> themselves, and decided that first of all the brother of Icilius and the son of Numitorius, active young men, should proceed straight to the City gate and make all possible haste to the camp, to summon Verginius; for the maiden's safety turned on her protector's being at hand in time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They set out the moment they got their orders, and galloping their horses, carried the message through to the father.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the claimant of the girl pressed Icilius to furnish the sureties required of her guarantor, and Icilius said that it was precisely that which he was considering (though he was doing his best to consume time, that the messengers who had been dispatched to the camp might get a start on the way), the people began on every side to raise their hands, and every man of them to indicate his readiness to go bail for Icilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And Icilius said, with tears in his eyes, <quote>I am grateful to you; to-morrow I will use your services; of sureties I now have enough.</quote> So Verginia was surrendered, on the security of her kinsmen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Appius waited a little while, that he might not appear to have sat for this case only, and when nobody applied to him &mdash;for all other matters were forgotten in men's concern over this, &mdash;he went to his house and wrote to his colleagues in camp that they should grant no furlough to Verginius, and should even detain him in custody.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His base design was too late, as it deserved to be; Verginius had already got his leave, and had set out in the fore-part of the night, nor was it until early the next morning that the letters for detaining him were delivered, to no purpose.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But in the City, as the citizens at break <pb id="p.155"/>of day were standing in the Forum, agog with<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> expectation, Verginius, dressed in sordid clothes and leading his daughter, who was also meanly clad and was attended by a number of matrons, came down into the market-place with a vast throng of supporters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then began to go about and canvass people, and not merely to ask their aid as a favour, but to claim it as his due, saying that he stood daily in the battle-line in defence of their children and their wives; that there was no man of whom more strenuous and courageous deeds in war could be related &mdash;to what end, if despite the safety of the City those outrages which were dreaded as the worst that could follow a city's capture must be suffered by their children? Pleading thus, as if in a kind of public appeal, he went about amongst the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Similar appeals were thrown out by Icilius; but the women who attended them were more moving, as they wept in silence, than any words.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the face of all these things Appius hardened his heart &mdash;so violent was the madness, as it may more truly be called than love, that had overthrown his reason &mdash;and mounted the tribunal. The plaintiff was actually uttering a few words of complaint, on the score of having been balked of his rights the day before through partiality, when, before he could finish his demand, or Verginius be given an opportunity to answer, Appius interrupted him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The discourse with which he led up to his decree may perhaps be truthfully represented in some one of the old accounts, but since I can nowhere discover one that is plausible, in view of the enormity of the decision, it seems my duty to set forth the naked fact, upon which all agree, that <pb id="p.157"/>he adjudged Verginia to him who claimed her as his<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> slave.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first everybody was rooted to the spot in amazement at so outrageous a proceeding, and for a little while after the silence was unbroken. Then, when Marcus Claudius was making his way through the group of matrons to lay hold upon the girl, and had been greeted by the women with wails and lamentations, Verginius shook his fist at Appius and cried, <quote>It was to Icilius, Appius, not to you that I betrothed my daughter; and it was for wedlock, not dishonour, that I brought her up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Would you have men imitate the beasts of the field and the forest in promiscuous gratification of their lust? Whether these people propose to tolerate such conduct I do not know: I cannot believe that those who have arms will endure it.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The claimant of the maiden was being forced back by the ring of women and supporters who surrounded her, when silence was commanded by a herald; 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>and the decemvir, crazed with lust, declared that he knew, not only from the abusive words uttered by Icilius the day before and the violence of Verginius, which he could prove by the testimony of the Roman People, but also from definite information, that all through the night meetings had been held in the City to promote sedition.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, having been aware of the approaching struggle, he had come down into the Forum with armed men, not that he might do violence to any peaceable citizen, but to coerce, conformably to the dignity of his office, those who would disturb the nation's peace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>You will therefore,</quote> he cried, <quote>best be quiet! Go, lictor, remove the mob and open a way for the master <pb id="p.159"/>to seize his slave!</quote> When he had wrathfully<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> thundered out these words, the crowd parted spontaneously and left the girl standing there, a prey to villainy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then Verginius, seeing no help anywhere, said, <quote>I ask you, Appius, first to pardon a father's grief if I have somewhat harshly inveighed against you; and then to suffer me to question the nurse here, in the maiden's presence, what all this means, that if I have been falsely called a father, I may go away with a less troubled spirit.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Permission being granted, he led his daughter and the nurse apart, to the booths near the shrine of Cloacina, now known as the <quote>New Booths,</quote> and there, snatching a knife from a butcher, he exclaimed, <quote>Thus, my daughter, in the only way I can, do I assert your freedom!</quote> He then stabbed her to the heart, and, looking back to the tribunal, cried, <quote>'Tis you, Appius, and your life I devote to destruction with this blood!</quote> The shout which broke forth at the dreadful deed roused Appius, and he ordered Verginius to be seized.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But Verginius made a passage for himself with his knife wherever he came, and was also protected by a crowd of men who attached themselves to him, and so reached the City gate. Icilius and Numitorius lifted up the lifeless body and showed it to the people, bewailing the crime of Appius, the girl's unhappy beauty, and the necessity that had constrained her father.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After them came the matrons crying aloud, <quote>Was it on these terms that children were brought into the world?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Were these the rewards of chastity?</quote> &mdash;with such other complaints as are prompted at a time like this by a woman's anguish, and are so much the more pitiful as their lack of self-control <pb id="p.161"/>makes them the more give way to grief.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The men,<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> and especially Icilius, spoke only of the tribunician power; of the right of appeal to the people which had been taken from them; and of their resentment at the nation's wrongs.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The wildest excitement prevailed amongst the people, occasioned in part by the atrocity of the crime,<note>Livy doubtless means the crime of Appius rather than the justifiable though shocking deed of Verginius (see chap. xlviii. &sect; 7, and chap. 1. &sect; 5).</note> in part by the hope of improving the opportunity to regain their liberty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Appius first commanded that Icilius be summoned; then, on his resisting, that he be arrested; and at last, when the crowd would not allow his attendants to approach the man, he headed a band of patrician youths in person, and advancing through the mob, bade them drag his enemy off to prison.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By this time Icilius was supported not only by the populace but by the leaders of the populace as well, Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, who, forcing the lictor back, declared that if Appius proceeded legally, they would protect Icilius from the prosecution of a mere citizen; if he sought to make use of violence, there too they would be a match for him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This led to a desperate struggle. The decemvir's lictor now made a rush at Valerius and Horatius; his rods were broken by the mob. Appius mounted the platform; Horatius and Valerius followed him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To them the crowd listened; the decemvir's voice they drowned with noise. And now, as though vested with authority, Valerius was commanding the lictors to withdraw from one who was a private citizen; when Appius, broken in spirit and fearing for his life, covered up his head and sought refuge in a house near the Forum, unobserved by his opponents.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Spurius Oppius, wishing to assist his colleague, burst into the Forum from the other <pb id="p.163"/>quarter. He saw that authority had been overcome<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> by force. Distracted then by the suggestions which came from every side, and timidly agreeing first with one and then with another of his many advisers, he ended by ordering the senate to be summoned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This course, inasmuch as a great proportion of the patricians appeared to disapprove of the decemvirs' acts, afforded hopes that the senators would end their power, and so quieted the multitude.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate decided that the plebs must not be provoked, and that it was even more necessary to see to it that the arrival of Verginius in the army should not occasion any turbulence.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly certain of the younger senators were dispatched to the camp, which was then on Mount Vecilius, and carried word to the decemvirs that they must employ all their resources to keep the troops from mutiny.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Verginius aroused a greater commotion than he had left in Rome. For besides that he was seen approaching attended by a body of nearly four hundred men, who had joined him when he left the City, in their anger and resentment at the affair, the weapon in his hand and the gore with which he was spattered drew the attention of the entire camp upon him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then too the appearance of togas in the camp, in many places, produced the effect of a greater company of civilians than were actually there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Being asked what the matter was, Verginius wept, and for a long time answered never a word; at length, when the bustle and confusion of the gathering had subsided and silence had ensued, he gave an orderly account of all that had taken place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, lifting up his hands in an attitude of prayer, and addressing the <pb id="p.165"/>crowd as his fellow-soldiers, he besought them not<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> to attribute to him the crime of which Appius Claudius stood guilty, nor to repudiate him as one who had murdered his child.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To him the life of his daughter had been dearer than his own, if she had been permitted to live pure and chaste; when he saw her being carried off like a slave to be dishonoured, thinking it better to lose his children by death than by outrage, he had been impelled by pity to an act of seeming cruelty; nor would he have survived his daughter, had he not hoped to avenge her death by the help of his fellow-soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They too had daughters, sisters, and wives; the lust of Appius Claudius had not been extinguished with the life of Verginia, but its lawlessness would be proportioned to its impunity. In the calamity of another they had been given a warning to be on their guard against similar wrongs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So far as he was concerned, his wife had been taken from him in the course of nature, his daughter, because she could no longer have lived chaste, had died a pitiful but an honourable death;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for the lust of Appius there was now no longer in his house any scope; from other forms which his violence might take he would defend his own person with no less spirit than he had shown in defence of his daughter; the others must look out for themselves and for their own children.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As Verginius spoke these words in a loud voice, the multitude signified with responsive shouts that they would not forget his sufferings nor fail to vindicate their liberty. And the civilians, mingling with the crowd, repeated the same complaints and told them how much more shameful the thing would have appeared if they could have seen it instead of <pb id="p.167"/>hearing about it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> at the same time they reported<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> that the decemvirate was already overthrown at Rome; and on the arrival of later tidings, to the effect that Appius had almost lost his life and had gone into exile, they induced the troops to raise the cry <quote>To arms!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and to pluck up their standards and set out for Rome. The decemvirs, troubled alike by what they saw and by what they heard had taken place in Rome, rushed through the camp, one this way, another that, to still the rising.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And so long as they mildly remonstrated, they got no answer; but if one of them tried to use his authority, they told him that they were men, and armed. They marched in column to the City and took possession of the Aventine, urging the plebeians, as often as they fell in with one, to
				<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> make an effort to regain their liberty and to elect plebeian tribunes. Save this, no violent proposals were heard.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The senate was convened by Spurius Oppius. It was resolved that no harsh action should be taken, seeing that occasion for the mutiny had been given by themselves.<note>Viz. by the senate and decemvirs.</note> Three delegates of consular rank, Spurius Tarpeius, Gaius Julius, and Publius Sulpicius, were dispatched in the name of the senate to inquire by whose orders the men had deserted the camp, and what they meant, who with arms had seized the Aventine, and, abandoning the enemy, had captured their native City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The men were at no loss for an answer: what they lacked was some one to make it, since they had as yet no definite leader, nor did individuals quite dare to single themselves out for enmity. But the crowd called out in unison that they should send them Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, to whom they would intrust their reply.</p> <pb id="p.169"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the delegates had been dismissed,<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> Verginius reminded the soldiers that they had been thrown into confusion a few minutes before, over a matter of no very great importance, because the multitude had been without a head;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and although a very good answer had been returned, yet this had been due rather to their happening to feel alike about the matter than to a concerted plan.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He recommended that ten men should be chosen to have supreme command, and that they should be styled, by a military title, tribunes of the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they would have tendered Verginius himself the first appointment to this office, he replied, <quote>Reserve your good opinion of me till my own affairs and yours are in a better plight; to me no honour can be agreeable while my daughter is unavenged; nor is it well for you, with the state in such confusion, to be led by those who are most exposed to hatred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If I can render any service,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> it shall not be less because I am a private citizen.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So they chose ten military tribunes.</p> 
			<p>Nor was the army in the Sabine country inactive. There too, at the instigation of Icilius and Numitorius, a secession from the decemvirate was brought about; men's anger on being reminded of the murder of Siccius being no less violent than that which was kindled in them by the new story of the maiden whose dishonour had been so foully sought.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Icilius, on hearing that military tribunes had been elected on the Aventine, feared lest the City comitia might take their cue from the comitia of the soldiers<note><hi rend="italics">Comitia</hi> is here used untechnically of the extemporized election called by Verginius.</note> and elect the same
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> men to be tribunes of the plebs, for he was experienced in the ways of the people; and having designs upon that office himself, <pb id="p.171"/>he saw to it, before they marched to the City, that<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> the same number of men, vested with equal power, were chosen by his own army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They entered Rome under their standards, by the Colline Gate, and marched right through the midst of the City to the Aventine. There they joined the other army, and directed the twenty military tribunes to appoint two of their number to exercise supreme command.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Marcus Oppius and Sextus Manilius were appointed.</p> 
			<p>The Fathers were alarmed about the state; but, though the senate held daily sessions, they spent more time in recriminations than in deliberating.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Siccius's murder was cast in the teeth of the decemvirs, as well as the lust of Appius, and their disgraces in the field. It was decided that Valerius and Horatius should go to the Aventine. They agreed to go only on condition that the decemvirs would put off the insignia of that magistracy which they had already ceased to hold the year before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The decemvirs, complaining that they were being deprived of their office, asserted that they would not lay down their authority until after the enactment of the laws which had been the reason of their appointment.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having learned from Marcus Duillius, who had been a plebeian tribune, that nothing was coming of the endless bickerings of the senate, the commons quitted the Aventine for the Sacred Mount, since Duillius assured them that not until the patricians beheld the City deserted would they feel any real concern;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Sacred Mount would remind them of the firmness of the plebs, and they would know whether it were possible or not that affairs should be reduced to harmony without the <pb id="p.173"/>restoration of the tribunician power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marching out<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> by the Via Nomentana, then called Ficulensis, they pitched their camp on the Sacred Mount, having imitated the good behaviour of their fathers and made no depredations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Following the army came the plebeian civilians; nor did any one who was of an age to go hold back. They were attended a little way forth by their wives and children, who inquired pathetically to whose protection they were leaving them, in that City where neither chastity nor liberty was sacred.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now that all Rome was desolate with an unwonted loneliness, and there was nobody in the Forum but a few old men, and it appeared, particularly when the Fathers had been summoned to the senate-house, quite deserted, there were many others besides Horatius and Valerius who remonstrated. <quote>What will you wait for, Conscript Fathers?</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they cried out. <quote>If the decemvirs persist in their obstinacy, will you suffer everything to go to wrack and ruin? Pray what is that authority, decemvirs, to which you cling with such tenacity? Is it to roofs and walls you will render judgment?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Are you not ashamed that your lictors should be seen in the Forum in almost larger numbers than the other citizens? What do you mean to do if the enemy should come to the City? What if, by and bye, the plebs, finding us unmoved by their secession, come with sword in hand? Do you wish the downfall of the City to be the end of your rule? And yet, either we must have no plebs, or we must have plebeian tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> We will sooner dispense with patrician magistrates than they with plebeian. It was a new and untried power when they extorted it from our fathers:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> now <pb id="p.175"/>that they have once been captivated by its charm,<note type="margin">B.C.449</note> they would be even less willing to forgo it, especially when we on our side do not so temper the exercise of our authority that they stand in no need of help.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As these reproaches were flung at them from every quarter, the decemvirs were overborne by the consensus of opinion and gave assurances that they would submit, since it was thought best, to the authority of the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They had but this one request to make &mdash;which was also a warning, &mdash;that their persons might be protected from men's hate, and that their blood might not be the means of accustoming the plebs to punish senators.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Valerius and Horatius were then sent to bring back the plebs and adjust all differences, on such terms as might seem good to them; and they were also instructed to secure the decemvirs against the anger and violence of the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having proceeded to the camp, they were received with great rejoicings by the plebs, as undoubted champions of liberty both in the beginning of the disturbance and in the sequel. In recognition of this they were thanked on their arrival, Icilius speaking on behalf of the multitude.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And it was Icilius too who, when terms were discussed and the commissioners inquired what the plebeians demanded, made such requests, in pursuance of an understanding already reached before the arrival of the envoys, that it was apparent they based their hope more on equity than on arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the recovery of the tribunician power and the appeal were the things they sought &mdash;things which had been the help of the plebs before the election of decemvirs; &mdash;and that it should not be held against any man that he had incited the soldiers or the people <pb id="p.177"/>to recover their liberties by secession.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Only in regard<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> to the punishment of the decemvirs was their demand a harsh one; for they thought it just that the decemvirs should be delivered up to them, and threatened to burn them alive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To these proposals the commissioners replied: <quote>The demands which have been prompted by your judgment are so right that they ought to have been accorded you voluntarily; for you seek in them guarantees of liberty, not of a licence to make attacks on others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But your anger calls for pardon rather than indulgence, seeing that hatred of cruelty is driving you headlong into cruelty, and almost before you are free yourselves you are wishing to lord it over your adversaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Will the time never come when our state shall rest from punishments visited either by the patricians on the Roman plebs or by the plebs on the patricians? A shield is what you need more than a sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is enough and more than enough for a lowly citizen when he lives in the enjoyment of equal rights in the state, neither inflicting an injury nor receiving one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Even if you are one day to make yourselves dreaded, when you have got back your magistrates and laws and possess authority to put us on trial for our lives and fortunes, you shall then give judgment in accord with the merits of each particular case: for the present it is enough to regain your liberty.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the people all consented that they should do as they saw fit, the envoys assured them that they would settle matters and presently return.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So they departed and explained to the Fathers the demands of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The other decemvirs, when they found that, contrary to their expectation, no mention was made of any punishment of themselves, <pb id="p.179"/>made no objection to anything: Appius, hard-hearted,<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> knowing himself peculiarly unpopular, and measuring other men's hatred of himself by his own of them, exclaimed, <quote>I am not unaware of the lot which threatens me.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I perceive that the attack upon us is only being postponed till arms are handed over to our adversaries. Hatred must have its offering of blood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I too am willing to relinquish the decemvirate.</quote> A decree was passed by the senate that the decemvirs should abdicate the magistracy at the earliest possible moment; that Quintus Furius, the Pontifex Maximus,<note>Asconius (ed. Clark, p. 77) commenting on Cicero's speech <hi rend="italics">Pro Cornelio de Maiestate</hi> (which states that the plebs on this occasion <quote>elected ten plebeian tribunes, through the instrumentality of the pontifex, because there was no magistrate</quote>) gives the name of the <hi rend="italics">pontifex maximus</hi> as M. Papirius. This is the first time that Livy has mentioned the <hi rend="italics">pontifex maximus,</hi> thus implying the existence of a <hi rend="italics">college</hi> of pontiffs. See IV. xliv.</note> should hold an election of plebeian tribunes; and that no one should be made to suffer for the secession of the soldiers and the plebs.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Having so decreed the senate adjourned and the decemvirs went before the people and laid down their office, to the great delight of all.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These events were reported to the plebs, the envoys being accompanied by all the people left in the City. The multitude was met by another joyful throng from the camp, and they exchanged congratulations on the restoration of freedom and harmony to the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The commissioners addressed the people as follows: <quote>Prosperity, favour, and good fortune to you and the Republic! Return to your native City, to your homes, to your wives, and your children; but let the self-restraint you have shown here, where no man's farm has been violated, though so many things were useful and necessary to so great a multitude, be preserved when you return to the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Go to the Aventine, whence you set out. There in the auspicious place where you first laid the foundations of your liberty, you shall choose tribunes of the plebs. The <pb id="p.181"/>Pontifex Maximus will be at hand to hold the<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> election.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With loud applause and great alacrity the people showed their approval of all that had been said. They pulled up their standards from the place and set out for Rome, vying with those whom they met in joyful demonstrations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Armed, they proceeded in silence through the City to the Aventine. There the Pontifex Maximus at once held the comitia, and they elected tribunes of the plebs;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> first of all Lucius Verginius; then Lucius Icilius and Publius Numitorius, Verginia's great-uncle,<note><hi rend="italics">Avunculus</hi> means properly <quote>uncle,</quote> but sometimes <quote>great-uncle,</quote> as I have here translated it, taking it to refer to the P. Numitorius who in chap. xlv. &sect; 4 is called <hi rend="italics">puellae avus.</hi></note> the instigators of the secession; then Gaius Sicinius, son of the man who is related to have been the first plebeian tribune chosen on the Sacred Mount; and Marcus Duillius, who had filled the tribuneship with distinction before the decemvirs were appointed, and had not failed the plebs in their contentions with the decemvirs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then, more by reason of their promise than for any deserts of theirs, they elected Marcus Titinius, Marcus Pomponius, Gaius Apronius, Appius Villius, and Gaius Oppius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As soon as they had taken office, Lucius Icilius proposed to the people, and they so voted, that no man should suffer for the secession from the decemvirs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Immediately a bill that consuls should be elected subject to appeal was offered by Marcus Duillius and was carried. These matters were all transacted by the council of the plebs, in the Flaminian Meadows, which men now call the Flaminian Circus.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, through an interrex, they elected to the consulship Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, who at once assumed office. Their administration was favourable to the people, without in any way wronging the patricians, though not without offending <pb id="p.183"/>them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for whatever was done to protect the<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> liberty of the plebs they regarded as a diminution of their own strength.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To begin with, since it was virtually an undecided question whether the patricians were legally bound by plebiscites, they carried a statute in the centuriate comitia enacting that what the plebs should order in the tribal organization should be binding on the people &mdash;a law which provided the rogations of the tribunes with a very sharp weapon.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Next they not only restored a consular law about the appeal, the unique defence of liberty, which had been overthrown by the decemviral power, but they also safeguarded it for the future by the solemn enactment of a new law, that no one should declare the
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> election of any magistrate without appeal, and that he who should so declare might be put to death without offence to law or religion, and that such a homicide should not be held a capital crime.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And having sufficiently strengthened the plebs, by means of the appeal on the one hand and the help of the tribunes on the other, they revived, in the interest of the tribunes themselves, the principle of their sacrosanctity (which was a thing that had now come to be well-nigh forgotten) by restoring certain long-neglected ceremonies;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and they rendered those magistrates inviolate, not merely on the score of religion but also by a statute, solemnly enacting that he who should hurt the tribunes of the plebs, the aediles,<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the plebeian aediles, two in number, elected by the plebeians to assist the tribunes, as the quaestors did the consuls, and take charge of the archives of the plebs, kept in the temple of Ceres (see 13).</note> or the decemviral judges<note>These <hi rend="italics">decemviri stlitibus iudicandis</hi> judged cases involving liberty or citizenship.</note> should forfeit his head to Jupiter, and that his possessions should be sold at the temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Expounders of the law deny that any one is sacrosanct by virtue of this statute, but maintain that <pb id="p.185"/>the man who has injured any of these officials is<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> solemnly forfeited to Jupiter;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> hence the aedile may be arrested and imprisoned by the greater magistrates, an act which, though it be unlawful &mdash;for he is thereby injured who, according to this statute, may not be injured, &mdash;is nevertheless a proof that the aedile is not regarded as sacrosanct;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> whereas the tribunes are sacrosanct in consequence of the ancient oath taken by the plebs, when they first created this magistracy.<note>The legal experts seem to have held that there was a distinction between the status of the tribunes and that of the aediles based on the belief that the former had been given <hi rend="italics">sacrosanctitas</hi> at the time their office and that of the aediles was established, and that any violation of their persons automatically made the violator an outlaw (<hi rend="italics">sacer</hi>); whereas it was necessary for an aedile to bring suit against the higher magistrate and convict him of the violation, before the man became <hi rend="italics">sacer.</hi></note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There were some who taught that by this same Horatian law the consuls also were protected, and the praetors, inasmuch as they were created under the same auspices as the consuls; for the consul was called <quote>judge.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But this interpretation is refuted by the fact that it was not yet the custom in those days for the consul to be called <quote>judge,</quote> but <quote>praetor.</quote> Such were the consular laws.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The practice was also instituted by the same consuls that the decrees of the senate should be delivered to the aediles of the plebs at the temple of Ceres. Up to that time they were wont to be suppressed or falsified, at the pleasure of the consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Marcus Duillius, the tribune of the plebs, then proposed to the plebs, and they so decreed, that whosoever should leave the plebs without tribunes and whosoever should declare the election of a magistrate without appeal should be scourged and beheaded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All these measures, though they were passed against the will of the patricians, were yet not opposed by them, <pb id="p.187"/>since, so far, no one person had been singled out<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> for attack.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, when the tribunician power and the liberty of the plebs were firmly established, the tribunes, believing that it was now safe to proceed against individuals and that the time was ripe for doing so, selected Verginius to bring the first accusation and Appius to be defendant.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When Verginius had cited Appius to appear, and the latter, attended by a crowd of young patricians, had come down into the Forum, there was instantly revived in the minds of all the recollection of that most wicked power, as soon as they caught sight of the man himself and his satellites.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Verginius said, <quote>Oratory was invented for doubtful matters; and so I shall neither waste time in arraigning before you the man from whose cruelty you freed yourselves with arms, nor shall I suffer him to add to his other crimes the impudence of defending himself.<note>Verginius did not mean to deprive Appius of the right to speak eventually in his own defence, as we see in chap. lvii. &sect; 6, but merely to abridge the preliminary hearing. He therefore proposed a <hi rend="italics">sponsio</hi> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. xxiv. &sect; 5) to determine the guilt or innocence of Appius on one essential point.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I therefore pardon you, Appius Claudius, all the impious and wicked deeds which you dared, during two years, to heap one upon another; on one charge only, unless you shall name a referee to establish your innocence of having illegally assigned custody of a free person to him who claimed her as his slave, I shall order you to be taken to prison.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Neither in the protection of the tribunes nor in the decision of the people had Appius anything to hope; yet he called upon the tribunes, and when none of them would stay proceedings, and he had been arrested by an officer, he cried, <quote>I appeal.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The sound of this word, the one safeguard of liberty, coming from that mouth by which, shortly before, a free person had been given into the <pb id="p.189"/>custody of one who claimed her as a slave,<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> produced a hush.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And while the people muttered, each man to himself, that there were gods after all, who did not neglect the affairs of men; and that pride and cruelty were receiving their punishment, which though late was nevertheless not light &mdash;that
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he was appealing who had nullified appeal; that he was imploring the protection of the people who had trodden all the rights of the people under foot; that he was being carried off to prison, deprived of his right to liberty, who had condemned the person of a free citizen to slavery &mdash;the voice of Appius himself was heard amidst the murmurs of the assembly, beseeching the Roman People to protect him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He reminded them of the services his forefathers had rendered the state in peace and in war; of his own unfortunate affection for the Roman plebs, in consequence of which he had given up his consulship &mdash;in order to make the laws equal for all &mdash;with great offence to the patricians; &mdash;of the laws he had himself drawn up,<note>The Twelve Tables.</note> which were still standing while their author was being dragged off to prison.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For the rest, when he should be given an opportunity to plead his cause, he would try what would come of his own peculiar services and shortcomings; at present he asked that, in accordance with the common right of citizenship, he be permitted, being a Roman citizen and under accusation, to speak, and to be judged by the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He did not so fear men's malice as to have no hope in the justice and pity of his fellow citizens. But if he was to be imprisoned, his cause unheard, he appealed once more to the tribunes of the plebs, and warned them not to <pb id="p.191"/>imitate those whom they hated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And if the tribunes<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> should confess that they were bound by the same agreement which they charged the decemvirs with having entered into, not to hear an appeal, he still appealed to the people, and invoked the laws, both consular and tribunician, which had been enacted concerning appeals that very year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For who, he asked, should make an appeal, if a man who had not been condemned, whose cause had not been heard, might not do so? What humble plebeian would find protection in the laws, if they afforded none to Appius Claudius? His own case would show whether the new statutes had established tyranny or freedom, and whether the appeal to the tribunes and that to the people against the injustice of magistrates had been merely a parade of meaningless forms, or had been really granted.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Against this plea Verginius asserted that Appius Claudius alone was beyond the pale of the laws and of the rights of citizens and men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He bade his hearers look on the tribunal, the stronghold of all crimes, where that man, as perpetual decemvir, deadly foe to their fortunes, their persons, and their lives, threatening them all with rods and axes, despising gods and men, backed by executioners instead of lictors, had began to turn his thoughts from rapine and murder to lust;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and, in full sight of the Roman People, had torn a free maiden from her father's arms, as though she had been a captive taken in war, and bestowed her as a gift upon his pimp and client; &mdash;the
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> tribunal where, by his tyrannical decree and wicked judgments, he had armed a father's right hand against his daughter; where, as they were lifting up the body of the dying girl, he had <pb id="p.193"/>ordered her betrothed and her uncle to be haled to<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> prison &mdash;more moved by the disappointing of his pleasure than by her death. For Appius too had been built that prison which he was wont to call the home of the Roman plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, though he should again and repeatedly appeal, he would himself again and repeatedly challenge him to prove before a referee that he had not adjudged a free citizen to the custody of one who claimed her as a slave. Should he refuse to go before a referee, he bade him be led to gaol, as one found guilty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Though none raised his voice in disapproval, there were yet profound misgivings on the part of the plebs when he was cast into prison, since they saw in the punishment of so great a man a sign that their own liberty was already grown excessive. The tribune appointed a day for the continuance of the trial.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Meanwhile from the Latins and the Hernici came envoys to congratulate the Romans upon the harmony subsisting between the patricians and the plebs; and to commemorate it they brought a gift for Jupiter Optimus Maximus, to the Capitol. This was a golden crown, of no great weight, for their states were not rich, and they observed the worship of the gods with piety rather than magnificence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From these same envoy came the information that the Aequi and the Volsci were making strenuous preparations for war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consuls were therefore bidden to divide the commands between them. To Horatius fell the campaign against the Sabines; to Valerius that against the Aequi.<note>And the Volsci, apparently, see chap. lx. &sect; 1.</note> When they had proclaimed a levy for these wars, the plebs showed so much good-will <pb id="p.195"/>that not only the juniors but also a great number<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> of volunteers who had served their time presented themselves for enrolment, with the result that not alone in numbers but in the quality of the troops as well, owing to the admixture of veterans, the army was stronger than usual.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Before they left the City, the consuls had the decemviral laws, which are known as the Twelve Tables, engraved on bronze, and set them up in a public place. Some authors say that the aediles, acting under orders from the tribunes, performed this service.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gaius Claudius, who loathed the wickedness of the decemvirs and was particularly offended by his nephew's insolence, had retired to Regillus, the ancient seat of his family. He was advanced in years, but he returned to Rome to beg for the pardon of the man whose vices he had fled. In sordid garments, accompanied by his clansmen and clients, he went about the Forum, soliciting the support of one citizen after another, beseeching them that they would not seek to brand the Claudian race with the shame of being held to merit imprisonment and chains.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A man whose portrait-mask would be held in the highest honour by coming generations, the framer of statutes and the founder of Roman law, lay in prison among night-prowling thieves and banditti.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Let them turn their minds from wrath, for a moment, to consider and reflect upon the matter; and let them sooner forgive one man, at the entreaty of so many Claudii, than scorn, in their hatred of one, the prayers of many.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He was doing this, he said, out of regard to his family and his name; nor had there been any reconciliation between him and the man whose adversity he sought to succour. By <pb id="p.197"/>courage they had got back their liberty; by showing<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> mercy they had it in their power to establish harmony between the orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were some whom he moved, more by his family-loyalty than by the cause of the man for whom he pleaded. But Verginius begged them rather to pity himself and his daughter, and to hearken, not to the entreaties of the Claudian family, whose province it was to tyrannize over the plebs, but instead to those of Verginia's relations, the three plebeian tribunes, who had been appointed to help the plebs but were themselves imploring the plebs to protect and comfort them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Men found more reason in his tears. And so Appius, cut off from hope, did not wait for the appointed day to come, but killed himself.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Immediately thereafter Publius Numitorius caused the arrest of Spurius Oppius, who stood next in point of unpopularity, because he had been in the City when the unjust verdict was pronounced by his colleague.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Yet a wrong which Oppius committed was more responsible for men's bitterness towards him than the one which he failed to prevent. A witness was produced who, after enumerating his twenty-seven campaigns, during which he had eight times received special decorations, which he wore in full sight of the people, tore open his tunic and exhibited his back, scored by the rods, professing that if the defendant could name any crime of which he had been guilty, he would suffer him without complaining, private citizen though he was, to vent his rage upon him a second time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Oppius too was led to prison, and before the day of trial he there put an end to his life. The property of Claudius and that of Oppius was <pb id="p.199"/>confiscated by the tribunes. Their colleagues in the<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> decemvirate went into exile, and their possessions were forfeited.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcus Claudius also, the claimant of Verginia, was cited and condemned, but at the instance of Verginius himself the extreme penalty was remitted; and being allowed to depart, he went into exile at Tibur.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so the manes of Verginia, who was more fortunate after her death than she had been while alive, after ranging through so many houses in quest of vengeance, were finally at peace; for no guilty man remained.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A great fear had come over the patricians, and the bearing of the tribunes was now just what that of the decemvirs had been, when Marcus Duillius, a tribune of the plebs, placed a salutary check upon their excessive power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Our own liberty,</quote> he declared, <quote>and the exaction of penalties from our enemies have gone far enough; I shall therefore this year allow no one to be arraigned or thrown into gaol.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For on the one hand it is not good to rake up old offences, already blotted out of memory, now that recent crimes have been expiated by the punishment of the decemvirs; and on the other hand we have a guarantee that no wrong will be attempted that could call for the intervention of tribunician authority, in view of the unceasing care both consuls take to protect your liberty.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was this moderation on the tribune's part which first relieved the patricians of their fear. It also increased their dislike of the consuls, since the latter had been so wholly devoted to the plebs that the safety and independence of the patricians had been dearer to a plebeian magistracy than to their own, and their opponents had grown sated <pb id="p.201"/>with punishing them before the consuls evinced any<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> intention of opposing their licence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And there were many who said that the senate had shown a want of resolution in having voted for the measures proposed by the consuls; and indeed there was no doubt that in the troubled state of public affairs they had yielded to the times.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls, having set affairs in order in the City and established the position of the plebs, departed to their respective commands.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Valerius, facing the armies of the Aequi and Volsci, which had already effected a junction on Mount Algidus, deliberately postponed engaging them; had he risked an immediate decision, it is likely &mdash;such was the difference in spirit between the Romans and the enemy, in consequence of the godless dealings of the decemvirs &mdash;that the struggle would have cost him a severe defeat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He established his camp a mile from the enemy and kept his men within the works. The enemy repeatedly drew up their troops in fighting order on the ground between the camps, and challenged the Romans to come out and engage them; but no one answered them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At length, weary with standing and waiting, to no purpose, for the battle, the Aequi and Volsci concluded that the Romans had virtually yielded them the victory; and marched off to pillage, some against the Hernici, others against the Latins, leaving behind what was rather a garrison for the camp than a sufficient force for giving battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On perceiving this the consul repaid the fear he had previously been made to feel, and forming a line of battle, himself provoked the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Since they declined the combat, conscious of their want of strength, the <pb id="p.203"/>Romans felt an immediate access of courage, and<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> regarded their opponents, cowering behind the palisade, as beaten men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After standing in line all day intent on fighting, the Romans withdrew at nightfall. And they, on their side, were full of hope, as they ate their evening meal; but the enemy's spirits were by no means so high, and they sent out couriers far and wide, in great alarm, to recall the marauders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The nearest of these hastened back; but those who were farther afield could not be found. As soon as it was light, the Romans sallied from their camp, intending to assault the rampart, unless the enemy gave battle. So, when the day was now far spent and the enemy made no move, the consul ordered an advance. The Roman line having got in motion, the Aequi and Volsci were ashamed that their victorious armies should depend for protection upon stockades, instead of valour and the sword. Accordingly they too demanded of their leaders, and received, the signal to attack.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A part had already passed out through the gates and the rest were following in good order, each man coming out into his proper place; when the Roman consul, not waiting till the enemy's line should be strongly posted in full force, advanced to the charge.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The attack, which he delivered before their troops had all been brought out, and when those who had been were insufficiently deployed, found little more than a surging mob of men, who as they hurried this way and that cast anxious looks at one another and wished for their missing friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The shouting and the fury of the onset increased their agitation, and at first they fell back; then, when they had collected their wits and on <pb id="p.205"/>every side heard their officers wrathfully demanding<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> if they meant to yield to troops whom they had beaten, they rallied and held their own.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, on the other side, bade the Romans remember that on that day they were for the first time fighting as free men for a free Rome. They would be conquering for themselves, not that they might become the spoil of decemvirs in the hour of victory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was no Appius who was commanding them, but the consul Valerius, descendant of liberators of the Roman People, and himself their liberator. Let them show that in previous battles it had been the fault of the generals, not of the soldiers, that they had failed to win.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It would be disgraceful to have shown more courage in facing their fellow citizens than in facing the enemy, and to have been more fearful of enslavement at home than abroad.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> No one's chastity but Verginia's had been in danger while they were at peace, no citizen but Appius had been possessed of a dangerous lust; but if the fortune of war turned against them, the children of all of them would be in danger from all those thousands of enemies;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> yet he would not utter an omen which neither Jupiter nor Mars their Father would suffer to come home to a City founded with such auspices.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He reminded them of the Aventine and the Sacred Mount, that they might bring back an undiminished power to the spot where liberty had a few months before been won, and might show that the nature of Rome's soldiers was the same after the expulsion of the decemvirs that it had been before they were elected, and that equality before the law had not lessened the courage of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having pronounced these words <pb id="p.207"/>amid the standards of the infantry, he hastened to<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> the cavalry. <quote>Come, young men,</quote> he cried, <quote>surpass the foot-soldiers in daring as you do in honour and in rank!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the first encounter the infantry have forced the enemy back; now that they are repulsed, do you give rein to your horses and drive them from the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They will not sustain the shock; even now they are rather hesitating than resisting.</quote> Clapping spurs to their horses they charged the enemy, already disordered by the infantry-attack, and penetrating his lines, dashed through to the rear; while another division made a detour over unoccupied ground, and finding the enemy everywhere in flight turned most of them back from their camp and frightened them off by riding across their course.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The infantry and the consul himself swept on into the camp in the full tide of battle, and took possession of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The enemy's losses in men were great, but in booty were even greater.</p> 
			<p>The report of this battle having been brought not only to Rome but also to the Sabine country and the other army, was celebrated in the City with rejoicings, and in the camp inspired the soldiers with a desire to emulate the glorious achievement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Horatius had already accustomed them, by practice in raids and skirmishes, to be self-reliant, instead of dwelling on the disgrace they had incurred under the leadership of the decemvirs; and small engagements had encouraged the highest hopes of the general outcome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Nor were the Sabines backward &mdash;emboldened as they were by their victory of the year before &mdash;with challenges and threats. Why, they asked, did the Romans waste their time advancing swiftly in small companies, like brigands, and as hurriedly retreating; <pb id="p.209"/>thus dissipating in many little combats the issues of<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> one pitched battle?
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Why did they not attack in line and suffer fortune to decide the matter once for all?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Besides the fact that they had of themselves accumulated a good store of confidence, the Romans were also kindled with indignation. The other army, they said, would presently be returning victorious to the City; they themselves were actually being insulted and reviled by the enemy; but when should they be a match for him, if they were not at that moment?
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consul became aware how the soldiers were murmuring in the camp, he called them together. <quote>Soldiers,</quote> said he, <quote>you have heard, I suppose, how matters have gone on Algidus. The army has proved to be such as it was fitting that the army of a free people should be. By my colleague's strategy and the bravery of his men a victory has been won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As for me, my strategy and my courage will be what you make them yourselves. It is within our power either to prolong the war with advantage or to bring it to a speedy and successful end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If it is to be prolonged, I shall seek to increase your hopes and courage from day to day by the same course of training I have begun; if your spirits are already high enough and you wish the war to be decided, come, give a shout here in the camp, to show your good-will and your courage, like the cheer you will raise in the battle!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The shout was given with great alacrity, and the consul promised, invoking good fortune on the enterprise, that he would do as they wished and lead them forth to battle on the morrow. The rest of the day they spent in making ready their arms.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.211"/>
			<p>Next day, as soon as the Sabines saw the Romans<note type="margin">B.C. 442</note> forming, they came out themselves, for they had long been eager to fight. It was a battle such as takes place when both armies are confident; for the glory of the one was ancient and unbroken, and the other was exalted by its recent unaccustomed victory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Moreover the Sabines employed a stratagem to increase their strength; for when they had marshalled a front of equal extent with the Roman, they held two thousand men in reserve to hurl against their opponent's left, as soon as the battle should be under way.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These troops, attacking in flank, had almost encompassed that wing, and were beginning to overpower it; when the cavalry of the two legions, numbering about six hundred, leaped down from their horses and rushed to the front, where their comrades were already giving ground. There they made a stand against the foe and at the same time roused the courage of the infantry, first by sharing the danger on equal terms, and then by causing them to feel ashamed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They felt humiliated that the cavalry should be fighting in their own fashion and in that of infantry too, and that the infantry should not be as good as the horsemen, even when these were dismounted.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="63"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They therefore renewed the battle which on their flank had been given up, and advanced again into the position from which they had retreated, and in a trice the fighting was not merely even, but the Sabine wing had begun to yield.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The horsemen, under cover of the ranks of infantry, regained their mounts. Then they galloped across to the other wing, announcing the victory to their friends; and at the same time they made a charge against the <pb id="p.213"/>enemy, who were already panic-stricken, as they<note type="margin">B.C.449</note> might well be when the stronger of their wings had been defeated. No other troops showed more conspicuous courage in that battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul looked out for every contingency, commended the brave, and upbraided any who fought listlessly. Being rebuked they would at once begin to acquit themselves like men, &mdash;shame proving as powerful an incentive to them as praise to the others.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With a fresh cheer all along the line the Romans made a concerted effort and drove the enemy back, and from that moment there was no resisting the violence of their onset. The Sabines fled in confusion through the fields and left their camp to be plundered by their foes. There the Romans won back not the possessions of their allies, as on Algidus, but their own which had earlier been lost to them through the raids on their lands.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Though a double victory had been gained in two separate battles, the senate was so mean as to decree thanksgivings in the name of the consuls for one day only. The people went unbidden on the second day also in great numbers, to offer up thanks to the gods; and this unorganized and popular supplication was attended with an enthusiasm which almost exceeded that of the other.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls had arranged to approach the City within a day of one another, and summoned the senate out into the Campus Martius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While they were there holding forth on the subject of their victories, complaints were made by leading senators that the senate was being held in the midst of the army on purpose to inspire fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so the consuls, to allow no room for the accusation, adjourned the senate from that place to the Flaminian Meadows, where the temple of Apollo <pb id="p.215"/>is now, and which was called even then Apollo's<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> Precinct. When the Fathers, meeting there, refused with great unanimity to grant a triumph, Lucius Icilius the plebeian tribune laid the issue before the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Many came forward to dissuade them, and Gaius Claudius was particularly vehement. It was a triumph, he said, over the patricians, not Rome's enemies, which the consuls desired; they were seeking a favour in return for personal services they had done the tribune, not an honour in requital of valour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Never before had a triumph been voted by the people; the decision whether this honour had been deserved had always rested with the senate; not even the kings had infringed the majesty of the highest order in the state; let not the tribunes so dominate all things as not to suffer the existence of any public council; if each order retained its own rights and its own dignity, then, and only then, would the state be free and the laws equal for all.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After many speeches had been made to the same purpose by the other older members of the senate, all the tribes voted in favour of the motion. Then, for the first time, a triumph which lacked the authorization of the senate was celebrated at the bidding of the people.<note>It was not the last time, however (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> vii. xvii. 9). Sometimes the consul triumphed without the authorization of either senate or plebs (x. xxxvii. 8), in which case the ceremony took place on the Alban Mount; sometimes by virtue of a plebiscite confirmed by resolution of the senate (iv. xx. 1). But unless granted by the senate the triumph was paid for by the victorious consul, instead of by the state.</note></p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="64"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This victory of the tribunes and the commons had nearly resulted in a dangerous abuse; for the tribunes conspired together to obtain their re-election, and, that their own ambition might be less conspicuous, to procure as well the return to office of the consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their pretext was the solidarity of the patricians, which had operated, by injurious treatment of the consuls, to break down the authority of the tribunes of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What <pb id="p.217"/>would happen if, ere the laws were firmly<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> established, the new tribunes should be assailed through the agency of consuls belonging to the patricians' own party? For there would not always be consuls like Valerius and Horatius, who preferred the liberty of the plebs to their own interests.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By a fortunate chance in this emergency the superintendence of the elections fell by lot to none other than Marcus Duillius, a far-seeing man who perceived that the re-election of the magistrates would be fraught with odium.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But when he asserted that he would not consider the candidacy of any of the former tribunes, his colleagues vehemently insisted that he should receive the suffrages of the tribes without restriction, or else resign the presidency of the election to his fellow-tribunes, who would conduct the voting in accordance with the law rather than the desires of the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A controversy having thus arisen, Duillius summoned the consuls before the benches of the tribunes and asked them what course they meant to pursue in the consular elections; and finding, by their replying that they should have new consuls chosen, that he had got in them popular supporters of his unpopular policy, he went with them before the assembly.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the consuls, on being there brought forth to the people and asked what they would do if the Roman People, mindful of their help in the recovery of liberty at
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> home and remembering their military successes, should again elect them to office, declined to alter their determination, Duillius first praised the consuls for persisting to the end in their unlikeness to the decemvirs, and then held the election. And after five tribunes had been chosen <pb id="p.219"/>and no other candidates obtained a majority of the<note type="margin">B.C. 449</note> tribes, on account of the eagerness with which the nine incumbents openly sought re-election, he dismissed the assembly, nor did he afterwards convene it for an election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He declared that the law had been satisfied, which, without anywhere prescribing the number, provided only that the tribunate should not be left vacant; and directed that those who had been elected should co-opt colleagues.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He recited too the formula of the announcement, in which the following words occurred: <quote><hi rend="italics">If</hi> I shall call for your suffrages for ten tribunes of the plebs; if for any reason you shall elect to-day less than ten tribunes of the plebs, then let those whom the elected tribunes co-opt as their colleagues be as legally tribunes of the plebs as those whom you shall this day have chosen to that office.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Having persevered to the end in denying that the state could have fifteen plebeian tribunes,<note>More accurately <quote>fourteen,</quote> since the reference is to the five whose election Duillius recognized, together with the nine incumbents who claimed re-election.</note> and having defeated the cupidity of his colleagues, Duillius laid down his magistracy, approved by patricians and plebs alike.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="65"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new tribunes of the plebs consulted<note type="margin">B.C. 448-447</note> the wishes of the nobles in the co-optation of colleagues; they even chose two who were patricians and ex-consuls, Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus Aternius.<note>The <hi rend="italics">lex sacrata</hi> (II. xxxiii. 1) denied patricians access to the tribunate, but apparently there was at this time a disposition to wink at their co-optation. Tarpeius and Aternius had been consuls in <date value="-454">454 B.C.</date></note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The new consuls, Spurius Herminius and Titus Verginius Caelimontanus, being specially devoted neither to the cause of the patricians nor to that of the plebs, enjoyed a peaceful year both at home <pb id="p.221"/>and abroad.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Lucius Trebonius, a tribune of the<note type="margin">B.C. 448-447</note> commons, being angry with the patricians, because, as he said, he had been defrauded by them in the co-optation of the tribunes and had been betrayed by his
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> colleagues,<note>When they co-opted patricians.</note> proposed a law that he who called upon the Roman plebs to elect tribunes should continue to call upon them until he should effect the election of ten; and he so baited the nobles during his year of office as even to gain the surname of <hi rend="italics">Asper,</hi> or <quote>the Truculent.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Next, Marcus Geganius Macerinus and Gaius Julius became consuls, and assuaged the strife of the tribunes with the young nobles, without censuring those magistrates or sacrificing the dignity of the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They withheld the plebs from sedition by suspending a levy which had been decreed with a view to making war on the Volsci and the Aequi, averring that so long as the City was quiet their foreign relations were likewise entirely peaceful; that it was discord in Rome which made other nations take heart.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The pains they were at to maintain peace were also productive of internal harmony. But the one order was always taking advantage of the moderation of the other; the plebs were tranquil, but the younger patricians began to insult them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the tribunes attempted to assist the lowly, at first their services were of little effect; and later they did not even escape violence themselves, especially in the last months of their term, since not only were wrongs committed through cabals of the more powerful, but the effectiveness of every magistrate rather languished, as a rule, in the latter part of the year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> By this time the plebs had ceased to count upon <pb id="p.223"/>the tribunate, unless they could have tribunes like<note type="margin">B.C. 448-447</note> Icilius; for two years they had had mere names.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The elder patricians, for their part, though they thought their young men too headstrong, yet preferred, if moderation must be left behind, that the excess of spirits should be on their side rather than with their adversaries.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So difficult is it to be moderate in the defence of liberty, since everyone, while pretending to seek fair-play, so raises himself as to press another down; while insuring themselves against fear, men actually render themselves fearful to others; and having defended ourselves from an injury, we proceed &mdash;as though it were necessary either to do or suffer wrong &mdash;to inflict injury upon our neighbour.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="66"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Titus Quinctius Capitolinus (for the fourth<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> time) and Agrippa Furius were then made consuls. They experienced neither domestic sedition nor foreign war, but were threatened with both.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The strife between citizens could now no longer be repressed, since tribunes and plebs alike were inflamed against the patricians, and the trial of one or another of the nobles was continually embroiling the assemblies in new quarrels.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the first disturbance in these meetings the Aequi and Volsci took up arms, as though they had received a signal, and also because their leaders, being eager for plunder, had convinced them that the Romans had found it impossible, the year before, to carry out the levy which they had proclaimed, since the plebs were no longer amenable to authority; and that this had been the reason why armies were not dispatched against themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lawlessness was breaking down their martial traditions, nor was <pb id="p.225"/>Rome any longer a united nation; all the hostility<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> and quarrelsomeness they had formerly entertained towards other nations was now being turned against themselves; the wolves<note>Alluding to the wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus.</note> were blinded with mad rage at one another, and there was now an opportunity to destroy them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Combining their armies, they first desolated the country of the Latins, and then, when it appeared that there was no one in that region to punish them, they carried their marauding, amidst the triumphant rejoicings of the advocates of war, to the very walls of Rome, in the direction of the Esquiline Gate, where they insolently exhibited to the inhabitants of the City the devastation of their lands.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After they had withdrawn unmolested, and driving their booty before them had marched to Corbio, the consul Quinctius summoned the people to an assembly.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="67"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There he spoke, as I understand, to the following effect: "Although I am conscious, Quirites, of no wrong-doing, nevertheless it is with great shame that I have come to this assembly to confront you. To think that you know, to think that future generations will be told, that the Aequi and the Volsci, but now scarce a match for the Hernici, have in the fourth consulship of Titus Quinctius approached the walls of the City of Rome &mdash;with impunity, and armed!
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> We have now for a long time been living under such conditions that my mind could foresee nothing good; yet had I known that such a disgrace was in store for this year, of all others, I should have shunned it even at the cost of exile or of death, in default of other means of escaping office. So! Had they been men whose swords were there at our gates, Rome might have been captured in my consulship!
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.227"/>I had enjoyed honours enough, I had had enough,<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> and more than enough, of life; death should have come to me in my third consulship. For whom, pray, did the most dastardly of our enemies feel such contempt?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For us, the consuls, or for you, Quirites? If the fault is ours, deprive us of authority we do not merit; and if that is not enough, then punish us to boot: if yours, may neither god nor man seek to punish your sins, Quirites; only may you yourselves repent of them!
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was not cowardice in you that they despised, nor was it their own courage in which they put their trust; in truth they have been too often beaten and routed, despoiled of their camps, stripped of their lands, and sent under the yoke, not to know both themselves and you: it was the discord betwixt the classes, and the quarrels &mdash;poison of this City &mdash;between the patricians and the plebs that roused their hopes, as they beheld our greed for power and yours for liberty; your disgust at the patrician magistracies and ours at the plebeian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In Heaven's name what would you have? You conceived a longing for tribunes of the plebs; for the sake of harmony we granted them. You desired decemvirs; we allowed them to be elected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> You grew exceedingly weary of the decemvirs; we compelled them to abdicate. When your resentment against them persisted in their retirement to private life, we permitted men of the highest birth and the most distinguished careers to suffer death and exile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Again you desired to choose tribunes of the plebs, and chose them; to appoint consuls of your own faction, and though we saw that this was unfair to the patricians, we beheld even the patrician magistracy presented to the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That you should <pb id="p.229"/>enjoy the support of tribunes and the right of appeal<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> to the people; that the decrees of the plebs should be made binding upon the patricians; that on the pretext of equalizing the laws our rights should be trodden under foot &mdash;all this we have endured and are now enduring.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> What end will there be to our dissensions? Will a time ever come when we can have a united City? Will a time ever come when this can be our common country? We, the beaten party, accept the situation with more equanimity than do you, the victors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Is it not enough that we must fear you? It was against us that the Aventine was taken; against us that the Sacred Mount was occupied; we have seen the Esquiline almost captured by the enemy, and the Volscian mounting our rampart. The enemy found none to drive him back; against us you show your manhood; against us you have drawn the sword.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="69"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rarely has the speech of a popular tribune been more agreeable to the plebs than was at that time this speech by the sternest of consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Even the young men, who amid such alarms were wont to regard a refusal to enlist as their sharpest weapon <pb id="p.235"/>against the nobles, began to look forward to war<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> and arms. And the flight of the country-people and the presence of those who had been plundered while on their farms and wounded, and who reported worse outrages than those which met the eyes of the citizens, filled all Rome with resentment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the senate had met, then in truth all turned to Quinctius, whom they looked on as the sole champion of Roman majesty. The foremost senators declared that his speech had been worthy of the consular authority, worthy of the many consulships he had held in the past, worthy of his whole life, crowded as it had been with honours which, often as he had received them, he had still oftener deserved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Other consuls had either flattered the plebs by betraying the dignity of the patricians, or by harshly inforcing the rights of their order had exasperated the populace while seeking to subjugate them; Titus Quinctius had spoken without forgetting the dignity of the patricians, or the harmony of the orders, or &mdash;what was particularly important &mdash;the existing crisis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They begged him and his colleague to undertake the guidance of the state; they besought the tribunes to unite with the consuls in a single-minded effort to repel their enemies from the walls of the City, and to cause the plebs to yield obedience to the patricians in so alarming a situation; the appeal to the tribunes came, they said, from their common country, which implored their assistance for its wasted fields and its well-nigh beleaguered City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By general consent a levy was proclaimed and held. The consuls announced in the assembly that there was no time to consider excuses; that all the juniors should present <pb id="p.237"/>themselves at dawn of the following day in the Campus<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> Martius;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that they would take time when the war was over to listen to the excuses of those who had failed to hand in their names; and that any man whose excuse they did not approve would be treated as a deserter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Next day the entire body of young men appeared. The cohorts each chose their own centurions, and two senators were put in command of every cohort. We are told that all these measures were carried out so promptly that the standards were fetched from the treasury by the quaestors that very day, and being carried to the Campus Martius, headed the line of march from the mustering ground at ten o'clock in the morning; and the newly recruited army, with the voluntary escort of a few cohorts of veterans, encamped over night at the tenth mile-stone.<note>On the Latin Way.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The following day brought the enemy into view, and the Roman camp was established close to theirs, near Corbio.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the third day, the Romans being urged on by indignation, and the enemy, who had so often revolted, by the consciousness of their guilt and by despair, no attempt was made to delay the battle.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="70"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although the two consuls were of equal authority in the Roman army, yet they made an arrangement which is extremely advantageous in the administration of important measures, by which Agrippa yielded the supreme command to his colleague. The latter, thus preferred, responded courteously to the ready self-effacement of the other by admitting him to a share in his plans and his achievements, and treating him as an equal, despite his inferiority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the battle-line Quinctius held the right wing, Agrippa the left; to Spurius Postumius <pb id="p.239"/>Albus, the lieutenant, they gave the centre in<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> charge; and the other lieutenant, Publius Sulpicius, they put in command of the horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The infantry on the right fought brilliantly, and were vigorously resisted by the Volsci.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Publius Sulpicius broke through the enemy's centre with his cavalry. He might have returned to the Roman side the way he went, before the enemy could re-form their broken ranks; but it seemed better to assail them in the rear. It would have been but the work of a moment to charge them from behind and throw them into confusion between the two attacks; but the Volscian and Aequian cavalry met him with his own kind of troops and held him in check for some little while.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thereupon Sulpicius cried out that there was no time for hesitation; they were surrounded and cut off from their fellows, unless they put forth all their might and disposed of the enemy's cavalry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor was it enough to rout them and let them get safely off; they must destroy them, horse and man, that none might ride back into the battle or renew the fight. It would be impossible, he said, for their cavalry to resist his men, when the close ranks of their infantry had given way before them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His words did not fall upon deaf ears. With a single rush the Romans routed the entire body of cavalry. Hurling great numbers of them from their horses, they transfixed men and steeds with their javelins.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This ended the cavalry-battle. Then they fell upon the hostile infantry, and sent off gallopers to announce their success to the consuls, where the enemy's line was already beginning to give way.<note>Livy is thinking chiefly of Quinctius. From &sect; 10 it appears that Agrippa's victory came later.</note> The tidings at once aroused fresh ardour in the conquering Romans and <pb id="p.241"/>filled the faltering Aequi with confusion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> in the centre that their defeat began, where the attack of the troopers had thrown their ranks into disorder; then the left wing began to fall back before the consul Quinctius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Romans experienced most difficulty on the right; there Agrippa, young, active, and courageous, perceiving that the battle was everywhere going better than on his own front, snatched the standards from the men who bore them, and began to carry them forward himself, and even to fling some of them into the press of the enemy. The disgrace with which his soldiers were thus threatened spurred them to the attack, and the victory was extended to every part of the line.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A message then came from Quinctius, saying that he had beaten the enemy and was already threatening their camp, but did not wish to storm it until he knew that the fight had been decided on the left wing also;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> if Agrippa had already defeated his opponents, let him bring up his troops, that the entire army might enter together into possession of the spoils. The victorious Agrippa accordingly joined his victorious colleague, with mutual congratulations, in front of the enemy's camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Its handful of defenders was speedily put to flight, and the Romans burst into the entrenchments without encountering resistance. The consuls led their army back to the City laden with a vast quantity of booty, as well as with the goods which they had lost by the pillage of their fields but had now recovered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> I do not find either that the consuls themselves asked for a triumph or that one was offered them by the senate; nor is there any record of the reason why <pb id="p.243"/>they despised the honour or did not hope for it.<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The best conjecture I myself can offer, after so long an interval of time, is this: since the consuls Valerius and Horatius, who besides beating the Volsci and Aequi had also attained renown by bringing the Sabine war to a successful conclusion, had been refused a triumph by the senate, they were ashamed to ask for that distinction in recompense of an achievement only half as great, lest even if it should be granted, it might seem that account had been taken rather of persons than of deserts.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="71"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The glory of defeating the enemy was sullied by a shameful judgment given by the people in Rome regarding the boundaries of her allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The men of Aricia and those of Ardea had often gone to war over a territory which both cities claimed. Exhausted by the many defeats which each had experienced, they referred their quarrel to the Roman People for decision.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they had come to plead their cause, and a popular assembly had been granted them by the magistrates, they argued their respective claims with great vehemence. The testimony had already been taken, and the time had come for the tribes to be summoned and the people to give their votes, when Publius Scaptius, an aged plebeian, arose and said: <quote>If I am permitted, consuls, to speak concerning the nation's interests, I will not suffer the people to go wrong in this matter.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls declared that he was an untrustworthy fellow and ought not to be listened to, and when he protested noisily that the public cause was being betrayed, they ordered him to be removed; whereat he appealed to the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The tribunes, as almost always <pb id="p.245"/>happens, were swayed by the crowd, instead of<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> swaying it, and, to please the greedy ears of the plebs, gave Scaptius leave to say what he wished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He therefore began, and said that he was eighty-two years old and had fought in the army, in that district which was under discussion, not as a youth, but as one already in his twentieth year of service at the time of the campaign before Corioli.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hence it came that he was telling them of a matter forgotten with the lapse of years, but fixed in his own memory, namely that the disputed land had been a part of the territory of Corioli, and had consequently, on the capture of that town, become, by right of conquest, the property of the Roman People. He marvelled, he said, at the effrontery with which the men of Ardea and Aricia hoped to deprive the Roman People &mdash;whom they had made the judge, in place of being the owner &mdash;of a territory over which they had never exercised any authority so long as the state of Corioli was intact.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had himself but a little while to live; yet he had not been able to convince himself that, having as a soldier done his part to conquer the land, he should not defend it, even in his old age, with the only weapon left him, to wit his voice.

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consuls had perceived that Scaptius was listened to not only in silence but actually with approval, they called on gods and men to witness that a great outrage was being perpetrated, and sent for the leaders of the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With them they went about among the tribes and implored <pb id="p.247"/>them not to be guilty of an act which, utterly wrong<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> in itself, would establish a precedent that was even worse, by diverting to their own possession, as judges, the property in dispute; and that too when, even if it were right that a judge should be concerned for his own advantage, they would by no means gain so much by the seizure of the land as they would lose by the wrongful estrangement of their allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For reputation at least and trustworthiness were things the loss of which was beyond all reckoning. Was this to be the report carried home by the envoys? Was this to be noised abroad and come to the ears of allies and enemies?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What grief it would cause the former, and what joy the latter! Did they suppose that Scaptius, a meddling old hanger-on of assemblies, would be held responsible for this by the neighbouring nations? It would be a famous thing for Scaptius to have inscribed beneath his portrait, but the Roman People would be playing a role of chicanery and of usurpation of the claims of others.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For what umpire in a private suit would have thought of awarding to himself the object of litigation? Even Scaptius, though he had already outlived all sense of shame, would not do that.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These arguments were loudly urged both by the consuls and by the Fathers; but they were less convincing than men's cupidity, or than Scaptius, who had aroused it. The tribes, being called upon to vote, decided the territory to be public land belonging to the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor is it denied that such would have been the verdict if recourse had been had to another court; but in the circumstances the excellence of the cause did not in the slightest degree extenuate the disgrace of the judgment, <pb id="p.249"/>which seemed no less scandalous and harsh to the<note type="margin">B.C. 446</note> Roman senators than to the men of Aricia and Ardea.

			<p>THERE were quarrels about land-laws. The Capitol
				was seized by exiles and slaves; who were slain and
				the Capitol recovered. The census was taken twice. By
				the earlier enumeration there were returned 8714<note>Livy III. iii. 9 gives the numbers as 104,714. Apparently there has been a mistake in copying the Periochae due to the confusion of CIIII and viii.</note> citizens,
				besides male and female wards; by the second 117,219.
				After a defeat had been sustained at the hands of the
				Aequi, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, being appointed
				dictator, was summoned to the control of the war while
				engaged in working on his farm. He defeated the enemy
				and sent them under the yoke. The number of tribunes
				was increased to ten in the 36th year from the election
				of the first ones. After the laws of Athens had been
				searched out and brought to Rome by envoys, decemvirs
				with consular powers were chosen, without any other
				magistrates, to draw up and publish them. It was in
				the 302nd year after the founding of Rome that the power
				was transferred from consuls to decemvirs, as it had
				formerly been from kings to consuls. When the decemvirs
				had posted up ten tables of laws, after such moderation in
				the conduct of their office that it had been voted to continue the same magistracy for another year, they added
				two tables to the ten; and after many insolent acts
				refused to lay down their authority, but retained it for
				a third year, till the lust of Appius Claudius put an end to
				their hated dominion. Having fallen in love with the
				maiden Verginia, he suborned an agent to claim her as
				his slave, and obliged her father Verginius to act. Seizing
				a knife from the nearest stall, he slew his daughter, since
				there was no other way to keep her from falling into
				the hands of the man who meditated her dishonour.
				By this great wrong the plebeians were roused to action,
				<pb id="p.253"/>
				and occupying the Aventine, forced the decemvirs to
				abdicate. Of these, Appius, who had been most guilty,
				was flung into prison; the rest were exiled. The book
				contains also successful campaigns against the Sabines
				and the Volsci, and a discreditable judgment rendered
				by the Roman People, who, being chosen umpire between
				the Ardeates and the Aricini, awarded to themselves the

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>MARCUS GENUClUS and Gaius Curtius succeeded<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> these men as consuls. It was a year of quarrels both at home and abroad. For at its commencement Gaius Canuleius, a tribune of the plebs, proposed a bill regarding the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians which the patricians looked upon as involving the debasement of their blood and the subversion of the principles inhering in the <hi rend="italics">gentes,</hi> or families;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and a suggestion, cautiously put forward at first by the tribunes, that it should be lawful for one of the consuls to be chosen from the plebs, was afterwards carried so far that nine tribunes proposed a bill giving the people power to choose consuls as they might see fit, from either the plebs or the patriciate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To carry out this last proposal would be, in the estimation of the patricians, not merely to give a share of the supreme authority to the lowest of the citizens, but actually to take it away from the nobles and bestow it on the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Fathers therefore rejoiced to hear that the people of Ardea had revolted because of the unjust decision which deprived them of their land; that the men of Veii had ravaged the Roman frontier; and that the Volsci and Aequi were murmuring at the fortification of Verrugo;<note>This is Livy's first mention of Verrugo, which was situated on a steep hill in the Trerus valley.</note> so decidedly did they prefer even an unfortunate war to an ignominious peace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly they made the most of these threats, that the proposals of the tribunes might be silenced amidst the <pb id="p.259"/>din or so many wars; and ordered levies to be held<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> and military preparations to be made with the utmost energy, and if possible, even more strenuously than had been done when Titus Quinctius was consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon Gaius Canuleius curtly proclaimed in the senate that it was in vain the consuls sought to frighten the plebs out of their concern for the new laws; and, declaring that they should never hold the levy, while he lived, until the plebs had voted on the measures which he and his colleagues had brought forward, at once convened an assembly.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At one and the same time the consuls were inciting the senate against the tribune, and the tribune was arousing the people against the consuls. The consuls declared that the frenzy of the tribunes could no longer be endured; the end had now been reached, and there was more war being stirred up at home than abroad.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This state of things was, to be sure, as much the fault of the senators as of the plebs, and the consuls were as guilty as the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That tendency which a state rewarded always attained the greatest growth; it was thus that good men were produced, both in peace and in war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In Rome the greatest reward was given to sedition, which had, therefore, ever been held in honour by all and sundry. Let them recall the majesty of the senate when they had taken it over from their fathers, and think what it was likely to be when they passed it on to their sons, and how the plebs could glory in the increase of their strength and consequence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was no end in sight, nor would be, so long as the fomenters of insurrection were honoured in proportion to the success of their projects. What tremendous schemes had Gaius Canuleius set on foot!
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was aiming to contaminate the <hi rend="italics">gentes</hi> and <pb id="p.261"/>throw the auspices, both public and private, into<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> confusion, that nothing might be pure, nothing unpolluted; so that, when all distinctions had been obliterated, no man might recognise either himself or his kindred.<note>The right to ascertain the will of the gods by auspices was claimed as an exclusively patrician prerogative. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> chap. vi. &sect; 1.</note> For what else, they asked, was the object of promiscuous marriages, if not that plebeians and patricians might mingle together almost like the beasts?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The son of such a marriage would be ignorant to what blood and to what worship he belonged; he would pertain half to the patricians, half to the plebs, and be at strife even with himself. It was not enough for the disturbers of the rabble to play havoc with all divine and human institutions: they must now aim at the consulship. And whereas they had at first merely suggested in conversations that one of the two consuls should be chosen from the plebeians,<note>This is inaccurate. We see from chap. i. &sect; 2 that the suggestion was that one of the consuls <hi rend="italics">might</hi> be (not <hi rend="italics">should</hi> be) a plebeian.</note> they were now proposing a law that the people should elect consuls at its pleasure from patriciate or plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Its choice would without doubt always fall upon plebeians of the most revolutionary sort, and the result would be that they would have consuls of the type of Canuleius and Icilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They called on Jupiter Optimus Maximus to forbid that a power regal in its majesty should sink so low. For their parts, they would sooner die a thousand deaths than suffer so shameful a thing to be done.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They felt certain that their forefathers too, had they divined that all sorts of concessions would make the commons not more tractable but more exacting, and that the granting of their first demands would lead to others, ever more unjust, would rather have faced any conflict whatsoever than have permitted such laws to be imposed upon them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Because they had yielded then, in the matter of the tribunes, they had <pb id="p.263"/>yielded a second time; it was impossible there<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> should be any settlement of the trouble, if in one and the same state there were both plebeian tribunes and patricians; one thing or the other must go, &mdash; the patriciate or the tribunate. It was better late than never to oppose their rashness and temerity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Were they to be suffered with impunity first to sow discord and stir up neighbouring wars, and then to prevent the state from arming and defending itself against the wars they had raised themselves?
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When they had all but invited in the enemy, should they refuse to allow the enrolment of armies to oppose that enemy; while Canuleius had the hardihood to announce in the senate that unless the Fathers permitted his laws to be received, as though he were a conqueror, he would forbid the levy? What else was this than a threat that he would betray his native City to attack and capture? How must that speech encourage, not the Roman plebs, but the Volsci, the Aequi, and the Veientes!
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Would they not hope that, led by Canuleius, they would be able to scale the Capitol and the Citadel? Unless the tribunes had robbed the patricians of their courage when they took away their rights and their dignity, the consuls were prepared to lead them against criminal citizens sooner than against armed enemies.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the very time when these opinions were finding expression in the senate, Canuleius held forth in this fashion in behalf of his laws and in opposition to the consuls:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> "How greatly the patricians despised you, Quirites, how unfit they deemed you to live in the City, within the same walls as themselves, I think I have often observed before, but never more clearly than at this very moment, <pb id="p.265"/>when they are rallying so fiercely against these<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> proposals of ours.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Yet what else do we intend by them than to remind our fellow citizens that we are of them, and that, though we possess not the same wealth, still we dwell in the same City they inhabit?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the one bill we seek the right of intermarriage, which is customarily granted to neighbours and foreigners &mdash;indeed we have granted citizenship, which is more than intermarriage, even to defeated enemies;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> &mdash;in the other we propose no innovation, but reclaim and seek to exercise a popular right, to wit that the Roman People shall confer office upon whom it will.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What reason is there, pray, why they should confound heaven and earth; why they should almost have attacked me just now in the senate; why they should declare that they will place no restraint on force, and should threaten to violate our sacrosanct authority?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If the Roman People is granted a free vote, that so it may commit the consulship to what hands it likes, if even the plebeian is not cut off from the hope of gaining the highest honours &mdash;if he shall be deserving of the highest honours &mdash;will this City of ours be unable to endure? Is her dominion at an end? When we raise the question of making a plebeian consul, is it the same as if we were to say that a slave or a freedman should attain that office?
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Have you any conception of the contempt in which you are held? They would take from you, were it possible, a part of this daylight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That you breathe, that you speak, that you have the shape of men, fills them with resentment. Nay, they assert, if you please, that it is sinning against Heaven to elect a plebeian consul. Tell me, if we are not admitted to consult the <pb id="p.267"/>Fasti<note><hi rend="italics">Dies fasti</hi> were the days on which it was lawful to pronounce judgment. <hi rend="italics">Fasti</hi> often means, as here, the calendar kept by the pontiffs on which such days were marked. It was not until <date value="-304">304 B.C.</date>, when Cn. Flavius posted a list of them in the Forum (ix. xlvi. 5), that the plebeians could know with certainty when they fell.</note> or the Commentaries of the Pontiffs,<note>Minutes of the proceedings of the pontifical college. They probably furnished guidance regarding ceremonies.</note> are we<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> therefore ignorant of what all men, even foreigners, know, viz. that the consuls succeeded to the place of the kings, and possess no jot nor tittle of right or dignity that belonged not to the kings before?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Come! Would you believe the story was ever heard how Numa Pompilius &mdash;not only no patrician, but not even a Roman citizen &mdash;was sent for from the country of the Sabines, and reigned at Rome, by command of the people and with the senators' consent?
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And again, how Lucius Tarquinius, who was not even of Italian stock &mdash;not to mention Roman &mdash;being the son of Demaratus of Corinth, and an immigrant from Tarquinii, was made king, while the sons of Ancus were still living?
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And how after him Servius Tullius, son of a captive woman from Corniculum, who had nobody for his father and a bond-woman for his mother, held the royal power by his innate ability and worth? For why should I speak of Titus Tatius the Sabine, with whom Romulus himself, the Father of the City, shared his sovereignty?
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Well then, so long as men despised no family that could produce conspicuous excellence, the dominion of Rome increased. And are you now to scorn a plebeian consul, when our ancestors were not above accepting alien kings, and when the City was not closed against the meritorious foreigner, even after the expulsion of the kings?
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Claudian family at least we not only received from the Sabine country, after the kings had been driven out, and gave them citizenship, but even admitted them to the number of patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Shall the son of a stranger <pb id="p.269"/>become patrician and then consul, but a Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> citizen, if plebeian, be cut off from all hope of the consulship?
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Do we not believe it possible that a bold and strenuous man, serviceable both in peace and in war, should come from the plebs, &mdash;a man like Numa, Lucius Tarquinius, or Servius Tullius?
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Or shall we refuse, even if such an one appear, to let him approach the helm of state? Must we rather look forward to consuls like the decemvirs, the vilest of mortals, who nevertheless were all of patrician birth, than to such as shall resemble the best of the kings, new men though they were?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"'But,' you will say, ' from the time the kings were expelled no plebeian has ever been consul.' Well, what then?. Must no new institution be adopted? Ought that which has not yet been done &mdash;and in a new nation many things have not yet been done &mdash;never to be put in practice, even if it be expedient?
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were neither pontiffs nor augurs in the reign of Romulus; Numa Pompilius created them. There was no census in the state, no registration of centuries and classes; Servius Tullius made one. There had never been any consuls; when the kings had been banished, consuls were elected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither the power nor the name of dictator had ever been known; in the time of our fathers they began. Plebeian tribunes, aediles, and quaestors, there were none; men decided to have them. Within the past ten years we have elected decemvirs for drawing up the laws, and removed them from the commonwealth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Who can question that in a city founded for eternity and of incalculable growth, new powers, priesthoods, and rights of families and individuals, must be established?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Was not this very <pb id="p.271"/>provision, that patricians and plebeians might not<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> intermarry, enacted by the decemvirs a few years since, with the worst effect on the community and the gravest injustice to the plebs? Or can there be any greater or more signal insult than to hold a portion of the state unworthy of intermarriage, as though it were defiled?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What else is this but to suffer exile within the same walls and banishment? They guard against having us for connections or relations, against the mingling of our blood with theirs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Why, if this pollutes that fine nobility of yours &mdash;which many of you, being of Alban or of Sabine origin, possess not by virtue of race or blood, but through co-optation into the patriciate, having been chosen either by the kings, or, after their expulsion, by decree of the people &mdash;could you not keep it pure by your own private counsels, neither taking wives from the plebs nor permitting your daughters and sisters to marry out of the patriciate? No plebeian would offer violence to a patrician maiden: that is a patrician vice.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No one would have compelled anybody to enter a compact of marriage against his will.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But let me tell you that in the statutory prohibition and annulment of intermarriage between patricians and plebeians we have indeed at last an insult to the plebs. Why, pray, do you not bring in a law that there shall be no intermarrying of rich and poor?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That which has always and everywhere been a matter of private policy, that a woman might marry into whatever family it had been arranged, that a man might take a wife from that house where he had engaged himself, you would subject to the restraint of a most arrogant aw, that thereby you might break up our civil <pb id="p.273"/>society and make two states out of one.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Why do<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> you not enact that a plebeian shall not live near a patrician, nor go on the same road? That he shall not enter the same festive company? That he shall not stand by his side in the same Forum? For what real difference does it make if a patrician takes a plebeian wife, or a plebeian a patrician? What right, pray, is invaded?
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The children of course take the father's rank. There is nothing we are seeking to gain from marriage with you, except that we should be accounted men and citizens. Neither have you any reason to oppose us, unless you delight in vying with each other how you may outrage and humiliate us.</p>

			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consuls had come forth to the people and set speeches had given place to wrangling, the tribune demanded what reason there was why a plebeian should not be chosen consul;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> to whom Curtius replied, with truth perhaps, yet, in the circumstances, to little purpose, <quote>because no plebeian has the auspices, and that is the reason the decemvirs have forbidden intermarriages, lest the auspices should be confounded by the uncertain standing of those born of them.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At this the plebs fairly blazed with indignation, because it was declared that; they could not take auspices, as though they were hated by the immortal gods; nor was the controversy ended &mdash;for the plebeians had got a most energetic champion in their tribune, and rivalled him themselves in determination, &mdash;until
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> at last the patricians were beaten, and allowed the law <pb id="p.277"/>regarding intermarriage to be passed, chiefly because they<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> thought that so the tribunes would either wholly give over their contention for plebeian consuls or would postpone it until after the war, and that the plebs meantime, contented with the right to intermarry, would be ready to submit to the levy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But since Canuleius was grown so great through his victory over the patricians and the favour of the plebs, the other tribunes were encouraged to take up the quarrel; and they fought for their measure with the utmost violence, hindering the levy, though the rumours of war increased from day to day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls, since they were powerless to do anything through the senate when the tribunes interposed their veto,<note>The first recorded instance of the tribunician veto being exercised upon a decree of the senate.</note> held councils of their leading men in private. It was clear that they must submit to be conquered either by the enemy or by their fellow citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of all the consulars only Valerius and Horatius<note>Leaders of that element in the senate which stood for a policy of conciliation, and authors of the Valerio-Horatian laws (17. li.-lv.).</note> took no part in their deliberations. Gaius Claudius spoke in favour of arming the consuls against the tribunes; the Quinctii, both Cincinnatus and Capitolinus, were opposed to bloodshed and to injuring those whom they had acknowledged by a solemn treaty with the plebs to be inviolable.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The upshot of these consultations was this, that they permitted military tribunes with consular authority to be chosen indifferently from the patriciate and the plebs,<note>The office thus instituted (very probably by a special law, <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. xxxv. &sect; 10) was not finally given up till <date value="-367">367 B.C.</date> During this period consuls were chosen twenty-two times and tribunes fifty-one times.</note> but made no change in the election of consuls. With this decision both tribunes and commons were content. An election was called, for <pb id="p.279"/>choosing three tribunes with consular powers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> No<note type="margin">B.C. 445</note> sooner was it proclaimed than everybody who had ever spoken or acted in a seditious manner, especially those who had been tribunes, fell to canvassing voters and bustling about all over the Forum in the white robes of candidates;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> so that the patricians, what with despair of obtaining office now that the plebs were so wrought up, and what with scorn if they must share its administration with these fellows, were deterred from standing. At last, however, they were compelled by their leaders to compete, lest they might seem to have surrendered the control of the commonwealth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The outcome of this election showed how different are men's minds when struggling for liberty and station from what they are when they have laid aside their animosities and their judgment is unbiassed; for the people chose all the tribunes from among the patricians, quite satisfied that plebeians should have been allowed to stand.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Where shall you now find in one single man that moderation, fairness, and loftiness of mind, which at that time characterized the entire people?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the year three hundred and ten from B.C. 444 the founding of Rome, military tribunes for the first time took office in place of consuls. Their names were Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Atilius,<note>Other Atilii were plebeians (see <hi rend="italics">e. g.</hi> Liv. v. xiii. 3), hence Niebuhr conjectured that Livy was in error in stating that the three tribunes were all patricians.</note> and Titus Cloelius. During their administration domestic harmony insured peace abroad, as well.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> (Some say that on account of a war with Veii, which broke out in addition to the war with the Aequi and Volsci and the revolt of the men of Ardea, two consuls were unable to cope with so many wars at once, and therefore three military tribunes were created. These writers say nothing of the <pb id="p.281"/>promulgation of a law about the election of consuls<note type="margin">B.C. 444</note> from the plebs, but record that the three tribunes enjoyed the authority and insignia<note>The lictors, with their rods and axes.</note> of consuls.)
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Still, the power of that magistracy was not yet upon a firm footing, for three months after they had taken up their office they laid it down, the augurs having decreed that there had been a flaw in their election, because Gaius Curtius, who had presided over the assembly, had not properly selected the ground for the tent.<note>The <hi rend="italics">tabernaculum</hi> was a tent erected on the <hi rend="italics">templum,</hi> or place marked out for the augural ceremony. Through an aperture in its roof the sky was watched for the flight of birds. Any flaw in the procedure would vitiate the subsequent election.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Ambassadors from Ardea came to Rome, complaining of the injustice done them, and with such fairness that it was evident that if they
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> were granted redress, through the restoration of their land, they would abide by the treaty and remain friendly. The senate replied that the judgment of the people could not be rescinded by them, not only because they had no precedent or authority for such action, but also because they had regard to the harmony between the orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If the Ardeates would bide their time and leave the senate to decide upon a remedy for the injury done them, the day would come when they would be glad that they had controlled their anger, and they would learn that the senators had been equally concerned that no wrong should be done them and that what had been done should be speedily redressed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So the ambassadors, having said that they would refer the whole matter to their people, were courteously dismissed.</p> 
			<p>The patricians, since the state was without any curule magistrate, met and chose an interrex.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A dispute whether consuls or military tribunes should be appointed kept the state in an interregnum for <pb id="p.283"/>several days. The interrex and the senate held out<note type="margin">B.C. 444</note> for the election of consuls; the plebeian tribunes and the plebs were for military tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Victory rested with the senators, not only because the plebs gave up the idle contest whether they should confer this honour or that upon the patricians, but also because the leaders of the plebs preferred an election in which they would not be reckoned candidates to one in which they would be passed over as unworthy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The tribunes, too, of the plebs relinquished the unavailing contest in favour of the leaders of the patricians. Titus Quinctius Barbatus, as interrex, declared the election of Lucius Papirius Mugillanus and Lucius Sempronius Atratinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In their consulship the treaty with the Ardeates was renewed; and in this lies the proof that these men were consuls that year, although their names are found neither in the ancient annals<note>Perhaps the <hi rend="italics">Annales Maximi.</hi></note> nor in the lists of magistrates;<note>Livy perhaps has in mind <hi rend="italics">libri consulares,</hi> or lists of consuls.</note> I suppose that, because there were military tribunes in the beginning of the year, the consuls who were elected in their place were passed over as if the tribunes had been in power throughout the year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Licinius Macer testifies that the names of these consuls were given both in the treaty with Ardea and in the Linen Rolls in the temple of Moneta.<note>The temple of Juno Moneta was erected on the Capitoline Hill in <date value="-344">344 B.C.</date> (VII. xxviii. 6). The Linen Rolls which Livy tells us were preserved there contained chronological lists of magistrates.</note> Things were quiet both abroad and at home, despite the numerous alarms which neighbouring states had caused.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year, whether it had tribunes only or B.C. 443 tribunes succeeded by consuls, was followed by one <pb id="p.285"/>which had consuls about whom there is no question.<note type="margin">B.C. 443</note> These were Marcus Geganius Macerinus, for the second time, and Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, for the fifth time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This same year saw the adoption of the censorship, an institution which originated in a small way but afterwards grew to such dimensions that it was invested with the regulation of the morals and discipline of the Romans. The distribution of honour and ignominy amongst the senate and the centuries of the knights was controlled by this magistracy, while jurisdiction over public and private sites, together with the revenues of the Roman People, were entirely subject to its discretion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What first gave rise to the office was this: the people had not been rated for many years and the census could not be postponed; yet the consuls, when so many nations threatened war, had no time for this work.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The subject was brought up in the senate, where it was held that the task, which was a laborious one and beneath the dignity of a consul, required its own proper magistrates, who should have a staff of clerks, assume the custody of the records, and regulate the form of the census.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senators, though it was a small matter, nevertheless gladly welcomed the suggestion, in order that there might be more patrician magistracies in the administration of the state. They thought even then, I imagine, as afterwards proved to be the case, that it would not be long before the consequence of those who held the office would lend authority and dignity to the office itself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The tribunes also, regarding it as a necessary rather than a showy service, as in those days it actually was, did not hold out against the plan, lest they <pb id="p.287"/>might seem to be vexatiously obstinate even in<note type="margin">B.C. 443</note> trifles.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The principal men in the state scorned the office, and the taking of the census was, by the votes of the people, committed to Papirius and Sempronius (whose consulship is questioned), that they might round out their incomplete year of office with this magistracy. They were called censors from their function.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on in Rome, there came envoys from Ardea begging the Romans in the name of their ancient alliance, renewed by the recent treaty, to send help to their city, which was on the brink of ruin.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the enjoyment of peace, which they had most wisely preserved with the Roman People, had been denied them, owing to civil war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This is said to have had its cause and origin in the rivalry of factions, which have been and will be fraught with destruction to more nations than foreign wars, or famine and pestilence, or whatsoever other scourges men attribute, as the most desperate national calamities, to the wrath of Heaven.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A maiden of plebeian family who was famous for her beauty had two youthful suitors. One was of her own class and relied on the approval of her guardians, who were themselves of the same standing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The other was a noble, captivated solely by her good looks, who was supported by the favour of the optimates,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the aristocratic party.</note> which resulted in the introduction of party strife into the household of the girl herself. The noble was preferred by the mother, who wished her daughter to make as grand a match as possible. The guardians, mindful even in a matter like this of political interests, held out for their fellow plebeian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the dispute could not be settled <pb id="p.289"/>privately, a suit was instituted. After listening to the<note type="margin">B.C. 443</note> pleas of the mother and the guardians, the magistrates decreed that the mother should have power to decide as she saw fit about the marriage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But violence was stronger than they; for the guardians, after openly addressing a crowd of their own party in the market-place, on the injustice<note>The injustice probably lay in the disregard of the guardians' traditional right to dispose of the hand of their ward. The mother herself would be a ward.</note> of the decision, collected a party and carried the girl off from her mother's house.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To confront them an even more warlike band of nobles gathered, under the leadership of the injured and indignant youth, and a desperate battle followed. The plebs were routed, but, unlike the Roman plebs, having armed and withdrawn from their city and encamped upon a certain hill, they sallied forth, sword and torch in hand, to sack the farms of the nobles.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They even prepared to besiege the city itself, for the entire body of artizans, even those who had hitherto had no part in the quarrel, had been called out by the hope of plunder;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> nor was there wanting any form of the horrors of war, as though the nation had been infected with the madness of the two young men who sought a fatal marriage in the ruin of their country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Neither side saw that there had been enough of war and arms at home; the optimates called upon the Romans to relieve their beleaguered city; the plebeians sent for the Volsci to help them capture Ardea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Volsci, with the Aequian Cluilius for their leader,<note>This looks as though the Volscian party were free lances, since a regular army would hardly have been led by an Aequian.</note> were the first to reach Ardea, and threw up intrenchments against the walls of their enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When the news was brought to Rome, Marcus Geganius the consul immediately set out with an army. When three miles from the enemy he chose a place for his camp; and as the day was <pb id="p.291"/>now fast drawing to a close, ordered his soldiers<note type="margin">B.C. 443</note> to refresh themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then in the fourth watch he marched out, and commencing a contravallation, made such speed that at sunrise the Volsci perceived that they were more securely hemmed in by the Romans than was the city by themselves; and on one side the consul had thrown out a work to join the walls of Ardea, in order that his friends in the town might be enabled to come and go.<note>Apparently the Volsci had not succeeded in drawing their lines completely round the city.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Volscian commander, who had maintained his men up to that time not out of a store provided in advance, but with corn taken from day to day in pillaging the country-side, was no sooner shut in by the rampart than he found himself all at once destitute of everything. He therefore invited the consul to a parley, and said that if the Roman general had come for the purpose of raising the siege, he would lead the Volscians off.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul replied that it was for the conquered to accept terms, not to make them; the Volsci had consulted their own pleasure in coming to attack the allies of the Roman People; it would be otherwise with their departure.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He ordered them to surrender their general, to lay down their arms, and, confessing themselves defeated, to yield to his authority; if they did not, he would be their determined enemy, whether they attempted to go or to stay, and would rather bring back to Rome a victory over the Volsci than a treacherous peace with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Volsci, testing the small hope that arms held out to them &mdash;for all other hope had been cut off &mdash;fought, not to speak of other disadvantages, in a position that was unfavourable for battle and still more unfavourable <pb id="p.293"/>for flight; and being cut to pieces on every side,<note type="margin">B.C.443</note> left off fighting and fell to entreaties; and after giving up their general and handing over their weapons, were sent under the yoke, with a single garment each, and so dismissed, overwhelmed with shame and disaster.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But on their encamping not far from the city of Tusculum, the Tusculans, upon an old grudge, attacked them in their defenseless state, and exacted so heavy a penalty that they scarce left any to report the massacre.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman commander, finding Ardea distracted by sedition, composed its troubles by beheading the ringleaders of the revolt and confiscating their property to the public treasury of the Ardeates. The townsmen thought that the great service which the Roman People had thus rendered them had cancelled the injustice of the judgment,<note>Whereby certain land over which Ardea and Aricia were in litigation was awarded by the Roman People to themselves. See III. lxxi. and IV. i. 4.</note> but the Roman senate felt that something still remained to do in order to wipe out that reminder of the national greed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul returned to the City and triumphed, making Cluilius, the leader of the Volsci, walk before his chariot, and displaying the spoils which he had taken from the hostile army, before sending them under the yoke.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>It is no easy thing to do, but the consul Quinctius equalled in civil life the fame of his armed colleague; for so well did he maintain domestic peace and concord, by tempering the law to high and low, that the Fathers regarded him as a strict consul, and the plebs as mild enough.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He held his own, too, with the tribunes, more by his personal influence than by contending with them. Five consulships administered on the self-same principles, and a life which had been throughout of consular <pb id="p.295"/>dignity, made the man himself almost more revered<note type="margin">B.C. 433</note> than his office. Hence there was no talk of military tribunes while these men were consuls.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Marcus Fabius Vibulanus and Postumus<note type="margin">B.C. 442</note> Aebutius Cornicen were elected to the consulship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These men, perceiving that they succeeded to a period of great renown for civil and military achievements, and that nothing made the year so memorable in the eyes of neighbouring peoples, both allies and enemies, as the earnestness with which the Romans had come to the assistance of the Ardeates in their dangerous crisis, were the more concerned to erase completely from men's minds the disgrace of the judgment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They accordingly caused the senate to decree that inasmuch as the citizens of Ardea had been reduced by domestic troubles to a small number, colonists should be enrolled to defend that city against the Volsci.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was the form in which the decree was drawn up and published,<note>As a <hi rend="italics">senatus consultum,</hi> to be submitted to the people for ratification.</note> that the plebs and the tribunes might not perceive that a plan was on foot for rescinding the judgment; but the senators had privately agreed that they would enrol as colonists a much larger proportion of Rutulians than Romans, and that no land should be parcelled out except that which had been sequestered by the infamous decision, nor a single clod assigned there to any Roman until all the Rutulians had been provided for.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus the land reverted to the Ardeates. As triumvirs for establishing the colony at Ardea they appointed Agrippa Menenius, Titus Cloelius Siculus, Marcus Aebutius Helva.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These men not only had a far from popular service to perform, and offended the plebs by assigning to the allies land which the Roman People <pb id="p.297"/>had adjudged to be its own; but failed to satisfy even<note type="margin">B.C. 442</note> the great patricians, because they had done nothing to conciliate any man's goodwill.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They therefore avoided vexatious attacks before the people &mdash;where the tribunes had already summoned them for trial &mdash;by remaining in the colony, which bore witness to their integrity and justice.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was peace at home and abroad during<note type="margin">B.C. 441-440</note> this and the following year, when Gaius Furius Paculus and Marcus Papirius Crassus were consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The games which the decemvirs had vowed in pursuance of a decree of the senate, during the secession of the plebs from the patricians, were that year celebrated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Occasion for dissension was sought in vain by Poetelius, who though he had got himself elected plebeian tribune for the second time, by proclaiming that he would carry through these very measures, was unsuccessful in forcing the consuls to lay before the senate a proposal for assigning land to the plebs;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and when, after a hard struggle, he obtained a vote of the senate to determine whether consuls or tribunes should be elected, the decision was for consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Men only laughed when the tribune threatened to hold up the levy, for the neighbouring peoples were quiet, and war and warlike preparations were alike uncalled for.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>To this tranquil period succeeded the consulship of Proculus Geganius Macerinus and Lucius Menenius Lanatus, a year conspicuous for numerous deaths and dangers, for seditions, famine, and for the yoke of sovereignty, to which, won over by largesses, men almost bowed their necks.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The one thing lacking was foreign war, and if that had been added to their burden they could hardly have held out, though all <pb id="p.299"/>the gods had aided them. The troubles began with<note type="margin">B.C. 441-440</note> a dreadful famine, whether because the season was unfavourable for crops, or that the attraction of assemblies and city-life had left the fields uncultivated; for both explanations have been given. The patricians accused the plebeians of idleness, and the tribunes of the plebs accused the consuls now of dishonesty, now of carelessness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the end they brought the plebs, with no opposition on the senate's part, to elect Lucius Minucius prefect of the corn-supply. He was destined, while filling this magistracy, to be more successful in safe-guarding liberty than in discharging the duties of his office, although in the end he also earned and received both gratitude and glory for relieving the scarcity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For although he had dispatched to neighbouring peoples many embassies by land and sea without result &mdash;save that a little corn was brought in from Etruria &mdash;he found that he had not materially improved the supply. He then fell back upon the plan of distributing the shortage.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He forced men to declare their stocks of corn and to sell the surplus above the requirements of a month; he deprived the slaves of a portion of their daily ration; he brought charges against the dealers and exposed them to the anger of the people;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and by this bitter inquisition rather revealed than alleviated the scarcity, so that many of the plebeians lost hope, and sooner than suffer torment by prolonging their existence, covered up their heads<note>As the ancients usually did when conscious that they were about to die. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> the story of Caesar's death in Suetonius (<hi rend="italics">Iulius,</hi> lxxxii).</note> and threw themselves into the Tiber.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then Spurius Maelius, of the equestrian<note type="margin">B.C. 440-439</note> order,<note>The <hi rend="italics">ordo equester</hi> here means the eighteen centuries of cavalry, and must not be confused with the later <hi rend="italics">ordo equester,</hi> consisting of all citizens below senatorial rank, whose property was assessed at 400,000 sesterces. Maelius was a plebeian <hi rend="italics">eques.</hi></note> a man for those times very rich, undertook to do a useful thing in a way that set a very bad example and had a motive still worse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For having <pb id="p.301"/>bought up corn in Etruria with his own money,<note type="margin">B.C. 440-439</note> through the agency of friends and clients there &mdash; which very circumstance had hindered, I can well believe, the public efforts to bring down prices &mdash;he set about distributing it gratis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The plebeians were captivated by this munificence; wherever he went, conspicuous and important beyond the measure of a private citizen, they followed in his train; and the devotion and hope he inspired in them gave him no uncertain assurance of the consulship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He himself, so insatiable of fortune's promises is the heart of man, began to cherish a loftier and less allowable ambition; and since even the consulship would have to be wrested from unwilling nobles, considered how he might be king: nothing else, he felt, would adequately reward him for his elaborate schemes and the toil and moil of the great struggle he must make.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consular election was now at hand, and found him with his plans not yet fully ripened.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the sixth time Titus Quinctius Capitolinus was chosen consul, a most unsuitable man for the purposes of a would-be revolutionary.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For colleague he was given Agrippa Menenius, surnamed Lanatus; and Lucius Minucius either was reappointed prefect of the corn-supply or had been named for an indefinite period, so long as the situation should require; for authorities do not agree, but the name of the prefect is entered in the Linen Rolls among the magistrates for both years.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This Minucius was discharging the same function in his public capacity which Maelius had undertaken to perform as a private citizen, and the same sort of men<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> corn-dealers.</note> were coming and going in both their houses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thus Minucius discovered the affair and reported to the senate that weapons were <pb id="p.303"/>being collected at the house of Maelius, that he<note type="margin">B.C. 440-439</note> was haranguing people there, and that they were certainly contriving a kingdom; the time for executing the plot was not yet fixed; all else had been agreed upon: the tribunes had been bribed to betray liberty, and the leaders of the mob had been assigned their parts. He said that he had withheld his report of these things almost longer than was safe, that he might not become voucher for anything of an uncertain or trivial nature.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On hearing this the leaders of the senate loudly blamed the consuls of the year before because they had suffered these donations and plebeian gatherings to take place in a private house, and the new consuls because they had waited till information of so grave a crime was laid before the senate by the prefect of the corn-supply, though it wanted a consul not only to report it but to punish it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but Quinctius said that the consuls were blamed unjustly, for, constrained by the laws of appeal, which had been enacted in order to break down their authority, they had by no means so much power in their office as they had will to punish so heinous an offence in the way it deserved. There was need, he continued, of a man, and one who was not only brave, but free and unfettered by the laws.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He would therefore name Lucius Quinctius dictator; there was a spirit whose stature was equal to that great power. Despite the universal approval of this step, Quinctius at first refused, and asked what they meant by exposing him at the end of his life to so fierce a struggle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then, when men called out on every side that there was not only more wisdom but more courage in that old man's heart than in all the rest and loaded him with not <pb id="p.305"/>unmerited compliments, and when the consul would<note type="margin">B.C. 440-439</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> not recede from his purpose, at length Cincinnatus uttered a prayer to the immortal gods that they would not suffer his old age to bring harm or shame to the republic in so perilous a case, and was pronounced dictator by the consul. He then himself named Gaius Servilius Ahala his master of the horse.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day, after disposing guards at<note type="margin">B.C. 439</note> several points he went down into the Forum, where the novel and surprising sight drew upon him the attention of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The followers of Maelius and their leader himself perceived that it was against them that the force of that high authority was aimed; while those who knew nothing of the plans for setting up a king asked what outbreak or what sudden war had called for the majesty of a dictator or for Quinctius (now past his eightieth year) to direct the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Servilius, the master of the horse, being sent by the dictator to Maelius, said: <quote>The dictator summons you.</quote> When Maelius, trembling, asked what he wanted, Servilius replied that he must stand his trial and clear himself of a charge which Minucius had lodged against him with the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then Maelius drew back into the crowd of his retainers, and at first, glancing this way and that, attempted to avoid the issue; but finally, when the attendant, being so commanded by the master of the horse, would have led him away, he was torn from his grasp by the bystanders and fled, calling on the Roman plebs to protect him, declaring that he was overthrown by
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> a plot of the patricians because he had acted kindly by the commons, and begging them to help him in his extremity and not permit him to be murdered before their eyes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While <pb id="p.307"/>he was screaming out these appeals, Servilius Ahala<note type="margin">B.C. 439</note> overtook and slew him; then, bespattered with his blood and guarded by a company of young nobles, he returned to the dictator and reported that Maelius, having been summoned to appear before him, had repulsed the attendant and was rousing up the populace when he received the punishment he had deserved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whereat the dictator exclaimed, <quote>Well done, Gaius Servilius; you have delivered the commonwealth!</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, as the crowd was in a turmoil, not knowing what to think of the deed, he bade convoke them to an assembly. There he asserted that Maelius had been justly slain, even though he had been innocent of plotting to make himself king, since he had been cited before the dictator by the master of the horse and had not obeyed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He himself, he said, had sat to hear the cause, and if the hearing had been concluded Maelius would have prospered as his cause deserved; but, planning violence to avoid undergoing trial, he had been repressed by violence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither would it have been right to deal with Maelius as with a citizen. The man had been born amongst a free people enjoying rights and laws, in a City from which he knew that the kings had been banished, and how in that very year the king's nephews,<note>This is inexact; from I. lvi. 7 we learn that it was Brutus, the father of the young men in question, who was nephew to the king, on the mother's side.</note> sons of the consul who had freed his country, had, on the exposure of a compact they had made to bring the princes back to Rome, been beheaded by their father's orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He knew that in this City the consul Tarquinius Collatinus had been commanded, out of hatred for the name he bore, to lay down his office and go into exile; that here, some years after, Spurius Cassius<note>See II. xli.</note> had been punished for aiming at <pb id="p.309"/>royalty; that here, but lately, the decemvirs had<note type="margin">B.C. 439</note> been visited with confiscation, banishment, and death, because of kingly arrogance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Yet in this same City a Spurius Maelius had conceived the hope of reigning. And who was this fellow? To be sure, no nobility, no honours, no merits, opened wide the road to tyranny for any man; nevertheless the Claudii<note>The reference is to Appius Claudius the decemvir.</note> and Cassii had been encouraged by consulships and decemvirates, by their own honours and those of their forefathers, and by the splendour of their families, to aim at forbidden heights;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Spurius Maelius, a rich corn-dealer, a man who might have desired but ought scarcely to have hoped to become a plebeian tribune, had flattered himself that for a couple of pounds of spelt he had purchased the liberty of his fellow citizens;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he had imagined that by flinging food to them he could entice into slavery a people who had conquered all their neighbours, so that a state which could scarce have stomached him as a senator would endure him for its king, having the insignia and authority of Romulus its founder, who was descended from the gods and had returned to them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This ought to be regarded as a thing no less monstrous than wicked; nor was his blood sufficient expiation, unless the roof and walls within which such madness had been conceived should be demolished, and the goods which had been tainted with the offer of them as the price to buy a tyranny be confiscated; he therefore bade the quaestors sell those goods and place the proceeds in the public treasury.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius then commanded the man's house<note type="margin">B.C. 438</note> to be pulled down, that the bare site might commemorate the frustration of his wicked purpose. The <pb id="p.311"/>place was named Aequimaelium.<note>The Aequimaelium was in the Vicus Iugarius, below the Capitol. Cicero derives the name from <hi rend="italics">aequus</hi> <quote>just,</quote> because Maelius was justly punished (<hi rend="italics">de Domo,</hi> 101); Varro from <hi rend="italics">aequus</hi> <quote>level</quote> (<hi rend="italics">L.L.</hi> V. 157).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Minucius<note type="margin">B.C. 438</note> was presented with an ox and a gilded statue outside the Porta Trigemina, without opposition even on the part of the plebs, since Minucius divided the corn of Maelius among them at the price of one <hi rend="italics">as</hi> the peck.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I find it stated by some historians that this Minucius went over from the patricians to the plebeians, and being co-opted an eleventh tribune of the plebs, allayed the rebellious feeling which arose from the killing of Maelius;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but it is hardly credible that the patricians should have permitted the number of tribunes to be increased, and that this precedent, of all others, should have been introduced by a patrician; or that the plebs, having once obtained this concession, should not have held fast to it, or at least have tried to do so. But what proves more conclusively than anything the falsity of the inscription on his portrait is this, that it was enacted by law a few years before that the tribunes might not co-opt a colleague.<note>The Lex Trebonia of <date value="-448">448 B.C.</date> (III. lxv. 4) required the election officials to continue the voting until ten tribunes had been chosen, but said nothing about the co-optation of an eleventh.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Quintus Caecilius, Quintus Junius, and Sextus Titinius were the only members of the college of tribunes who had not supported the law conferring honours on Minucius, and had never ceased to accuse now Minucius, now Servilius, before the plebs, and to complain of the unmerited death of Maelius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So they forced through a measure providing that military tribunes should be elected instead of consuls, not doubting that for some of the six places &mdash;for this was now the number that might be filled &mdash;plebeians would be chosen, if they would promise to avenge the death of Maelius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The plebeians, though they had been aroused that year by many different commotions, elected no more than three tribunes with consular powers, and among <pb id="p.313"/>these Lucius Quinctius, son of Cincinnatus, from<note type="margin">B.C. 438</note> whose dictatorship men were trying to derive the odium for inspiring a mutiny.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Aemilius Mamercus, a man of the highest standing, was ahead of Quinctius in the voting; Lucius Julius was elected third.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the term of these magistrates,<note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> Fidenae, a Roman colony, revolted to Lars Tolumnius and the Veientes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To their defection they added a worse crime, for when Gaius Fulcinius, Cloelius Tullus, Spurius Antius, and Lucius Roscius, Roman envoys, came to inquire the reason of this new policy, at the command of Tolumnius they put them to death.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some persons seek to palliate the king's act, saying that an ambiguous expression of his upon a lucky throw of dice, which made him seem to order them to kill the envoys, was heard by the Fidenates and was responsible for the men's death.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But it is quite incredible that the king on being interrupted by the Fidenates, his new allies, come to consult him about a murder that would violate the law of nations, should not have withdrawn his attention from the game, and that the attribution of the crime to a mistake did not come later.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is easier to believe that he wished the people of Fidenae to be involved by the consciousness of so heinous a deed, that it might be impossible for them to hope for any reconciliation with the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The envoys who had been slain at Fidenae were honoured, at the public cost, with statues on the Rostra.<note>A slight anachronism, as the speaker's platform in the Forum was not called Rostra till <date value="-338">338 B.C.</date>, when Gaius Menenius decorated it with the <hi rend="italics">rostra</hi>(beaks) of the ships taken at Antium (VIII. xiv. 12).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With the Veientes and Fidenates, not only because they were neighbouring peoples, but also in consequence of the nefarious act with which they had begun the war, a bitter struggle now impended.</p> <pb id="p.315"/>
			<p>Accordingly, out of regard for the general welfare,<note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> the plebeians and their tribunes kept quiet, and raised no opposition to the election as consuls of Marcus Geganius Macerinus (for the third time) and Lucius Sergius Fidenas.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I suppose that the name was given him from the war which he then waged; for he was the first who fought a successful battle on this side the Anio with the king of the Veientes; but he gained no bloodless victory, and so there was more grief for the citizens who were lost than rejoicing over the defeat of the enemy; and the senate, as is usual in an alarming situation, commanded the appointment of a dictator, Mamercus Aemilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He named as his master of the horse a man who had been his colleague the year before, when they had both been military tribunes with consular authority, namely Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, a young man worthy of his father.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the troops which the consuls levied were added veteran centurions experienced in war, and the losses of the last battle were made good. The dictator bade Titus Quinctius Capitolinus and Marcus Fabius Vibulanus follow him as his lieutenants.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The high authority of the dictatorship, in the hands of one who was equal to it, drove the enemy out of Roman territory and across the Anio. They withdrew their camp and pitched upon the hills between Fidenae and the Anio; nor did they descend into the plains until the forces of the Faliscans had come to their support.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then, and not till then, did the Etruscans encamp before the walls of Fidenae. The Roman dictator likewise went into camp not far off, on the banks of both rivers, at their confluence, and threw up a rampart between his army and the enemy, where he <pb id="p.317"/>was able to span the interval with intrenchments.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> where the distance from bank to bank was not too great.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> Next day he formed up in line of battle.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The enemy were of several minds. The Faliscans, chafing under service performed away from home<note>Their city Falerii (now Civita Castellana) was about twenty-five miles north of Rome.</note> and fairly self-confident, demanded battle: the Veientes and Fidenates anticipated greater success from a prolongation of the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Tolumnius, though the views of his own followers were more agreeable to him, announced that he would fight on the following day, lest the Faliscans might not tolerate a protracted campaign.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The dictator and the Romans were encouraged at the enemy's reluctance; and the next day, on the soldiers threatening that they would at once attack the camp and the city, unless the enemy came to an engagement, both armies marched out in line of battle into the plain between the two camps.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Veientes, having men to spare, dispatched a party round the mountains to assail the camp of the Romans during the engagement. The army of the three nations was so drawn up that the Veientes held the right wing, the Faliscans the left, and the Fidenates formed the centre.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The dictator advanced on the right, against the Faliscans, and Quinctius Capitolinus on the left, to meet the Veientes; while the master of the horse, with the cavalry, led the attack on the centre.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For a brief moment all was hushed and still; since the Etruscans were resolved not to begin fighting unless they were forced, and the dictator kept looking back to the Citadel of Rome, that the augurs might thence make him a signal, as they had arranged to do, the moment the omens were propitious.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As soon as he descried the signal, he first sent his cavalry against the enemy, <pb id="p.319"/>cheering as they charged; and the infantry followed<note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> with a furious attack.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At no point could the Etruscan legions withstand the onset of the Romans; their horse made the chief resistance, and of all their horse by far the bravest was the king himself, who rode against the Romans, as they scattered in every direction for the pursuit, and prolonged the struggle.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was at that time among the cavalrymen a tribune of the soldiers named Aulus Cornelius Cossus, a man of strikingly handsome person and no less distinguished for courage and strength. Proud of his name, which was very famous when it came to him, he left to his descendants one still greater and more glorious.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This man, seeing how Tolumnius, wherever he charged, brought confusion to the Roman squadrons, and recognizing him, conspicuous in his royal dress, as he galloped swiftly up and down the line, exclaimed, <quote>Is this the breaker of human leagues, the violater of the law of nations?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I will speedily offer him up as a sacrificial victim, if only it is the will of Heaven that there should be aught sacred on this earth, to the manes of the envoys!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Clapping spurs to his charger and levelling his spear, he made for his one enemy. Having struck and unhorsed his man, he himself leaped quickly to the ground by the help of his lance, and as the king struggled to his feet flung him back with the boss of his shield, and plunging the spear again and again into his body, pinned him to earth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then stripping the spoils from the corpse and cutting off the head, he bore it victoriously on the point of his spear and drove the enemy before him, panic-stricken at the sight of their slain king. Thus <pb id="p.321"/>even the cavalry was routed, which alone had made<note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> the issue of the contest doubtful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The dictator pressed on after the flying legions, and pursuing them to their camp cut them to pieces. Large numbers of the Fidenates escaped, thanks to their knowledge of the ground, into the mountains. Cossus crossed the Tiber with his cavalry, and from the fields of the Veientes brought a vast quantity of booty back to town.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During the battle there was also fighting at the Roman camp with a part of the forces of Tolumnius which he had dispatched against it, as has been said before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Fabius Vibulanus first manned the rampart with a cordon of defenders; and then, when the attention of the enemy was fixed on the wall, sallied out of the Porta Principalis, on the right,<note>A Roman camp was divided by the Via Principalis, which ran from one side to the other, with a gate at each end of it, called respectively <hi rend="italics">Porta Principalis dextra,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">P. P. sinistra.</hi></note> with his reserves,<note>The <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> were experienced troops, a body of which made a part of each legion. They were usually, as here, kept in reserve until a crisis called for their employment (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> VIII. viii.).</note> and fell suddenly upon them. In consequence of the panic thus occasioned, though the slaughter was less, because fewer were engaged, yet the rout was quite as complete as in the battle-line.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having been everywhere victorious, the dictator, as decreed by the senate and ratified by the people, returned to the City in triumphal procession.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By far the greatest spectacle in the triumph was Cossus, bearing the spoils of honour of the slain king, while the soldiers sang rude verses about him, comparing him to Romulus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The spoils he fastened up as an offering, with solemn dedication, in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, near the spoils of Romulus, which had been the first to be called <hi rend="italics">opima,</hi> and were at that time the only ones. Cossus had drawn the gaze of the citizens away from the car of the dictator upon himself, and the honours of that crowded festival were virtually his alone.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The <pb id="p.323"/>dictator, at the people's behest, presented to Jupiter<note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> on the Capitol a golden chaplet of a pound in weight, from the public treasury.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Following all previous historians, I have stated that Aulus Cornelius Cossus was a military tribune when he brought the second spoils of honour to the temple of Jupiter Feretrius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But besides that only those are properly held to be <quote>spoils of honour</quote> which one commander has taken from another commander, and that we know no <quote>commander</quote> but him under whose auspices the war is waged, the very words inscribed upon the spoils disprove their account and mine, and show that it was as consul that Cossus captured them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having heard from the lips of Augustus Caesar, the founder or renewer of all the temples, that he had entered the shrine of Jupiter Feretrius, which he repaired when it had crumbled with age, and had himself read the inscription on the linen breast-plate, I have thought it would be almost sacrilege to rob Cossus of such a witness to his spoils as Caesar, the restorer of that very temple.<note>Nepos tells us (<hi rend="italics">Att.</hi> xx. 3) that the restoration of this temple was undertaken at the suggestion of Atticus. It was therefore probably done not later than <date value="-32">32 B.C.</date>, the year in which Atticus died.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Where the error in regard to this matter lies, in consequence of which such ancient annals and also the books of the magistrates, written on linen and deposited in the temple of Moneta, which Licinius Macer cites from time to time as his authority, only give Aulus Cornelius Cossus as consul (with Titus Quinctius Poenus) seven years later, is a matter on which everybody is entitled to his opinion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For there is this further reason why so famous a battle could not be transferred to the later year, that the consulship of Cossus fell within a period of about three years when there were no wars, owing to a pestilence and a dearth of crops, so that <pb id="p.325"/>certain annals, as though death-registers, offer<note type="margin">B.C. 437</note> nothing but the names of the consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The third year after Cossus's consulship saw him military tribune with consular powers, and in the same year he was master of the horse, in which office he fought another famous cavalry-engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Here is freedom for conjecture, but in my opinion it is idle; for one may brush aside all theories when the man who fought the battle, after placing the newly-won spoils in their sacred resting-place, testified in the presence of Jupiter himself, to whom he had vowed them, and of Romulus &mdash;witnesses not to be held lightly by a forger &mdash;that he was Aulus Cornelius Cossus, consul.<note>It is possible that this paragraph was inserted by Livy, without altering the context, some time after the original publication of Books I-V. This would account for the appearance in the preceding paragraph of the version which Livy now rejects, and also for its reappearance in chap. xxxii. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Niebuhr, <hi rend="italics">R&ouml;m. Gesch.</hi> ii. 517.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis and<note type="margin">B.C. 436-435</note> Lucius Papirius Crassus were consuls, armies invaded the country of the Veientes and the Faliscans and drove off booty consisting of men and flocks;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> they nowhere encountered their enemies in the fields nor met with any opportunity to give them battle; still, they besieged no cities, for a pestilence attacked the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And seditions were attempted at home, but not brought about, by Spurius Maelius, tribune of the plebs, who, imagining that the popularity of his name would enable him to stir up trouble, had appointed a day for the prosecution of Minucius, and had also proposed a law for confiscating the goods of Servilius Ahala, maintaining that
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> Maelius had been circumvented by Minucius with false accusations, and flinging it up to Servilius that he had killed a citizen who had not been condemned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These charges were even less regarded by the people than was their author. But the increasing virulence of the disease gave concern, and so did certain alarms and prodigies; <pb id="p.327"/>in particular that it was frequently announced that<note type="margin">B.C. 436-435</note> farm-buildings had been thrown down by earthquakes. A supplication was therefore offered up by the people under the direction of the duumviri.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e. duumviri sacrorum,</hi> in charge of the Sibylline books, from which they derived the form of prayer used in this service.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The pestilence was worse next year, when Gaius Julius (for the second time) and Lucius Verginius were the consuls, and caused such fears and ravages in the City and the country that not only did
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> no one go out beyond the Roman marches to pillage, nor either patricians or plebs have any thought of waging war, but the men of Fidenae, who at first had kept to their mountains or their city walls, actually came down into Roman territory, bent on plunder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, when they had called in an army from Veii &mdash;for the Faliscans could not be driven into renewing the war either by the calamity of the Romans or the entreaties of their allies, &mdash;the two peoples crossed the Anio and set up their standards not far from the Colline Gate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consternation in the City was therefore no less than in the fields; the consul Julius disposed his troops on the rampart and walls, and Verginius took counsel with the senate in the temple of Quirinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was resolved that Quintus Servilius, whose surname some give as Priscus, others as Structus, should be appointed dictator. Verginius delayed till he could consult his colleague; then, with his consent, he that night named the dictator, who appointed as his master of the horse Postumus Aebutius Helva.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dictator commanded everybody to be outside the Colline Gate at break of day. All those who were able to bear arms were at hand. The <pb id="p.329"/>standards were taken out of the treasury and brought<note type="margin">B.C. 436-435</note> to the dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While this was going on, the enemy withdrew to a more elevated position. Thither the dictator marched under arms, and not far from Nomentum joined battle with the Etruscan forces and put them to rout.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From there he drove them into the city of Fidenae, which he surrounded with a rampart; but could not capture it with scaling-ladders, since it was a lofty, well-fortified town, nor accomplish anything by blockade, for they not only had corn enough for their necessities, but in fact were lavishly supplied with it from stores which they had collected in advance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In despair therefore alike of storming the place and of forcing it to surrender; the dictator, operating in a region which was familiar from its nearness to Rome, began, on the farthest side of the city, which was least guarded because its peculiar character made it the safest of all, to drive a mine into the citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He himself, advancing against the city from widely separated points-with his army in four divisions, that they might relieve one another in the attack &mdash;by
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> fighting continuously day and night distracted the enemy's attention from the work, until a tunnel had been dug through the hill and a passage-way constructed up into the citadel; when the Etruscans, intent on groundless alarms and unmindful of their real danger, were apprised by the shouts of the enemy above their heads that their city had been taken.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In that year Gaius Furius Paculus and Marcus Geganius Macerinus the censors approved a public building erected in the Campus Martius, and the census of the people was taken there for the first time.</p> <pb id="p.331"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That the same consuls were re-elected<note type="margin">B.C. 434</note> the following year (Julius for a third and Verginius for a second term) I find stated by Licinius Macer: Valerius Antias and Quintus Tubero give Marcus Manlius and Quintus Sulpicius as the consuls for that year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the rest, in spite of the great discrepancy in their statements, both Tubero and Macer cite the authority of the Linen Rolls; neither writer dissembles the fact that the elder historians had recorded that there were military tribunes for that year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Licinius sees fit to follow without hesitation the Linen Rolls: Tubero is uncertain where the truth lies. With all the other matters which are shrouded in antiquity this question too may be left undecided.<note>It is typical of Livy's indifference to documents that he should not have taken the trouble to consult the Linen Rolls himself. As to the fact, Diodorus Siculus, xii. 53, gives Marcus Manlius, Quintus Sulpicius, and Servius Cornelius Cossus as military tribunes for the year <date value="-320">320 B.C.</date>, and the statement of Antias and Tubero may have arisen from the loss of the third name, and the consequent assumption that consuls were in office.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>There was great alarm in Etruria in consequence of the capture of Fidenae. Not only were the people of Veii terrified by the fear of a similar disaster, but the Faliscans too remembered that they had commenced the war in alliance with the Fidenates, although they had not supported them in their revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly when the two states, sending envoys round amongst the twelve cities, had obtained their consent to have a council proclaimed for all Etruria at the shrine of Voltumna, the senate, feeling that they were threatened with a great outbreak in that quarter, ordered that Mamercus Aemilius be again named dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By him Aulus Postumius Tubertus was appointed master of the horse, and preparations for war were set about as much more energetically than on the last occasion, as the danger from all Etruria was greater than it had been from two cities.</p> <pb id="p.333"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This affair ended a good deal more quietly<note type="margin">B.C. 434</note> than anybody had anticipated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was reported by merchants<note>This implies that the meetings of the league were made occasions for fairs. Cp. the fair at the shrine of Feronia, I. xxx. 5.</note> that the Veientes had been refused assistance and had been told that having embarked on the war at their own discretion they must prosecute it with their own forces nor seek the alliance of those in their adversity with whom they had not shared the prospect of success.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Whereupon the dictator, that his appointment might not have been for nothing, was desirous, being deprived of the means of winning military renown, of accomplishing some peaceful achievement to signalize his dictatorship. He therefore laid his plans to weaken the censorship, either thinking its powers excessive, or troubled less by the greatness of the office than by its long duration.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So, calling an assembly, he said that the immortal gods had undertaken to manage the foreign relations of the state and to make everything safe: he himself would do what needed to be done within the City, and would defend the liberty of the Roman People. Now the greatest safeguard was that great powers should not be long-continued, but that a limit of time should be imposed on them, since no limit of jurisdiction could be. Other magistracies were tenable for one year, the censorship for five.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was a serious matter for the same man to have authority over people for so many years, in a great part of their affairs. He announced that he should propose a law that the censorship might not last longer than a year and a half.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With vast enthusiasm on the part of the people the law was next day enacted, and Mamercus exclaimed, <quote>That you may have positive proof, Quirites, how little I approve prolonged authority, I lay down my <pb id="p.335"/>dictatorship.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus, having resigned his own<note type="margin">B.C. 434</note> magistracy and assigned a limit for the other, he was escorted to his home by the people, with striking manifestations of rejoicing and good-will. The censors, in their indignation that Mamercus had abridged a magistracy of the Roman People, removed him from his tribe, and assessing him at eight times his former tax, disfranchised him.<note>The <hi rend="italics">aerarii</hi> were the lowest class of citizens. They could neither vote nor hold office; were not eligible for service in the legion; and shared in the burdens of the state only by the payment of taxes
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;<hi rend="italics">aes</hi> &mdash;assessed by the censors, instead of being determined by the citizen's sworn declaration, as was the case with members of the five classes.</note> This they say Mamercus bore with great fortitude, having regard rather to the cause of his humiliation than to the humiliation itself. The leading patricians, though they had opposed the curtailment of the jurisdiction of the censorship, were offended by this example of censorial ruthlessness, since each of them perceived that he should be subjected to the censor for a longer period and more frequently than he should hold the
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> censor's office. The people at any rate are said to have been so enraged that no man's influence but that of Mamercus himself could have shielded the censors from their violence.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The tribunes of the plebs by persistent<note type="margin">B.C. 433-432</note> opposition prevented the consular elections from taking place. At last, when matters had been brought almost to an interregnum, they succeeded in their contention that military tribunes with consular powers should be chosen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Though they hoped their victory would be rewarded by the choice of a plebeian, they were disappointed: all those who were elected were patricians, Marcus Fabius Vibulanus, Marcus Folius, Lucius Sergius Fidenas.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> An epidemic that year afforded a respite from other troubles. A temple was vowed to Apollo in behalf of the people's health. The duumviri did many things by direction of the Books<note><hi rend="italics">Viz.</hi> the Sibylline Books.</note> for the <pb id="p.337"/>purpose of appeasing the angry gods and averting<note type="margin">B.C. 433-432</note> the plague from the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nevertheless the losses were severe, both in the City and the country, and men and cattle were stricken without distinction. They even feared that famine would succeed the epidemic, since the farmers were down with the disease. They therefore sent to Etruria and the Pomptine district, and to Cumae, and finally to Sicily itself, for, corn.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nothing was said about consular elections; military tribunes with consular authority were chosen as follows: Lucius Pinarius Mamercus, Lucius Furius Medullinus, Spurius Postumius Albus &mdash;all patricians.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>This year the violence of the disease was mitigated, and there was no risk of a dearth of corn, since precautions had been taken in advance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Schemes for instigating war were discussed in the councils of the Volsci and Aequi, and in Etruria at the shrine of Voltumna.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There the enterprise was put over for a year, and it was decreed that no council should convene before that date, though the Veientes complained &mdash;without effect &mdash;that Veii was threatened with the same destruction as had overtaken Fidenae.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Meanwhile in Rome the leaders of the plebs, who had now for a long time, while there was peace with other nations, been thwarted in their hopes of attaining to greater honours, began to appoint meetings at the houses of the plebeian tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There they considered their plans in secret; they complained that they were held in such contempt by the plebs that although military tribunes with consular powers had been elected for so many years, no plebeian had ever been admitted to that office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their ancestors had shown great foresight in <pb id="p.339"/>providing that no patrician should be eligible for the<note type="margin">B.C. 433-432</note> plebeian magistracies; otherwise they would have been obliged to have patricians as tribunes of the plebs, so contemptible did they appear, even to their own class, being no less despised by the commons than by the nobles.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Others exonerated the plebs and threw the blame upon the patricians: it was owing to their artful canvassing that the plebeians found the road to office blocked; if the plebs might have a breathing-spell from the mingled prayers and menaces of the nobles, they would think of their friends when they went to vote, and to the protection they had already won would add authority.<note><hi rend="italics">Auxlium</hi> alludes to the plebeian tribunate, <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> to the military tribunate with consular powers.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It was resolved in order to do away with canvassing, that the tribunes<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> the plebeian tribunes.</note> should propose a law forbidding anyone to whiten his toga, for the purpose of announcing himself a candidate.<note>The office-seeker pipe-clayed his toga; hence <hi rend="italics">candidatus,</hi> <quote>candidate.</quote></note> This may now appear a trivial thing and one scarcely to be considered seriously, but at that time it kindled a furious struggle between the patricians and the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Yet the tribunes prevailed and carried their law; and it was clear that the plebeians in their irritated mood would support the men of their own order. That they might not be at liberty to do so, the senate decreed that consuls should be elected.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The reason alleged was a sudden outbreak B..431 of hostilities on the part of the Aequi and Volsci, which the Latins and the Hernici had reported.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus, son of Lucius &mdash;the same who is given the added surname Poenus, &mdash; and Gnaeus Julius Mento were made consuls. Nor was the fear of war deferred.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After a levy, held under a <hi rend="italics">lex sacrata</hi><note>Whoever offended against such a law was forfeited (<hi rend="italics">sacer</hi>) to the gods.</note> which was their most effective <pb id="p.341"/>means of collecting soldiers, strong armies marched<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> out from both nations and met on Algidus, where the Aequi encamped
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> in one place and the Volsci in another, and their generals took more pains than ever before to intrench, and to drill their men. For this reason the report occasioned the more dismay in Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate resolved that a dictator should be appointed, since, though often beaten, those nations had renewed the war with greater efforts than at any previous time, and a considerable proportion of the young Romans had been carried off by the plague.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Above all, men were frightened by the wrong-headedness of the consuls, their want of harmony between themselves, and their opposition to each other in all their plans. Some writers say that these consuls were defeated on Algidus, and that this was the reason of the dictator's being named.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus much is clear: though they might differ in other matters, they were agreed on one thing, to oppose the wishes of the Fathers for the appointment of a dictator; until, as the reports grew more and more alarming, and the consuls refused to be guided by the senate, Quintus Servilius Priscus, a man who had filled with distinction the highest offices, cried out, <quote>To you, tribunes of the plebs, since matters
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> have come to an extremity, the senate appeals, that in this great national crisis you may compel the consuls, by virtue of your authority, to name a dictator.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hearing this the tribunes felt that an opportunity had come for increasing their power; they conferred apart, and then announced, in behalf of the college, that they were resolved that the consuls should obey the senate; if they persisted further <pb id="p.343"/>to oppose the unanimous opinion of that most<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> honourable order, they should command them to be put in prison. The consuls preferred to be defeated by the tribunes rather than by the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They declared that the senators had betrayed the rights of the highest office in the state and had ignominiously surrendered the consulship to the tribunician power, since apparently it was possible for the consuls to be subjected to the official compulsion of a tribune, and even &mdash;what could a private citizen fear more than that? &mdash;be carried off to gaol.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was determined by lot &mdash;for the colleagues had not been able to agree even about this &mdash;that Titus Quinctius should name the dictator. He appointed Aulus Postumius Tubertus, his father-in-law, a man of the sternest authority; and by him Lucius Julius was chosen master of the horse. At the same time a levy was proclaimed and a cessation of legal business, and it was ordered that nothing else should be done in all the City but prepare for war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The examination of those who claimed exemption from military service was put over till after the war, and so even those whose cases were uncertain were disposed to give in their names.<note>For fear that &mdash;their claims being then disallowed &mdash;they would be treated as deserters.</note> Men were required also of the Hernici and the Latins, and in both instances the dictator was zealously obeyed.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These measures were all carried out with great dispatch. Gnaeus Julius the consul was left behind to protect the city; and Lucius Julius, the master of the horse, to meet the sudden demands which arise in war, that the troops might not be hampered in camp by the want of anything that they might need.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The dictator, repeating the words <pb id="p.345"/>after Aulus Cornelius the pontifex maximus, vowed<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> to celebrate great games<note>Not to be confounded with the annual <hi rend="italics">Ludi Magni</hi> established by A. Postumius after his victory at Lake Regillus, <date value="-499">499 B.C.</date> The present reference is to votive games to be given, in the event of victory, as payment in full for the assistance of the gods.</note> if he succeeded in quelling the outbreak, and, dividing his army with the consul Quinctius, set out from Rome and came to the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Seeing that the opposing forces occupied two camps with a little space between, the Roman generals followed their example and encamped about a mile from the enemy, the dictator nearer to Tusculum and the consul to Lanuvium.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thus the four armies in their four intrenchments had in their midst a field of sufficient extent not merely for small preliminary skirmishes but even for drawing up lines of battle on both sides.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor from the moment the Romans had pitched their camp near that of the enemy did they once cease skirmishing; and the dictator was well content that his men should match their strength against their adversaries, and by trying the outcome of these contests come, little by little, to count upon a general victory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The enemy in consequence abandoned all hope of success in a regular battle and attacked the consul's camp at night, committing their cause to the hazard of a dangerous enterprise. The shout which suddenly broke out aroused not only the consul's sentries and after them his entire army, but the dictator as well.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When circumstances required instant action, the consul proved to be wanting neither in resolution nor in judgment. With a part of his soldiers he reinforced the guards at the gates; with a part he lined the palisade.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the other camp, with the dictator, there was less confusion and a correspondingly clearer perception what was needful to be done. Reinforcements were immediately sent to the consul's camp, under Spurius Postumius Albus <pb id="p.347"/>the lieutenant: the dictator himself, taking a part of<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> his forces, marched by a slight detour to a place absolutely screened from the fighting, that he might thence strike the enemy unawares as he faced the other way.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The lieutenant Quintus Sulpicius he put in charge of the camp; to the lieutenant Marcus Fabius he assigned the cavalry, but ordered him not to move his command till daybreak, as it would be hard to control in the confusion of the night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Everything that any wise and active general could have commanded and carried out in such a situation was duly commanded and carried out by him; but an unusual proof of judgment and daring and one which reflects no ordinary credit upon him was this, that he actually attacked the enemy's camp (from which, as he ascertained, they had marched out with more than half their troops), dispatching Marcus Geganius with some chosen cohorts on that service.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This officer found his foes absorbed in the issue of the dangerous work undertaken by their fellows, and with no thought for themselves, neglecting their sentinels and outguards;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> he attacked them, captured their camp almost before they fully realized that they were assailed, and sent up a prearranged signal of smoke, on seeing which the dictator cried out that the enemy's camp was taken and bade spread the news.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By this time the day was breaking and everything could be seen. Fabius had delivered a charge with his cavalry; the consul had made a sally from the camp against the enemy, who were already wavering;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> while the dictator, on the other side of the field, attacking the supports and the second line, had fallen upon the foe from every side, as they <pb id="p.349"/>wheeled about to meet the wild shouts and sudden<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> onsets, with his victorious foot and horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, being now hemmed in on every side, the enemy would have suffered to a man the penalty of their rebellion, had not Vettius Messius, a Volscian more distinguished by his deeds than by his birth, called out in a clear voice to his men, who were already crowding together in a circle, <quote>Are you going to offer yourselves up here to the weapons of the enemy, defenceless and unavenged?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To what end then are you armed, or why without provocation did you make war, turbulent in peace and sluggards in the field? What hope is there while you stand here? Do you think that some god will protect you and deliver you from this plight?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is your swords must make a way for you! Come, where you see me go before, there you must follow, if you would look on homes, parents, wives and children! It is not a wall or rampart that blocks your path, but armed men like yourselves. In courage you are their equals; in necessity, which is the last and chiefest weapon, you are the better men.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So he spoke, and acted on the word. Renewing their shouts they followed after, and hurled themselves against the Romans where the cohorts of Postumius Albus had confronted them. And they forced the victors to give ground, until the dictator came up, as his men were already falling back, and the fighting all centred on that spot.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On one single warrior, Messius, hung the fortunes of the enemy. Many were the wounds on either side, and great was the slaughter everywhere. Now even the Roman leaders were bleeding as they fought.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Only Postumius left the battle, struck by a stone that broke his head. <pb id="p.351"/>A wounded shoulder could not drive the dictator<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> from so critical a fight; nor would Fabius retire for a thigh almost pinned to his horse; nor the consul for an arm that was hewn away.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Messius pressed on with a band of courageous youths over the slain bodies of his enemies, and reached the Volscian camp, which had not yet been taken; and on that point the entire battle converged.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul, after pursuing his opponents clear up to the rampart, assailed the camp itself and the palisade; and thither from another part of the field the dictator brought up his troops.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The assault was no less vigorous than the battle had been. They say that the consul even cast his standard into the stockade, to make his men the more eager in the charge, and that in seeking to recover it they made the first breach. The dictator too had breached the rampart and had already carried the fighting into the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the enemy began on every hand to throw down their arms and surrender. Finally the camp itself was captured, and the enemy were all sold into slavery, except the senators. A portion of the booty was restored to the Latins and the Hernici, on their identifying it as their own; a part was sold at auction by the dictator; who then left the consul in command of the camp and returning himself in triumph to the City laid down his office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The memory of the noble dictatorship assumes a sombre hue in a tradition that Aulus Postumius' son, who, tempted by an opportunity of fighting to advantage, had left his post unbidden, was in the hour of his victory beheaded by his father's orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> One is loath to believe this story, and the diversity of opinion allows one to reject it. It is an indication <pb id="p.353"/>of its falsity that we speak of Manlian,<note>Alluding to the story told at VIII. vii. 1.</note> not Postumian<note type="margin">B.C. 431</note> discipline, whereas he who had first established so rigorous a precedent would himself have received that notorious stigma of cruelty. Besides, Manlius was given the surname <hi rend="italics">Imperiosus</hi> &mdash;<quote>the Despotic</quote> &mdash;while Postumius received no such grim distinction.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Gnaeus Julius the consul dedicated the temple of Apollo in the absence of his colleague, without drawing lots. Quinctius resented this, when he had dismissed his army and returned to the City; but his complaint of it in the senate was without effect.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>To the history of a year famous for its great events, is appended a statement &mdash;as though the incident was then regarded as of no importance to the Roman state-that the Carthaginians, destined to be such mighty enemies, then for the first time sent over an army into Sicily to assist one of the factions in the domestic quarrels of the Sicilians.<note>A mistake. The Carthaginians had obtained a foothold in Sicily long before this time, and (according to Herodotus, vii. 166), were defeated in a great naval battle by the Sicilians on the same day that Salamis was fought (<date value="-480">480 B.C.</date>).</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>An effort was made in the City by the B.C. tribunes of the plebs to procure the election of military tribunes with consular powers, but it was unsuccessful. Lucius Papirius Crassus<note>The same who had been consul in 435? Livy usually notes the second election to a consulship with the word<hi rend="italics">iterum.</hi> Diodorus, xii. 72, gives our consul's name as Gaius.</note> and Lucius Julius were chosen consuls. The Aequi, through their envoys, sought a treaty from the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Instead of granting a treaty, the senate suggested that they surrender; but they asked and obtained a truce for eight years. The Volscian commonwealth, in addition to the disaster it had suffered on Algidus, had become involved in quarrels and seditions, in consequence of an obstinate struggle between the advocates of peace and those of war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans everywhere enjoyed peace. A law concerning the <pb id="p.355"/>valuation of fines was most welcome to the people.<note type="margin">B.C. 430-427</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having learned through the treachery of a member of the college that the tribunes were drawing one up, the consuls anticipated their action and themselves proposed it.<note>An earlier law (<hi rend="italics">Menenia Sextia,</hi> <date value="-452">452 B.C.</date>) had fixed the limit of fines which magistrates might impose on their own responsibility at two sheep for poor men and thirty oxen for rich men. The present law (<hi rend="italics">Papiria Julia</hi>) provided for a uniform money equivalent for these fines, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> twenty and three thousand asses respectively.</note></p> 
			<p>The next consuls were Lucius Sergius Fidenas (for the second time) and Hostius Lucretius Tricipitinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nothing noteworthy was done this year. They were succeeded in the consulship by Aulus Cornelius Cossus and Titus Quinctius Poenus, who was elected for the second time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Veientes made inroads into Roman territory. It was rumoured that certain young men of Fidenae had shared in the pillaging. The investigation of this report was intrusted to Lucius Sergius, Quintus Servilius, and Mamercus Aemilius; and certain men were banished to Ostia, because it was not clear why they had been away from Fidenae during those days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A number of settlers were added to the colony, and land was assigned them which had belonged to men who had fallen in the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A drought that year caused great suffering. Not only did the skies provide too little rain, but the earth as well was deficient in native moisture and could hardly supply the perennial streams.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In some cases the failure of the sources caused the dry springs and brooks to be lined with cattle perishing of thirst; others were carried off by a mange, and their diseases were by contact communicated to mankind. At first they attacked country people and slaves; then the City was infected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And not only were men's bodies smitten by the plague, but a horde of superstitions, mostly foreign, took possession of their minds, as the class of men who find their profit in superstition-ridden souls <pb id="p.357"/>introduced strange sacrificial rites into their homes,<note type="margin">B.C. 430-437</note> pretending to be seers;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> until the public shame finally reached the leading citizens, as they beheld in every street and chapel outlandish and unfamiliar sacrifices being offered up to appease Heaven's anger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The aediles were then commissioned to see to it that none but Roman gods should be worshipped, nor in any but the ancestral way.</p> 
			<p>Revenge on the men of Veii was postponed till the following year, when Gaius Servilius Ahala and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus were consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Even then a religious scruple prevented the immediate declaration of war and dispatch of armies; they resolved that fetials must first be sent to require restitution.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Not long before there had been a battle with the Veientes near Nomentum and Fidenae, and this had been followed not by peace but by a truce. Its time had now run out, and indeed the enemy had begun to fight again before its expiration; nevertheless fetials were sent; yet their words, when they sought reparation after taking the customary oath,<note>For the procedure of the fetials see I. xxxii.</note> were not attended to.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> A dispute then arose whether war should be declared by command of the people, or whether a senatorial decree was enough.<note>If the war was a new war it must be sanctioned by vote of the people; if merely a continuation of the old war this was unnecessary.</note> The tribunes prevailed, by threatening to hinder the levy, and forced the consul Quinctius to refer the question of war to the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All the centuries voted for it. In this respect also the plebs had the better, that they made good their wish that consuls should not be elected for the following year.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Four military tribunes with consular powers<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> were elected, Titus Quinctius Poenus, who had just been consul, Gaius Furius, Marcus Postumius, and Aulus Cornelius Cossus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of these, Cossus had charge <pb id="p.359"/>of the City; the three others held a levy and<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> marching against Veii gave a demonstration how unprofitable it was in war to parcel out authority. By pursuing each his own counsels, one having this opinion, another that, they gave the enemy room to take them at a disadvantage;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for their army was confused when some bade sound the charge, while others commanded the recall; and at this favourable moment the Veientes fell upon them. The camp, which was close by, received the demoralized and fleeing men, and so they suffered more disgrace than actual harm.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The nation was filled with grief, for it was not used to being conquered; disgusted with the tribunes, people demanded a dictator: therein, they said, lay the hope of the state. And when they seemed likely to be thwarted in that also, by a scrupulous feeling that no one but a consul could name a dictator, the augurs were consulted and removed the impediment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Aulus Cornelius named as dictator Mamercus Aemilius and was himself appointed by Mamercus master of the horse, so true is it that when the fortune of the state required real worth, the animadversion of the censor could by no means prevent men's seeking a director of their affairs in a house undeservedly stigmatized.<note>See chap. xxiv.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Veientes, elated by their success, dispatched envoys round about to the peoples of Etruria, boasting that they had routed three Roman commanders in one fight. Nevertheless they obtained no general support from the league, though they attracted volunteers from all quarters by the prospect of booty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Only the people of Fidenae voted to renew the war; and, as though it were forbidden to commence war without a crime, as before in the blood <pb id="p.361"/>of the ambassadors, so now they imbued their swords<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> in that of the new settlers, and joined the men of Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Consultations followed between the leaders of the two nations whether they should take Veii or Fidenae for the headquarters of their campaign. Fidenae seemed the fitter; and accordingly the Veientes crossed the Tiber and transferred the war to Fidenae.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At Rome there was a wild alarm. The troops were recalled from Veii, though even their spirits were much daunted in consequence of their failure, and encamped before the Colline Gate. Armed men were disposed along the walls, a cessation of the courts was proclaimed in the Forum, the shops were closed, and everything assumed more the look of a camp than of a city. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dictator, sending heralds this way and that through the streets, summoned the frightened citizens to an assembly, where he rebuked them for possessing hearts so easily dismayed by trivial fluctuations of fortune that on sustaining a slight reverse &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that not due to the valour of the enemy or the cowardice of the Roman army, but to a disagreement among their generals &mdash;they were seized with dread of the Veientine enemy whom they had six times defeated, and of Fidenae which they had captured almost more often than they had attacked it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both the Romans and their enemies were the same as they had been for so many generations; they had the same courage, the same bodily vigour, the same weapons; he was himself the same dictator Mamercus Aemilius who had formerly put to flight the armies of the Veientes and the Fidenates, with the Faliscans added, before Nomentum;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and, as master of the horse, Aulus <pb id="p.363"/>Cornelius would be the same man in battle that<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> he had shown himself in the former war, when as military tribune he had slain Lars Tolumnius, king of the Veientes, in full sight of both armies, and had borne the spoils of honour to the temple of Jupiter Feretrius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Let them remember then that theirs were the triumphs, theirs the spoils, theirs the victory; while their enemies were stained with the crime of putting envoys to death against the law of nations, with the slaughter in time of peace of settlers at Fidenae, with the broken truce, with rebelling unsuccessfully for the seventh time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Let them think of these things and arm. When once they should have pitched their camp near the camp of the enemy, he was very confident the dastardly foe would not long rejoice over the humiliation of a Roman army;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but that the Roman People would perceive how much better those men had served the state who had named him for the third time dictator, than had those who, because he had torn from the censorship its tyrannical powers, had fixed a stigma upon his second dictatorship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, having offered vows to the gods, he marched out and encamped a mile and a half this side of Fidenae, protected on his right by mountains, on his left by the river Tiber.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His lieutenant Titus Quinctius Poenus he commanded to secure the mountains and secretly to occupy the ridge which lay to the enemy's rear.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>On the morrow, when the Etruscans, in high feather at what, on the previous day, had been more good luck than good fighting, sallied forth to offer battle, the dictator delayed a little, till his scouts should report that Quinctius had come out <pb id="p.365"/>on the ridge near the citadel of Fidenae; and then<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> forming his infantry in line of battle led them at the double against the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He directed the master of the horse not to begin to fight until he got his orders: when he required the help of the cavalry, he would himself give the signal; let him then bear himself as one mindful of his battle with a king, of his glorious offering, of Romulus and Jupiter Feretrius. The armies came together with great fury. The Romans were consumed with hatred.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>Traitors</quote> was the name they gave the Fidenates, and <quote>brigands</quote> the men of Veii; they called them breakers of truces, stained with the horrid murder of ambassadors, sprinkled with the gore of their own settlers, faithless allies and cowardly enemies; and fed their rage at once with deeds and with words.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They had shaken the enemy's resistance at the very first onset, when suddenly the gates of Fidenae were flung open and a strange kind of army, never seen before or heard of, came pouring out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fire was the weapon of that vast multitude, and blazing torches threw a glare upon the entire throng when, as though inspired with a wild insanity, they rushed headlong on their enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For an instant the strangeness of this kind of battle dismayed the Romans. Then the dictator, calling up the master of the horse and his cavalry, sending for Quinctius to come down from the mountains, and urging on the fight himself, hurried to the left wing, which, as though it found itself in a conflagration rather than a line of battle, had shrunk back in terror from the flames, and in a loud voice cried out:
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>Will you quit your post, <pb id="p.367"/>subdued with smoke like a swarm of bees, and yield<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> to an unarmed foe? Will you not extinguish fire with the sword?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Will you not seize these self-same brands, and each for himself &mdash;if we must fight with fire, not with javelins &mdash;attack them with their own weapons? Come, call to mind the Roman name, your fathers' valour and your own; turn this blaze upon the enemy's city and destroy Fidenae with its own flames, since your kindness was powerless to gain its friendship! The blood of your envoys and your colonists and your devastated borders exhort you to do as I say.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the dictator's command the whole array was set in motion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Here they caught up torches which had been flung away; there they wrested them violently from their bearers: both sides were armed with fire. The master of the horse on his part invented a new kind of cavalry-fighting. Commanding his men to pull off the bridles from their horses, he led the way, and setting spurs to his own, was carried by the unbridled charger into the midst of the flames.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other horses too were urged on and bore their riders at full tilt against the enemy; while the dust that rose and mingled with the smoke darkened the eyes both of the men and of their mounts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the sight which had frightened the infantry had no terror for the horses, and the cavalry overthrew their enemies in heaps wherever they advanced. Then a new shout was heard. Both armies in astonishment looked that way; and when the dictator called out that Quinctius the lieutenant and his followers had assailed the enemy in the rear, the cheering was renewed, and he pressed home his own attack more sharply.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <pb id="p.369"/>Now that two battle-fronts and two distinct attacks<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> hemmed in the Etruscans and forced them back from front and rear; and there was no way for them to flee, either back into their camp or into the mountains, whence a new foe had appeared to block their path; and the horses, with loose reins, had borne their riders far and wide; &mdash;the Veientes for the most part ran in disorder to the Tiber, while those of the Fidenates who survived turned towards the city of Fidenae.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In their panic they fled into the middle of the carnage. Some were cut down on the banks of the river; others, forced into the water, were swept away by the current; even experienced swimmers were borne down by weariness and wounds and fear; only a few out of the many swam across.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The other party was carried on through the camp to the city. Thither the Romans too pushed forward in the impetuosity of the pursuit &mdash;especially Quinctius, and with him those who had just come down from the hills and were the freshest soldiers for the work, having arrived at the close of the battle.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After these troops, mingling with the enemy, had entered the gate, they made their way on to the wall, where they raised a signal to show their friends that the town was taken.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the dictator saw it &mdash;for by this time he had himself penetrated to the deserted camp of the enemy, &mdash;he checked his soldiers, who were eager to scatter in search of booty, by encouraging the hope that they would find larger spoils in the city;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and, leading them to the gate, was received within the walls and marched directly to the citadel, whither he saw that the throng of fugitives was rushing Nor was <pb id="p.371"/>the slaughter in the city less than it had been in<note type="margin">B.C. 426</note> the battle, until they threw away their arms, and asking nothing but their lives, surrendered to the dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The city and the camp were sacked. Next day the cavalrymen and centurions drew lots for a single captive each, while those who had shown conspicuous bravery received two. The rest were sold at auction, and the dictator marched his victorious army, enriched with plunder, back to Rome, and triumphed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After commanding his master of the horse to lay down his office, he himself abdicated, giving up in peace on the sixteenth day the supreme authority he had received in time of war and danger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Certain annalists have recorded that there was a naval battle also with the Veientes, near Fidenae, a thing equally difficult and incredible; for even to-day the river is not wide enough for that, and in those times it was somewhat narrower, as we learn from the old writers;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> unless possibly there were a few ships assembled to dispute the passage of the river and this was exaggerated, as so often happens, by those who added to the inscription<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> under the portrait of Aemilius. Livy is thinking of the partiality characteristic of such family records.</note> the false claim of a naval victory.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next year there were military<note type="margin">B.C. 425-424</note> tribunes with consular powers, namely Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, Lucius Furius Medullinus, Lucius Horatius Barbatus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Veientes were granted a truce of twenty years, and the Aequi one of three, though they had asked for a longer one. There was a respite also from civil disturbances.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The following year was noteworthy neither for foreign war nor dissension at home, but gained celebrity from the games which had been vowed <pb id="p.373"/>during the war and were splendidly carried out by<note type="margin">B.C. 425-424</note> the military tribunes and attended by a great concourse of neighbouring peoples.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tribunes with consular authority were Appius Claudius Crassus, Spurius Nautius Rutulus, Lucius Sergius Fidenas, and Sextus Julius Iulus. The spectacle was rendered the more agreeable to the visitors by the courtesy which their hosts had united in a resolution to extend to them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After the games seditious speeches were made by the plebeian tribunes, who berated the populace because, in their besotted admiration of the men they hated, they kept themselves in perpetual servitude, and not only dared not aspire to claim participation in the consulship, but even in the matter of choosing military tribunes &mdash;an
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> election open alike to patricians and plebeians &mdash;took no thought either for themselves or for their friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let them cease therefore to wonder why no one busied himself for the good of the plebs; toil was bestowed and danger risked, they said, in causes which held out hopes of emolument and honour; there was nothing men would not attempt if those who made great efforts were afforded the prospect of great rewards;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but that some one plebeian tribune should rush blindly into a struggle where the risk was enormous and the reward was nothing, and in consequence of which he might be certain that the patricians, against whom he would be striving, would pursue him with relentless animosity, and that the plebs, for whom he would have fought, would not add the least tittle to his honours, was a thing to be neither expected nor demanded. Great hearts were begotten of great honours.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> No plebeian would despise himself when plebeians should cease <pb id="p.375"/>to be despised. It was high time they made trial in<note type="margin">B.C. 425-424</note> one or two cases, to see whether there were some plebeian fit to hold high office, or whether it were almost a portent and a miracle that there should exist any brave and energetic man of plebeian origin.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By exerting their utmost force they had carried the point that military tribunes with consular powers might be chosen even from the plebs. Men whose worth had been proven at home and in the field had stood for the office; during the first years they had been buffeted about, rejected, and laughed at by the patricians; finally, they had ceased to expose themselves to insult.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They could see no reason, they said, why they should not even repeal a statute which authorized something that would never come; there would surely be less shame in the injustice of the law than in being passed over on account of their own unworthiness.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Speeches of this sort, being listened to with approval, incited certain men to stand for the military tribuneship, with the promise that they would propose in their term of office such and such measures of advantage to the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hopes were held out of dividing up the public domain and planting colonies, and of levying a tax on the occupants of the land and distributing the money as pay for the soldiers.<note>The first attempt to tax the patricians enjoying the use of the public land for the purpose of paying the soldiers, who had always been required to serve gratis. See chap. lix. &sect; 11.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The military tribunes then watched for an opportunity when people were out of town, and recalling the senators by a secret notification, got the senate to pass a resolution, in the absence of the tribunes of the plebs, that
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> since the Volsci were rumoured to have made a plundering expedition into the country of the Hernici, the tribunes of the soldiers should go and investigate <pb id="p.377"/>the affair, and that a consular election should be<note type="margin">B.C. 425-424</note> held.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The tribunes set out, leaving Appius Claudius, the decemvir's son, as prefect of the City. He was an energetic young man and imbued from his very cradle with hatred of the tribunes and the plebs. The plebeian tribunes had no ground of contention either with the absent officials who had obtained the resolution of the senate, or with Appius, now that the thing was done. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gaius<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> Sempronius Atratinus and Quintus Fabius Vibulanus were elected consuls.</p> 
			<p>A foreign episode, but worth relating, is ascribed to this year, viz. that Volturnum, the Etruscan city which is now Capua, was taken by the Samnites, and named Capua from their leader Capys, or, as is more probable, from its champaign country.<note>The name is now connected with Greek <foreign lang="greek">kh=pos</foreign> <quote>orchard</quote> or <quote>garden</quote> not (as Livy thought) with <hi rend="italics">campus</hi> <quote>plain.</quote></note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Now they captured it after being admitted by the Etruscans &mdash;who were worn out with fighting &mdash;to a share in the city and its fields; then, on a holiday, when the old settlers were heavy with sleep and feasting, the newcomers fell upon them in the night and slew them.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In the train of these events,<note>The events described in chap. xxxvi.</note> the consuls whom I have named took up their duties, on the 13th of December. By this time not only had those who had been dispatched for this purpose reported that a Volscian invasion was imminent, but
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> envoys from the Latins, and the Hernici as well, announced that never before had the Volscians been more energetic, whether in selecting generals or in levying an army;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that everywhere men were muttering that they must either give up for ever all thoughts of arms and war, and submit to the yoke, or must not lag behind those with whom they were contending for <pb id="p.379"/>supremacy, either in courage or in endurance or in<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> military discipline.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their tidings were true, but they caused no answerable activity among the senators; and Gaius Sempronius, to whom the command had been assigned by lot, trusting to fortune as though it were the most constant thing in the world, because he had commanded the victorious nation against the people they had defeated, conducted everything so carelessly and rashly that Roman discipline was more in evidence in the Volscian army than in the Roman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly Fortune, as on many another occasion, waited on desert. In the first battle, which Sempronius entered without caution or deliberation, his line was not strengthened with reserves nor was his cavalry skilfully posted, when the fighting began.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The battle-cries were the first intimation how the affair was likely to go;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for the enemy's was louder and fuller, that of the Romans dissonant and uneven and, dragging more with each repetition, betrayed the faintness of their hearts. This caused the enemy to charge the more boldly, thrusting with shields and making play with swords.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the Roman side helmets nodded, as their wearers looked this way and that for help, and irresolute soldiers made falteringly for the nearest group; at one moment the standards would be left behind by the retreat of the front-rankers, at the next they would be falling back among their proper maniples.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was not yet a definite flight, not yet a victory; the Romans sought rather to protect themselves than to fight; the Volscians advanced and bore hard against the Roman line, but saw more of their enemies killed than running away.</p> <pb id="p.381"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But now the Romans were everywhere<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> falling back, and it was in vain that Sempronius the consul upbraided or encouraged them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was no virtue either in his authority or in his dignity; and his men would presently have shown the enemy their backs, had not a cavalry decurion<note>The <hi rend="italics">decurion</hi> commanded a <hi rend="italics">decuria</hi> (ten men).

				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In a loud voice he cried out that the horsemen who wished to save the state should leap down from their horses, and when the troopers in every squadron had bestirred themselves as if at the command of the consul, he added: <quote>Unless this bucklered<note>The <hi rend="italics">parma</hi> (<quote>buckler</quote> or <quote>target</quote>) was the trooper's shield, much smaller than the <hi rend="italics">scutum</hi> of the foot-soldier.</note> cohort stops the enemy's rush it is all over with our supremacy.

				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When a cheer had shown their approval of this exhortation, he advanced with uplifted spear. Wherever they went they forced a passage; holding their targets up before them, they charged where they saw the distress of their friends was greatest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The fortune of the day was restored at every point where their onset carried them; nor was there any doubt that if those few men could have been present everywhere at the same time the enemy would have turned tail.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Volscian general saw that their attack could not anywhere be stopped, he ordered his troops to give ground to the men with bucklers, the enemy's new cohort, until, carried forward in their rush, they should be cut off from their friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On this being done, the horsemen were intercepted, and were unable to break through in <pb id="p.383"/>the same way as they had got over, since their enemies<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> were most thickly crowded together where they had made their path.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the consul and the Roman legions could nowhere see the soldiers who a moment before had been a shield to the entire army, they pressed forward to save at any cost so many heroic men from being surrounded and borne down by the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Volscians, facing two ways, sustained on one side the onset of the consul and the legions, and on the other front pressed home their attack upon Tempanius and his troopers;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> who, having failed, in spite of many attempts, to force their way through to their friends, had seized a certain mound and, forming a circle, were defending themselves, not without taking vengeance on their assailants. The battle did not end till nightfall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Neither did the consul relax his efforts anywhere, but kept the enemy engaged as long as there was any light. Darkness put a stop to the indecisive struggle, and the terror in each camp was such, in consequence of men's ignorance of the outcome, that both armies, abandoning their wounded and a good part of their baggage, retreated to the nearest hills, as though defeated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nevertheless the mound was besieged till after midnight. But when word was brought to the besiegers that their camp was abandoned, they too supposed that their side had been defeated, and every man fled where his panic led him in the darkness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Tempanius feared an ambush and kept his soldiers close till daylight. Then, descending with a few followers to reconnoitre, he discovered by questioning some wounded enemies that the camp of the Volscians was deserted, whereupon he joyfully called his men down from the hill and made his way <pb id="p.385"/>into the Roman camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There he found everything<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> abandoned and forlorn and the same desolation he had met with on the ground of the enemy; and, before the Volsci could learn of their blunder and return, he carried with him such of the wounded as he was able, and not knowing what way the consul had gone, took the nearest road to the City.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thither the rumour of an unsuccessful engagement and the abandonment of the camp had already made its way, and more than all the rest the horsemen had been mourned, with public as well as private lamentations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul Fabius was keeping watch before the gates &mdash;for the panic had permeated even the City &mdash;when cavalry were espied a long way off, and caused no little trepidation, since men knew not who they could be.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But being soon after recognized, they turned the people's fear to such rejoicing that the City was filled with the noise of congratulations on the safe and victorious return of the horse; and from the houses which a little while before had been filled with sadness and had bewailed their sons as dead, the inhabitants ran out into the street, and trembling mothers and wives, heedless of decorum in their happiness, hurried to meet the troops, and flung themselves with utter abandonment into the arms of their loved ones, being scarcely able to control themselves for joy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The plebeian tribunes, who had set a day for the trial of Marcus Postumius and Titus Quinctius, because of their responsibility for the reverse at Veii, thought a favourable opportunity was afforded by the odium recently incurred by the consul Sempronius for renewing men's displeasure with them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So, having called a meeting, they loudly declared that the state <pb id="p.387"/>had been betrayed at Veii by its generals; and that<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> then, because they had gone scot free, the army fighting with the Volsci had been betrayed by the consul, their heroic cavalry given over to slaughter, and the camp basely abandoned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then Gaius Junius, one of the tribunes, commanded the cavalryman Tempanius to be called, and turning to him spoke as follows: <quote>Sextus Tempanius, I ask you whether you think that Gaius Sempronius the consul either joined battle at a suitable moment, or strengthened his line with supports, or performed any of the duties of a good consul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and whether you yourself, when the Roman legions had been beaten, dismounted the cavalry of your own motion and restored the fortunes of the battle; then, when you and your troopers had been cut off from our line, if either the consul himself came to your rescue or sent supports;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> furthermore, whether you had any help anywhere next day, or you and your cohort forced a way to the camp by your own valour; whether you found any consul in the camp and any army, or a deserted camp and wounded and forsaken soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the name of your courage and your loyalty, which alone have preserved the republic in this war, you must now answer these questions; finally you must tell us where Gaius Sempronius and our legions are; whether you were abandoned, or yourself abandoned the consul and the army; &mdash;in one word, whether we have been defeated or victorious.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To these questions Tempanius is said to have replied in homely terms but with a soldierly dignity, in which was neither self-praise nor self-complacent criticism of others.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Touching the degree of skill in military matters possessed by Gaius Sempronius, it <pb id="p.389"/>was not for a soldier, he said, to appraise a general:<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> that had been the Roman People's business when it elected Sempronius consul at the comitia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was not, therefore, to him that they must address inquiries concerning the strategy of commanders and the qualifications of consuls; even the weighing of such abilities demanded great mental and intellectual powers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But that which he had seen he was able to report; and he had seen the consul, before he had himself been cut off from the main army, fighting in the front line, encouraging his men, and moving about amidst the standards of the Romans and the enemy's missiles.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had afterwards been carried out of sight of his friends; but still, from the din and shouting, he had made out that the struggle had been prolonged till nightfall, and he did not believe that it had been possible to break through to the hillock which he himself had held, in view of the enemy's numbers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Where the army was, he did not know; he supposed that, just as he himself had protected himself and his men by taking up a strong position, so likewise the consul, in order to save his army, had occupied a place of greater security than the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And he did not believe that the Volsci were any better off than the Roman People; chance and darkness had at every point confused both armies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On his going on to beg that they would not detain him, exhausted by toil and wounds, it is said that he was dismissed with the highest praise, no less for his moderation than for his bravery. Meanwhile the consul had already reached the shrine of Quies<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> Sleep or Repose.</note> on the Labican road. Thither wagons and beasts of burden were dispatched from the City, and brought the soldiers back, weary from fighting and the <pb id="p.391"/>nightmarch.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A little later the consul entered the City,<note type="margin">B.C. 423</note> and showed no less concern to extol Tempanius with well-merited praise than to clear himself of blame.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While the citizens were grieving over their defeat, and were filled with resentment against their commanders, Marcus Postumius, who had been military tribune with consular authority at Veii, was brought before them for trial and condemned to pay a fine of ten thousand pounds of bronze.<note><hi rend="italics">Aes grave</hi> (<quote>heavy bronze</quote>) is used to distinguish the original <hi rend="italics">as libralis</hi>(<hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> of a pound in weight) from the reduced <hi rend="italics">as</hi> of a later time.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Titus Quinctius his colleague, having been victorious both in the Volscian country, when consul under the auspices of the dictator Postumius Tubertus, and at Fidenae, as lieutenant to the other dictator, Mamercus Aemilius, shifted all the blame for the present campaign upon his colleague who had already been condemned, and was acquitted by all the tribes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is said that the memory of his father Cincinnatus, whom the people venerated, was a help to him, and also the fact that Quinctius Capitolinus, now well-stricken in years, supplicated and implored them not to suffer him, who had but a little time to live, to be the bearer of such sad news to Cincinnatus.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The plebs elected in their absence Sextus<note type="margin">B.C. 422</note> Tempanius, Marcus Asellius, Tiberius Antistius, and Tiberius Spurillius to be plebeian tribunes. These were men whom the cavalry had also chosen, at the instance of Tempanius, to act as centurions over them.<note>When they had dismounted to fight as infantry; see chap. xxxviii.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate, feeling that the hatred of Sempronius made the title of consul offensive, ordered the election of military tribunes with consular powers. The successful candidates were Lucius Manlius Capitolinus, Quintus Antonius Merenda, Lucius Papirius Mugillanus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the very beginning of the year Lucius Hortensius, tribune of the plebs, brought an <pb id="p.393"/>action against Gaius Sempronius, consul of the year<note type="margin">B.C. 422</note> before. The tribune's four colleagues besought him in full sight of the Roman People not to persecute their general, in whom nothing could be reckoned amiss save his ill-fortune;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but this Hortensius would not brook, regarding it as a test of his perseverance and persuaded that the defendant was relying not on the entreaties of the tribunes, which were thrown out merely to preserve appearances, but on their veto.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so, turning now to Sempronius, he demanded to be told where the well-known patrician spirit was, and where the courage that placed its confident reliance upon innocence; was it in the shadow of the tribunate that a former consul had found a hiding-place?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And again, addressing his colleagues, he asked, <quote>But what do you mean to do, if I persist in prosecuting the defendant?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Will you rob the people of their rights and overthrow the authority of the tribunes?</quote> When they replied that the authority of the Roman People was supreme over Sempronius and all other men, and that they neither desired nor were able to annul the people's judgment;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but that if their entreaties in behalf of their commander, who stood in the relation of a parent to them, should prove ineffectual, they would put on mourning with him, then Hortensius declared, <quote>The Roman plebs shall not see its tribunes clad in mourning. Gaius Sempronius may go free, for me, since his command has gained him this, to be so beloved by his soldiers.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nor was the loyalty of the four tribunes more pleasing to both plebs and senators than was the disposition of Hortensius to yield so readily to reasonable entreaties.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Fortune now ceased to favour the Aequi,<note>Livy perhaps begins at this point to follow another annalist, who had described a successful campaign of the Aequi not noticed by his authority for what has just preceded.</note> who had <pb id="p.395"/>accepted the dubious victory of the Volsci as their<note type="margin">B.C. 422</note> own. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next year Numerius Fabius<note type="margin">B.C. 421</note> Vibulanus and Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, the son of Capitolinus, were consuls. Under the leadership of Fabius, to whom this command had been assigned by lot, nothing worthy of relation was accomplished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Aequi had scarce made an irresolute show of battle when they were routed and driven disgracefully from the field, and the consul got no credit by the affair. He was accordingly denied a triumph; but because he had relieved the ignominy incurred by Sempronius's defeat, he was allowed to enter the City in an ovation.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But while the war had been concluded with less of a struggle than men had feared, in the City tranquillity gave place to unexpected and serious quarrels, which broke out between the plebs and the senators, and began over the duplication of the number of quaestors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This measure &mdash;that besides the two city quaestors two others should be elected to assist the consuls in the administration of wars &mdash;was proposed by the consuls and received the hearty approval of the senate, but the tribunes of the plebs made a fight to have half of the quaestors &mdash;hitherto patricians had been chosen &mdash;taken from the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Against this provision both consuls and senators at first exerted themselves with all their might; afterwards they were ready to concede that, just as in the case of tribunes with consular powers, so likewise with the quaestors, the people should be unrestricted in their choice; but making no headway with this offer, they dropped the whole question of enlarging the number of quaestors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was then taken up where they had left it by the tribunes; and other <pb id="p.397"/>revolutionary schemes came to the fore in quick<note type="margin">B.C. 421</note> succession, among them one for enacting an agrarian law. When the senate, because of these disturbances, preferred that consuls be elected rather than tribunes, yet was unable to pass a resolution on account of tribunician vetoes, the government passed from the consuls to an interrex;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> nor was even this accomplished without a violent struggle, for the tribunes tried to prevent the patricians from holding a meeting.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The greater part of the ensuing year dragged on with contests between the new tribunes and several interreges. At one time the tribunes would keep the patricians from meeting to appoint an interrex; at another time they would interpose their veto against the interrex, that the senate might not pass a resolution to hold the consular elections.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Finally Lucius Papirius Mugillanus was named interrex, and upbraiding now the senators, now the tribunes of the plebs, reminded them how the state, abandoned and forsaken by men, had been protected by the providential care of Heaven, and existed by the grace of the Veientine truce and the dilatory policy of the Aequi.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If an alarm should break out in that quarter, was it their pleasure that the republic should be caught without a patrician magistrate? that there should be no army, no general to enrol an army?
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Or did they expect to beat off a foreign foe with a civil war? But if both should come at once, the help of the gods themselves would scarce suffice to stay the destruction of the Roman commonwealth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Why would they not every man abate somewhat of his full rights and compromise harmoniously on a middle course, the Fathers consenting that military tribunes should be chosen instead of consuls, the <pb id="p.399"/>tribunes interposing no veto to prevent four quaestors<note type="margin">B.C. 421</note> being taken promiscuously from plebeians and patricians by free election of the people?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The election of tribunes was held first.<note type="margin">B.C. 420</note> The tribunes with consular powers who were chosen were all patricians, namely Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus (for the third time), Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the second time), Marcus Manlius, and Aulus Sempronius Atratinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The last-named held the election for quaestors. Among the several plebeians who sought the place were the son of a plebeian tribune, named Aulus Antistius, and the brother of another, Sextus Pompilius. Yet neither the authority nor the support of these men could prevent the people from giving the preference, because of their noble birth, to men whose fathers and grandfathers they had seen consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This made all the tribunes furious, but more than all the rest Pompilius and Antistius, who were incensed at the defeat of their kinsmen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What in the world, they asked, was the meaning of this? Had neither their own services nor the wrongs which the patricians had inflicted, nor even the pleasure of exercising a right &mdash;since what had before been unlawful was now permitted &mdash;availed to elect a single quaestor from the plebs, let alone a military tribune?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Of no avail had been a father's entreaties for his son, a brother's for his brother, not though they had been tribunes of the plebs, and invested with an inviolable office, created for the protection of liberty. There was fraud in the matter, beyond question, and Aulus Sempronius had employed more artifice than honesty in the election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was by his wrong-doing, they complained, that their relations had been defeated for office. And so, <pb id="p.401"/>since they could not attack the man himself, secure<note type="margin">B.C. 420</note> as he was not only in his innocence but in the magistracy which he was filling, they turned their anger upon Gaius Sempronius, the cousin of Atratinus; and prosecuted him, with the co-operation of their colleague Marcus Canuleius, on the score of the humiliation suffered in the Volscian war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same tribunes frequently mentioned in the senate the division of the public lands, a measure which Gaius Sempronius had always stoutly resisted, for they reckoned &mdash;and rightly &mdash;that either he would abandon the cause and his defence would become a matter of less concern to the patricians, or that persevering in his attitude he would give offence, up to the moment of his trial, to the plebeians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He chose to face the storm of unpopularity and to injure his own cause rather than be found wanting in that of the nation; and he held fast to the same opinion, that there should be no largess, for that would redound to the advantage of the three tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was not land for the plebs they were then looking for, he declared, but hatred for himself; he was as ready as another to confront that tempest with a courageous heart; nor ought the senate to set so high a value upon himself or any other citizen that their tenderness for him should bring about a general disaster.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His spirit was not a whit less firm when the day of trial came.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He pleaded his own cause; the senators exerted in vain every means of mollifying the plebs; and he was condemned to pay a fine of fifteen thousand <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi></p> 
			<p>The same year a Vestal virgin named Postumia was put on trial for unchastity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> She was innocent of the charge, though open to suspicion because of her <pb id="p.403"/>pretty clothes and the unmaidenly freedom of her<note type="margin">B.C. 420</note> wit. After she had been remanded and then acquitted, the pontifex maximus, in the name of the college, commanded her to abstain from jests, and to dress rather with regard to sanctity than coquetry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In this same year Cumae, a city which the Greeks then held, was captured by the Campanians.</p> 
			<p>The ensuing year had as military tribunes with consular powers Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, Publius Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Spurius Nautius Rutulus.

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was a year remarkable, thanks to the good<note type="margin">B.C. 419-18</note> fortune of the Roman People, for a great danger but not a disaster. The slaves conspired to set fire to the City at points remote from one another, and, while the people should be busy everywhere with rescuing their houses, to seize the Citadel and the Capitol with an armed force.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Jupiter brought their wicked schemes to naught, and on the evidence of two of their number the guilty were arrested and punished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Each informant was rewarded from the public treasury with ten thousand pounds of bronze &mdash;which passed for wealth in those days &mdash;and with freedom.</p> 
			<p>The Aequi then began to prepare again for war; and word was brought to Rome on good authority that new enemies, the Labicani, were making common cause with the old ones.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the Aequi, the citizens had by now grown accustomed to war with them, as to an annual occurrence; but they dispatched envoys to Labici, and having got them back with an ambiguous answer, from which it appeared that though war was not as yet being organized, yet peace would not long continue, they commissioned the Tusculans to watch that no fresh outbreak should occur at that place.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><pb id="p.405"/>
			<p>To the military tribunes with consular authority<note type="margin">B.C. 419-418</note> who held office the ensuing year, Lucius Sergius Fidenas, Marcus Papirius Mugillanus, and Gaius Servilius, son of the Priscus who as dictator had captured Fidenae, there came,
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> just as they had entered on their magistracy, ambassadors from Tusculum, who announced that the Labicani had armed and, after devastating the Tusculan countryside in company with an Aequian army, had encamped on Algidus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thereupon war was declared against the Labicani, and the senate resolved that two of the tribunes should proceed to the front, while one attended to matters in Rome. At this a dispute immediately broke out amongst the tribunes, each of whom boasted of his superiority as a general and spurned the care of the City as a thankless and ignoble task.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While the astonished senators watched this unseemly rivalry amongst the colleagues, Quintus Servilius exclaimed, <quote>Since you have no respect for this order nor for the republic, a father's authority shall end your quarrel. My son shall preside over the City, without recourse to lots. I only hope that those who are eager to make the campaign may conduct it with more consideration and harmony than they display in seeking it.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was determined not to make a general levy on the entire people, but ten tribes were chosen by lot. From these the two tribunes enrolled the men of military age and led them to war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The bickerings which had commenced between them in the City grew much hotter in the camp, from the same eagerness to command; they could not agree on anything; each strove for his own opinion; each desired his own plans and his own orders to be the <pb id="p.407"/>only valid ones;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> each despised the other and was<note type="margin">B.C. 419-418</note> in turn despised by him, until at last, reproved by their lieutenants, they arranged to exercise the supreme command on alternate days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the report of this reached Rome, it is said that Quintus Servilius, taught by years and experience, besought the immortal gods that the strife between the tribunes might not result more disastrously to the republic than had been the case at Veii, and as though certain defeat were imminent, urged his son to enlist soldiers and make ready arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor was he a false prophet. For under the leadership of Lucius Sergius, whose day it was to command, the Romans found themselves in an unfavourable position close to the enemy's camp, whither they had been drawn, when the Aequi feigned fear and retired to their rampart, by the vain hope of capturing it; and there they were suddenly attacked by the Aequi and driven pellmell down a sloping valley, where many of them, as they rather tumbled down than retreated, were overtaken and put to the sword.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That day they defended their camp with difficulty, and on the next, when the enemy had almost surrounded it, they abandoned it by a disgraceful flight through the opposite gate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The generals and their lieutenants and such of the army's strength as kept to the standards made for Tusculum: the others, scattering through the fields, this way and that, hastened to Rome by divers roads and reported a much heavier defeat than had been sustained.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was the less dismay for the reason that the event had tallied with men's apprehensions, and because reserves which they could look to in the hour of danger had been made ready by the tribune <pb id="p.409"/>of the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was by his orders too that the<note type="margin">B.C. 419-418</note> lesser magistrates had quieted the confusion in the City, when the scouts whom he had hurriedly sent out reported that the generals and the army were at Tusculum, and that the enemy had not broken camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And &mdash;what raised men's courage most &mdash; Quintus Servilius Priscus was in consequence of a senatorial decree named dictator &mdash;a man whose clear vision in public affairs the state had proved on many previous occasions, but particularly in the outcome of this war, because he alone had viewed the quarrel of the tribunes with anxiety, before their defeat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Having appointed his son, by whom, when military tribune, he had himself been pronounced dictator, to be master of the horse, &mdash;as
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> some authorities have recorded; for others write that Servilius Ahala was master of the horse that year, &mdash;he set out with a fresh army for the war, sent for the troops which were at Tusculum, and fixed his camp two miles from the enemy.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In consequence of their success, the Aequi<note type="margin">B.C. 417-416</note> had taken over the arrogance and carelessness which the Roman generals had shown, and the result was seen in the very first battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the dictator had attacked with his cavalry and had thrown the enemy's front ranks into confusion, he ordered the legions to advance rapidly, and when one of his standard-bearers hesitated, cut him down.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So eager for combat were the troops, that the Aequi could not stop their rush, and when, defeated in the field, they had withdrawn to their camp in a disordered flight, it was stormed with less expenditure of time and effort than the battle itself had cost.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having captured and sacked the camp, the dictator <pb id="p.411"/>relinquished the plunder to his soldiers; and the cavalry,<note type="margin">B.C. 417-416</note> which had pursued the enemy as they fled from their encampment, came back with the report that all
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the Labicani, after their defeat, and a great part of the Aequi, had taken refuge in Labici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Next day the army marched to Labici and, drawing a cordon about the town, stormed it with ladders and plundered it. Leading his victorious army back to Rome, the dictator resigned his office eight days after his appointment; and the senate seized the opportunity, before the tribunes of the plebs could stir up agrarian troubles by proposing a division of the Labican territory, to resolve, in a largely-attended meeting, that a colony should be planted in Labici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Fifteen hundred colonists were sent from the City, and each received two <hi rend="italics">iugera.</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">iugerum</hi> was about five-eighths of an acre.</note></p> 
			<p>The year that followed the capture of Labici, having as military tribunes with consular powers Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, Gaius Servilius Structus, and Publius Lucretius Tricipitinus (all these for the second time), together with Spurius Rutilius Crassus;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and the succeeding year, with Aulus Sempronius Atratinus (for his third term) and Marcus Papirius Mugillanus and Spurius Nautius Rutulus (for their second) were a period of tranquillity in foreign relations but of civil discord arising out of agrarian laws.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Those who stirred up the people were Spurius Maecilius, tribune of the plebs for the fourth time, and Marcus Metilius, for the third, both having been elected in their absence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On their proposing a law that the land which had been captured from enemies should be divided up among the citizens, a plebiscite which would mean the confiscation of the <pb id="p.413"/>fortunes of a great part of the nobles &mdash;for
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> there<note type="margin">B.C. 417-416</note> was scarcely any land, as might be expected in the case of a city situated on alien soil, which had not been gained by force of arms;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> nor was much, if any, of that which had been sold or assigned by the state held by other than plebeians, &mdash;it appeared that a desperate struggle was at hand between the plebs and the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The military tribunes had hit upon no plan of action either in the senate or in the private conferences which they held with the leading men, when Appius Claudius, grandson of him who had been decemvir for drawing up the laws, himself the youngest of the council of senators, announced &mdash;so
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the story goes &mdash;that he was bringing them from his house an old family device;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for it had been his great-grandfather<note>Really his great-great-grandfather (<hi rend="italics">abavus</hi>).</note> Appius Claudius who had pointed out to the senators that the only way to break the power of the tribunes lay through the veto of their colleagues.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was not difficult for the leading men of the state to induce upstart politicians<note>The term <hi rend="italics">novus homo</hi> was usually applied to a man who was the first of his family to hold a curule office (curule aedileship, praetorship, consulship).</note> to change their minds, if they would but suit their discourse meantime rather to the exigencies of the crisis than to their lofty station.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The sentiments of such fellows varied with their fortunes: when they saw that their colleagues, by taking the lead in the management of affairs, had appropriated all the favour of the populace in advance and had left no room there for themselves, they would incline without reluctance to the cause of the senate, by supporting which they might gain the goodwill not only of the order as a whole, but also of the foremost senators.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they had all expressed their approval, and especially Quintus Servilius Priscus, who praised the young man as <pb id="p.415"/>one who had not degenerated from the Claudian<note type="margin">B.C. 417-416</note> stock, everybody was given the task of inducing such of the tribunician college as he could to interpose their vetoes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The senate adjourned and the leading members began to canvass the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> By arguments in which they mingled warnings with the promise that their action would earn the tribunes the personal gratitude of individuals, as well as that of the senate as a body, they got six men to promise their opposition.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Next day when the senate, in accordance with a preconcerted plan, had taken up the question of the sedition which Maecilius and Metilius were beginning by proposing a donation of the most objectionable type, the principal senators made speeches in which each took occasion to say that he could think of nothing to suggest and saw no help for the situation anywhere save in the assistance of the tribunes;
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> this was the power to whose protection the harassed republic, like a private citizen in distress, now fled for succour; it was a, glorious thing both for the men themselves and for their office that the tribunate possessed no less strength for the resistance of its wicked colleagues than for troubling the senate and promoting discord between the orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Loud shouts were then heard from the entire senate and appeals were addressed to the tribunes from every part of the Curia. Then, after silence had been obtained, those who had been won over by the favour of the chief senators declared their readiness to veto the measure which their colleagues had proposed but the senate deemed subversive of the republic.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The thanks of the senate were voted the protesters. The authors of the bill convened an assembly, and accusing their <pb id="p.417"/>colleagues of being traitors to the interests of the<note type="margin">B.C. 417-416</note> plebs and slaves of the consulars, and in other ways bitterly denouncing them, withdrew their measure.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There would have been two wars in the<note type="margin">B.C. 415-411</note> ensuing year, in which Publius Cornelius Cossus, Gaius Valerius Potitus, Quintus Quinctius Cincinnatus, and Numerius Fabius Vibulanus were military tribunes with consular powers, had not the war with Veii been delayed, thanks to the superstition of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Veientine leaders, whose farms an overflow of the Tiber had laid waste, chiefly by ruining the farmhouses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the same time the Aequi were deterred by the defeat they had suffered three years before from marching to the assistance of the Bolani, a tribe of their own race.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These people had made incursions into the neighbouring territory of Labici and attacked the new settlers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consequences of this outrage they had hoped to avoid by means of the co-operation of all the Aequi; but, having been abandoned by their friends, they lost their town and their lands, in a war which does not even merit description, as the result of a siege and a single skirmish.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> An attempt on the part of Lucius Decius, a plebeian tribune, to carry a law providing that colonists should be sent to Bolae too, as well as to Labici, was frustrated through the intervention of his colleagues, who intimated that they would permit no plebiscite to pass unless it had the warrant of the senate.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Bolae was retaken the next year, and the Aequi planted a colony there and strengthened the town with new defenders. Rome now had the following military tribunes with consular powers, Gnaeus Cornelius Cossus, Lucius Valerius Potitus, Quintus Fabius Vibulanus (for the second time), and Marcus <pb id="p.419"/>Postumius Regillensis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this last was intrusted<note type="margin">B.C. 415-414</note> the campaign against the Aequi. He was a wrongheaded man, yet he showed it more in the hour of victory than during the campaign.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For he was energetic in raising an army and leading it to Bolae, where, after breaking the spirit of the Aequi in some trifling engagements, he finally forced an entrance into the town. He then diverted the quarrel from the enemy to his fellow-citizens; and though he had proclaimed at the time of the attack that the booty should belong to the soldiers, when he had taken the town he broke his promise.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This, I am inclined to believe, was the cause of the army's resentment, rather than the fact that in a recently-plundered city inhabited by new settlers, there was less booty than the tribune had predicted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The ill-feeling was increased, when, being sent for by his colleagues on account of tribunician disturbances, he had returned to the City, by a stupid and almost insane remark he was heard to make in an assembly, where Marcus Sextius, a plebeian tribune, in introducing an agrarian measure, announced that he should propose also that colonists be dispatched to Bolae &mdash;for it was proper, he said, that the city and lands of the Bolani should belong to those who had captured them in war. <quote>Woe to my soldiers,</quote> exclaimed Postumius, <quote>unless they hold their peace!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> &mdash;a saying which presently, on being reported to the senators, offended them no less than it had the assembly. And the tribune of the plebs, a keen and not uneloquent man, having got for one of his adversaries a man of haughty spirit and unbridled tongue, whom he could irritate and provoke to say things that would not only make himself disliked <pb id="p.421"/>but his cause and the entire senate as well, made a<note type="margin">B.C. 415-414</note> point of involving Postumius in a dispute more
				<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> often than any other member of the college of military tribunes. On this particular occasion, after that savage and brutal threat, he cried, <quote>Do you hear him, Quirites, threatening his soldiers with punishment like slaves?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Shall this wild beast seem to you, notwithstanding, more deserving of so great an office than those who would present you with a city and with lands, and send you out to colonies; who would provide a home for your old age; who fight for your interests against these cruel and insolent adversaries?
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And does it surprise you that so few espouse your cause? What are they to expect of you? Those offices which you give by preference to your opponents, rather than to the champions of the Roman People?
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> You groaned just now when you heard his remark. What of it? If you should be asked to vote this very moment, you would elect this man who threatens you with chastisement in preference to those who wish to secure you lands and houses and fortunes.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this saying of Postumius reached the<note type="margin">B.C. 414</note> troops, it stirred up much greater indignation in the camp: did the man who had fraudulently cut off his soldiers from their spoils also threaten them with punishment?
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And while they murmured openly, the quaestor Publius Sestius, thinking that the mutiny could be quelled with the same violence which had occasioned it, sent a lictor to arrest a certain brawling soldier;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> whereupon shouts and objurgations broke forth, and Sestius was hit with a stone and retreated from the scuffle, while the man who had wounded him thundered after him that the quaestor <pb id="p.423"/>had got what the general had threatened to give his<note type="margin">B.C. 414</note> men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Being summoned to deal with this disturbance, Postumius aggravated everything by his harsh inquisitions and savage punishments. Finally his anger got beyond all bounds, and when the shout of those whom he had ordered to be put to death under a hurdle<note>See the account, in I. li. 9, of the execution of Herdonius Here water is not mentioned, and the victim was probably placed on the ground and crushed beneath the stones which were heaped upon the hurdle.</note> had caused a crowd to gather, he ran down in a frenzy of passion from his tribunal to those who would have interrupted the execution.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There, when the lictors and centurions assailed the mob and tried to drive them back, on this side and on that, resentment ran so high that a military tribune was overwhelmed with a volley of stones from his own soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This dreadful deed having been announced in Rome, the tribunes of the soldiers wished to institute a senatorial inquiry into the death of their colleague, but the plebeian tribunes interposed their vetoes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The dispute was closely connected with another struggle. The senators had become apprehensive lest the plebs, what with their fear of investigations and their indignation, should elect military tribunes from their own class; they therefore used all their efforts to have consuls chosen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Since the plebeian tribunes would not allow the resolution of the senate<note>Providing for the investigation of the murder of Postumius.</note> to go through, and also vetoed the election of consuls, the state reverted to an interregnum. The victory then rested with the senators.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, acting as interrex,<note type="margin">B.C. 413</note> held an election, and Aulus Cornelius Cossus and Lucius Furius Medullinus were chosen consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In their consulship, early in the year, a senatorial resolution was passed that the tribunes should bring the investigation of Postumius's murder before the plebs at the earliest possible moment, and that the <pb id="p.425"/>plebs should appoint whomsoever they wished to<note type="margin">B.C. 413</note> have charge of the inquiry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The plebs unanimously referred the matter to the consuls. They accomplished their task with the utmost moderation and leniency, punishing a few only, &mdash;and these are generally believed to have committed suicide; &mdash;yet
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> they were unable to prevent the transaction from being bitterly resented by the plebs, who complained that the measures which had been proposed in their interests lay all this while neglected, whereas the law that was passed concerning their punishment and their lives was carried out at once, and most effectually. It would have been a very suitable occasion, now that the mutiny had been avenged, to appease their anger by offering to divide the Bolan territory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Had the senators done this, they would have lessened men's desire for the agrarian law which was meant to expel the patricians from their wrongful occupation of the public domain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As it was, a sense of injury was aroused by the very circumstance that the nobility not only persisted in retaining the public lands, which they held by force, but would not even divide among the plebeians the unoccupied ground which had recently been taken from the enemy and would soon, they thought, become, like all the rest, the booty of a few.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The same year the Volsci laid waste the borders of the Hernici, and the legions were led out to meet them by the consul Furius. Not finding the enemy there, they captured Ferentinum, to which a great number of Volsci had retired.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was less plunder there than they had expected, because the Volsci, having small hopes of defending the town, removed their possessions by night and abandoned <pb id="p.427"/>it; next day, when it was taken, it was practically<note type="margin">B.C. 413</note> deserted. The town itself and its territory were given to the Hernici.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this year, which the moderation of the<note type="margin">B.C. 412-411</note> tribunes had made a quiet one, came the plebeian tribuneship of Lucius Icilius, when Quintus Fabius Ambustus and Gaius Furius Paculus were consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While Icilius, at the very outset of the year, was endeavouring to stir up sedition by the promulgation of agrarian laws, as
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> if it had been the appointed task of his name and family, a pestilence broke out, which, though it was more threatening than fatal, diverted men's thoughts from the Forum and political conflicts to their homes and the care of the sick, and is thought to have been less hurtful than the sedition would have been.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The state had escaped with very few deaths, considering the great number of those who had fallen ill, when the year of pestilence was succeeded, in the consulship of Marcus Papirius Atratinus and Gaius Nautius Rutulus, by a scarcity of corn, owing to the neglect of tillage usual at such times.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Indeed the famine would have been more baneful than the disease, had they not supplemented the supply of corn by dispatching emissaries to all the peoples round about who dwelt on the Tuscan sea or by the Tiber, to purchase it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Samnites who held Capua and Cumae insolently refused to permit the envoys to trade with them, but the Sicilian tyrants,<note>Livy probably has Dionysius I. in mind; though in reality it was several years later when he became tyrant of Syracuse.</note> on the contrary, lent them generous assistance; and the largest supplies of all were brought down the Tiber, with the hearty goodwill of the Etruscans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls experienced a lack of men in the afflicted City, and, being unable to find more than one senator for an embassy, were obliged to add <pb id="p.429"/>two knights to each.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With the exception of the<note type="margin">B.C. 412-411</note> disease and the shortage of corn, there was no internal or foreign trouble during these two years. But no sooner had these anxieties departed, than there came an outbreak of all the ills which were wont to harass the state, domestic quarrels and war abroad.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the consulship of Marcus Aemilius and<note type="margin">B.C. 410</note> Gaius Valerius Potitus the Aequi prepared to go to war, and the Volsci, though they did not take up arms as a nation, made the campaign as volunteers serving for pay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When, on the rumour of their advance, &mdash; for they had already crossed over into Latin and Hernican territory, &mdash;Valerius the consul was raising troops, and Marcus Menenius, tribune of the plebs and proposer of an agrarian law, was obstructing the levy, and everybody who did not
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> wish to go was availing himself of the tribune's protection and refusing the oath, on a sudden came the news that the citadel of Carventum had been seized by the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This humiliation not only gave the patricians the means of stirring up feeling against Menenius, but supplied the rest of the tribunes, who had already been persuaded to veto the agrarian law, with a more justifiable pretext for resisting their colleague.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The dispute was long drawn out. The consuls called gods and men to witness that the responsibility for whatever defeat or disgrace had already been or threatened to be visited on them by the enemy would rest with Menenius, because of his interference with the levy;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Menenius, on the other hand, protested loudly that if the occupants of the public domain would surrender their illegal possession of it, he was prepared to withdraw his opposition to the muster. At this juncture nine tribunes interposed a resolution <pb id="p.431"/>which ended the contention.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They proclaimed in<note type="margin">B.C. 410</note> the name of the college that they would support the consul Gaius Valerius if, in enforcing the levy, he resorted, despite the veto of their colleague, to fines and other forms of coercion against those who refused to serve.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Armed with this decree, the consul caused the few who appealed to the tribune to be haled before him; the rest were cowed into taking the oath.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The army marched to the citadel of Carventum; and although the soldiers were hated by the consul and returned his hostility, yet the moment they came to the place, they manfully drove out the garrison and recovered the stronghold, which had been laid open to attack by the negligence that had permitted men to slip away from the garrison in quest of booty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There was a considerable accumulation of spoils from this constant raiding, because everything had been heaped up there for safety. All this the consul ordered the quaestors to sell at auction and place the proceeds in the public treasury, giving out word that the army should share in the plunder only when the men had not refused to serve.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This increased the enmity of plebs and soldiers towards the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so when he entered the City in an ovation, as the senate had decreed, the soldiers, with military freedom, shouted out rude verses now abusing the consul and now praising Menenius, while at every mention of the tribune's name the enthusiasm of the attendant populace vied with the voices of the men in cheers and applause.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This circumstance caused the patricians more anxiety than the sauciness of the soldiers towards the consul, which was virtually an established custom; and as though they made no question that Menenius would be chosen for one of the military tribunes, if he were <pb id="p.433"/>a candidate, they held a consular election and so<note type="margin">B.C. 410</note> excluded him.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls elected were Gnaeus Cornelius<note type="margin">B.C. 409</note> Cossus and (for the second time) Lucius Furius Medullinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Never before had the plebs felt so aggrieved that they were not allowed to choose military tribunes. They showed their disappointment, and likewise avenged it, at the election of quaestors, when plebeians were for the first time chosen to that office; though among the four to be elected room was made for one patrician, Caeso Fabius Ambustus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Three plebeians, Quintus Silius, Publius Aelius, and Publius Pupius, were preferred before young men of the most distinguished families. I find that those who encouraged the people to make so free with their votes were the Icilii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Three members of that family, a family most hostile to the patricians, had been made plebeian tribunes for that year, in consequence of the many great hopes they had held out to the populace, always more than eager to accept such promises.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These men had declared that they would make no move in their behalf, if even in the election of quaestors &mdash;the only election which the senate had left open to both classes &mdash;the people could not find sufficient resolution to accomplish what they had so long wished to do and the laws permitted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so the plebs felt that they had won a great victory, not estimating the significance of that quaestorship by the limits of the office itself, but feeling that the way to consulships and triumphs was thrown open to new men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The patricians, on the other hand, were as angry as though they had not merely shared their offices with the plebs but had lost them. They said that if such <pb id="p.435"/>things were to be, it was wrong for them to rear<note type="margin">B.C. 409</note> children, who after being driven out from the places of their forefathers would behold others in possession of their honours, and would be left, without power or authority, to serve no other purpose than to offer up sacrifices, as salii and flamens,<note>The <hi rend="italics">salii</hi> were a very ancient college of priests whose name was derived from a weapon-dance which figured in their ritual. The <hi rend="italics">flamen</hi> ('kindler') was the special priest of some god, thus the <hi rend="italics">Flamen Dialis</hi> was attached to the cult of Jupiter, the <hi rend="italics">Flamen Martialis</hi> to that of Mars, etc.</note> for the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The feelings of both sides were overwrought. The plebs had plucked up courage and they had three very distinguished leaders for the popular cause. The patricians, perceiving that every election where the plebs were free to choose either sort of candidate would be like that of the quaestors, strove to bring about a consular election, which was not yet open to both orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Icilii, on the contrary, maintained that military tribunes should be chosen; it was high time, they said, that the plebs were given their share of honours.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the consuls had no measure on foot which the tribunes could oppose and so wring from them what they wanted, when, by a wonderful piece of luck, the Volsci and Aequi were reported to have crossed the border and raided the lands of the Latins and the Hernici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As the consuls, in order to meet this invasion, were commencing to raise an army, in pursuance of a resolution of the senate, the tribunes obstructed the levy with all their might, declaring that the incident had been a fortunate one for the plebeians and themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were three of them, and they were all very active and belonged to a family which might now be called noble, considering that they were plebeians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Two of them assumed the task of keeping constant watch on the consuls, each taking one of them; to the third was given the duty of haranguing the plebs, for the purpose, now of <pb id="p.437"/>restraining, now of urging them on. The consuls could<note type="margin">B.C. 409</note> neither bring about the levy, nor the tribunes the election, they desired. Then, as fortune was inclining to the cause of the plebs, came couriers who reported that while the soldiers who were in garrison at the citadel of Carventum had dispersed to plunder, the Aequi had come, and killing the few guards, had rushed the place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some of the soldiers had been cut down as they were hurrying back to the fortress, others as they roamed the fields. This national reverse added strength to the contention of the tribunes. It was in vain they were importuned to cease at last their opposition to the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They yielded neither to the public need nor to men's hatred of themselves, and carried their point &mdash;that the senate should pass a decree for the election of military tribunes. It was, however, expressly provided that no one should be accepted as a candidate who had that year been tribune of the plebs, and that no tribune of the Plebs should be re-elected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is evident that the senate wished to stigmatize the Icilii, whom they charged with seeking the consulship<note>Livy here employs <quote>consulship</quote> as a convenient, if not quite accurate, substitute for <quote>consular tribuneship.</quote></note> as a reward for their seditious conduct while tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The levy was then begun and preparation made for war, with the consent of all the orders. Whether both consuls marched to the citadel of Carventum, or one stayed behind to hold an election, is uncertain in view of the contradictory accounts of the authorities. Thus much is clear (for in this they do not differ), that the Romans, after a long and futile siege, retired from the citadel of Carventum and recaptured Verrugo,<note>See iv. i. 4. Livy has not mentioned the previous loss of Verrugo to the Volsci.</note> in the Volscian country, with the same army, which spread great <pb id="p.439"/>devastation both among the Aequi and in the<note type="margin">B.C. 409</note> territory of the Volsci, and gathered enormous spoils.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome, though the plebeians were so far<note type="margin">B.C. 408</note> victorious as to have the election they preferred, yet in the outcome of the election the patricians won the day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the military tribunes with consular authority were all three, contrary to the universal expectation, chosen from the patricians, viz., Gaius Julius lulus, Publius Cornelius Cossus, and Gaius Servilius Ahala.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The patricians are said to have employed a ruse (and the Icilii taxed them with it at the time), in that they mixed a rabble of unworthy competitors with the deserving, and the disgust which the notorious turpitude of certain of them provoked turned the people against the plebeian candidates.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then came a rumour that the Volsci and Aequi, whether encouraged by their defence of the citadel of Carventum or angered by the loss of the garrison at Verrugo, had risen in prodigious strength;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that the Antiates were the head and front of the war; that their envoys had gone about among the tribes of both races, upbraiding their cowardice in having hidden behind their walls the year before and allowed the Romans to pillage their lands and overwhelm the garrison at Verrugo.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They would presently be sending out, not merely armed expeditions across their borders, but colonies too; and not only, they said, had the Romans divided up their possessions amongst themselves, but they had even taken Ferentinum from them and bestowed it on the Hernici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These words aroused indignation, and a number of young men were enlisted wherever the envoys went. So the forces of all the tribes drew together at Antium, where they encamped and waited for the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <pb id="p.441"/>When these things had been reported at Rome,<note type="margin">B.C. 408</note> amid excitement even greater than the situation warranted, the senate at once had recourse to its final counsel in emergencies, and ordered the appointment of a dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is said that Julius and Cornelius resented this, and that a very bitter discussion took place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In vain the leading senators complained that the military tribunes were not amenable to senatorial control, and eventually appealed to the tribunes of the plebs and reminded them that their authority had in a similar case operated to restrain the consuls. But the tribunes of the plebs were delighted with the want of harmony amongst the senators.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They could give no assistance, they said, to men who did not regard them as citizens, or even as human beings.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If some day offices were thrown open to all, and they were given a share in the government, they would then see to it that no proud magistrate thwarted the decrees of the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Meanwhile let the patricians live with no regard for laws and magistracies, and let the tribunes act as they saw fit.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This quarrel, so inopportune at a time when<note type="margin">B.C. 407</note> a great war was in hand, had quite taken possession of men's thoughts, and for a long time Julius and Cornelius &mdash;first
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> one and then the other &mdash;had argued that, since they were themselves quite capable of directing that campaign, it was unfair that they should be summarily deprived of the office which the people had intrusted to them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> when Servilius Ahala arose and said that he had been so long silent not because of any doubt as to his opinion &mdash;for what good citizen considered his own interests apart from those of the nation? &mdash;but because he had <pb id="p.443"/>wished that his colleagues should of their own free<note type="margin">B.C. 407</note> will give in to the senators' authority, instead of suffering the power of the tribunes to be invoked against them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even then, if the circumstances allowed of it, he would gladly, he said, have given them time to retreat from their too obstinate contention; but since war's necessity did not wait upon man's deliberations, he should place the public welfare above the favour of his colleagues;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and if the senate held to its opinion, he should name a dictator that night, contenting himself, if any one vetoed the senate's resolution, with the expression of its wishes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having by this course gained the well-merited praise and friendly support of all, he named as dictator Publius Cornelius, by whom he was himself appointed master of the horse, thus showing such persons as considered the case of his colleagues and himself that favour and high office sometimes come more easily when men do not covet them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The war was no way noteworthy. In a single battle, and an easy one, they defeated the enemy at Antium. The victorious army laid waste the Volscian country and took by storm a fortress at Lake Fucinus, where three thousand men were taken prisoners, the rest being driven within their city-walls, leaving their fields defenceless.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The dictator, after so conducting the campaign that he seemed barely to have taken advantage of his luck, returned to the City, with more good fortune than renown, and resigned his magistracy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The tribunes of the soldiers, without saying a word about electing consuls, &mdash;I suppose because of their indignation at the appointment of a dictator, &mdash;proclaimed an election of military tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At that the patricians were <pb id="p.445"/>more concerned than ever, as they might well be<note type="margin">B.C. 407</note> when they saw their cause betrayed by their own fellows.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly, just as in the preceding year they had used the least worthy of the plebeian competitors to arouse a dislike of them all, even the deserving, so at this time, by setting up as candidates the senators of the greatest splendour and popularity, they secured all the places, in order that no plebeian might be chosen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Four men were elected, all of whom had held that office before. They were Lucius Furius Medullinus, Gaius Valerius Potitus, Numerius Fabius Vibulanus, and Gaius Servilius Ahala. This last was continued in office partly for his other good qualities, partly because of the approval he had just gained by his singular moderation.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In that year, since the term of the truce<note type="margin">B.C. 406</note> with Veii had run out, steps were taken to demand restitution, through ambassadors and fetials.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Arriving at the frontier, these men were met by an embassy of the Veientes, who asked them not to proceed to Veii until they themselves should have gone before the Roman senate. The senate, considering that the Veientes were in the throes of civil discord, agreed not to demand a settlement of them; so far were they from taking advantage of another people's difficulties.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And in the Volscian country the Romans suffered a disaster, in the loss of their garrison at Verrugo. On that occasion the element of time was of such moment that, although the troops who were being besieged there by the Volsci appealed for help and might have been relieved if their friends had made haste, yet the army dispatched for that purpose only arrived in season to surprise <pb id="p.447"/>the enemy as they were dispersed in quest of booty,<note type="margin">B.C. 406</note> just after putting the garrison to the sword.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The delay was due quite as much to the tribunes as to the senate, for they got reports that the garrison was making a strenuous resistance and failed to consider that no valour can transcend the limits of human endurance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the heroic soldiers were not unavenged, living or dead.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The following year, when Publius and Gnaeus Cornelius Cossus, Numerius Fabius Ambustus, and Lucius Valerius Potitus were consular tribunes, war broke out with Veii on account of the insolent reply of the Veientine senate, who, when envoys demanded restitution of them, bade them be
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> answered that unless they got quickly out from their city and their borders, they would give them what Lars Tolumnius had given the others.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> death (see chap. xvii).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This angered the Fathers, and they decreed that the military tribunes should propose to the people a declaration of war on the Veientes at the earliest possible day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As soon as this was promulgated, the young men protested loudly that the Volscian war was not yet brought to a conclusion; two garrisons had just been destroyed, and the other outposts were being held at great risk; not a year went by without a pitched battle;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and as though they had not troubles enough, a new war was being started with a neighbouring and very powerful people, who were sure to raise all Etruria against them.</p> 
			<p>This smouldering discontent was fanned into a blaze by the plebeian tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They persistently declared that it was the plebs with whom the senators were chiefly at war;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> them they deliberately plagued with campaigning and exposed to be <pb id="p.449"/>slaughtered by the enemy; them they kept at a<note type="margin">B.C. 406</note> distance from the City, and assigned to foreign service, lest they might have thoughts, if they remained peaceably at home, of liberty and colonies, and might agitate for public lands or the free use of their votes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And laying hold of veteran soldiers, they enumerated the campaigns of each and his wounds and scars; asking where one could now find a whole place on their bodies to receive fresh wounds, or what blood they had left to shed for their country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When the tribunes by repeating these arguments in their talk and in their speeches had produced in the plebs a reluctance to undertake the war, the authors of the bill put off the time for voting on it, since it was clear that if subjected to the storm of disapproval it would fail to pass.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meantime it was determined that the military tribunes should lead the army into the country of the Volsci; only Gnaeus Cornelius was left in Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The three tribunes, on its appearing that the Volsci had no camp anywhere and did not propose to risk a battle, divided their army into three and advanced in different directions to lay waste the country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Valerius marched upon Antium, Cornelius against Ecetrae, and wherever they went they plundered farms and buildings far and wide, to divide the forces of the Volsci; Fabius led his troops to Anxur, the principal object of their attack, and laid siege to it, without doing any pillaging.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Anxur, the Tarracinae of our day,<note>Anxur was likely the Volscian name. The present form of the name is Terracina.</note> was a city which sloped down towards the marshes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On this side Fabius threatened an assault, while four cohorts <pb id="p.451"/>marched round under Gaius Servilius Ahala, and<note type="margin">B.C. 406</note> seizing the hill which overhangs the city, assailed the walls from this superior position, where there was no force to oppose them, with great noise and confusion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hearing the din, the soldiers who were defending the lowest part of the town against Fabius were bewildered, and permitted him to bring up scaling-ladders; and soon the whole place was alive with enemies, who for a long time gave no quarter, slaughtering without distinction those who fled and those who resisted, the armed and the unarmed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so the vanquished, since they could hope for no mercy if they yielded, were compelled to fight; when suddenly the command was given that none should be hurt but those who carried weapons. Thereupon, all the survivors voluntarily laid down their arms, and about twenty-five hundred of them were taken alive.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Fabius made his soldiers leave the rest of the spoils until his colleagues could
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> come up, saying that their armies had helped to capture Anxur by diverting the rest of the Volsci from the defence of that place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they arrived, the three armies sacked the town, which long years of prosperity had filled with riches. It was this generous treatment on the part of their commanders which first reconciled the plebs to the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In addition to this the senate then granted the people the most seasonable boon which has ever been bestowed on them by the chiefs of the state, when they decreed, without waiting for any suggestion by the plebs or their tribunes, that the soldiers should be paid from the public treasury, whereas till then every man had served at his own costs.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nothing, it is said, was ever welcomed by <pb id="p.453"/>the plebs with such rejoicing. Crowds gathered at B.C. 406 the Curia and men grasped the hands of the senators as they came out, saying that they were rightly called Fathers, and confessing that they had brought it to pass that no one, so long as he retained a particle of strength, would grudge his life's blood to so generous a country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not only were they pleased at the advantage that their property would at least not diminish while their bodies were impressed for the service of the state, but the voluntary character of the offer, which had never been mooted by plebeian tribunes nor extorted by any words of their own, multiplied their satisfaction and increased their gratitude.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes of the plebs were the only persons who did not partake in the general joy and good feeling of both orders. They said that the measure would neither be so agreeable to the Fathers nor so favourable to the whole body of the citizens as the latter believed; it was a plan which at first sight had promised to be better than experience would prove it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For where, they asked, could the money be got together, save by imposing a tribute on the people? The senators had therefore been generous at other men's expense; and even though everyone else should submit to it, those who had already earned their discharge would not endure that others should serve on better terms than they had themselves enjoyed, and that the same men who had paid their own expenses should also contribute to the expenses of others.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By these arguments they influenced a part of the plebs. Finally, when the assessment had already been proclaimed, the tribunes even announced that they would protect anybody who should refuse to contribute to a tax for paying the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The <pb id="p.455"/>Fathers had made a good beginning and persevered<note type="margin">B.C. 406</note> in supporting it. They were themselves the first to contribute, and since there was as yet no silver coinage,<note>The elder Pliny (<hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> xxxiii. 42) says that the Romans did not use coined silver until the defeat of King Pyrrhus (<date value="-275">275 B.C.</date>)</note> some of them brought uncoined bronze in waggons to the treasury, and even made a display of their contributing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After the senators had paid most faithfully, according to their rating, the chief men of the plebs, friends of the nobles, began, as had been agreed, to bring in their quota.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the crowd saw that these men were applauded by the patricians and were looked upon as good citizens by those of military age, they quickly rejected the protection of the tribunes and vied with one another who should be the first to pay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And on the law being passed declaring war on the Veientes, an army consisting in great part of volunteers marched, under command of the new military tribunes, upon that city.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now the tribunes were Titus Quinctius<note type="margin">B.C. 405-404</note> Capitolinus, Quintus Quinctius Cincinnatus, Gaius Julius Iulus (for the second time), Aulus Manlius, Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the third time), and Manius Aemilius Mamercus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By them Veii was for the first time besieged. Shortly after this siege began, the Etruscans held a numerously attended council at the shrine of Voltumna, but could reach no decision as to whether the entire nation should go to war in defence of the Veientes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The siege languished during the year that followed, for some of the tribunes and a part of the army were called away to fight the Volsci.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The military tribunes with consular powers for this year were Gaius Valerius Potitus (for the third time), Manius Sergius Fidenas, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, Gnaeus Cornelius Cossus, Gaius Fabius Ambustus, and (for the second time) Spurius Nautius <pb id="p.457"/>Rutulus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A pitched battle was fought with the<note type="margin">B.C. 405-404</note> Volsci between Ferentinum and Ecetra, in which fortune favoured the Romans. The tribunes then laid siege to Artena, a Volscian town.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While attempting a sortie the enemy were driven back into the city and afforded the Romans an opportunity of forcing an entrance, so that the whole place, except the citadel, was captured; to this fortress, which was naturally strong, a band of armed men retired; below the citadel a large number were killed or taken prisoner.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The citadel was then besieged, but could neither be taken by assault, having a sufficient garrison in proportion to its area, nor appeared likely to surrender, for the whole public store of grain had been conveyed into the fortress before the capture of the town. The Romans would have withdrawn, discouraged, had not a slave betrayed the place into their hands.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This man admitted some soldiers by way of a steep approach, and they captured it and slew the sentries; whereupon the rest of the garrison was seized with a sudden panic and surrendered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After demolishing the citadel and the town of Artena, the legions were withdrawn from the Volsci and all the might of Rome was brought to bear upon Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The traitor was given the property of two families as a reward, besides his liberty, and was named Servius Romanus.<note>Later it was the custom to give a slave thus manumitted by the state the name of the officiating magistrate.</note> There are those who think that Artena had belonged to the Veientes, not to the Volsci.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their mistake is due to the fact that there was a city of the same name between Caere and Veii; but this place was destroyed by the Roman kings,<note>Livy does not mention the incident in Book I.</note> and it had been a dependency of Caere, not of Veii; the other town of the same name, whose overthrow I have just related, was in Volscian territory.</p> <pb id="p.459"/></div1> 
		<div1 type="book" n="4s"><head>Summary of book IV</head>
			<p>A LAW about the marriage of patricians and plebeians
				was carried by the tribunes, after a violent struggle,
				against the opposition of the patricians. The tribunes
				. . .<note>The institution of military tribunes was evidently recorded in the words that have been lost.</note> of the plebs. For some years the affairs of the Roman
				People at home and in the field were administered through
				this kind of magistracy. Likewise censors were then
				elected for the first time. The land taken from the
				Ardeates by the decision of the people was restored and
				colonists were sent out to it. When the Roman People
				was in sore straits on account of a famine, Spurius Maelius,
				a Roman knight, distributed corn to the people at his own
				expense. Having by this act gained the favour of the
				plebs, he aimed at royal power and was killed by Gaius
				Servilius Ahala, the master of the horse, at the command
				of the dictator Quintus<note>A mistake for Quinctius.</note> Cincinnatus; Lucius Minucius gave evidence against him and was presented with a gilded ox. When the envoys of the Romans had been slain by
				the Fidenates, because they had fallen in the service of the
				state, statues were erected to them on the rostra. Cornelius Cossus, the military tribune, killed Tolumnius, king of
				the Veientes, and returned with the second spoils of honour.
				Mamercus Aemilius, the dictator, limited the office of
				censor, which was wont to be held for five years, to the
				period of eighteen months; for this he was stigmatized by
				the senators. Fidenae was subjugated and colonists were
				sent thither; the Fidenates, having slain these men and revolted, were defeated by Mamercus Aemilius the dictator,
				and Fidenae was captured. A conspiracy of the slaves
				was suppressed. Postumius, the military tribune, was for
				his cruelty put to death by his army. Pay from the public
				treasury was then for the first time given the soldiers. It
				contains also campaigns waged against the Volsci and the
				Fidenates and the Faliscans.</p>
