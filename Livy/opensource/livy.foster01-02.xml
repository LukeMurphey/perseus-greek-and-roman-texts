					<p>THE Latin text of this volume has been set up
						from that of the ninth edition (1908) of Book I.,
						and the eighth edition (1894) of Book II., by Weissenborn and M&uuml;ller, except that the <hi rend="italics">Periochae</hi> have
						been reprinted from the text of Rossbach (1910).
						But the spelling is that adopted by Professors
						Conway and Walters in their critical edition of
						Books I.-V. (Oxford, 1914), which is the source also
						of a number of readings which differ from those given
						in the Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller text, and has furnished,
						besides, the materials from which the textual notes
						have been drawn up. I have aimed to indicate
						every instance where the reading printed does not
						rest on the authority of one or more of the good
						MSS., and to give the author of the emendation.
						The MSS. are often cited by the symbols given in
						the Oxford edition, but for brevity's sake I have
						usually employed two of my own, viz. <foreign lang="greek">W</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">s.</foreign>
						The former means <quote> such of the good MSS. as are
							not cited for other readings,</quote> the latter <quote>one or
								more of the inferior MSS. and early printed editions.</quote> Anyone who wishes more specific information regarding the source of a variant will consult
						<pb id="p.viii"/>
						the elaborate apparatus of the Oxford text, whose
						editors have placed all students of the first decade
						under lasting obligations by their thorough and
						minute report of the MSS. With the publication
						of their second volume there will be available for
						the first time an adequate diplomatic basis for the
						criticism of Books I.-X.</p>
					<p>I have utilized throughout the translations by
						Philemon Holland, George Baker, and Canon
						Roberts, and have occasionally borrowed a happy
						expression from the commentaries of Edwards,
						Conway, and others, mentioned in the introduction.
						The unpretentious notes in the college edition of
						my former teacher, the late Professor Greenough,
						have been particularly useful in pointing out the
						significance of the word-order.</p>
					<p>Acknowledgments are also due to my colleagues,
						Professors Fairclough, Hempl, Cooper, and Briggs,
						and to Professor Noyes of the University of California, each of whom has given me some good
						suggestions.</p>

					<div3 type="section"><head>I</head>
						<p>From entries in Jerome's re-working of the
							<hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi> of Eusebius we learn that Titus Livius the
							Patavian was born in <date value="-59">59 B.C.</date>, the year of Caesar's
							first consulship, and died in his native town (the
							modern Padua) in 17 A.D. Of his parents nothing is
							known. They were presumably well-to-do, for their
							son received the training in Greek and Latin
							literature and in rhetoric which constituted the
							standard curriculum of that time, and was afterwards
							able to devote a long life to the unremunerative work
							of writing. That he was by birth an aristocrat is no
							more than an inference from his outstanding sympathy with the senatorial party. Livy's childhood
							witnessed the conquest of Gaul and Caesar's rapid
							rise to lordship over the Roman world. These early
							years he doubtless passed in his northern home.
							Patavium laid claim to great antiquity. Livy tells
							us himself in his opening chapter the legend of its
							founding by the Trojan Antenor, and elsewhere
							describes with unmistakable satisfaction the vain
							attempt of the Spartan Cleonymus (in <date value="-302">302 B.C.</date>) to
							<pb id="p.x"/>
							subdue the Patavians.<note>Liv. x. ii. There were many living in his own day, Livy says, who had seen the beaks of the ships captured from Cleonymus, which were preserved as trophies in the temple of Juno.</note> They defended themselves
							with equal vigour and success against the aggressions
							of the Etruscans and the inroads of the Gauls, and
							in the war with Hannibal cast in their lot with
							Rome. In <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>, when Livy was ten years old, the
							town became a Roman municipality and its citizens
							were enrolled in the Fabian tribe. The place was a
							great centre of trade, especially in wool,<note>Martial, xiv. cxliii., speaks of the thickness of Patavian tunics.</note> and under
							Augustus was perhaps the wealthiest city in Italy,
							next to Rome,<note>Strabo, II. clxix. and v. ccxiii.; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Nissen, <hi rend="italics">Italische Landeskunde,</hi> 2, p. 220.</note> to which in some respects it presented a striking contrast, since the Patavians
							maintained the simple manners and strict morality
							which had long gone out of fashion in the cosmopolitan capital.<note>Plin. <hi rend="italics">Epist. </hi>. xiv. 6, says of a young protege: <quote>His maternal grandmother is Sarrana Procula, from the municipality of Patavium. You know the manners of the place; yet Serrana is a pattern of strictness even to the Patavians.</quote></note> We cannot say how old Livy was
							when he left Patavium, but it is probable that his
							tastes and character had been permanently influenced
							by the old-world traditions of his native town. Did he
							go to Rome with the intention of pursuing there the
							career of a rhetorician and subsequently become
							interested in historical studies? It may have been
							<pb id="p.xi"/>
							so. Perhaps he had already resolved to write
							history and wished to make use of the libraries and
							other sources of information which were lacking in a
							provincial town. Certain passages in his earlier
							books<note><hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> I. iv. 5; I. viii. 5; I. xxvi. 13.</note> indicate that he was already familiar with the City when he began his great work, about <date value="-27">27 B.C.</date>,<note>It could not well have been earlier than 27, for in I. xix. and iv. xx. 7 Octavian is mentioned with the title of Augustus, which the senate only conferred on him in January of that year. Nor may we put the date much later, for in mentioning the occasions on which the temple of Janus had been closed (I. xix. 3) Livy has nothing to say of the second of the two closings which took place in his own life-time,&mdash; namely that of <date value="-25">25 B.C.</date></note> and a reference to a conversation with Augustus in
							Book IV. seems to argue that it was not long till he
							was on a friendly footing with the Emperor.<note>Liv. iv. xx. 7.</note> He doubtless continued to reside in Rome, with occasional visits to Patavium and other places in Italy, till near the end of his long life.</p> 
						<p>Livy seems never to have held any public office,
							but to have given himself up entirely to literature.
							Seneca says that he wrote dialogues which one
							might classify under history as well as under philosophy, besides books which were professedly philosophical.<note>Sen. <hi rend="italics">Epist.</hi> 100. 9.</note> And Quintilian quotes a letter from Livy to his son which was very likely an essay on the
							training of the orator, for in the passage cited he
							advises the young man to read Demosthenes and
							Cicero, and then such as most nearly resembled
							<pb id="p.xii"/>
							them.<note>Quint. x. i. 39 (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi>II. v. 20).</note> So, in another place, Quintilian tells us that he finds in Livy that there was a certain teacher who bade his pupils <hi rend="italics">obscure</hi> what they said.<note>Quint. viii. ii. 18.</note> It may have been in this same essay that he made the criticism on Sallust which seemed to the elder Seneca to be unjust,&mdash;that he had not only appropriated a sentence from Thucydides but had spoilt
							it in the process.<note>Sen. <hi rend="italics">Controv. </hi>ix. i. 14.</note> And there is another passage in Seneca where Livy is credited with having quoted approvingly a <hi rend="italics">mot</hi> of the rhetorician Miltiades against orators who affected archaic and sordid words, which may also be an echo of the letter.<note><hi rend="italics">Ibid. </hi>ix. ii. 26.</note> If Livy was about thirty-two years old when he began to write history it is probable that this essay was composed some years later, for it is unlikely to have been written before the son was about sixteen.<note>Schanz, <hi rend="italics">Geschichte der romischen Litteratur,</hi> ii3. 1, p. 419.</note> We may therefore think of the historian as putting aside his magnum opus for a season, to be of use in the education of the boy, who, whether or no he profited by his father's instructions in rhetoric, at all events became a writer, and is twice named by the elder Pliny as one of his authorities, in Books V. and
							VI. of the <hi rend="italics">Natural History,</hi> which deal with geography.
							In a sepulchral inscription found in Padua, which
							may be that of our Livy, two sons are named&mdash;Titus
							Livius Priscus and Titus Livius Longus,&mdash;and their
							<pb id="p.xiii"/>
							mother's name is given as Cassia.<note><hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> v. 2975 (=Dessau, <hi rend="italics">Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae,</hi> 2919): T. Livius C. f. sibi et /suis/T. Livio T. f. Prisco f., T. Livio T. f. Longo f., / Cassiae Sex. f. Primae / uxori.</note> The only other item of information we possess about the family is supplied by the elder Seneca, who mentions a son-inlaw, named Lucius Magius, as a declaimer who had some following for a time, though men rather endured him for the sake of his father-in-law than praised him for his own.<note>Sen. <hi rend="italics">Controv. x. praef.</hi> 2.</note> </p> 
						<p>Of Livy's social life in Rome we know nothing more
							than that he enjoyed the friendship of Augustus, and
							probably, as we have seen, from an early date in his
							stay in Rome.<note>It is just possible that the conversation with Augustus mentioned in iv. xx. 7 took place at some time after the original publication of that book, and that the reference was inserted later.</note> The intimacy was apparently maintained till the end of the Emperor's life, for it cannot
							have been much before A.D. 14 that Livy, as related
							by Suetonius,<note>Suet. <hi rend="italics">Claud.</hi> xli.</note> advised his patron's grand-nephew Claudius (born <date value="-9">9 B.C.</date>) to take up the writing of history.
							The good relations subsisting between the Emperor
							and the historian do honour to the sense and candour of
							both. Livy gloried in the history of the republic,
							yet he could but acquiesce in the new order of things.
							And the moral and religious reforms of Augustus,
							his wish to revive the traditions of an elder day, his
							respect for the forms inherited from a time when
							Rome was really governed by a senate, must have
							commanded Livy's hearty approval. On the other
							<pb id="p.xiv"/>
							side, when Livy's great history was appealing to men's
							patriotism and displaying the ideal Rome as no other
							literary work (with the possible exception of the
							contemporaneous <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi>) had ever done, it was easy
							for the Emperor to smile at the scholar's exaggerated
							admiration of Pompey,<note>Tacitus, <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> iv. xxxiv., describing the trial of Cremutius Cordus for l&eacute;se-majest&eacute; on the ground that he had published annals in which he praised Brutus and styled Cassius the <quote>last of the Romans,</quote> makes Cremutius say in his defence: <quote>Titus Livius, pre-eminent for eloquence and candour, so lauded Pompey that Augustus called him a Pompeian; yet it made no difference in their friendship.</quote></note> and even to overlook the
							frankness of his query whether more of good or of
							harm had come to the state from the birth of Julius
							Caesar.<note>Sen. <hi rend="italics">Nat. Quaest.</hi> v. xviii. 4.</note> Livy died three years after Augustus, in 17 A.D., at the ripe age of 76. If he continued working at his history up to the last he had devoted more than 40 years to the gigantic enterprise. Jerome says
							that he died in Patavium. We can only conjecture
							whether he was overtaken by death while making a
							visit to his old home, or had retired thither, with the
							coming in of the new regime, to spend his declining
							years. The latter is perhaps the more likely assumption. The character of Tiberius can have possessed
							little claim to the sympathy of Livy, and life in Rome
							may well have lost its charm for him, now that his
							old patron was no more.</p>
						<pb id="p.xv"/>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section"><head>II</head>
						<p>Livy seems to have called his history simply <hi rend="italics">Ab</hi>
							<hi rend="italics">Urbe Condita,</hi> <quote>From the Founding of the City,</quote><note>Livy once refers to his work as <quote>my annals</quote> (<hi rend="italics">in meos annales,</hi> XLIII. xiii. 2), and Pliny, <hi rend="italics">N. H. praef.</hi> 16, speaks of a certain volume of Livy's <quote>histories,</quote> but these are merely generic names.</note> just as Tacitus was later to call his Annals <hi rend="italics">Ab
								Excessu Divi Augusti,</hi> <quote>From the death of the Divine
									Augustus.</quote> He began with the legend of Aeneas,
							and brought his narrative down to the death of Drusus
							(and the defeat of Quintilius Varus?<note>The <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> of Book CXLII. ends with these events, but the mention of Varus, which is found in only one his., is generally regarded as a late addition. Its genuineness is, however, upheld by Rossbach, in his edition, <hi rend="italics">ad loc.</hi></note> ) in <date value="-9">9 B.C.</date> There is no reason to think that Livy intended, as
							some have supposed, to go on to the death of
							Augustus. In the preface to one of the lost books
							he remarked that he had already earned enough of
							reputation and might have ceased to write, were
							it not that his restless spirit was sustained by
							work.<note>Plin. <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi></note> He probably toiled on till his strength failed him, with no fixed goal in view, giving his
							history to the public in parts, as these were severally
							completed. The following table, taken from Schanz,<note><hi rend="italics">Geschichte der romischen Litteratur, </hi>ii3. 1, p. 421.</note> is an attempt to reconstruct these instalments: <list>
								<item>Books I.-V. From the founding of the City to its

								<pb id="p.xvi"/>

						</p>
						<p>It will be noticed that certain portions fall natureally into decades (notably XXI.-XXX.), or pentads
							(<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> I.-V.). Elsewhere, and particularly in that part
							of the work which deals with the writer's own times,
							no such symmetry is discernible. Later however it
							became the uniform practice of the copyists to
							divide the history into decades. This is clearly seen
							in the wholly distinct and independent MS. tradition
							of the several surviving sections.</p>
						<p>Only about a quarter of the whole work has been
							<pb id="p.xvii"/>
							preserved. We have the Preface and Books I.-X.,
							covering the period from Aeneas to the year <date value="-293">293 B.C.</date>;
							Books XXI.-XXX. describing the Second Punic
							War; and Books XXXI.-XLV., which continue the
							story of Rome's conquests down to the year <date value="-167">167 B.C.</date>
							and the victories of Lucius Aemilius Paulus.<note>Books XLI.-XLV. contain many lacunae.</note> </p> 
						<p>For the loss of the other books the existence from
							the first century of our era of a handy abridgment
							is no doubt largely responsible. It is to this Martial
							alludes in the following distich (XIV. cxc.):
							<quote rend="blockquote">
								<l>Pellibus exiguis artatur Livius ingens,</l>
								<l>Quem mea non totum bibliotheca capit.</l><note>Thus translated by Professor Duff:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In vellum small huge Livy now is dressed;</l> <l>My bookshelves could not hold him uncompressed.</l></quote></note> </quote>
							If we had this <hi rend="italics">Epitome</hi><note>See Schanz, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> ii3. 1, pp. 425-428. H. A. Sanders, <quote>The Lost Epitome of Livy</quote> (in <hi rend="italics">Roman Historical Sources and Institutions,</hi> p. 257), makes the interesting suggestion that it may have been written by Livy's son.</note> it would be some slight
							compensation for the disappearance of the original
							books, but we have only a compend of it, the
							so-called <hi rend="italics">Periochae,</hi> and certain excerpts thought to
							have been made from another summary of it, no
							longer extant, which scholars refer to as the
							<hi rend="italics">Chronicon,</hi> to wit, the fragments of the <hi rend="italics">Oxyrhynchus</hi>
							<hi rend="italics">Papyrus,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Prodigiorum Liber</hi> of Obsequens, and
							the consular lists of Cassiodorius.</p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italics">Periochae,</hi> or summaries of the several Books
							(only CXXXVI. and CXXXVII. are wanting), are the
							<pb id="p.xviii"/>
							most valuable of these sources for supplying the gaps
							in our text of Livy. Their author narrates briefly
							what seem to him the leading events in each book,
							adding a reference to other matters treated in the
							original.<note>See <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> the last sentence of <hi rend="italics">Per. II.,</hi> p. 438.</note> The <hi rend="italics">Periochae</hi> are thus a kind of compromise between a book of excerpts for the use of readers who for any reason could not or would not go
							to the unabridged Livy, and a table of contents
							for the convenience of those who did.<note>Schanz, p. 425.</note> They are usually printed with editions of Livy, and are included in this one. It may be noted here that
							<hi rend="italics">Per. I</hi> exists in a double recension, of which B
							appears from its style to be of a piece with those
							of all the other books, while A is thought to have
							come from the <hi rend="italics">Chronicon.</hi></p>
						<p>In 1903 a papyrus was discovered at Oxyrhynchus
							which contained fragments of a compend of Roman
							history which was based on Livy, though it seems
							not to have been taken from Livy directly but from
							the <hi rend="italics">Chronicon,</hi> which was also, as we have said,
							the source of Obsequens and Cassiodorius. The
							MS. is assigned to the third century, and the book
							must therefore have been composed in that or a still
							earlier period. It contains eight columns of uncial
							writing. Of these 1-3 preserve a selection of the
							events recorded in Livy, Books XXXVII.-XL.,
							(which we have), while 4-8 deal with the
							<pb id="p.xix"/>
							subjectmatter of Books XLVIII.-LV. But there is a
							column gone between column 6 and column 7, which
							treated of the years 143 and <date value="-142">142 B.C.</date></p>
						<p>Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorius Senator lived about
							480 to 575, and was Consul in 514, under Theodoric.
							Among his writings was a chronicle, from Adam to
							A.D. 519. For the earlier periods he used Eusebius
							and Jerome, but from the expulsion of Tarquinius
							to A.D. 31 he names as his authorities Titus Livius
							and Aufidius Bassus. His list of consuls for this
							period shows kinship with the <hi rend="italics">Oxyrhynchus Papyrus</hi>
							and Obsequens.</p>
						<p>In his <hi rend="italics">Prodigiorum Liber</hi> Julius Obsequens
							enumerates in chronological order the portents
							which occurred from the year 190 to the year
							<date value="-12">12 B.C.</date> In its original form the catalogue probably
							began, as the title in the MS. indicates,<note>Iulii Obsequentis <hi rend="italics">Ab Anno Urbis Conditae DV Prodigiorum Liber.</hi></note> with the year 249. The little book is of unknown date:
							Schanz thinks it is a product of the fourth century
							of our era, when paganism made its last struggle
							against Christianity.<note>Schanz, <hi rend="italics">R&ouml;m. Lit.</hi> iv2. 1, p. 85.</note> Rossbach inclines to a somewhat earlier date.<note>See his edition, p. xxxiii.</note> In any case Rossbach has shown that the author was a believer in prodigies, and therefore a pagan.</p>
						<pb id="p.xx"/>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section"><head>III</head>
						<p>In his preface to the whole work Livy gives a satisfactory account of his conception of history and the
							ends he himself had in view. He begins with an
							apology for adding to the already large number of
							Roman histories. Those who attempt this theme
							hope, he says, to surpass their predecessors either in
							accuracy or style, and it is doing Livy no injustice to
							infer that in his own case it was the belief that he
							could make the story of Rome more vivid and readable than anyone had yet done which gave him the
							courage to undertake the task. But whether he succeeds or not, he will be glad, he tells us, to have done
							what he could for the memory of the foremost people
							of the world. He recognizes the immense labour
							which confronts him, in consequence of the more
							than seven hundred years which he must deal with,
							and admits that it will be labour thrown away on
							most of his readers, who will have little patience with
							the earlier history in their eagerness to be reading of
							the civil wars and the events of their own generation.
							<quote>I myself, on the contrary,</quote> he continues&mdash;and the
							sentiment reveals at once the man's romantic spirit&mdash;
							<quote>shall seek in this an additional reward for my toil,
								that I may turn my back upon the evils which our
								age has witnessed for so many years, so long at least as
								I am absorbed in the recollection of the brave days
								<pb id="p.xxi"/>
								of old.</quote><note>In another passage (XLIII. xiii. 2) Livy tells us that when he is writing of old-world things his spirit somehow becomes old-fashioned.</note> He refers to the marvellous tales which
							were associated with the founding of the City as to
							matters of no great consequence. He declines to
							vouch for their authenticity, though he means to set
							them down as he finds them; and he apparently regards them as possessing a certain symbolic truth, at
							least. But the really important thing in Rome's
							history is the way her power was founded on morality
							and discipline, waxed mighty with the maintenance of
							these, and was now fallen upon evil days through
							their decay. For the use of historical study lies in
							its application to life. The story of a great people
							is fraught with examples and warnings, both for the
							individual and for the state. And no nation is better
							worth studying than Rome, for in none did righteousness and primitive simplicity so long resist the encroachments of wealth and luxury.</p>
						<p>It was the ethical aspect of history then that chiefly
							appealed to Livy, and he chose Rome for his subject
							because the rise of the Roman empire seemed to him
							the best example of the fruition of those qualities
							which he wished to inculcate. To do this he must
							first of all win the interest of his readers, and if
							morality is his goal style is certainly the road by
							which he hopes to lead men towards it. We must
							therefore fix our attention on these two things if we
							would approach Livy's work in the spirit of his
							<pb id="p.xxii"/>
							ancient readers, and understand their almost unqualified approval of it.</p>
						<p>For Livy's success was both immediate and lasting.
							I have already referred to the frank way in which he
							himself recognized his fame, in the preface to one of
							the books of his History, and the younger Pliny tells
							a delightful story of an enthusiastic Spanish admirer
							who travelled from Cadiz to Rome solely to behold
							the great writer, and having gratified his curiosity
							returned forthwith to his home.<note>Plin. <hi rend="italics">Ep. </hi>ii. iii. 8.</note> Livy's magnanimity was warmly praised by the elder Seneca, who said
							that he was by nature a most candid judge of all
							great talents,<note>Sen. <hi rend="italics">Suas.</hi> vi. 22.</note> and it is a striking testimony to the justice of this observation that the modern reader's admiration for Hannibal is largely a reflection of
							Livy's, which all his prejudice against Rome's most
							formidable enemy could not altogether stifle. Tacitus
							too admired Livy, whom he considered the most eloquent of the older historians, as Fabius Rusticus was
							of the more recent.<note><hi rend="italics">Agric.</hi> x. and the passage already quoted from the <hi rend="italics">Annals</hi> (IV. xxxiv.).</note> Quintilian compared him with Herodotus, and spoke of the wonderful fascination of his narrative, his great fairness, and the inexpressible eloquence of the speeches, in which everything was suited not only to the circumstances but to
							the speaker.<note>Quint. <hi rend="italics">Inst. Or.</hi> x. i. 101. There are some 400 of these inserted speeches in the extant text, some consisting of only a few lines, while others run to a length of several pages. Under Domitian a certain Mettius Pompusius made a collection of speeches by kings and generals which he took from Livy ( Suet. <hi rend="italics">Dom.</hi> x. 3)</note> Quintilian also praised his
							<pb id="p.xxiii"/>
							representation of the emotions, particularly the gentler ones,
							in which field he said he had no superior. Livy
							shared with Virgil the honour of being the most
							widely read of Latin writers, and in consequence
							incurred the resentment of the mad Caligula, who
							lacked but little of casting out their works and their
							portraits from all the libraries, alleging of Livy that
							he was verbose and careless.<note>Suet. <hi rend="italics">Calig.</hi> xxxiv. (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Schanz, p. 439.)</note> Even Quintilian could tax him with prolixity,<note>Quint. <hi rend="italics">Inst. Or.</hi> VIII. iii. 53.</note> though he seems to have owned that it was but the defect of a quality, for he elsewhere speaks of his <quote>milky richness.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Ibid. </hi>x. i. 32.</note> The only other jarring note in the general chorus of admiration is sounded by the critic Asinius Pollio, who reproached Livy's style with <quote> Patavinity,</quote> by which he perhaps meant that it was tainted with an occasional word or idiom peculiar to the historian's native dialect.<note><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> vii. i. 3. Pollio was also severe upon Caesar, Cicero, Catullus and Sallust!</note> Owing chiefly to its intrinsic excellence, but partly no doubt to the accidental circumstance that it covered the whole field of Roman History, Livy's work became the standard source-book from which later writers were to draw their materials. We have already seen how it was epitomized and excerpted. Other writers who took their historical data from Livy were Lucan
							<pb id="p.xxiv"/>
							and Silius Italicus, Asconius, Valerius Maximus,
							Frontinus, Florus, and the Greeks Cassius Dio and
							Plutarch. Avienus, in the fourth century, turned
							Livy into iambic senarii, a <hi rend="italics">tour deforce</hi> which has not
							come down to us.<note>Servius on Virg. <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> x. 388, Schanz, IV2. i. p. 20.</note> In the fifth he is cited by Pope Gelasius,<note>Hertz, <hi rend="italics">Frag.</hi> 12 (in his edition of Livy).</note> and the grammarian Priscian used him in the sixth. Comparatively little read in the Middle Ages, Livy found a warm admirer in Dante, who used him in the second book of his <hi rend="italics">De Monarchia,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italics">Divina Commnedia</hi> refers to him naively as <quote> Livio , . . che non erra.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Inferno,</hi> xxviii. 12.</note> The Italians of the Renaissance seized upon Livy's History with avidity. The poet Beccadelli sold a country-place to enable him to purchase a copy by the hand of Poggio. Petrarch was among those who hoped for the recovery of the lost decades, and Pope Nicholas V. exerted himself without avail to discover them. With the emendations in Books XXI.-XXVI. by Laurentius Valla<note>Born in Rome, 1407.</note> the critical study of the text was inaugurated. The year 1469 saw the first printed edition of the History, which was produced in Rome. Early in the sixteenth century Machiavelli wrote his famous <hi rend="italics">Discorsi sul</hi> <hi rend="italics">Primo Libro delle Deche di Tito Livio.</hi> It is not too much to say that from the Revival of Learning to the present time Livy has been generally recognized as one of the world's great writers. The English scholar Munro pronounced him owner of what is  <pb id="p.xxv"/>
							<quote>perhaps the greatest prose style that has ever been
								written in any age or language,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Criticisms and Elucidations of Catullus,</hi> London, 1905', p. 232.</note> and his history seemed to Niebuhr a <quote>a colossal masterpiece.</quote><note>See the Introduction to his <hi rend="italics">Roman History.</hi> I have taken most of the material for this paragraph from Schanz, pp. 438-441.</note> </p> 
						<p>The qualities which gave Livy his lofty place in
							literature are easily discovered. He was a high-minded patriot, inspired with a genuine desire to
							promote the welfare of his country. An idealist of
							the most pronounced type, he was endowed&mdash;as not
							all idealists are&mdash;with a breadth of sympathy which
							enabled him to judge men with charity, and to discern
							in the most diverse characters whatever admirable
							traits they might possess. In him a passionate love
							of noble deeds and a rare insight into the workings
							of the mind and heart were united with a strength of
							imagination which enabled him to clothe the shadowy
							names of Rome's old worthies with the flesh and blood
							of living men. Finally, his mastery of all the resources
							of language is only equalled by his never-failing tact
							and sense of fitness in the use of them.<note>Wachsmuth, <hi rend="italics">Einleitung in das Studium der alten</hi> <hi rend="italics">Geschichte,</hi> p. 591. Wachsmuth says: <quote>No one even now can escape the magic of his enthralling narrative, and to his countrymen, whether contemporary or of a later generation, his style must have been absolutely fascinating. We are not surprised that Latin-speaking mankind in the time of the Empire saw the ancient history of Rome almost exclusively through the eyes of Livy.</quote></note> It is difficult
							to describe in a few words so complex an instrument
							<pb id="p.xxvi"/>
							as Livy's style. Perhaps it might fairly be said that
							it is distinguished by the attributes of warmth and
							amplitude. The Livian period, less formal and
							regular than that of Cicero, whom Livy so greatly admired,<note>Quint. <hi rend="italics">Inst. Or.</hi> x. i. 39; Sen. <hi rend="italics">Suas.</hi> vi. 17 and 22.</note> is fully as intricate, and reveals an amazing sensitiveness to the rhetorical possibilities inherent
							in word-order.<note>H. D. Naylor, <hi rend="italics">Latin and English Idiom,</hi> p. 6, says: <quote>If I were asked ' What is <hi rend="italics">the great</hi> feature of Livy's style?' I would boldly answer: 'His brilliant use of order.'</quote></note> To the first decade, and especially
							Book I., Livy has, consciously no doubt, given a
							slightly archaic and poetical colour, in keeping with
							the subject-matter<note>Norden, <hi rend="italics">Antike Kunstposa</hi> i., p. 235.</note> ; and his extraordinary faculty for visualizing and dramatizing the men and events of Roman story reminds us even more insistently
							of Quintilian's dictum that history is a kind of
							prose poetry.<note>Quint.<hi rend="italics"> Inst. Or.</hi> x. i. 31. Historia ..... est... proxima poetis et quodam modo carmen solutum.</note> </p> 
						<p>Yet despite his many remarkable gifts it is only too
							clear that Livy was deficient in some of the most
							essential qualifications for producing such a history of
							Rome as would satisfy the standards of our own day.
							Neither well informed nor specially interested in
							politics or the art of war, and lacking even such
							practical knowledge of constitutional matters as scores
							of his contemporaries must have gained from participating in the actual business of the state, he undertook to trace the development of the greatest military
							<pb id="p.xxvii"/>
							power (save one) that the world has ever seen, and
							the growth of an empire which has taught the
							principles of organization and government to all
							succeeding ages. Nor was this lack of technical knowledge the only or indeed the heaviest handicap that
							Livy was compelled to carry. His mind was fundamentally uncritical, and he was unable to subject his
							authorities to such a judicial examination as might
							have made it possible for him to choose the safer guides
							and reject the less trustworthy. Towards original
							documents he manifests an almost incredible indifference.<note>Taine says: <quote>On ne trouve pas [chez Tite Live] l'amour infatigable de la science compl&eacute;te et de la v&eacute;rit&eacute; absolue. 11 n'en a que le gofit; il n'en a pas la passion</quote> (<hi rend="italics">Essai sur Tite</hi> <hi rend="italics">Live,</hi> p. 64).</note> As regards the earlier period, he himself
							remarks that the Gauls in burning Rome had swept
							away the <quote>pontifical commentaries</quote> and pretty much
							all the other public and private records,<note>Liv. vi. i. 2.</note> but there is nothing to indicate that he made much use of even
							such shreds of evidence as survived the fire, or that
							he referred, in writing of a later period, to so
							important a source as the <hi rend="italics">Annales Maximi,</hi> though
							they had been published in <date value="-123">123 B.C.</date>, in eighty books,
							by P. Mucius Scaevola. He excuses himself from
							transcribing the expiatory hymn composed by Livius
							Andronicus, and publicly sung, in the year <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>,
							by a chorus of girls, as a thing too uncouth for
							modern taste.<note>Liv. xxvii. xxxvii. 13.</note> He seems never to have bothered  <pb id="p.xxviii"/>
							to examine the terrain of so important a battle as
							Cannae, and his account of the operations there
							shows that he had no very clear notion of the topography of the field. It would be easy to multiply
							instances. There is an example at ii. xli. 10, where
							he refers to an inscription, but without having himself consulted it, as his contemporary, Dionysius of
							Halicarnassus, did.<note>Dion. Hal. <hi rend="italics">Antiq. Rom.</hi> Iv. xxvi. and VIII. xxvii. Dionysius and Livy worked independently of each other, though they used common sources.</note> </p> 
						<p>Livy's history supplanted the works of the annalists,
							which have consequently perished, so that it is impossible to ascertain with exactness his relation to
							his sources. His own references to them are rather
							casual. He makes no attempt to indicate his authorities systematically, but cites them in certain cases
							where they conflict with one another, or where he is
							sceptical of their statements and does not choose to
							assume the responsibility for them.<note>A. Klotz, <quote>Zu den Quellen der 4ten und 5ten Dekade des Livius</quote> in <hi rend="italics">Hermes,</hi> 1. (1915), pp. 482 and 536.</note> Often he does
							not give names, but contents himself with a phrase
							like, <quote>men say,</quote> or <quote> I find in certain writers.</quote> For
							the first decade he derived his materials from a number of annalists. The oldest were Q. Fabius Pictor and
							L. Cincius Alimentus. Both men wrote in Greek and
							lived in the time of the war with Hannibal, in which
							both men fought. Another was L. Calpurnius Piso
							Frugi, who opposed the Gracchi and was consul in
							<pb id="p.xxix"/>
							133.<note>He composed a comprehensive chronicle of Roman events in seven books, written in Latin.</note> Cato's valuable history, the <hi rend="italics">Origines,</hi><note>This work, also in seven books, beginning with the Aeneas-legend and coming down to the year of the author's death, <date value="-149">149 B.C.</date>, should have been of the greatest use to Livy.</note> he seems not to have used until he came to treat of the events
							in which Cato himself played a part. It was to writers
							who lived nearer his own day, whose style caused
							Livy to rank them above their less sophisticated but
							no doubt far more trustworthy predecessors that he
							mainly resorted. Such were Valerius Antias, whose
							seventy-five books were certainly the most abundant
							source available, and are thought to have covered the
							history of Rome to the death of Sulla; C. Licinius
							Macer, tribune of the plebs in 73, who wrote from
							the democratic standpoint; and Q. Aelius Tubero,
							who took part in the Civil War on the side of
							Pompey, and brought down his annals to his own
							times.</p>
						<p>For the third decade Livy used Polybius,<note>Polybius was born about <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date>, in Megalopolis, where he died at the age of 82. His great philosophical history of the Romans, from the outbreak of the Second Punic War to the fall of Corinth, in <date value="-146">146 B.C.</date>, contained forty books. Only I.-v. are extant in their entirety, but we have extracts from vi.- XVIII., and some fragments of xix.-xl.</note> though
							whether directly or through a Roman intermediary,
							and whether for the whole or only a part of the ten
							books, are questions still <hi rend="italics">sub iudice.</hi> For this decade
							he also drew upon L. Coelius Antipater, a writer
							whose treatise on the Second Punic War in seven
							<pb id="p.xxx"/>
							books<note>Written after the death of C. Gracchus, in <date value="-121">121 B.C.</date></note> had introduced into Roman literature the genre of the historical monograph.</p>
						<p>In the fourth and fifth decades Livy's main reliance
							seems to have been Polybius, in describing eastern
							affairs, and the annalists Q. Claudius Quadrigarius<note>Claudius wrote of the period from the Gallic invasion to his own times, the Sullan age. His work had not fewer than 23 books.</note> and Valerius Antias, in treating of Italy and Spain.
							A recent critic<note>A. Klotz, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.,</hi> p. 533.</note> has found reason for thinking that Livy used Valerius as his chief authority for western
							matters (controlling his statements however by those
							of Claudius) until, coming to the prosecution of Scipio
							(see Book XXXVIII), he found so much in Valerius
							that was incredible that his mistrust, which had
							hitherto been confined to that annalist's reports of
							numbers (see <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XXXIII. x. 8.) caused him to take
							Claudius thenceforth for his principal guide.</p>
						<p>This unscientific attitude towards the sources was
							the product partly of Livy's own characteristics, partly
							of the conception of history as a means of edification
							and entertainment prevalent in ancient times.<note>Quint. <hi rend="italics">Inst. Or. x.</hi> i. 31; Plin. <hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi> v. viii. 9; Cic. <hi rend="italics">De</hi> <hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> ii. 59.</note> Another shortcoming, which would have to be insisted
							on if we were criticising him as though he were a
							contemporary, is his inability to clear his mind of
							ideas belonging to his own day in considering the
							men and institutions of the past,&mdash;though this again
							is a limitation which he shares with his age.</p>
						<pb id="p.xxxi"/>
						<p>It is evident that the student of history must use
							Livy with caution, especially in those portions of his
							work where his statements cannot be tested by comparison with those of Polybius. Yet, quite apart
							from his claims upon our attention as a supreme
							literary artist, it would be hard to overrate his importance as an historian, which is chiefly of two sorts.
							In the first place, uncritical though he is, we have
							no one to put in his place, and his pages are
							our best authority for long stretches of Roman
							history. In the second place he possesses a very
							positive excellence to add to this accidental one, in
							the fidelity and spirit with which he depicts for
							us the Roman's own idea of Rome. Any one of half
							a dozen annalists would have served as well as Livy
							to tell us what the Romans <hi rend="italics">did,</hi> but it required genius
							to make us realize as Livy does what the Romans
							<hi rend="italics">were.</hi> No mere critical use of documents could ever
							make the Roman character live again as it lives for
							us in his <quote> pictured page.</quote> The People and the State
							are idealized no doubt by the patriotic imagination
							of this extraordinary writer,&mdash;but a people's ideals
							are surely not the least significant part of their
							history.<note>See Mr. Duffs excellent remarks in the finely appreciative chapter on Livy in his <hi rend="italics">Literary History of Rome.</hi></note> </p>
						<pb id="p.xxxii"/>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section"><head>IV</head>
						<p>We have seen that each of the extant decades was
							handed down in a separate tradition. The manuscripts of the later portions will be briefly described
							in introductory notes to the volumes in which they
							are contained. Books I.-X. are preserved in a twofold MS. tradition. One family is represented by a
							single MS., the Verona palimpsest (V). The portion
							of this codex which contains the Livy consists of
							sixty leaves, on which are preserved fragments of
							Books III.-VI., written in uncial characters of the
							fourth century. These fragments were deciphered
							and published by Mommsen in 1868. The
							other family is the so-called Nichorachean.
							This edition, as it may be called, of the first decade
							was produced under the auspices of Q. Aurelius
							Symmachus, who was consul in 391 A.D. He appears
							to have commissioned Tascius Victorianus to prepare
							an amended copy of Books I.-X., and the latter's
							subscription (<hi rend="italics">Victorianus emendabam dominis Symmachis</hi>)
							is found after every book as far as the ninth. In
							Books VI.-VIII. the subscription of Victorianus is
							preceded by one of Nichomachus Flavianus, son-inlaw of Symmachus (<hi rend="italics">Nichomachus Flavianus v. c. III.
								Praefect, urbis emendavi apud Hennam</hi>), and in Books
							III.-V. by one of Nichomachus Dexter, a son of
							Flavianus (<hi rend="italics">Titi Livi Nichomachus Dexter v.c. emendavi ab</hi>
							<pb id="p.xxxiii"/>
							<hi rend="italics">urbe condita</hi>), who adds the information, in subscribing
							Book V., that he had used the copy of his kinsman
							Clementianus. To this origin all the MSS. now extant
							are referred, with the exception of the <hi rend="italics">Veronensis.</hi>
							The most famous member of the family is the <hi rend="italics">Mediceus,</hi>
							a minuscule codex of the tenth or eleventh century
							containing the ten books and written with great
							fidelity&mdash;even in absurdities&mdash;to its exemplar. It
							has been shown to be the work of at least three
							scribes. The MS. abounds with dittographies and
							other errors, but is possibly the most valuable of its
							class, because of its honesty. For a full description
							of this and the other Nichomachean MSS. the reader
							should consult the Oxford edition of Livy, Books I.-V.,
							by Conway and Walters. A list of all the MSS. used
							in that edition is given at the end of this introduction.</p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italics">editio princeps,</hi> edited by Andreas, afterwards
							Bishop of Aleria, was issued in Rome in 1469. In
							1518 came the Aldine edition. The first complete
							edition of all the books now extant was also brought

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Yet, however this shall be, it will be a satisfaction to have done myself as much as lies in me to commemorate the deeds of the foremost people of the world; and if in so vast a company of writers my own reputation should be obscure, my consolation would be the fame and greatness of those whose renown will throw mine into the shade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover, my subject involves infinite labour, seeing that it must be traced back <pb id="p.5"/>above seven hundred years, and that proceeding from slender beginnings it has so increased as now to be burdened by its own magnitude; and at the same time I doubt not that to most readers the earliest origins and the period immediately succeeding them will give little pleasure, for they will be in haste to reach these modern times, in which the might of a people which has long been very powerful is working its own undoing.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> days of old, free from every care which, even if it could not divert the historian's mind from the truth, might nevertheless cause it anxiety.<note>Livy refers to the animosities inevitably aroused by writers who dealt with such thorny subjects as the civil wars, during the lifetime of many who had taken part in them.</note>
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Such traditions as belong to the time before the city was founded, or rather was presently to be founded, and are rather adorned with poetic legends than based upon trustworthy historical proofs, I purpose neither to affirm nor to refute. It is the privilege of antiquity to mingle divine things with human, and so to add dignity to the beginnings of cities;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and if any people ought to be allowed to consecrate their origins and refer them to a divine source, so great is the military glory of the Roman People that when they profess that their Father and the Father of their Founder was none other than Mars, the nations of the earth may well submit to this also with as good a grace as they submit to Rome's dominion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But to such legends as these, however they shall be regarded and judged, I shall, for my own part, attach no great importance. Here are the questions to which I would have every reader <pb id="p.7"/>give his close attention &mdash;what life and morals were like; through what men and by what policies, in peace and in war, empire was established and enlarged; then let him note how, with the gradual relaxation of discipline, morals first gave way, as it were, then sank lower and lower, and finally began the downward plunge<note>The metaphor is from a decaying building.</note> which has brought us to the present time, when we can endure neither our vices nor their cure.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>What chiefly makes the study of history wholesome and profitable is this, that you behold the lessons of every kind of experience set forth as on a conspicuous monument;<note>The monument Livy means is the body of a nation's achievements (<hi rend="italics">cf. res</hi> in &sect; 1), the <quote>history</quote> of a nation, in that objective sense of the word. This he likens to a monument of stone on which men's deeds are recorded.</note> from these you may choose for yourself and for your own state what to imitate, from these mark for avoidance what is shameful in the conception and shameful in the result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the rest, either love of the task I have set myself deceives me, or no state was ever greater, none more righteous or richer in good examples, none ever was where avarice and luxury came into the social order so late, or where humble means and thrift were so highly esteemed and so long held in honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For true it is that the less men's wealth was, the less was their greed. Of late, riches have brought in avarice, and excessive pleasures the longing to carry wantonness and licence to the point of ruin for oneself and of universal destruction.
				</p> 
				<p>But complaints are sure to be disagreeable, even when they shall perhaps be necessary; let the beginning, at all events, of so great an enterprise have none.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> With good omens rather would we begin, and, if historians had the same custom which poets have, <pb id="p.9"/>with prayers and entreaties to the gods and goddesses, that they might grant us to bring to a successful issue the great task we have undertaken.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>First of all, then, it is generally agreed that when Troy was taken vengeance was wreaked upon the other Trojans, but that two, Aeneas and Antenor, were spared all the penalties of war by the Achivi, owing to long-standing claims of hospitality, and because they had always advocated peace and the giving back of Helen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They then experienced various vicissitudes. Antenor, with a company of Eneti who had been expelled from Paphlagonia in a revolution and were looking for a home and a leader &mdash;for they had lost their king, Pylaemenes, at Troy<note>See the <hi rend="italics">Iliad,</hi> v. 576.</note> &mdash;came to the inmost bay of the Adriatic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, driving out the Euganei, who dwelt between the sea and the Alps, the Eneti and Trojans took possession of those lands. And in fact the place where they first landed is called Troy, and the district is therefore known as Trojan, while the people as a whole are called the Veneti.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Aeneas, driven from home by a similar misfortune, but guided by fate to undertakings of greater consequence, came first to Macedonia; thence was carried, in his quest of a place of settlement, to Sicily; and from Sicily laid his course towards the land of Laurentum. This place too is called Troy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Landing there, the Trojans, as men who, after their all but immeasurable wanderings, had nothing left but their swords and ships, were driving booty from the fields, when King Latinus and the Aborigines, who then occupied that country, rushed down from their city and their fields to repel with arms the violence of the invaders. From this point the tradition follows two <pb id="p.11"/>lines. Some say that Latinus, having been defeated in the battle, made a peace with Aeneas, and later an alliance of marriage.<note>This, in a nutshell, is the form of the legend on which Virgil based Books vii.-xii. of the <hi rend="italics">Aeneid.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Others maintain that when the opposing lines had been drawn up, Latinus did not wait for the charge to sound, but advanced amidst his chieftains and summoned the captain of the strangers to a parley.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then inquired what men they were, whence they had come, what mishap had caused them to leave their home, and what they sought in landing on the coast of Laurentum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was told that the people were Trojans and their leader Aeneas, son of Anchises and Venus; that their city had been burnt, and that, driven from home, they were looking for a dwelling-place and a site where they might build a city. Filled with wonder at the renown of the race and the hero, and at his spirit, prepared alike for war or peace, he gave him his right hand in solemn pledge of lasting friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The commanders then made a treaty, and the armies saluted each other. Aeneas became a guest in the house of Latinus; there the latter, in the presence of his household gods, added a domestic treaty to the public one, by giving his daughter in marriage to Aeneas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This event removed any doubt in the minds of the Trojans that they had brought their wanderings to an end at last in a permanent and settled habitation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They founded a town, which Aeneas named Lavinium, after his wife. In a short time, moreover, there was a male scion of the new marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>War was then made upon Trojans and Aborigines alike. Turnus was king of the Rutulians, and to him Lavinia had been betrothed before the coming <pb id="p.13"/>of Aeneas. Indignant that a stranger should be preferred before him, he attacked, at the same time, both Aeneas and Latinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Neither army came off rejoicing from that battle. The Rutulians were beaten: the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost their leader Latinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Turnus and the Rutulians, discouraged at their situation, fled for succour to the opulent and powerful Etruscans and their king Mezentius, who held sway in Caere, at that time an important town. Mezentius had been, from the very beginning, far from pleased at the birth of the new city; he now felt that the Trojan state was growing much more rapidly than was altogether safe for its neighbours, and readily united his forces with those of the Rutulians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Aeneas, that he might win the goodwill of the Aborigines to confront so formidable an array, and that all might possess not only the same rights but also the same name, called both nations Latins;<note>Virgil makes Jupiter grant, as a favour to Juno, that the Trojan name shall be sunk in the Latin (<hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xii. 835).</note> and from that time on the Aborigines were no less ready and faithful than the Trojans in the service of King Aeneas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, trusting to this friendly spirit of the two peoples, which were growing each day more united, and, despite the power of Etruria, which had filled with the glory of her name not only the lands but the sea as well, along the whole extent of Italy from the Alps to the Sicilian Strait, Aeneas declined to defend himself behind his walls, as he might have done, but led out his troops to battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fight which ensued was a victory for the Latins: for Aeneas it was, besides, the last of his mortal labours. He lies buried, whether it is fitting and right <pb id="p.15"/>to term him god or man, on the banks of the river Numicus; men, however, call him Jupiter Indiges.<note><hi rend="italics">Indiges</hi> means <quote>of or belonging to a certain place</quote> (Fowler, <hi rend="italics">Fest.</hi> p. 192). Dion. Hal. i. 64, says that the Latins made a shrine to Aeneas with an inscription in which he was called <foreign lang="greek">path\r xqo/nios</foreign>(<hi rend="italics">Pater Indiges</hi>). He was also called <hi rend="italics">Deus Indiges</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Aeneas Indiges.</hi></note>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ascanius, Aeneas' son, was not yet ripe for authority; yet the authority was kept for him, unimpaired, until he arrived at manhood. Meanwhile, under a woman's regency, the Latin State and the kingdom of his father and his grandfather stood unshaken &mdash;so strong was Lavinia's character &mdash;until the boy could claim it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> I shall not discuss the question &mdash;for who could affirm for certain so ancient a matter? &mdash;whether this boy was Ascanius, or an elder brother, born by Creusa while Ilium yet stood, who accompanied his father when he fled from the city, being the same whom the Julian family call lulus and claim as the author of their name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This Ascanius, no matter where born, or of what mother &mdash;it is agreed in any case that he was Aeneas' son &mdash;left Lavinium, when its population came to be too large, for it was already a flourishing and wealthy city for those days, to his mother, or stepmother, and founded a new city himself below the Alban Mount.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was known from its position, as it lay stretched out along the ridge, by the name of Alba Longa. From the settlement of Lavinium to the planting of the colony at Alba Longa was an interval of some thirty years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Yet the nation had grown so powerful, in consequence especially of the defeat of the Etruscans, that even when Aeneas died, and even when a woman became its regent and a boy began his apprenticeship as king, neither Mezentius and his Etruscans nor any other neighbours dared to attack them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Peace had been agreed to on these terms, that the River Albula, which men now call the Tiber, should be the boundary <pb id="p.17"/>between the Etruscans and the Latins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Next Silvius reigned, son of Ascanius, born, as it chanced, in the forest. He begat Aeneas Silvius, and he Latinus Silvius. By him several colonies were planted, and called the Ancient Latins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereafter the cognomen Silvius was retained by all who ruled at Alba. From Latinus came Alba, from Alba Atys, from Atys Capys, from Capys Capetus, from Capetus Tiberinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This last king was drowned in crossing the River Albula, and gave the stream the name which has been current with later generations. Then Agrippa, son of Tiberinus, reigned, and after Agrippa Romulus Silvius was king, having received the power from his father. Upon the death of Romulus by lightning, the kingship passed from him to Aventinus. This king was buried on that hill, which is now a part of the City of Rome, and gave his name to the hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Proca ruled next. He begat Numitor and Amulius; to Numitor, the elder, he bequeathed the ancient realm of the Silvian family. Yet violence proved more potent than a father's wishes or respect for seniority. Amulius drove out his brother and ruled in his stead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Adding crime to crime, he destroyed Numitor's male issue; and Rhea Silvia, his brother's daughter, he appointed a Vestal under pretence of honouring, her, and by consigning her to perpetual virginity, deprived her of the hope of children.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the Fates were resolved, as I suppose, upon the founding of this great City, and the beginning of the mightiest of empires, next after that of Heaven.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Vestal was ravished, and having given birth to twin sons, named Mars as the father of her doubtful offspring, whether actually so believing, or because it seemed less wrong if a god <pb id="p.19"/>were the author of her fault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But neither gods nor men protected the mother herself or her babes from the king's cruelty; the priestess he ordered to be manacled and cast into prison, the children to be committed to the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It happened by singular good fortune that the Tiber having spread beyond its banks into stagnant pools afforded nowhere any access to the regular channel of the river, and the men who brought the twins were led to hope that being infants they might be drowned, no matter how sluggish the stream.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So they made shift to discharge the king's command, by exposing the babes at the nearest point of the overflow, where the fig-tree Ruminalis &mdash;formerly, they say, called Romularis &mdash;now stands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In those days this was a wild and uninhabited region. The story persists that when the floating basket in which the children had been exposed was left high and dry by the receding water, a she-wolf, coming down out of the surrounding hills to slake her thirst, turned her steps towards the cry of the infants, and with her teats gave them suck so gently, that the keeper of the royal flock found her licking them with her tongue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Tradition assigns to this man the name of Faustulus, and adds that he carried the twins to his hut and gave them to his wife Larentia to rear. Some think that Larentia, having been free with her favours, had got the name of <quote>she-wolf</quote> among the shepherds, and that this gave rise to this marvellous story.<note>The word <hi rend="italics">lupa</hi> was sometimes used in the sense of <quote>courtesan.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The boys, thus born and reared, had no sooner attained to youth than they began &mdash;yet without neglecting the farmstead or the flocks &mdash;to range the glades of the mountains for game.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having in this way gained both strength and resolution, they would now not <pb id="p.21"/>only face wild beasts, but would attack robbers laden with their spoils, and divide up what they took from them among the shepherds, with whom they shared their toils and pranks, while their band of young men grew larger every day.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They say that the Palatine was even then the scene of the merry festival of the Lupercalia which we have to-day, and that the hill was named Pallantium, from Pallanteum, an Arcadian city, and then Palatium.<note>The derivation here given is fanciful. The word is probably akin to <hi rend="italics">palus,</hi> <quote>pale,</quote> and meant a <quote>fenced place.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Evander, an Arcadian of that stock, who had held the place many ages before the time of which I am writing, is said to have established the yearly rite, derived from Arcadia, that youths should run naked about in playful sport, doing honour to Lycaean Pan, whom the Romans afterwards called Inuus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the young men were occupied in this celebration, the rite being generally known, some robbers who had been angered by the loss of their plunder laid an ambush for them, and although Romulus successfully defended himself, captured Remus and delivered up their prisoner to King Amulius, even lodging a complaint against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The main charge was that the brothers made raids on the lands of Numitor, and pillaged them, with a band of young fellows which they had got together, like an invading enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So Remus was given up to Numitor to be punished. From the very beginning Faustulus had entertained the suspicion that they were children of the royal blood that he was bringing up in his house; for he was aware both that infants had been exposed by order of the king, and that the time when he had himself taken up the children exactly coincided with that event. But he had been unwilling that the <pb id="p.23"/>matter should be disclosed prematurely, until opportunity offered or necessity compelled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Necessity came first; accordingly, driven by fear, he revealed the facts to Romulus. It chanced that Numitor too, having Remus in custody, and hearing that the brothers were twins, had been reminded, upon considering their age and their far from servile nature, of his grandsons. The inquiries he made led him to the same conclusion, so that he was almost ready to acknowledge Remus. Thus on every hand the toils were woven about the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Romulus did not assemble his company of youths &mdash;for he was not equal to open violence &mdash;but commanded his shepherds to come to the palace at an appointed time, some by one way, some by another, and so made his attack upon the king; while from the house of Numitor came Remus, with another party which he had got together, to help his brother. So Romulus slew the king. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the fray Numitor exclaimed that an enemy had invaded the city and attacked the palace, and drew off the active men of the place to serve as an armed garrison for the defence of the citadel; and when he saw the young men approaching, after they had dispatched the king, to congratulate him, he at once summoned a council, and laid before it his brother's crimes against himself, the parentage of his grandsons, and how they had been born, reared, and recognised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then announced the tyrant's death, and declared himself to be responsible for it. The brothers advanced with their band through the midst of the crowd, and hailed their grandfather king, whereupon such a shout of assent arose from the entire throng as confirmed the new monarch's title and authority.
				</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><pb id="p.25"/>
				<p>The Alban state being thus made over to Numitor, Romulus and Remus were seized with the desire to found a city in the region where they had been exposed and brought up. And in fact the population of Albans and Latins was too large; besides, there were the shepherds. All together, their numbers might easily lead men to hope that Alba would be small, and Lavinium small, compared with the city which they should build.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These considerations were interrupted by the curse of their grandsires, the greed of kingly power, and by a shameful quarrel which grew out of it, upon an occasion innocent enough. Since the brothers were twins, and respect for their age could not determine between them, it was agreed that the gods who had those places in their protection should choose by augury who should give the new city its name, who should govern it when built. Romulus took the Palatine for his augural quarter, Remus the Aventine. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Remus<note type="margin">B.C. 753</note> is said to have been the first to receive an augury, from the flight of six vultures. The omen had been already reported when twice that number appeared to Romulus. Thereupon each was saluted king by his own followers, the one party laying claim to the honour from priority, the other from the number of the birds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They then engaged in a battle of words and, angry taunts leading to bloodshed, Remus was struck down in the affray. The commoner story is that Remus leaped over the new walls in mockery of his brother, whereupon Romulus in great anger slew him, and in menacing wise added these words withal, <quote><hi rend="italics">So</hi> perish whoever else shall leap over my walls!</quote><note>A form of the legend preserved by Dion. Hal. i. 87, and Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Fasti,</hi> iv. 843, names Celer, whom Romulus had put in charge of the rising wall, as the slayer of Remus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thus Romulus acquired sole power, and the city, thus founded, was called by its founder's name.
				</p> <pb id="p.27"/>
				<p>His first act was to fortify the Palatine, on which<note type="margin">B.C. 753</note> he had himself been reared. To other gods he sacrificed after the Alban custom, but employed the Greek for Hercules, according to the institution of Evander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The story is as follows: Hercules, after slaying Geryones, was driving off his wondrously beautiful cattle, when, close to the river Tiber, where he had swum across it with the herd before him, he found a green spot, where he could let the cattle rest and refresh themselves with the abundant grass; and being tired from his journey he lay down himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he had there fallen into a deep sleep, for he was heavy with food and wine, a shepherd by the name of Cacus, who dwelt hard by and was insolent by reason of his strength, was struck with the beauty of the animals, and wished to drive them off as plunder. But if he had driven the herd into his cave, their tracks would have been enough to guide their owner to the place in his search; he therefore chose out those of the cattle that were most remarkable for their beauty, and turning them the other way, dragged them into the cave by their tails.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At daybreak Hercules awoke. Glancing over the herd, and perceiving that a part of their number was lacking, he proceeded to the nearest cave, in case there might be foot-prints leading into it. When he saw that they were all turned outward and yet did not lead to any other place, he was confused and bewildered, and made ready to drive his herd away from that uncanny spot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As the cattle were being driven off, some of them lowed, as usually happens, missing those which had been left behind. They were answered with a low by the cattle shut up in the cave, and this made Hercules turn back. When he came towards the <pb id="p.29"/>cave, Cacus would have prevented his approach with<note type="margin">B.C. 753</note> force, but received a blow from the hero's club, and calling in vain upon the shepherds to protect him, gave up the ghost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Evander, an exile from the Peloponnese, controlled that region in those days, more through personal influence than sovereign power. He was a man revered for his wonderful invention of letters,<note>Evander is said to have invented the Roman alphabet.</note> a new thing to men unacquainted with the arts, and even more revered because of the divinity which men attributed to his mother Carmenta, whom those tribes had admired as a prophetess before the Sibyl's coming into Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Now this Evander was then attracted by the concourse of shepherds, who, crowding excitedly about the stranger, were accusing him as a murderer caught red-handed. When he had been told about the deed and the reason for it, and had marked the bearing of the man and his figure, which was somewhat ampler and more august than a mortal's, he inquired who lie was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Upon learning his name, his father, and his birth-place, he exclaimed, <quote>Hail, Hercules, son of Jupiter! You are he, of whom my mother, truthful interpreter of Heaven, foretold to me that you should be added to the number of the gods, and that an altar should be dedicated to you here which the nation one day to
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> be the most powerful on earth should call the Greatest Altar, and should serve according to your rite.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Hercules gave him his hand, and declared that he accepted the omen, and would fulfil the prophecy by establishing and dedicating an altar. Then and there men took a choice victim from the herd, and for the first time made sacrifice to Hercules.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For the ministry and the banquet they employed the Potitii and the Pinarii, being the families <pb id="p.31"/>of most distinction then living in that region. It so<note type="margin">B.C. 753</note> fell out that the Potitii were there at the appointed time, and to them were served the inwards; the Pinarii came after the inwards had been eaten, in season for the remainder of the feast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thence came the custom, which persisted as long as the Pinarian family endured, that they should not partake of the inwards at that sacrifice. The Potitii, instructed by Evander, were priests of this cult for many generations, until, having delegated to public slaves the solemn function of their family, the entire stock of the Potitii died out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> This was the only sacred observance, of all those of foreign origin, which Romulus then adopted, honouring even then the immortality won by worth to which his own destiny was leading him.<note>For the story of Cacus and the origin of the Ara Maxima see also Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> viii. 182-279; Prop. iv. 9; Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Fasti,</hi> i. 543-586.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Romulus had duly attended to the worship of the gods, he called the people together and gave them the rules of law, since nothing else but law could unite them into a single body politic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But these, he was persuaded, would only appear binding in the eyes of a rustic people in case he should invest his own person with majesty, by adopting emblems of authority. He therefore put on a more august state in every way, and especially by the assumption of twelve lictors.<note>The lictors carried axes in bundles of rods, in readiness to execute the king's sentence of scourging and decapitation.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some think the twelve birds which had given him an augury of kingship led him to choose this number. For my part, I am content to share the opinion of those who derive from the neighbouring Etruscans (whence were borrowed the curule chair and purple-bordered toga) not only the type of attendants but their number as well &mdash;a number which the Etruscans themselves are thought to have chosen because each <pb id="p.33"/>of the twelve cities which united to elect the king<note type="margin">B.C. 753</note> contributed one lictor.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Meanwhile the City was expanding and reaching out its walls to include one place after another, for they built their defences with an eye rather to the population which they hoped one day to have than to the numbers they had then.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next, lest his big City should be empty, Romulus resorted to a plan for increasing the inhabitants which had long been employed by the founders of cities, who gather about them an obscure and lowly multitude and pretend that the earth has raised up sons to them. In the place which is now enclosed, between the two groves as you go up the hill,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Capitoline.</note> he opened a sanctuary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thither fled, from the surrounding peoples, a miscellaneous rabble, without distinction of bond or free, eager for new conditions; and these constituted the first advance in power towards that greatness at which Romulus aimed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He had now no reason to be dissatisfied with his strength, and proceeded to add policy to strength. He appointed a hundred senators, whether because this number seemed to him sufficient, or because there were no more than a hundred who could be designated Fathers.<note>As being heads of clans, <hi rend="italics">patresfamiliarum.</hi></note> At all events, they received the designation of Fathers from their rank, and their descendants were called patricians.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rome was now strong enough to hold her own<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> in war with any of the adjacent states; but owing to the want of women a single generation was likely to see the end of her greatness, since she had neither prospect of posterity at home nor the right of intermarriage with her neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So, on the advice of the senate, Romulus sent envoys round among all the neighbouring nations to solicit for the new people <pb id="p.35"/>an alliance and the privilege of intermarrying.<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Cities, they argued, as well as all other things, take their rise from the lowliest beginnings. As time goes on, those which are aided by their own worth and by the favour of Heaven achieve great power and renown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They said they were well assured that Rome's origin had been blessed with the favour of Heaven, and that worth would not be lacking; their neighbours should not be reluctant to mingle their stock and their blood with the Romans, who were as truly men as they were.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nowhere did the embassy obtain a friendly hearing. In fact men spurned, at the same time that they feared, both for themselves and their descendants, that great power which was then growing up in their midst; and the envoys were frequently asked, on being dismissed, if they had opened a sanctuary for women as well as for men, for in that way only would they obtain suitable wives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was a bitter insult to the young Romans, and the matter seemed certain to end in violence. Expressly to afford a fitting time and place for this, Romulus, concealing his resentment, made ready solemn games in honour of the equestrian Neptune, which he called Consualia.<note>The Consualia was a harvest festival, held on August 21. Consus, the true name of the god, is from <hi rend="italics">condere,</hi> <quote>to store up.</quote> From the association of the festival with horses came the later identification of the god with <hi rend="italics">Neptunus Equester.</hi> See Fowler, <hi rend="italics">Fest.</hi> pp. 206-9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then bade proclaim the spectacle to the surrounding peoples, and his subjects prepared to celebrate it with all the resources within their knowledge and power, that they might cause the occasion to be noised abroad and eagerly expected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many people &mdash;for they were also eager to see the new city &mdash;gathered for the festival, especially those who lived nearest, the inhabitants of Caenina, Crustumium, and Antemnae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Sabines, <pb id="p.37"/>too, came with all their people, including their<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> children and wives. They were hospitably entertained in every house, and when they had looked at the site of the City, its walls, and its numerous buildings, they marvelled that Rome had so rapidly grown great.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the time came for the show, and people's thoughts and eyes were busy with it, the preconcerted attack began. At a given signal the young Romans darted this way and that, to seize and carry off the maidens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In most cases these were taken by the men in whose path they chanced to be. Some, of exceptional beauty, had been marked out for the chief senators, and were carried off to their houses by plebeians to whom the office had been entrusted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> One, who far excelled the rest in mien and loveliness, was seized, the story relates, by the gang of a certain Thalassius. Being repeatedly asked for whom they were bearing her off, they kept shouting that no one should touch her, for they were taking her to Thalassius, and this was the origin of the wedding-cry.<note>Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Rom.</hi> 15, also gives the story, and observes that the Romans used <quote>Talasius</quote> as the Greeks did <quote>Hymenaeus.</quote> See also Catullus, lxi. 134.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The sports broke up in a panic, and the parents of the maidens fled sorrowing. They charged the Romans with the crime of violating hospitality, and invoked the gods to whose solemn games they had come, deceived in violation of religion and honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The stolen maidens were no more hopeful of their plight, nor less indignant. But Romulus himself went amongst them and explained that the pride of their parents had caused this deed, when they had refused their neighbours the right to intermarry; nevertheless the daughters should be wedded and become co-partners in all the possessions of the Romans, in their citizenship and, dearest privilege of all to the human race, in their children; <pb id="p.39"/>only let them moderate their anger, and give their<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> hearts to those to whom fortune had given their persons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> A sense of injury had often given place to affection, and they would find their husbands the kinder for this reason, that every man would earnestly endeavour not only to be a good husband, but also to console his wife for the home and parents she had lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> His arguments were seconded by the wooing of the men, who excused their act on the score of passion and love, the most moving of all pleas to a woman's heart.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The resentment of the brides was already much diminished at the very moment when their parents, in mourning garb and with tears and lamentations, were attempting to arouse their states to action. Nor did they confine their complaints to their home towns, but thronged from every side to the house of Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines; and thither, too, came official embassies, for the name of Tatius was the greatest in all that country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The men of Caenina, Crustumium, and Antemnae, were those who had had a share in the wrong. It seemed to them that Tatius and the Sabines were procrastinating, and without waiting for them these three tribes arranged for a joint campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But even the Crustuminians and Antemnates moved too slowly to satisfy the burning anger of the Caeninenses, and accordingly that nation invaded alone the Roman territory. But while they were dispersed and engaged in pillage, Romulus appeared with his troops and taught them, by an easy victory, how ineffectual is anger without strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their army he broke and routed, and pursued it as it fled; their king he killed <pb id="p.41"/>in battle and despoiled; their city, once their leader<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> was slain, he captured at the first assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then led his victorious army back, and being not more splendid in his deeds than willing to display them, he arranged the spoils of the enemy's dead commander upon a fame, suitably fashioned for the purpose, and, carrying it himself, mounted the Capitol. Having there deposited his burden, by an oak which the shepherds held sacred, at the same time as he made his offering he marked out the limits of a temple to Jupiter, and bestowed a title upon him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>Jupiter Feretrius,</quote> he said, <quote>to thee I, victorious Romulus, myself a king, bring the panoply of a king, and dedicate a sacred precinct within the bounds which I have even now marked off in my mind, to be a seat for the spoils of honour which men shall bear hither in time to come, following my example, when they have slain kings and commanders of the enemy.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This was the origin of the first temple that was consecrated in Rome.<note>Jupiter Feretrius (etymology unknown) was the pure Italian Jupiter, whose worship was later overshadowed by the Etruscan god of the great temple on the Capitol. See Fowler, <hi rend="italics">Fest.</hi> p. 229.</note> It pleased Heaven, in the sequel, that while the founder's words should not be in vain, when he declared that men should bring spoils thither in the after time, yet the glory of that gift should not be staled by a multitude of partakers. Twice only since then, in all these years with their many wars, have the spoils of honour been won; so rarely have men had the good fortune to attain to that distinction.<note>The other instances were the victories of Cossus over Tolumnius, king of Veii (iv. 20), and of Marcellus over Virdomarus, king of the Insubrian Gauls. Propertius tells the three stories in iv. 10.</note>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Romans were thus occupied in the City, the army of the Antemnates seized the opportunity afforded by their absence, and made an inroad upon their territory; but so swiftly was the Roman <pb id="p.43"/>levy led against them that they, too, were taken off<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> their guard while scattered about in the fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were therefore routed at the first charge and shout, and their town was taken. As Romulus was exulting in his double victory, his wife Hersilia, beset with entreaties by the captive women, begged him to forgive their parents and receive them into the state; which would, in that case, gain in strength by harmony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He readily granted her request. He then set out to meet the Crustuminians, who were marching to attack him. They offered even less resistance than their allies had done, for their ardour had been quenched by the defeats of the others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Colonies were sent out to both places, though most of the colonists preferred to enrol for Crustumium on account of the fertility of its soil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the other hand, many persons left Crustumium and came to live in Rome, chiefly parents and kinsmen of the captured women.
				</p> 
				<p>The last to attack Rome were the Sabines, and this war was by far the gravest of all, for passion and greed were not their motives, nor did they parade war before they made it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To their prudence they even added deception. Spurius Tarpeius commanded the Roman citadel. This man's maiden daughter was bribed with gold by Tatius to admit armed men into the fortress: she happened at that time to have gone outside the walls to fetch water for a sacrifice.<note>As a vestal, she had to draw water from the spring of the Camenae.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Once within, they threw their shields upon her and killed her so, whether to make it appear that the citadel had been taken by assault, or to set an example, that no one might anywhere keep faith with a traitor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There is also a legend that because most of the Sabines wore heavy golden <pb id="p.45"/>bracelets on their left arms and magnificent jewelled<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> rings, she had stipulated for what they had on their left arms, and that they had therefore heaped their shields upon her, instead of gifts of gold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some say that, in virtue of the compact that they should give her what they wore on their arms, she flatly demanded their shields and, her treachery being perceived, forfeited her life to the bargain she herself had struck.<note>According to Dion. Hal. ii. 38, this was the version given by L. Calpurnius Piso. Propertius wrote the best of his aetiological poems (iv. 5) about Tarpeia.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Be that as it may, the Sabines held the citadel. Next day the Roman army was drawn up, and covered the ground between the Palatine Hill and the Capitoline, but the Sabines would not come down till rage and eagerness to regain the citadel had goaded their enemy into marching up the slope against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Two champions led the fighting, the Sabine Mettius Curtius on the one side, and the Roman Hostius Hostilius on the other. Hostius held the Romans firm, despite their disadvantage of position, by the reckless courage he displayed in the thick of the fray.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when he fell, the Roman line gave way at once and fled towards the old gate of the Palatine. Romulus himself was swept along in the crowd of the fugitives, till lifting his sword and shield to
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> heaven, he cried, <quote>O Jupiter, it was thy omen that directed me when I laid here on the Palatine the first foundations of my City. The fortress is already bought by a crime and in the possession of the Sabines, whence they are come, sword in hand, across the valley to seek us here.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But do thou, father of gods and men, keep them back from this spot at least; deliver the Romans from their terror, and stay their shameful flight!
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I here vow to thee, Jupiter the Stayer, a temple, to be a <pb id="p.47"/>memorial to our descendants how the City was saved<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> by thy present help.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having uttered this prayer he exclaimed, as if he had perceived that it was heard, <quote>Here, Romans, Jupiter Optimus Maximus commands us to stand and renew the fight!</quote> The Romans did stand, as though directed by a voice from Heaven, Romulus himself rushing into the forefront of the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Mettius Curtius, on the Sabine side, had led the charge down from the citadel, and driven the Romans in disorder over all that ground which the Forum occupies. He was not now far from the gate of the Palatine, shouting, <quote>We have beaten our faithless hosts, our cowardly enemies! They know now how great is the difference between carrying off maidens and fighting with men!</quote> While he pronounced this boast a band of gallant youths, led on by Romulus, assailed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It chanced that Mettius was fighting on horseback at the time, and was therefore the more easily put to flight. As he fled, the Romans followed; and the rest of their army, too, fired by the reckless daring of their king, drove the Sabines before them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Mettius plunged into a swamp, his horse becoming unmanageable in the din of the pursuit, and even the Sabines were drawn off from the general engagement by the danger to so great a man. As for Mettius, heartened by the gestures and shouts of his followers and the encouragement of the throng, he made his escape; and the Romans and the Sabines renewed their battle in the valley that lies between the two hills. But the advantage rested with the Romans.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the Sabine women, whose wrong had given rise to the war, with loosened hair and torn <pb id="p.49"/>garments, their woman's timidity lost in a sense of<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> their misfortune, dared to go amongst the flying missiles, and rushing in from the side, to part the hostile forces and disarm them of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> their anger, beseeching their fathers on this side, on that their husbands, that fathers-in-law and sons-in-law should not stain themselves with impious bloodshed, nor pollute with parricide the suppliants' children, grandsons to one party and sons to the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>If you regret,</quote> they continued, <quote>the relationship that unites you, if you regret the marriage-tie, turn your anger against us; we are the cause of war, the cause of wounds, and even death to both our husbands and our parents. It will be better for us to perish than to live, lacking either of you, as widows or as orphans.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was a touching plea, not only to the rank and file, but to their leaders as well. A stillness fell on them, and a sudden hush. Then the leaders came forward to make a truce, and not only did they agree on peace, but they made one people out of the two.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They shared the sovereignty, but all authority was transferred to Rome. In this way the population was doubled, and that some concession might after all be granted the Sabines, the citizens were named Quirites, from the town of Cures.<note><hi rend="italics">Quirites</hi> probably comes not from Cures, nor (as Varro thought) from the Sabine word <hi rend="italics">quiris (curis),</hi> <quote>spear,</quote> but from <hi rend="italics">curia</hi> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> next section); it would then mean <quote>wardsmen.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As a reminder of this battle they gave the name of Curtian Lake to the pool where the horse of Curtius first emerged from the deep swamp and brought his rider to safety.<note>For another explanation of the name see vii. 6. Varro, <hi rend="italics">L. L.</hi> v. 14 ff., assigns this version of the story to Piso, the other to Procilius, adding a third, on the authority of Cornelius and Lutatius, to the effect that the Lacus Curtius was a place which had been struck by lightning in the consulship of a Curtius.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>The sudden exchange of so unhappy a war for a joyful peace endeared the Sabine women even more to their husbands and parents, and above all to <pb id="p.51"/>Romulus himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so, when he divided the<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> people into thirty <hi rend="italics">curiae,</hi> he named these wards after the women.<note>The <hi rend="italics">curia</hi> was a political unit the members of which had certain religious rites in common.</note> Undoubtedly the number of the women was somewhat greater than this, but tradition does not tell whether it was their age, their own or their husbands' rank, or the casting of lots, that determined which of them should give their names to the wards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the same time there were formed three centuries of knights: the Ramnenses were named after Romulus; the Titienses after Titus Tatius; the name and origin of the Luceres are alike obscure.<note>All three names are obscure, but it is not improbable that they represent a Roman, a Sabine, and an Etruscan element in the population.</note> From this time forth the two kings ruled not only jointly but in harmony.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some years later the kinsmen of King Tatius maltreated the envoys of the Laurentians, and when their fellow-citizens sought redress under the law of nations, Titus yielded to his partiality for his relations and to their entreaties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In consequence of this he drew down their punishment upon himself, for at Lavinium, whither he had gone to the annual sacrifice, a mob came together and killed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This act is said to have awakened less resentment than was proper in Romulus, whether owing to the disloyalty that attends a divided rule, or because he thought Tatius had been not unjustly slain. He therefore declined to go to war; but yet, in order that he might atone for the insults to the envoys and the murder of the king, he caused the covenant between Rome and Lavinium to be renewed.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Thus with the Laurentians peace was preserved against all expectation; but another war broke out, much nearer, and indeed almost at the city gates. The men of Fidenae, perceiving the growth of a power which they thought too near themselves for <pb id="p.53"/>safety, did not wait till its promised strength should<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> be realized, but began war themselves. Arming the young men, they sent them to ravage the land between the City and Fidenae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thence they turned to the left &mdash;for the Tiber stopped them on the right &mdash;and by their devastations struck terror into the farmers, whose sudden stampede from the fields into the City brought the first tidings of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Romulus led forth his army on the instant, for delay was impossible with the enemy so near, and pitched his camp a mile from Fidenae. Leaving there a small guard, he marched out with all his forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A part of his men he ordered to lie in ambush, on this side and on that, where thick underbrush afforded cover; advancing with the greater part of the infantry and all the cavalry, and delivering a disorderly and provoking attack, in which the horsemen galloped almost up to the gates, he accomplished his purpose of drawing out the enemy. For the flight, too, which had next to be feigned, the cavalry engagement afforded a favourable pretext.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And when not only the cavalry began to waver, as if undecided whether to fight or run, but the infantry also fell back, the city gates were quickly thronged by the enemy, who poured out and hurled themselves against the Roman line, and in the ardour of attack and pursuit were drawn on to the place of ambuscade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There the Romans suddenly sprang out and assailed the enemy's flanks, while, to add to their terror, the standards of the detachment which had been left on guard were seen advancing from the camp; thus threatened by so many dangers the men of Fidenae scarcely afforded time for Romulus and those whom they had seen riding off with him to wheel about, before they <pb id="p.55"/>broke and ran, and in far greater disorder than that<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> of the pretended fugitives whom they had just been chasing &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the flight was a real one this time &mdash; sought to regain the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But the Fidenates did not escape their foes; the Romans followed close upon their heels, and before the gates could be shut burst into the city, as though they both formed but a single army.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Fidenae the war-spirit, by a kind of contagion, spread to the Veientes, whose hostility was aroused by their kinship with the Fidenates, Etruscans like themselves, and was intensified by the danger which lay in their very proximity to Rome, if her arms should be directed against all her neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They made an incursion into Roman territory which more resembled a marauding expedition than a regular campaign; and so, without having entrenched a camp or waited for the enemy's army, they carried off their booty from the fields and brought it back to Veii. The Romans, on the contrary, not finding their enemy in the fields, crossed the Tiber, ready and eager for a decisive struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the Veientes heard that they were making a camp, and would be advancing against their city, they went out to meet them, preferring to settle the quarrel in the field of battle rather than to be shut up and compelled to fight for their homes and their town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Without employing strategy to aid his forces, the Roman king won the battle by the sheer strength of his seasoned army, and routing his enemies, pursued them to their walls. But the city was strongly fortified, besides the protection afforded by its site, and he refrained from attacking it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their fields, indeed, he laid waste as he returned, more in <pb id="p.57"/>revenge than from a desire for booty, and this disaster,<note type="margin">B.C. 753-717</note> following upon their defeat, induced the Veientes to send envoys to Rome and sue for peace. They were deprived of a part of their land, and a truce was granted them for a hundred years.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Such were the principal achievements of the reign of Romulus, at home and in the field, nor is any of them incompatible with the belief in his divine origin and the divinity which was ascribed to the king after his death, whether one considers his spirit in recovering the kingdom of his ancestors, or his wisdom in founding the City and in strengthening it by warlike and peaceful measures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For it was to him, assuredly, that Rome owed the vigour which enabled her to enjoy an untroubled peace for the next forty years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless, he was more liked by the commons than by the senate, and was preeminently dear to the hearts of his soldiers. Of these he had three hundred for a bodyguard, to whom he gave the name of Celeres,<note>Literally, <quote>the .Swift.</quote></note> and kept them by him, not only in war, but also in time of peace.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these deathless deeds had been done,<note type="margin">B.C. 716</note> as the king was holding a muster in the Campus Martius, near the swamp of Capra, for the purpose of reviewing the army, suddenly a storm came up, with loud claps of thunder, and enveloped him in a cloud so thick as to hide him from the sight of the assembly; and from that moment Romulus was no more on earth.<note>For the deification <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">de Rep.</hi> ii. 17; Dion. Hal. ii. 56; Plut. <hi rend="italics">Rom.</hi> xxvii. Ovid also tells the story in <hi rend="italics">Fasti,</hi> ii. 491 ff., and <hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> xiv. 806 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Roman soldiers at length recovered from their panic, when this hour of wild confusion had been succeeded by a sunny calm; but when they saw that the royal seat was empty, although they readily believed the assertion of the senators, who had been standing next to Romulus, <pb id="p.59"/>that he had been caught up on high in the blast, they<note type="margin">B.C. 716</note> nevertheless remained for some time sorrowful and silent, as if filled with the fear of orphanhood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, when a few men had taken the initiative, they all with one accord hailed Romulus as a god and a god's son, the King and Father of the Roman City, and with prayers besought his favour that he would graciously be pleased forever to protect his children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were some, I believe, even then who secretly asserted that the king had been rent in pieces by the hands of the senators, for this rumour, too, got abroad, but in very obscure terms; the other version obtained currency, owing to men's admiration for the hero and the intensity of their panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And the shrewd device of one man is also said to have gained new credit for the story.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was Proculus Julius, who, when the people were distracted with the loss of their king and in no friendly mood towards the senate, being, as tradition tells, weighty in council, were the matter never so important, addressed the assembly as follows: <quote>Quirites, the Father of this City, Romulus, descended suddenly from the sky at dawn this morning and appeared to me. Covered with confusion, I stood reverently before him, praying that it might be vouchsafed me to look upon his face without sin.<note>The Romans regularly prayed with the head cloaked.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> 'Go,' said he, 'and declare to the Romans the will of Heaven that my Rome shall be the capital of the world; so let them cherish the art of war, and let them know and teach their children that no human strength can resist Roman arms.'
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So saying,</quote> he concluded, <quote>Romulus departed on high.</quote> It is wonderful what credence the people placed in that man's tale, and how the grief for the loss of Romulus, which the plebeians <pb id="p.61"/>and the army felt, was quieted by the assurance of<note type="margin">B.C. 716</note> his immortality.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senators meanwhile were engaged in a struggle for the coveted kingship. So far it had not come to a question of any one person, for nobody stood out with special prominence in the new nation; instead, a strife of factions was waging between the two stocks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Those of Sabine origin, having had no king on their side since the death of Tatius, feared that despite their equal rights they might lose their hold upon the sovereign power, and hence desired that the king should be chosen from their own body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The original Romans spurned the idea of an alien king. Various, however, as were men's inclinations, to be ruled by a king was their universal wish, for they had not yet tasted the sweetness of liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the senators became alarmed, lest the state wanting a ruler and the army a leader, and many neighbouring states being disaffected, some violence might be offered from without.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All therefore were agreed that there should be some head, but nobody could make up his mind to yield to his fellow. And so the hundred senators shared the power among themselves, establishing ten decuries and appointing one man for each decury to preside over the administration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Ten men exercised authority; only one had its insignia and lictors. Five days was the period of his power, which passed in rotation to all; and for a year the monarchy lapsed. This interval was called, as it was, an interregnum, a name which even yet obtains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Murmurs then arose among the plebs that their servitude had been multiplied; that a hundred masters had been given them instead of <pb id="p.63"/>one. No longer, it seemed, would they endure<note type="margin">B.C. 716</note> anything short of a king, and a king, too, of their own choosing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Perceiving that such ideas were in the wind, the senators thought it would be well to proffer spontaneously a thing which they were on the verge of losing, and obtained the favour of the people by granting them supreme power on such terms as to part with no greater prerogative than they retained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For they decreed that when the people should have named a king, their act should only be valid in case the senators ratified it. Even now, in voting for laws and magistrates, the same right is exercised, but is robbed of its significance; before the people can begin to vote, and when the result of the election is undetermined, the Fathers ratify it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the present occasion the interrex summoned the assembly and spoke as follows: <quote>May prosperity, favour, and fortune attend our action! Quirites, choose your king. Such is the pleasure of the Fathers, who, in their turn, if your choice fall upon one worthy to be called Romulus' successor, will confirm your election.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This so pleased the plebs, that, unwilling to appear outdone in generosity, they merely resolved and ordered that the senate should decree who should be king in Rome.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A great reputation for justice and piety was enjoyed in those days by Numa Pompilius. Cures, a town of the Sabines, was his home, and he was deeply versed, so far as anyone could be in that age, in all law, divine and human.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The teacher to whom he owed his learning was not, as men say, in default of another name, the Samian Pythagoras; for it is well established that Servius Tullius was king at Rome, more than a hundred years after this <pb id="p.65"/>time, when Pythagoras gathered about him, on the<note type="margin">B.C. 716</note> farthest coasts of Italy, in the neighbourhood of Metapontum, Heraclea, and Croton, young men eager to share his studies.<note>It was about <date value="-530">530 B.C.</date> when Pythagoras settled in Croton.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And from that country, even if he had been contemporary, how could his fame have reached the Sabines? Again, in what common language could he have induced anyone to seek instruction of him? Or under whose protection could a solitary man have made his way through so many nations differing in speech and customs?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was Numa's native disposition, then, as I incline to believe, that tempered his soul with noble qualities, and his training was not in foreign studies, but in the stern and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, a race incorruptible as any race of the olden time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Numa's name had been proposed, the Roman senators perceived that the Sabines would gain the ascendancy if a king were to be chosen from that nation; yet nobody ventured to urge his own claims in preference to those of such a man, nor the claim of any other of his faction, nor those, in short, of any of the senators or citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so they unanimously voted to offer the sovereignty to Numa Pompilius. Being summoned to Rome he commanded that, just as Romulus had obeyed the augural omens in building his city and assuming regal power, so too in his own case the gods should be consulted. Accordingly an augur (who thereafter, as a mark of honour, was made a priest of the state in permanent charge of that function) conducted him to the citadel and caused him to sit down on a stone, facing the south.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The augur seated himself on Numa's left, having his head covered, and holding his in right hand the crooked staff without a knot <pb id="p.67"/>which they call a <hi rend="italics">lituus.</hi>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, looking out over the<note type="margin">B.C. 716</note> City and the country beyond, he prayed to the gods, and marked off the heavens by a line from east to west, designating as ' right' the regions to the south, as 'left' those to the north, and fixing in his mind a landmark opposite to him and as far away as the eye could reach;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> next shifting the crook to his left hand and, laying his right hand on Numa's head, he uttered the following prayer: <quote>Father Jupiter, if it is Heaven's will that this man Numa Pompilius, whose head I am touching, be king in Rome, do thou exhibit to us unmistakable signs within those limits which I have set.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then specified the auspices which he desired should be sent, and upon their appearance Numa was declared king, and so descended from the augural station.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had thus obtained the kingship, he<note type="margin">B.C. 715-672</note> prepared to give the new City, founded by force of arms, a new foundation in law, statutes, and observances.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And perceiving that men could not grow used to these things in the midst of wars, since their natures grew wild and savage through warfare, he thought it needful that his warlike people should be softened by the disuse of arms, and built the temple of Janus at the bottom of the Argiletum, as an index of peace and war, that when open it might signify that the nation was in arms, when closed that all the peoples round about were pacified.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Twice since Numa's reign has it been closed: once in the consulship of Titus Manlius, after the conclusion of the First Punic War; the second time, which the gods permitted our own generation to witness, was after the battle of Actium, when the emperor Caesar Augustus had brought about peace on land and <pb id="p.69"/>sea.<note>This was evidently written before <date value="-25">25 B.C.</date>, when the temple was again closed by Augustus. But it was not written before 27, for it was not until that year that the title of Augustus was conferred upon the emperor. We thus arrive at an approximate date for the beginning of Livy's history.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Numa closed the temple after first securing the<note type="margin">B.C. 715-672</note> good will of all the neighbouring tribes by alliances and treaties. And fearing lest relief from anxiety on the score of foreign perils might lead men who had hitherto been held back by fear of their enemies and by military discipline into extravagance and idleness, he thought the very first thing to do, as being the most efficacious with a populace which was ignorant and, in those early days, uncivilized, was to imbue them with the fear of Heaven.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As he could not instil this into their hearts without inventing some marvellous story, he pretended to have nocturnal meetings with the goddess Egeria, and that hers was the advice which guided him in the establishment of rites most approved by the gods, and in the appointment of special priests for the service of each.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And first of all he divided the year into twelve months, according to the revolutions of the moon. But since the moon does not give months of quite thirty days each, and eleven days are wanting to the full complement of a year as marked by the sun's revolution, he inserted intercalary months in such a way that in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started, and the period of twenty years be rounded out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He also appointed days when public business might not be carried on, and others when it might, since it would sometimes be desirable that nothing should be brought before the people.
				</p> <pb id="p.71"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He then turned his attention to the<note type="margin">B.C. 715-672</note> appointment of priests, although lie performed very many priestly duties himself, especially those which now belong to the Flamen Dialis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But inasmuch as he thought that in a warlike nation there would be more kings like Romulus than like Numa, and that they would take the field in person, he did not wish the sacrificial duties of the kingly office to be neglected, and so appointed a flamen for Jupiter, as his perpetual priest, and provided him with a conspicuous dress and the royal curule chair. To him he added two other flamens, one for Mars, the other for Quirinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In like manner he designated virgins for Vesta's service &mdash;a priesthood, this, that derived from Alba and so was not unsuited to the founder's stock. That they might be perpetual priestesses of the temple, he assigned them a stipend from the public treasury, and by the rule of virginity and other observances invested them with awe and sanctity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He likewise chose twelve Salii for Mars Gradivus, and granted them the distinction of wearing the embroidered tunic and over it a bronze breastplate, and of bearing the divine shields which men call <hi rend="italics">ancilia,</hi><note>The original <hi rend="italics">ancile</hi> was a shield fabled to have fallen from heaven. To lessen the chance of its being stolen, eleven others were .made exactly like it. It was of a peculiar shape, something like a violin. See Fowler, <hi rend="italics">Fest.</hi> p.42.</note> while they proceeded through the City, chanting their hymns to the triple beat of their solemn dance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He next chose as pontifex Numa Marcius, son of Marcus, one of the senators, and to him he intrusted written directions, full and accurate, for performing the rites of worship; with what victims, on what days, in what temple, sacrifices should be offered, and from what sources money was to be disbursed to pay their costs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All other public and private sacrifices lie likewise made subject to the decrees of the pontifex, that there <pb id="p.73"/>might be someone to whom the commons could<note type="margin">B.C. 715-672</note> come for advice, lest any confusion should arise in the religious law through the neglect of ancestral rites and the adoption of strange ones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And not merely ceremonies relating to the gods above, but also proper funeral observances and the propitiation of the spirits of the dead were to be taught by the pontifex as well, and also what prodigies manifested by lightning or other visible sign were to be taken in hand and averted. With the purpose of eliciting this knowledge from the minds of the gods, Numa dedicated an altar on the Aventine to Jupiter Elicius, and consulted the god by augury, that he might learn what portents were to be regarded.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consideration and disposal of these matters diverted the thoughts of the whole people from violence and arms. Not only had they something to occupy their minds, but their constant preoccupation with the gods, now that it seemed to them that concern for human affairs was felt by the heavenly powers, had so tinged the hearts of all with piety, that the nation was governed by its regard for promises and oaths, rather than by the dread of laws and penalties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And while Numa's subjects were spontaneously imitating the character of their king, as their unique exemplar, the neighboring peoples also, who had hitherto considered that it was no city but a camp that had been set up in their midst, as a menace to the general peace, came to feel such reverence for them, that they thought it sacrilege to injure a nation so wholly bent upon the worship of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was a grove watered by a perennial spring which flowed through the midst of it, out of a dark cave. Thither <pb id="p.75"/>Numa would often withdraw, without witnesses, as<note type="margin">B.C. 715-672</note> if to meet the goddess; so he dedicated the grove to the Camenae, alleging that they held counsel there with his wife Egeria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He also established an annual worship of Faith, to whose chapel he ordered that the flamens should proceed in a two-horse hooded carriage, and should wrap up their arms as far as the fingers before sacrificing, as a sign that faith must be kept, and that even in men's clasped hands her seat is sacred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He established many other rites, as well as places of sacrifice, which the pontiffs called <hi rend="italics">Argei.</hi><note>There were six of these shrines or chapels in each of the four regions of the Servian city. A procession made the round of the <hi rend="italics">Argei</hi> on March 17; and on May 15 rush puppets, also called <hi rend="italics">Argei,</hi> and probably corresponding to the shrines in number, were thrown into the Tiber by the Vestal Virgins, in the presence of the priestess of Jupiter, who was dressed in mourning. The meaning of both ceremonies is obscure. See Fowler, <hi rend="italics">Fest.</hi> pp. 54 and 111.</note> But of all his services the greatest was this, that throughout his reign he guarded peace no less jealously than his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thus two successive kings in different ways, one by war, the other by peace, promoted the nation's welfare. Romulus ruled thirty-seven years, Numa forty-three. The state was not only strong, but was also well organized in the arts both of war and of peace.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Numa's death the state reverted to an<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> interregnum. Then Tullus Hostilius, grandson of that Hostilius who had distinguished himself in the battle with the Sabines at the foot of the citadel, was declared king by the people, and the senate confirmed their choice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This monarch was not only unlike the last, but was actually more warlike than Romulus had been. Besides his youth and strength, the glory of his grandfather was also an incentive to him. So, thinking that the nation was growing decrepit from inaction, he everywhere sought excuses for stirring up war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It happened that the Roman rustics were <pb id="p.77"/>driving off cattle from Alban territory, while the<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> Albans were treating the Romans in the same way. The man who was then in power in Alba was Gaius Cluilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Each side, at about the same time, sent envoys to demand restitution. Tullus had commanded his envoys to do nothing else till they had carried out his orders; he felt convinced that the Albans would refuse his demands, in which case he could declare war with a good conscience. The Alban representatives proceeded rather laxly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Received by Tullus with gracious and kindly hospitality, they attended in a friendly spirit the banquet which he gave in their honour. Meanwhile the Romans had been beforehand with them in seeking redress, and, being denied it by the Alban leader, had made a declaration of war, to take effect in thirty days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Returning, they reported these things to Tullus, who thereupon invited the Alban envoys to inform him of the object of their mission. They, knowing nothing of what had happened, at first spent some time in apologies. They said they should be sorry to utter anything which might give offence to Tullus, but that they were compelled to do so by their orders; they had come to seek restitution; if it should be denied them they were commanded to declare war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To this Tullus replied: <quote>Tell your king the Roman king calls the gods to witness which people first spurned the other's demand for redress and dismissed its envoys, that they may call down upon the guilty nation all the disasters of this war.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With this answer the Albans returned to their city, and both sides prepared for war with the greatest energy &mdash;a civil war, to all intents and purposes, almost as if fathers were arrayed against sons; <pb id="p.79"/>for both were of Trojan ancestry, since Lavinium had<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> been planted from Troy, Alba from Lavinium, and from the line of the Alban kings had come the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Still, the issue of the war made the struggle less deplorable, for no battle was fought, and when only the buildings of one of the cities had been destroyed, the two peoples were fused into one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Albans were first in the field, and with a great army invaded the Roman territory. Their camp they pitched not more than five miles from the City, and surrounded it with a trench. (This was known for some centuries as the Cluilian Trench, from the name of the general, until in the course of time both trench and name disappeared.)
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In this camp Cluilius the Alban king died, and the Albans chose as dictator Mettius Fufetius. Meantime Tullus, emboldened principally by the death of the king, and asserting that Heaven's great powers would take vengeance upon all of the Alban name, beginning with their king himself, for their unscrupulous war, made a night march past the enemy's camp and led his army into the country of the Albans. This move drew Mettius out from his fortifications.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Leading his troops the shortest way towards the enemy, he sent an envoy on ahead to say to Tullus that before they fought it was well that they should confer together; if Tullus would meet him he was confident he had that to say which would be of no less moment to the Roman state than to the Alban. Without rejecting this suggestion, Tullus nevertheless drew up his men in line of battle, in case the proposals should prove impracticable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the other side the Albans also formed up. When both armies had been marshalled, the leaders, <pb id="p.81"/>attended by a few of their nobles, advanced to<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> the middle of the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then the Alban began as follows:
				</p> 
				<p><quote>Pillage and failure to make the amends demanded in accordance with our treaty I think I have myself heard named by our king, Cluilius, as the occasion of this war, and I doubt not, Tullus, but you make the same contention. But if truth is to be spoken, rather than sophistries, it is greed for dominion that is goading two kindred and neighbouring peoples into war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whether rightly or wrongly I do not attempt to determine; that is a question that may well have been considered by him who undertook the war; I am only the general appointed by the Albans to prosecute that war. But this is the point, Tullus, which I wish to suggest to you: Of the magnitude of the Etruscan power which encompasses us, and you especially, you are better aware than we, in proportion as you are nearer to that people. Great is their strength on land, exceedingly great on the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> You must consider that the instant you give the signal for battle, the Tuscans will be watching our two armies, so that, when we have become tired and exhausted, they may attack at once the victor and the vanquished. In Heaven's name, therefore, since we are not content with unquestioned liberty, but are proceeding to the doubtful hazard of dominion or enslavement, let us adopt some plan by which we may decide the question which nation shall rule the other, without a great disaster and much carnage on both sides.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Tullus made no objection, though inclined to war by nature no less than by his anticipation of victory. While both parties were considering what to do, a plan was hit upon for the execution of which Fortune herself supplied the means.
				</p> <pb id="p.83"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It chanced that there were in each of<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> these armies triplet brothers, not ill-matched either in age or in physical prowess. That they were Horatii and Curiatii is generally allowed, and scarcely any other ancient tradition is better known; yet, in spite of the celebrity of the affair, an uncertainty persists in regard to the names &mdash;to which people, that is, the Horatii belonged, and to which the Curiatii. The writers of history are divided. Still, the majority, I find, call the Roman brothers Horatii, and theirs is the opinion I incline to adopt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To these young men the kings proposed a combat in which each should fight for his own city, the dominion to belong with that side where the victory should rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> No objection was raised, and time and place were agreed on. Before proceeding with the battle, a treaty was made between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose citizens should triumph in this contest should hold undisputed sway over the other nation. One treaty differs from another in its terms, but the same procedure is always employed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the present occasion we are told that they did as follows, nor has tradition preserved the memory of any more ancient compact. The fetial<note>The <hi rend="italics">fetiales</hi> (related to <hi rend="italics">facio,</hi> <quote>do</quote>) were a college of priests whose duties were to represent the state in declaring war, making peace, entering into treaties, etc. <hi rend="italics">The pater</hi> <hi rend="italics">patratus</hi> (from <hi rend="italics">patro,</hi> <quote>accomplish</quote> or <quote>bring about</quote>) was the spokesman of the deputation.</note> asked King Tullus, <quote>Dost thou command me, King, to make a treaty with the <hi rend="italics">pater patratus</hi> of the Alban People?</quote> Being so commanded by the king, he said, <quote>I demand of thee, King, the sacred herb.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The king replied, <quote>Thou shalt take it untainted.</quote> The fetial brought from the citadel an untainted plant. After this he asked the king, <quote>Dost thou grant me, King, with my emblems and my companions, the royal sanction, to <pb id="p.85"/>speak for the Roman People of the Quirites?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> king made answer, <quote>So far as may be without prejudice to myself and the Roman People of the Quirites, I grant it.</quote> The fetial was Marcus Valerius; he made Spurius Fusius <hi rend="italics">pater patratus,</hi> touching his head and hair with the sacred sprig. The <hi rend="italics">pater patratus</hi> is appointed to pronounce the oath, that is, to solemnize the pact; and this he accomplishes with many words, expressed in a long metrical formula which it is not worth while to quote.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The conditions being then recited, he cries, <quote>Hear, Jupiter; hear, <hi rend="italics">pater patratus</hi> of the Alban People: hear ye, People of Alba: From these terms, as they have been publicly rehearsed from beginning to end, without fraud, from these tablets, or this wax, and as they have been this day clearly understood, the Roman People will not be the first to depart.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If it shall first depart from them, by general consent, with malice aforethought, then on that day do thou, great Diespiter, so smite the Roman People as I shall here to-day smite this pig: and so much the harder smite them as thy power and thy strength are greater.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Spurius had said these words, he struck the pig with a flint. In like manner the Albans pronounced their own forms and their own oath, by the mouth of their own dictator and priests.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the treaty had been established, the brothers armed themselves, in accordance with the agreement. On either side the soldiers urged on their champions. They reminded them that their fathers' gods, their native land, their parents, and all their countrymen, whether at home or with the army, had their eye only on their swords and their right hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Eager for the combat, as well owing to their <pb id="p.87"/>native spirit as to the shouts of encouragement which<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> filled their ears, the brothers advanced into the space between the two lines of battle. The two armies were drawn up, each in front of its own camp, no longer in any immediate danger, but their concern as great as ever; and no wonder, since empire was staked on those few men's valour and good fortune!
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Alert, therefore, and in suspense, they concentrated their attention upon this unpleasing spectacle. The signal was given, and with drawn steel, like advancing battle-lines, the six young men rushed to the charge, breathing the courage of great armies. Neither side thought of its own danger, but of the nation's sovereignty or servitude, and how from that day forward their country must experience the fortune they should themselves create.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The instant they encountered, there was a clash of shields and a flash of glittering blades, while a deep shudder ran through the onlookers, who, as long as neither side had the advantage, remained powerless to speak or breathe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, in the hand-to-hand fight which followed, wherein were soon exhibited to men's eyes not only struggling bodies and the play of the sword and shield, but also bloody wounds, two of the Romans fell, fatally wounded, one upon the other, while all three of the Albans were wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the fall of the Romans a shout of joy burst from the Alban army, while the Roman levies now bade farewell to all their hopes; but not to their anxiety, for they were horror-stricken at the plight of the single warrior whom the three Curiatii had surrounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He happened to have got no hurt, and though no match for his enemies together, was ready to fight them one at a time. So, to divide their attack, he <pb id="p.89"/>fled, thinking that each of them would pursue him<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> with what speed his wounds permitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had already run some little distance from the spot where they had fought, when, looking back, he saw that they were following at wide intervals and that one of them had nearly overtaken him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Facing about, he ran swiftly up to his man, and while the Alban host were calling out to the Curiatii to help their brother, Horatius had already slain him, and was hastening, flushed with victory, to meet his second antagonist. Then with a cheer, such as is often drawn from partisans by a sudden turn in a contest, the Romans encouraged their champion, and he pressed on to end the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so, before the third Curiatius could come up &mdash;and he was not far off &mdash;Horatius dispatched the second.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They were now on even terns, one soldier surviving on each side, but in hope and vigour they were far from equal. The one, unscathed and elated by his double victory, was eager for a third encounter. The other dragged himself along, faint from his wound and exhausted with running; he thought how his brothers had been slaughtered before him, and was a beaten man when he faced his triumphant foe. What followed was no combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman cried exultantly, <quote>Two victims I have given to the shades of my brothers: the third I will offer up to the cause of this war, that Roman may rule Alban.</quote> His adversary could barely hold up his shield.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> With a downward thrust Horatius buried his sword in the Alban's throat, and despoiled him where he lay. The Romans welcomed their hero with jubilations and thanksgivings, and their joy was all the greater that they had come near despairing. The burial of their dead then claimed the attention <pb id="p.91"/>of the two armies, &mdash;with widely different feelings,<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> since one nation was exalted with imperial power, the other made subject to a foreign sway.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The graves may still be seen where each soldier fell: two Roman graves in one spot, nearer Alba; those of the three Albans towards Rome, but separated, just as they had fought.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before they left the field Mettius asked, in pursuance of the compact, what Tullus commanded him to do, and the Roman ordered him to hold his young men under arms, saying that he should employ their services, if war broke out with the Veientes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The armies then marched home. In the van of the Romans came Horatius, displaying his triple spoils. As he drew near the Porta Capena he was met by his unwedded sister, who had been promised in marriage to one of the Curiatii. When she recognized on her brother's shoulders the military cloak of her betrothed, which she herself had woven, she loosed her hair and, weeping, called on her dead lover's name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It enraged the fiery youth to hear his sister's lamentations in the hour of his own victory and the nation's great rejoicing. And so, drawing his sword and at the same time angrily upbraiding her, he ran her through the body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>Begone</quote> he cried, <quote>to your betrothed, with your ill-timed love, since you have forgot your brothers, both the dead and the living, and forgot your country!
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So perish every Roman woman who mourns a foe!</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>Horrid as this deed seemed to the Fathers and the people, his recent service was an off-set to it; nevertheless he was seized and brought before the king for trial. The king, that he might not take upon himself the responsibility for so stern and unpopular a judgement, and for the punishment which must follow <pb id="p.93"/>sentence, called together the council of the people<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> and said: <quote>In accordance with the law I appoint duumvirs to pass judgement upon Horatius for treason.</quote><note>By taking it upon himself to punish his sister, Horatius had usurped a function of the state, and so was guilty of treason.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The dread formula of the law ran thus: <quote>Let the duumvirs pronounce him guilty of treason; if he shall appeal from the duumvirs, let the appeal be tried; if the duumvirs win, let the lictor veil his head; let him bind him with a rope to a barren tree; let him scourge him either within or without the pomerium.</quote><note>I have adopted the view of Oldfather (<hi rend="italics">T.A.P.A.</hi> xxxix. pp. 49 ff.) that neither hanging nor crucifixion is meant, but that the culprit was fastened to the tree and scourged to death.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By the terms of this law duumvirs were appointed. They considered that they might not acquit, under that act, even one who was innocent, and having given a verdict of guilty, one of them pronounced the words, <quote>Publius Horatius, I adjudge you a traitor; go, lictor, bind his hands.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The lictor had approached and was about to fit the noose. Then Horatius, at the prompting of Tullus, who put a merciful construction upon the law, cried, <quote>I appeal!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so the appeal was tried before the people. What influenced men most of all in that trial was the assertion of Publius Horatius, the father, that his daughter had been justly slain; otherwise he should have used a father's authority and have punished his son, himself. He then implored them not to make him childless whom they had beheld a little while before surrounded by a goodly offspring.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So saying, the old man embraced the youth, and pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii set up in the place which is now called <quote>the Horatian Spears,</quote><note>The name of the place which commemorated the spoils reflects the tradition, rejected above by Livy, that the Horatii were Albans, the Curiatii Romans.</note> he exclaimed, <quote>This man you saw but lately advancing <pb id="p.95"/>decked with spoils and triumphing in his victory;<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> can you bear, Quirites, to see him bound beneath a fork and scourged and tortured? Hardly could Alban eyes endure so hideous a sight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Go, lictor, bind the hands which but now, with sword and shield, brought imperial power to the Roman People! Go, veil the head of the liberator of this city! Bind him to a barren tree! Scourge him within the pomerium, if you will &mdash;so it be amidst yonder spears and trophies of our enemies &mdash;or outside the pomerium &mdash;so it be amongst the graves of the Curiatii! For whither can you lead this youth where his own honours will not vindicate him from so foul a punishment?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The people could not withstand the father's tears, or the courage of Horatius himself, steadfast in every peril; and they acquitted him, more in admiration of his valour than from the justice of his cause. And so, that the flagrant murder might yet be cleansed away, by some kind of expiatory rite, the father was commanded to make atonement for his son at the public cost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He therefore offered certain piacular sacrifices, which were thenceforward handed down in the Horatian family, and, erecting a beam across the street, to typify a yoke, he made his son pass under it, with covered head. It remains to this day, being restored from time to time at the state's expense, and is known as <quote>the Sister's Beam.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Horatia's tomb, of hewn stone, was built on the place where she had been struck down.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the peace with Alba did not last long. The discontent of the people, who criticized the dictator for having confided the nation's welfare to three soldiers, broke down his weak character, and since honest measures had proved unsuccessful, <pb id="p.97"/>he resorted to evil ones to regain the favour of his<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> countrymen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, just as in war he had sought peace, so now in time of peace he desired war. But seeing that his own state was richer in courage than in strength, he stirred up other tribes to make war openly after due declaration; while for his own people he reserved the part of the traitor under the disguise of friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The men of Fidenae, a Roman colony, and the Veientes, whom they admitted to a share in their designs, were induced to commence hostilities by a promise that the Albans would go over to their side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Fidenae having openly revolted, Tullus summoned Mettius and his army from Alba, and led his forces against the enemy. Crossing the Anio, he pitched his camp at the confluence of the rivers. The Veientine army had crossed the Tiber between that place and Fidenae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These troops, drawn up next the river, formed the right wing; on the left the Fidenates were posted, nearer the mountains. Tullus marshalled his own men against the Veientine enemy; the Albans he posted opposite the army of Fidenae. The Alban commander was as wanting in courage as in loyalty. Not daring, therefore, either to hold his ground or openly to desert, he drew off by imperceptible degrees in the direction of the mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, when he thought he had got near enough to them, he brought up his whole battle-line to an elevated position, and still irresolute, deployed his ranks with the object of consuming time. His purpose was to swing his forces to the side which fortune favoured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first the Romans posted next to the Albans were amazed when they perceived that their flank was being uncovered by the withdrawal of their allies; then a <pb id="p.99"/>horseman galloped up to the king, and told him that<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> the Albans were marching off. In this crisis Tullus vowed to establish twelve Salian priests,<note>These were the so-called <hi rend="italics">Collini,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Agonales,</hi> and were associated with Quirinus, as the <hi rend="italics">Palatini</hi> (chap. xx.) were with Mars Gradivus. See also v. lii. 7.</note> and to build shrines to Pallor and Panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The horseman he reprimanded in a loud voice, that the enemy might overhear him, and ordered him to go back and fight; there was no occasion for alarm; it was by his own command that the Alban army was marching round, that they might attack the unprotected rear of the Fidenates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He also ordered the cavalry to raise their spears. This man&oelig;uvre hid the retreat of the Alban army from a large part of the Roman foot-soldiers; those who had seen it, believing what the king had been heard to say, fought all the more impetuously. The enemy in their turn now became alarmed; they had heard Tullus's loud assertion, and many of the Fidenates, having had Romans among them as colonists, knew Latin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so, lest the Albans should suddenly charge down from the hills and cut them off from their town, they beat a retreat. Tullus pressed them hard, and having routed the wing composed of the Fidenates, returned, bolder than ever, to the Veientes, who were demoralized by the panic of their neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They, too, failed to withstand his attack, but their rout was stopped by the river in their rear When they had fled thus far, some basely threw away their arms and rushed blindly into the water, others hesitated on the bank and were overtaken before they had made up their minds whether to flee or resist. Never before had the Romans fought a bloodier battle.
				</p> <pb id="p.101"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the Alban army, which had been a<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> spectator of the battle, was led down into the plain. Mettius congratulated Tullus on the conquest of his enemies; Tullus replied kindly to Mettius, and commanded the Albans in a good hour to join their camp to that of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then made preparations to perform, on the morrow, a sacrifice of purification. At dawn, when all things were in readiness, he issued to both armies the customary order, convoking them to an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The heralds, beginning at the outskirts of the camp, called out the Albans first, who being moved by the very novelty of the occasion, took their stand close to the Roman king, that they might hear him harangue his army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Roman troops, by previous arrangement, were armed and disposed around them, and the centurions were bidden to execute orders promptly. Then Tullus began as follows:
				</p> 
				<p><quote>Romans, if ever anywhere in any war you have had reason to give thanks, first to the immortal gods and then to your own valour, it was in the battle of yesterday. For you fought not only against your enemies, but a harder and more dangerous fight &mdash;against the treachery and the perfidy of your allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For, to undeceive you, I gave no orders that the Albans should draw off towards the mountains. What you heard was not my command, but a trick and a pretended command, devised in order that you might not know you were being deserted, and so be distracted from the fight; and that the enemy, thinking that they were being hemmed in on the rear, might be panic-stricken and flee.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And yet this guilt which I am charging does not attach to all the Albans; they but followed <pb id="p.103"/>their general, as you, too, would have done, had I<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> desired to lead you off anywhere. It is Mettius yonder who led this march; Mettius, too, who contrived this war; Mettius who broke the treaty between Roman and Alban.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let another dare such a deed hereafter if I do not speedily visit such a punishment on him as shall be a conspicuous warning to all mankind.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>Thereupon the centurions, sword in hand, surrounded Mettius, while the king proceeded: <quote>May prosperity, favour, and fortune be with the Roman people and myself, and with you, men of Alba! I purpose to bring all the Alban people over to Rome, to grant citizenship to their commons, to enroll the nobles in the senate, to make one city and one state. As formerly from one people the Alban nation was divided into two, so now let it be reunited into one.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Hearing these words the Alban soldiers, themselves unarmed and fenced in by armed men, were constrained, however their wishes might differ, by a common fear, and held their peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then Tullus said: <quote>Mettius Fufetius, if you were capable of learning, yourself, to keep faith and abide by treaties, you should have lived that I might teach you this; as it is, since your disposition is incurable, you shall yet by your punishment teach the human race to hold sacred the obligations you have violated.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly, just as a little while ago your heart was divided between the states of Fidenae and Rome, so now you shall give up your body to be torn two ways,</quote> He then brought up two four-horse chariots, and caused Mettius to be stretched out and made fast to them, after which the horses were whipped up in opposite directions, and bore off in <pb id="p.105"/>each of the cars fragments of the mangled body,<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> where the limbs held to their fastenings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> All eyes were turned away from so dreadful a sight. Such was the first and last punishment among the Romans of a kind that disregards the laws of humanity. In other cases we may boast that with no nation have milder punishments found favour.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on, horsemen had already been sent on to Alba to fetch the inhabitants to Rome, and afterwards the legions were marched over to demolish the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they entered the gates there was not, indeed, the tumult and panic which usually follow the capture of a city, when its gates have been forced or its walls breached with a ram or its stronghold stormed, when the shouts of the enemy and the rush of armed men through the streets throw the whole town into a wild confusion of blood and fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But at Alba oppressive silence and grief that found no words quite overwhelmed the spirits of all the people; too dismayed to think what they should take with them and what leave behind, they would ask each other's advice again and again, now standing on their thresholds, and now roaming aimlessly through the houses they were to look upon for that last time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when at length the horsemen began to be urgent, and clamorously commanded them to come out; when they could now hear the crash of the buildings which were being pulled down in the outskirts of the city; when the dust rising in different quarters had overcast the sky like a gathering cloud; then everybody made haste to carry out what he could, and forth they went, abandoning their lares and penates,<note>Each family had its <hi rend="italics">lar,</hi> a special deity who protected the household, and its <hi rend="italics">penates,</hi> guardians of the <hi rend="italics">penus</hi> (the family store of provisions).</note> and the houses where they had been born and brought up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now the streets were filled with an unbroken <pb id="p.107"/>procession of emigrants, whose mutual pity, as they<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> gazed at one another, caused their tears to start afresh; plaintive cries too began to be heard, proceeding chiefly from the women, when they passed the venerable temples beset by armed men, and left in captivity, as it seemed to them, their gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the Albans had quitted the city, the Romans everywhere levelled with the ground all buildings, both public and private, and a single hour gave over to destruction and desolation the work of the four hundred years during which Alba had stood. But the temples of the gods were spared, for so the king had decreed.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rome, meanwhile, was increased by Alba's downfall. The number of citizens was doubled, the Caelian Hill was added to the City, and, that it might be more thickly settled, Tullus chose it for the site of the king's house and from that time onwards resided there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The chief men of the Albans he made senators, that this branch of the nation might grow too. Such were the Julii, the Servilii, the Quinctii, the Geganii, the Curiatii, and the Cloelii. He also built, as a consecrated place for the order he had enlarged, a senate-house, which continued to be called the Curia Hostilia as late as the time of our own fathers.<note>When Clodius was murdered, in <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date>, the mob burnt his body in the Curia Hostilia, which caught fire and was destroyed.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And that all the orders might gain some strength from the new people, he enrolled ten squadrons of knights<note>Each squadron contained thirty men. The total number was, therefore, the same as that of the three centuries of Romulus.</note> from among the Albans, and from the same source filled up the old legions and enlisted new ones.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Confiding in these forces, Tullus declared war on <pb id="p.109"/>the Sabines, a nation second only at that time to<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> the Etruscans in its wealth of men and arms. On either side there had been aggressions and refusals to grant satisfaction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Tullus complained that at the shrine of Feronia, in a crowded fair, Roman traders had been seized; the Sabines alleged that, before this, refugees from their country had fled to the grove of sanctuary, and had been detained in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These were put forward as the causes of war. The Sabines, not forgetting that a portion of their own forces had been settled in Rome by Tatius and that the Roman state had recently been further strengthened by the addition of the Alban people, began themselves to look about for outside help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Etruria was close by, and the nearest of the Etruscans were the Veientes. There the resentment left over from the wars was the strongest incentive to revolt, and procured them some volunteers; while with certain vagrant and poverty-stricken plebeians even the prospect of pay was effectual. Official aid there was none, and the Veientes (for there is less to surprise us in the others) held firmly to the truce they had agreed upon with Romulus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While preparations for war were making on both sides with the greatest energy, and success appeared to hinge upon which should first take the field, Tullus anticipated his enemies and invaded the Sabine country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A desperate battle was fought near the Silva Malitiosa,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> <quote>Guileful Wood.</quote></note> where, owing partly, it is true, to the strength of their infantry, but most of all to their newly augmented cavalry, the Roman army gained the mastery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The cavalry made a sudden charge; the ranks of the Sabines were thrown into disorder, and from that moment were unable, without heavy loss, either to hold their own in the fight or to extricate themselves by a retreat.
				</p> <pb id="p.111"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the defeat of the Sabines, when<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> King Tullus and the entire Roman state were at a high pitch of glory and prosperity, it was reported to the king and senators that there had been a rain of stones on the Alban Mount.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As this could scarce be credited, envoys were dispatched to examine the prodigy, and in their sight there fell from the sky, like hail-stones which the wind piles in drifts upon the ground, a shower of pebbles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They thought too that they heard a mighty voice issuing from the grove on the mountain-top, which commanded the Albans to celebrate, according to the fashion of their fathers, the sacrifices, which as though they had forsaken their gods along with their city, they had given over to oblivion, either adopting Roman rites, or in anger at their fortune, such as men sometimes feel, abandoning the worship of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans also, in consequence of the same portent, undertook an official nine days' celebration, whether so commanded by the divine utterance from the Alban Mount &mdash;for this too is handed down &mdash;or on the advice of soothsayers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At all events it remained a regular custom that whenever the same prodigy was reported there should be a nine days' observance.
				</p> 
				<p>Not very long after this Rome was afflicted with a pestilence. This caused a reluctance to bear arms, yet no respite from service was allowed by the warlike king (who believed, besides, that the young men were healthier in the field than at home) until he himself contracted a lingering illness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then that haughty spirit was so broken, with the breaking of his health, that he who had hitherto thought nothing less worthy of a king than to devote his mind to sacred rites, suddenly became a prey to all sorts of <pb id="p.113"/>superstitions great and small, and filled even the<note type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> minds of the people with religious scruples.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Men were now agreed in wishing to recall the conditions which had obtained under King Numa, believing that the only remedy left for their ailing bodies was to procure peace and forgiveness from the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The king himself, so tradition tells, in turning over the commentaries of Numa discovered there certain occult sacrifices performed in honour of Jupiter Elicius, and devoted himself in secret to those rites; but the ceremony was improperly undertaken or performed, and not only was no divine manifestation vouchsafed him, but in consequence of the wrath of Jupiter, who was provoked by his faulty observance, he was struck by a thunderbolt and consumed in the flames of his house. Tullus was greatly renowned in war and reigned thirty-two years.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the death of Tullus, the government<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> reverted, in accordance with the custom established in the beginning, to the senators, who named an interrex. This official called together the comitia, and the people elected Ancus Marcius king, a choice which the Fathers ratified. Ancus Marcius was a grandson, on the mother's side, of King Numa Pompilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he began to rule he was mindful of his grandfather's glory, and considered that the last reign, excellent in all else, had failed to prosper in one respect, owing to neglect or misconduct of religious observances. Deeming it therefore a matter of the utmost consequence to perform the state sacrifices as Numa had established them, he bade the pontifex copy out all these from the commentaries of the king and display them in public on a whitened table. This act led the citizens, who were eager for peace, <pb id="p.115"/>and also the neighbouring nations, to hope that he<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> would adopt the character and institutions of his grandfather.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hence the Latins, with whom a treaty had been made in the time of Tullus, plucked up courage, and raided Roman territory, and when called on by the Romans to make restitution, returned an arrogant answer, persuaded that the Roman king would spend his reign in inactivity amid shrines and altars. But the character of Ancus was well balanced, and he honoured the memory of Romulus, as well as Numa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And besides having a conviction that peace had been more necessary to his grandfather's reign, when the nation had been both young and mettlesome, he also believed that the tranquillity, so free of attack, which had fallen to the lot of Numa would be no easy thing for himself to compass; his patience was being tried, and when proved would be regarded with contempt, and in short the times were better suited to the rule of a Tullus than a Numa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In order however that, as Numa had instituted religious practices in time of peace, he might himself give out a ceremonial of war, and that wars might not only be waged but also declared with some sort of formality, he copied from the ancient tribe of the Aequicoli the law, which the fetials now have,<note>The institution of the fetials was ascribed in chap. xxiv. to Tullus (so also Cic. <hi rend="italics">Rep.</hi> ii. 31). Livy is here following another authority, without taking the trouble to remove the discrepancy. Other writers (Dion. ii. 72; Plut. <hi rend="italics">Numa</hi> xii.) credit Numa with the institution.</note> by which redress is demanded.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the envoy has arrived at the frontiers of the people from whom satisfaction is sought, he covers his head with a bonnet &mdash;the covering is of wool &mdash;and says: <quote>Hear, Jupiter; hear, ye boundaries of</quote> &mdash;naming whatever nation they belong to; &mdash;<quote>let righteousness hear!
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I am the public herald of the Roman People; I come duly and religiously commissioned; let my words be credited,</quote> Then he <pb id="p.117"/>recites his demands, after which he takes Jupiter to<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> witness: <quote>If I demand unduly and against religion that these men and these things be surrendered to me, then let me never enjoy my native land.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These words he rehearses when he crosses the boundary line, the same to what man soever first meets him, the same when he enters the city gates, the same when he has come into the market-place, with only a few changes in the form and wording of the oath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If those whom he demands are not surrendered, at the end of three and thirty days &mdash;for such is the conventional number &mdash;he declares war thus: <quote>Hear, Jupiter, and thou, Janus Quirinus, and hear all heavenly gods, and ye, gods of earth, and ye of the lower world; I call you to witness that this people</quote> &mdash;naming whatever people it is &mdash;<quote>is unjust, and does not make just reparation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But of these matters we will take counsel of the elders in our country, how we may obtain our right.</quote> Then the messenger returns to Rome for the consultation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Immediately the king would consult the Fathers, in some such words as these: <quote>Touching the things, the suits, the causes, concerning which the <hi rend="italics">pater patratus</hi> of the Roman People of the Quirites has made demands on the <hi rend="italics">pater patratus</hi> of the Ancient Latins, and upon the men of the Ancient Latins, which things they have not delivered, nor fulfilled, nor satisfied, being things which ought to have been delivered, fulfilled, and satisfied, speak,</quote> &mdash;turning to the man whose opinion he was wont to ask first, &mdash; <quote>what think you?</quote> Then the other would reply: <quote>I hold that those things ought to be sought in warfare just and righteous; and so I consent and vote.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The others were then asked the question, in their order, and when the majority <pb id="p.119"/>of those present went over to the same opinion, war<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> had been agreed upon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It was customary for the fetial to carry to the bounds of the other nation a cornet-wood spear, iron-pointed or hardened in the fire, and in the presence of not less than three grown men to say: <quote>Whereas the tribes of the Ancient Latins and men of the Ancient Latins have been guilty of acts and offences against the Roman People of the Quirites; and whereas the Roman People of the Quirites has commanded that war be made on the Ancient Latins, and the Senate of the Roman People has approved, agreed, and voted a war with the Ancient Latins; I therefore and the Roman People declare and make war on the tribes of the Ancient Latins and the men of the Ancient Latins.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Having said this, he would hurl his spear into their territory. This is the manner in which at that time redress was sought from the Latins and war was declared, and the custom has been received by later generations.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ancus delegated the care of the sacrifices to the flamens and other priests, and having enlisted a new army proceeded to Politorium, one of the Latin cities. He took this place by storm, and adopting the plan of former kings, who had enlarged the state by making her enemies citizens, transferred the whole population to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Palatine was the quarter of the original Romans; on the one hand were the Sabines, who had the Capitol and the Citadel; on the other lay the Caelian, occupied by the Albans. The Aventine was therefore assigned to the newcomers, and thither too were sent shortly afterwards the citizens recruited from the captured towns of Tellenae and Ficana.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Politorium was then attacked <pb id="p.121"/>a second time, for having been left empty it had been<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> seized by the Ancient Latins, and this gave the Romans an excuse for razing the town, lest it should serve continually as a refuge for their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the end the Latin levies were all forced back upon Medullia, where for some time the fighting was indecisive and victory shifted from one side to the other; for the city was protected by fortifications and was defended by a strong garrison, and from their camp in the open plain the Latin army several times came to close quarters with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At last, throwing all his troops into the struggle, Ancus succeeded first in defeating the enemy's army, and then in capturing the town, whence he returned to Rome enriched with immense spoils. On this occasion also many thousands of Latins were granted citizenship. These people, in order that the Aventine might be connected with the Palatine, were made to settle in the region of the Altar of Murcia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Janiculum was also annexed to the city, not from any lack of room, but lest it might some day become a stronghold of Rome's enemies. It was decided not only to fortify it, but also to connect it with the City, for greater ease in passing to and fro, by a bridge of piles, the first bridge ever built over the Tiber.<note>This was the famous Pons Sublicius, <quote>Pile Bridge,</quote> made of wood, without metal of any sort.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Quirites' Ditch also, no small protection on the more level and accessible side of town, was the work of King Ancus.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When these enormous additions to the community had been effected, it was found that in so great a multitude the distinction between right and wrong had become obscured, and crimes were being secretly committed. Accordingly, to overawe men's growing lawlessness, a prison was built in <pb id="p.123"/>the midst of the city, above the Forum.<note>This prison, <hi rend="italics">the</hi> Carcer, may still be seen at the foot of the Capitoline, between the Temple of Concord and the Curia. It is thought to be as old as any structure in Rome. It was used as a place of detention and execution for condemned criminals.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> this reign was a period of growth, not only for the City, but also for her lands and boundaries. The Maesian Forest was taken from the Veientes, extending Rome's dominion clear to the sea; at the Tiber's mouth the city of Ostia was founded, and salt-works were established near-by; while in recognition of signal success in war the temple of Jupiter Feretrius was enlarged.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the reign of Ancus one Lucumo, a man of energy and wealth, took up his residence in Rome, chiefly from ambition and the hope that he might there achieve a station such as he had found no opportunity of attaining in Tarquinii; for though he had been born there himself, his race was alien to that place also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was the son of Demaratus of Corinth, who had been driven from home by a political upheaval. Happening to settle in Tarquinii, he had married there and had two sons, named Lucumo and Arruns. Lucumo survived his father and inherited all his property; Arruns died before his father, leaving his wife with child.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Demaratus did not long survive Arruns, and, unaware that his son's wife was to become a mother, he died without making provision for his grandson in his will. When the babe was born his grandfather was dead, and having no share in the inheritance, he was given the name of Egerius,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> <quote>Necessitous.</quote></note> in consequence of his penniless condition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lucumo, on the other hand, was heir to the whole estate. The self-confidence implanted in his bosom by his wealth was heightened by his marriage with Tanaquil, who was a woman of the most exalted birth, and not of a character lightly to endure a humbler rank in her new environment than she had <pb id="p.125"/>enjoyed in the condition to which she had been born.<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Etruscans looked with disdain on Lucumo, the son of a banished man and a stranger. She could not endure this indignity, and forgetting the love she owed her native land, if she could only see her husband honoured, she formed the project of emigrating from Tarquinii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Rome appeared to be the most suitable place for her purpose; amongst a new people, where all rank was of sudden growth and founded on worth, there would be room for a brave and strenuous man; the City had been ruled by Tatius the Sabine, it had summoned Numa to the sovereignty from Cures, even Ancus was the son of a Sabine mother, and could point to no noble ancestor but Numa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> She had no trouble in persuading a man who was eager for distinction, to whom Tarquinii was only his mother's birthplace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They therefore gathered their possessions together and removed to Rome. They had come, as it happened, as far as Janiculum, when, as they were sitting in their covered waggon, an eagle poised on its wings gently descended upon them and plucked off Lucumo's cap, after which, rising noisily above the car and again stooping, as if sent from heaven for that service, it deftly replaced the cap upon his head, and departed on high.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This augury was joyfully accepted, it is said, by Tanaquil, who was a woman skilled in celestial prodigies, as was the case with most Etruscans. Embracing her husband, she bade him expect transcendent greatness: such was the meaning of that bird, appearing from that quarter of the sky, and bringing tidings from that god; the highest part of the man had been concerned in the omen; the eagle had removed the adornment placed upon a mortal's head that it might <pb id="p.127"/>restore it with the divine approbation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Such were<note type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> their hopes and their reflections as they entered the City. Having obtained a house, they gave out the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Romans regarded him with special interest, as a stranger and a man of wealth, and he steadily pushed his fortune by his own exertions, making friends wherever possible, by kind words, courteous hospitality, and benefactions, until his reputation extended even to the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had not long been known in this way to the king before the liberality and adroitness of his services procured him the footing of an intimate friend. He was now consulted in matters both of public and private importance, in time of war and in time of peace, and having been tested in every way was eventually even named in the king's will as guardian of his children.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ancus reigned four and twenty years, a<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> king inferior to none of his predecessors in the arts of peace and war and in the reputation they conferred. By this time his sons were nearly grown. Tarquinius was therefore all the more insistent in urging that the comitia should be held without delay to choose a king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the meeting had been proclaimed, and the day drew near, he sent the boys away on a hunting expedition. Tarcuinius was the first, they say, to canvass votes for the kingship and to deliver a speech designed to win the favour of the commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He pointed out that it; was no new thing he sought; he was not the first outsider to aim at the sovereignty in Rome &mdash;a thing which might have occasioned indignation and astonishment, &mdash;but the third. Tatius indeed, had been not merely an alien but an enemy when he was made king; while Numa was a stranger <pb id="p.129"/>to the City, and, far from seeking the kingship, had<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> actually been invited to come and take it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for himself, he had no sooner become his own master than he had removed to Rome with his wife and all his property. For the greater part of that period of life during which men serve the state he had lived in Rome, and not in the city of his birth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both in civil life and in war he had had no mean instructor &mdash;King Ancus himself had taught him Roman laws and Roman rites. In subordination and deference to the king he had vied, he said, with all his hearers; in generosity to his fellow-subjects he had emulated the king himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hearing him advance these not unwarranted claims, the people, with striking unanimity, named him king. The result was that the man, so admirable in all other respects, continued even after he had obtained the sovereignty to manifest the same spirit of intrigue which had governed him in seeking it; and being no less concerned to strengthen his own power than to enlarge the state, he added a hundred members to the senate, who were known thenceforward as Fathers of the <quote>lesser families,</quote> and formed a party of unwavering loyalty to the king, to whom they owed their admission to the Curia.<note>The senate had doubtless shown its disapproval of the accession of Tarquinius, who now sought to render its opposition futile by doubling the membership and appointing none but his own supporters.</note>
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>His first war was with the Latins, whose town of Apiolae he took by storm. Returning thence with more booty than the rumours about the war had led people to expect, he exhibited games on a more splendid and elaborate scale than former kings had done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was then that the ground was first marked out for the circus now called Maximus. Places were divided amongst the Fathers and the knights where they might each make seats for themselves; these were called 'rows.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They got their view from seats <pb id="p.131"/>raised on props to a height of twelve feet from the<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> ground. The entertainment was furnished by horses and boxers, imported for the most part from Etruria. From that time the Games continued to be a regular annual show, and were called indifferently the Roman and the Great Games.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was the same king, too, who apportioned building sites about the Forum among private citizens, and erected covered walks and booths.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He was also preparing to build a stone wall around the City, when a Sabine war interrupted his plans. And so sudden was the invasion, that they had crossed the Anio before the Roman army was able to march out and stop them, so that the City was thrown into a panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The first battle was indecisive, with heavy losses on both sides. The enemy then withdrew into their camp, affording the Romans an opportunity to renew their preparations for the war. Tarquinius believed that cavalry was what he chiefly lacked. To the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, the centuries which Romulus had enrolled, he therefore determined to add others, and to give them his own name as a permanent distinction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since this was a matter in which Romulus had obtained the sanction of augury before acting, it was asserted by Attus Navius, a famous augur of those days, that no change or innovation could be introduced unless the birds had signified their approval.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king's ire was aroused by this, and he is reported to have said, in derision of the science, <quote>Come now, divine seer! Inquire of your augury if that of which I am now thinking can come to pass.</quote> When Attus, having taken the auspices, replied that it would surely come to pass, the king said, <quote>Nay, but this is <pb id="p.133"/>what I was thinking of, that you should cleave a<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> whetstone with a razor. Take them, and accomplish what your birds declare is possible!</quote> Whereupon, they say, the augur, without a sign of hesitation, cut the whetstone in two.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was a statue of Attus standing, with his head covered, on the spot where the thing was done, in the comitium, even at the steps on the left of the senate-house; tradition adds that the whetstone also was deposited in the same place, to be a memorial of that miracle to posterity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> However this may be, auguries and the augural priesthood so increased in honour that nothing was afterwards done, in the field or at home, unless the auspices had first been taken: popular assemblies, musterings of the army, acts of supreme importance &mdash;all were put off when the birds refused their consent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Neither did Tarquinius at that time make any change in the organization of the centuries of knights. Their numerical strength he doubled, so that there were now eighteen hundred knights, in three centuries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But though enrolled under the old names, the new men were called the <quote>secondary knights,</quote> and the centuries are now, because doubled, known as the <quote>six centuries.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this arm of the service had been enlarged, a second battle was fought with the Sabines. And in this, besides being increased in strength, the Roman army was further helped by a stratagem, for men were secretly dispatched to light a great quantity of firewood lying on the bank of the Anio, and throw it into the river. A favouring wind set the wood in a blaze, and the greater part of it lodged against the boats and piles, where it stuck fast and <pb id="p.135"/>set the bridge on fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was another source of<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> alarm to the Sabines during the battle, and upon their being routed the same thing hindered their flight, so that many of them escaped the Romans only to perish in the stream; while their shields floated down the Tiber toward the City, and, being recognized, gave assurance that a victory had been won almost sooner than the news of it could be brought.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this battle the cavalry particularly distinguished themselves. They were posted on either flank of the Romans, and when the centre, composed of infantry, was already in retreat, they are said to have charged from both sides, with such effect that they not only checked the Sabine forces, which were pressing hotly forward as their enemy gave way, but suddenly put them to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Sabines made for the mountains in a scattered rout, and indeed a few gained that refuge. Most of them, as has been said before, were driven by the cavalry into the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Tarquinius thought it proper to follow up his victory while the other side was panic-stricken; he therefore sent the booty and the prisoners to Rome, and after making a huge pile of the captured arms and setting fire to it, in fulfilment of a vow to Vulcan, pushed forward at the head of his army into the enemy's country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although defeat had been the portion of the Sabines, and another battle could not be expected to result in better success, still, as the situation allowed no room for deliberation, they took the field with what soldiers they could hastily muster, and being then routed a second time and fairly reduced to extremities, they sued for peace.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Collatia, and what land the Sabines had on the hither side of Collatia, was taken from <pb id="p.137"/>them, and Egerius, the son of the king's brother, was<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> left in the town with a garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The surrender of the Collatini took place, I understand, in accordance with this formula: the king asked, <quote>Are you the legates and spokesmen sent by the People of Collatia to surrender yourselves and the People of Collatia?</quote> <quote>We are.</quote> <quote>Is the People of Collatia its own master?</quote> <quote>It is.</quote> <quote>Do you surrender yourselves and the People of Collatia, city, lands, water, boundary marks, shrines, utensils, all appurtenances, divine and human, into my power and that of the Roman People?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>We do.</quote> <quote>I receive the surrender.</quote> Upon the conclusion of the Sabine war Tarquinius returned to Rome and triumphed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then made war against the Ancient Latins. In this campaign there was no general engagement at any point, but the king led his army from one town to another until he had subdued the entire Latin race. Corniculum, Ficulea Vetus, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum &mdash;these were the towns which were captured from the Ancient Latins, or from those who had gone over to the Latins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Peace was then made.
				</p> 
				<p>From that moment the king devoted himself to peaceful undertakings with an enthusiasm which was even greater than the efforts he had expended in waging war, so that there was no more rest for the people at home than there had been in the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For he set to work to encircle the hitherto unfortified parts of the City with a stone wall, a task which had been interrupted by the Sabine war; and he drained the lowest parts of the City, about the Forum, and the other valleys between the hills, which were too flat to carry off the flood-waters easily, by means of sewers so made as to slope down toward the Tiber.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <pb id="p.139"/>Finally, with prophetic anticipation of the splendour<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> which the place was one day to possess, he laid foundations for the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, which he had vowed in the Sabine war.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time there happened in the house of the king a portent which was remarkable alike in its manifestation and in its outcome. The story is that while a child named Servius Tullius lay sleeping, his head burst into flames in the sight of many.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The general outcry which so great a miracle called forth brought the king and queen to the place. One of the servants fetched water to quench the fire, but was checked by the queen, who stilled the uproar and commanded that the boy should not be disturbed until he awoke of himself. Soon afterwards sleep left him, and with it disappeared the flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, taking her husband aside, Tanaquil said: <quote>Do you see this child whom we are bringing up in so humble a fashion? Be assured he will one day be a lamp to our dubious fortunes, and a protector to the royal house in the day of its distress. Let us therefore rear with all solicitude one who will lend high renown to the state and to our family.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is said that from that moment the boy began to be looked upon as a son, and to be trained in the studies by which men are inspired to bear themselves greatly. It was a thing easily accomplished, being the will of Heaven. The youth turned out to be of a truly royal nature, and when Tarquinius sought a son-in-law there was no other young Roman who could be at all compared to Servius; and the king accordingly betrothed his daughter to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This great honour, for whatever cause conferred on him, forbids us to suppose that <pb id="p.141"/>his mother was a slave and that he himself had been<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> in a state of servitude as a child. I am rather of the opinion of those who say, that on the capture of Corniculum, when Servius Tullius, the chief man of that city, had been slain, his wife, who was great with child, had been recognized amongst the other captive women, and on the score of her unique nobility had been rescued from slavery by the Roman queen, and had brought forth her child at Rome in the house of Priscus Tarquinius;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> in the sequel this act of generosity led to a growing intimacy between the women, and the boy, as one reared from childhood in the palace, was held in affection and esteem; it was his mother's misfortune, who by the capture of her native town came into the power of its enemies, which gave rise to the belief that Servius was born of a slave woman.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now about thirty-eight years since Tarquinius had begun to reign, and not only the king, but the Fathers and the commons too, held Servius Tullius in the very highest honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Now the two sons of Ancus had always considered it a great outrage that they had been ousted from their father's kingship by the crime of their guardian, and that Rome should be ruled by a stranger whose descent was derived from a race not only remote but actually not even Italian.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But their indignation was vastly increased by the prospect that even after Tarquinius' death the sovereignty would not revert to them, but, plunging down to yet baser depths, would fall into the hands of slaves; so that where, a hundred years before, Romulus, a god's son and himself a god, had borne sway, so long as he remained on earth, in that self-same state a slave and <pb id="p.143"/>the son of a slave woman would be king. It would<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> be not only a general disgrace to the Roman name, but particularly to their own house, if during the lifetime of Ancus' sons it should be open not only to strangers, but even to slaves to rule over the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They therefore determined to repel that insult with the sword. But resentment at their wrong urged them rather against Tarquinius himself than against Servius, not only because the king, if he survived, would be more formidable to avenge the murder than a subject would be, but because if Servius should be dispatched it seemed probable that the kingdom would be inherited by whomsoever else Tarquinius might choose to be his son-in-law. For these reasons they laid their plot against the king himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Two very desperate shepherds were selected to do the deed. Armed with the rustic implements to which they were both accustomed, they feigned a brawl in the entrance-court of the palace and, making as much noise as possible, attracted the attention of all the royal attendants; then they appealed to the king, until their shouts were heard inside the palace and they were sent for and came before him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first each raised his voice and tried to shout the other down. Being repressed by the lictor and bidden to speak in turn, they finally ceased to interrupt each other, and one of them began to state his case, as they had planned beforehand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While the king, intent upon the speaker, turned quite away from the other shepherd, the latter lifted his axe and brought it down upon his head. Then, leaving the weapon in the wound, they both ran out of doors.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dying Tarquinius had hardly been caught <pb id="p.145"/>up in the arms of the bystanders when the fugitives<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> were seized by the lictors. Then there was an uproar, as crowds hurried to the scene, asking one another in amazement what the matter was. In the midst of the tumult Tanaquil gave orders to close the palace, and ejected all witnesses. She busily got together the remedies needful for healing a wound, as if there were still hope, taking at the same time other measures to protect herself in case her hope should fail her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having hastily summoned Servius, she showed him her husband's nearly lifeless body, and grasping his right hand, besought him not to suffer the death of his father-in-law to go unpunished, nor his mother-in-law to become a jest to her enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>To you, Servius,</quote> she cried, <quote>if you are a man, belongs this kingdom, not to those who by the hands of others have committed a dastardly crime. Arouse yourself and follow the guidance of the gods, who once declared by the token of divine fire poured out upon this head that you should be a famous man. Now is the time for that heaven-sent flame to quicken you! Now wake in earnest! We, too, were foreigners, yet we reigned. Consider what you are, not whence you were born. If your own counsels are benumbed in this sudden crisis, at least use mine.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the shouting and pushing of the crowd could hardly be withstood, Tanaquil went up into the upper storey of the house, and through a window looking out upon the Nova Via &mdash;for the king lived near the temple of Jupiter the Stayer &mdash; addressed the populace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> She bade them be of good cheer: the king had been stunned by a sudden blow; the steel had not sunk deep into his body; he had already recovered consciousness; the blood had been <pb id="p.147"/>wiped away and the wound examined; all the<note type="margin">B.C. 616-578</note> symptoms were favourable; she trusted that they would soon see Tarquinius himself; meanwhile she commanded that the people should obey Servius Tullius, who would dispense justice and perform the other duties of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Servius went forth in the royal robe, accompanied by lictors, and sitting in the king's seat rendered judgment in some cases, while in regard to others he gave out that he would consult the king. In this way for several days after Tarquinius had breathed his last he concealed his death, pretending that he was merely doing another's work, while he was really strengthening his own position; then at last the truth was allowed to be known, from the lamentations which arose within the palace. Servius surrounded himself with a strong guard, and ruled at first without the authorization of the people, but with the consent of the Fathers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The sons of Ancus, upon the arrest of the agents of their crime and the report that the king was alive and that Servius was so strong, had already gone into voluntary exile at Suessa Pometia.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Servius now took steps to assure his<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> position by private as well as public measures. In order that the sons of Tarquinius might not show the same animosity towards himself which the sons of Ancus had felt towards Tarquinius, he married his two daughters to the young princes, Lucius and Arruns Tarquinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But he could not break the force of destiny by human wisdom; and jealousy of his power, even among the members of his household, created an atmosphere of treachery and hostility. Most opportune for the tranquil preservation <pb id="p.149"/>of the existing state of things was a war which was<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> undertaken against the people of Veii &mdash;for the truce<note>Perhaps a reference to the hundred years' truce with Romulus (xv. 5), for Livy has not mentioned any war with Veii in the interval, though one is implied in the statement (xxxiii. 9) that the Veientes surrendered the Maesian Forest, in the reign of Ancus.</note> had now run out &mdash;and the other Etruscans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this war the bravery and good fortune of Tullius were conspicuous; and when he had utterly defeated the vast army of his enemies, he found on returning to Rome that his title to the kingship was no longer questioned, whether he tested the feeling of the Fathers or that of the commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then addressed himself to what is by far the most important work of peace: as Numa had established religious law, so Servius intended that posterity should celebrate himself as the originator of all distinctions among the citizens, and of the orders which clearly differentiate the various grades of rank and fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For he instituted the census,<note>The organisation now to be described was primarily designed to increase the fighting strength of Rome. Formerly the right to bear arms had belonged solely to the patricians. Now plebeians were to be given a place in the army, which was to be reclassified according to every man's property, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> his ability to provide himself a more or less complete equipment for the field. See Dion. Hal. iv. 16-21; Cic. <hi rend="italics">Rep.</hi> ii. 39.</note> a most useful thing for a government destined to such wide dominion, since it would enable the burdens of war and peace to be borne not indiscriminately, as heretofore, but in proportion to men's wealth. He then distributed the people into classes and centuries according to the following scale, which was based upon the census and was suitable either for peace or war: 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Out of those who had a rating of a hundred thousand assess<note>Capital, not income. The <hi rend="italics">as</hi> was originally a rod of copper a foot long and divided into twelve inches (<hi rend="italics">unciae</hi>). Some time during the regal period weight was substituted for measure in appraising the <hi rend="italics">as,</hi> and it began to be stamped with the figure of an ox, which was the source of the Latin name for money, viz. <hi rend="italics">pecunia.</hi> From being a full pound the <hi rend="italics">as</hi> was gradually reduced, till, in the Second Punic War, it came to weigh only one ounce. What its value may have been in the time of Servius is a highly speculative question. See the note in the edition of Book I. by H. J. Edwards (pp. 179 ff.).</note> or more he made eighty <pb id="p.151"/>centuries, forty each of seniors and of juniors; these<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> were all known as the first class; the seniors were to be ready to guard the city, the juniors to wage war abroad.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The armour which these men were required to provide consisted of helmet, round shield, greaves, and breast-plate, all of bronze, for the protection of their bodies; their offensive weapons were a spear and a sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were added to this class two centuries of mechanics, who were to serve without arms; to them was entrusted the duty of fashioning siege-engines in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The second class was drawn up out of those whose rating was between a hundred thousand and seventy-five thousand; of these, seniors and juniors, twenty centuries were enrolled. The arms prescribed for them were an oblong shield in place of the round one, and everything else, save for the breast-plate, as in the class above.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He fixed the rating of the third class at fifty thousand; a like number of centuries was formed in this class as in the second, and with the same distinction of ages; neither was any change made in their arms, except that the greaves were omitted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the fourth class the rating was twenty-five thousand; the same number of centuries was formed, but their equipment was changed, nothing being given them but a spear and a javelin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fifth class was made larger, and thirty centuries were formed. These men carried slings, with stones for missiles. Rated with them were the horn-blowers and trumpeters, divided into two centuries. Eleven thousand was the rating of this class.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those who were assessed at less than this amount, being all the rest of the population, were made into a single century, exempt from military service. When the <pb id="p.153"/>equipment and distribution of the infantry had been<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> thus provided for, Servius enrolled twelve centuries of knights out of the leading men of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He likewise formed six other centuries &mdash;three had been instituted by Romulus &mdash;employing the same names which had been hallowed to their use by augury. For the purchase of horses they were allowed ten thousand asses each from the state treasury, and for the maintenance of these horses unmarried women were designated, who had to pay two thousand asses each, every year. All these burdens were shifted from the shoulders of the poor to those of the rich.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The latter were then granted special privileges: for manhood suffrage, implying equality of power and of rights, was no longer given promiscuously to all, as had been the practice handed down by Romulus and observed by all the other kings; but gradations were introduced, so that ostensibly no one should be excluded from the suffrage, and yet the power should rest with the leading citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the knights were called upon to vote first; then the eighty centuries of the first class: if there were any disagreement there, which rarely happened, it was provided that the centuries of the second class should be called; and they almost never descended so far as to reach the lowest citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nor ought it to cause any surprise that the present organization, which exists since the increase of the tribes to thirty-five, and the doubling of their number in the matter of the junior and senior centuries, does not correspond with the total established by Servius Tullius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For, having divided the City according to its inhabited regions and hills into four parts, he named them <quote>tribes,</quote> a word <pb id="p.155"/>derived, I suppose, from <quote>tribute</quote>;<note><hi rend="italics">Tributum</hi> comes from <hi rend="italics">tribus</hi> (not <hi rend="italics">vice versa,</hi> as Livy has it), which meant originally <quote>third part,</quote> but lost the numerical force and became simply <quote>part,</quote> <quote>district,</quote> like the French <quote><hi rend="italics">quartier,</hi></quote> which Walde compares.</note> for this<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> likewise the same king planned to have apportioned equitably, on the basis of the census; nor had these tribes anything whatever to do with the distribution or the number of the centuries.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon the completion of the census, which had been expedited by fear of a law that threatened with death and imprisonment those who failed to register, Servius issued a proclamation calling on all Roman citizens, both horse and foot, to assemble at daybreak, each in his own century, in the Campus Martius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There the whole army was drawn up, and a sacrifice of a pig, a sheep, and a bull was offered by the king for its purification. This was termed the <quote>closing of the lustrum,</quote> because it was the last act in the enrolment. Eighty thousand citizens are said to have been registered in that census; the most ancient of the historians, Fabius Pictor, adds that this was the number of those capable of bearing arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To meet the wants of this population it was apparent that the City must expand, and so the king added two hills, the Quirinal and the Viminal, after which he proceeded to enlarge the Esquiline,<note>Dion. iv. 13, and Strabo, v. 3, 7, make Servius the first to include the Esquiline in the City. Livy appears to have thought of him as merely increasing the extent of that district. Conway and Walters adopt <hi rend="italics">O'</hi>s <hi rend="italics">Viminalemque, Viminalem,</hi> and Gronov's <hi rend="italics">Esquiliis,</hi> thus reconciling Livy with Dion and Strabo.</note> going there to live himself, that the place might obtain a good reputation. He surrounded the City with a rampart, trenches, and a wall, and so extended the <quote>pomerium.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This word is interpreted by those who look only at its etymology as meaning <quote>the tract behind the wall,</quote> but it signifies rather <quote>the tract on both sides of the wall,</quote> the space which the Etruscans used formerly to consecrate with augural <pb id="p.157"/>ceremonies, where they proposed to erect their wall,<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> establishing definite limits on either side of it, so that they might at the same time keep the walls free on their inward face from contact with buildings, which now, as a rule, are actually joined to them, and on the outside keep a certain area free from human uses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This space, which the gods forbade men to inhabit or to till, was called <quote>pomerium</quote> by the Romans, quite as much because the wall stood behind it as because it stood behind the wall; and as the city grew, these consecrated limits were always pushed out for as great a distance as the walls themselves were to be advanced.<note><hi rend="italics">Pomerium</hi> at first meant the boundary-line itself, then the strip of land left free within the wall, and finally was loosely used of the strip on both sides of the wall.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the king had promoted the grandeur of the state by enlarging the City, and had shaped all his domestic policy to suit the demands of peace as well as those of war, he was unwilling that arms should always be the means employed for strengthening Rome's power, and sought to increase her sway by diplomacy, and at the same time to add something to the splendour of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Even at that early date the temple of Diana at Ephesus enjoyed great renown. It was reputed to have been built through the cooperation of the cities of Asia, and this harmony and community of worship Servius praised in superlative terms to the Latin nobles, with whom, both officially and in private, he had taken pains to establish a footing of hospitality and friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By dint of reiterating the same arguments he finally carried his point, and a shrine of Diana was built in Rome by the nations of Latium conjointly with the Roman People. This was an admission that Rome was the capital &mdash;a point which had so often been disputed <pb id="p.159"/>with force of arms. But though it seemed that the<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> Latins had lost all interest in this contention after the repeated failure of their appeals to war, there was one man amongst the Sabines who thought that he saw an opportunity to recover the empire by a shrewd plan of his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the Sabine country, on the farm of a certain head of a family, there was born a heifer of extraordinary size and beauty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> a marvel to which the horns afterwards bore testimony, for they were fastened up for many generations in the vestibule of Diana's temple.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This heifer was regarded as a prodigy, as indeed it was; soothsayers prophesied that the state whose citizens should sacrifice the animal to Diana would be the seat of empire, and this prediction had reached the ears of the priest of Diana's shrine. On the earliest day which seemed suitable for the sacrifice, the Sabine drove the heifer to Rome, and bringing her to the shrine of Diana, led her up to the altar. There the Roman priest, moved by the great size of the victim, which had been much talked of, and recalling the prophecy, asked the Sabine, <quote>What is this that you are doing, stranger? Would you sacrifice, unpurified, to Diana? Not so! First bathe in a running stream; the Tiber flows by in the bottom of the valley.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The stranger, touched by a scruple and wishing to do everything according to ritual, that the prodigy might be answered by the event, at once descended to the Tiber. Meanwhile the Roman offered the heifer to Diana, an act which was exceedingly acceptable to the king and the citizens.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Servius had by this time a definite prescriptive right to the supreme power. Still, hearing <pb id="p.161"/>that the young Tarquinius now and then threw out<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> a hint that he was reigning without the consent of the people, he proceeded to gain the goodwill of the commons by dividing among all the citizens the land obtained by conquest from the enemy; after which he made bold to call upon the people to vote whether he should be their ruler, and was declared king with such unanimity as none of his predecessors had experienced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Yet the circumstance did not lessen Tarquinius's hopes of obtaining the kingship. On the contrary, perceiving that the bestowal of land on the plebeians was in opposition to the wishes of the senate, he felt that he had got the better opportunity of vilifying Servius to the Fathers and of increasing his own influence in the senate-house. He was a hot-headed youth himself, and he had at hand, in the person of Tullia his wife, one who goaded on his restless spirit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the royal house of Rome produced an example of tragic guilt, as others had done,<note>The reference is to the stories of Atreus and Oedipus.</note> in order that loathing of kings might hasten the coming of liberty, and that the end of reigning might come in that reign which was the fruit of crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This Lucius Tarquinius &mdash;whether he was the son or the grandson of King Tarquinius Priscus is uncertain; but, following the majority of historians, I would designate him son &mdash;had a brother, Arruns Tarquinius, a youth of a gentle disposition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These two, as has been said before, had married the two Tullias, daughters of the king, themselves of widely different characters. Chance had so ordered matters that the two violent natures should not be united in wedlock, thanks doubtless to the good fortune of the Roman People, that the reign of Servius might be prolonged and the traditions of <pb id="p.163"/>the state become established.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was distressing to<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> the headstrong Tullia that her husband should be destitute of ambition and enterprise. With her whole soul she turned from him to his brother; him she admired, him she called a man and a prince: she despised her sister because, having got a man for a mate, she lacked a woman's daring.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their similarity soon brought these two together, as is generally the case, for evil is strongly drawn to evil; but it was the woman who took the lead in all the mischief. Having become addicted to clandestine meetings with another's husband, she spared no terms of insult when speaking of her own husband to his brother, or of her sister to that sister's husband. She urged that it would have been juster for her to be unmarried and for him to lack a wife than for them to be united to their inferiors and be compelled to languish through the cowardice of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If the gods had given her the man she deserved she would soon have seen in her own house the royal power which she now saw in
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> her father's. It was not long before she had inspired the young man with her own temerity, and, having made room in their respective houses for a new marriage, by deaths which followed closely upon one another, they were joined together in nuptials which Servius rather tolerated than approved.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From that moment the insecurity of the aged Tullius and the menace to his authority increased with each succeeding day. For the woman was already looking forward from one crime to another, nor would she allow her husband any rest by night or day, lest the murders they had done before should be without effect.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> She had not wanted a <pb id="p.165"/>man just to be called a wife, just to endure<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> servitude with him in silence; she had wanted one who should deem himself worthy of the sovereignty, who bethought him that he was the son of Tarquinius Priscus, who preferred the possession of the kingship to the hope of it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>If you are he,</quote> she cried, <quote><hi rend="italics">whom</hi> I thought I was marrying, I call you both man and king; if not, then I have so far changed for the worse, in that crime is added, in your case, to cowardice. Come, rouse yourself!
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> You are not come, like your father, from Corinth or Tarquinii, that you must make yourself king in a strange land; the gods of your family and your ancestors, your father's image, the royal palace, with its throne, and the name of Tarquinius create and proclaim you king. Else, if you have no courage for this, why do you cheat the citizens? why do you suffer yourself to be looked on as a prince? Away with you to Tarquinii or Corinth!
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Sink back into the rank of your family, more like your brother than your father!</quote> With these and other taunts she excited the young man's ambition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor could she herself submit with patience to the thought that Tanaquil, a foreign woman, had exerted her spirit to such purpose as twice in succession to confer the royal power &mdash;upon her husband first, and again upon her son-in-law &mdash; if Tullia, the daughter of a king, were to count for nothing in bestowing and withdrawing a throne. Inspired by this woman's frenzy Tarquinius began to go about and solicit support, especially among the heads of the lesser families, whom he reminded of his father's kindness to them, and desired their favour in return; the young men he attracted by gifts; both by the great things he promised to do <pb id="p.167"/>himself, and by slandering the king as well, he<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> everywhere strengthened his interest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At length, when it seemed that the time for action was now come, he surrounded himself with a body of armed men and burst into the Forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, amidst the general consternation which ensued, he seated himself on the throne in front of the Curia, and commanded, by the mouth of a herald, that the senators should come to King Tarquinius at the senate-house. They at once assembled: some of them already prepared beforehand, others afraid that they might be made to suffer for it if they did not come; for they were astounded at this strange and wonderful sight, and supposed that Servius was utterly undone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Tarquinius then went back to the very beginning of Servius's family and abused the king for a slave and a slave-woman's son who, after the shameful death of his own father, Tarquinius Priscus, had seized the power;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> there had been no observance of the interregnum, as on former occasions; there had been no election held; not by the votes of the people had sovereignty come to him, not with the confirmation of the Fathers, but by a woman's gift.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Such having been his birth, and such his appointment to the kingship, he had been an abettor of the lowest class of society, to which he himself belonged, and his hatred of the nobility possessed by others had led him to plunder the leading citizens of their land and divide it amongst the dregs of the populace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> All the burdens which had before been borne in common he had laid upon the nation's foremost men. He had instituted the census that he might hold up to envy the fortunes of the wealthy, and make them available, when he chose to draw upon them, for largesses to the destitute.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the midst of this harangue Servius,<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> who had been aroused by the alarming news, came up and immediately called out in a loud voice from the vestibule of the Curia: <quote>What means this, Tarquinius?
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With what assurance have you dared, while I live, to convene the Fathers or to sit in my chair?</quote> Tarquinius answered truculently that it was his own father's seat he occupied; that the king's son was a fitter successor to his kingdom than a slave was; that Tullius had long enough been suffered to mock his masters and insult them. Shouts arose from the partisans of each, and the people began to rush into the senate-house; it was clear that he would be king who won the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Tarquinius was now compelled by sheer necessity to go on boldly to the end. Being much superior to Servius in youth and strength, he seized him by the middle, and bearing him out of the senate-house, flung him down the steps. He then went back into the Curia to hold the senate together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king's servitors and companions fled. The king himself, half fainting, was making his way home without the royal attendants, when the men whom Tarquinius had sent in pursuit of the fugitive came up with him and killed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is believed, inasmuch as it is not inconsistent with the rest of her wickedness, that this deed was suggested by Tullia. It is agreed, at all events, that she was driven in her carriage into the Forum, and nothing abashed at the crowd of men, summoned her husband from the Curia and was the first to hail him king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Tarquinius bade her withdraw from so turbulent a scene. On her way home she had got to the top of the Vicus Cyprius, where the shrine of Diana recently stood, and was bidding her driver <pb id="p.171"/>turn to the right into the Clivus Urbius, to take her<note type="margin">B.C. 578-534</note> to the Esquiline Hill, when the man gave a start of terror, and pulling up the reins pointed out to his mistress the prostrate form of the murdered Servius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Horrible and inhuman was the crime that is said to have ensued, which the place commemorates &mdash;men call it the Street of Crime &mdash;for there, crazed by the avenging spirits of her sister and her former husband, they say that Tullia drove her carriage over her father's corpse, and, herself contaminated and defiled, carried away on her vehicle some of her murdered father's blood to her own and her husband's penates, whose anger was the cause that the evil beginning of this reign was, at no long date, followed by a similar end.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Servius Tullius had ruled forty-four years, so well that even a good and moderate successor would have found it hard to emulate him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But there was this to enhance his renown, that just and lawful kingship perished with him. Yet, mild and moderate though his sway was, some writers state that he had intended to resign it, as being a government by one man, had not the crime of one of his family interrupted his plans for the liberation of his country.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now began the reign of Lucius Tarquinius,<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> whose conduct procured him the surname of Superbus, or the Proud.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For he denied the rites of sepulture to his own father-in-law, asserting that Romulus had also perished without burial. He put to death the leading senators, whom he believed to have favoured the cause of Servius and, conscious that a precedent for gaining the kingship by crime might be found in his own career and turned against himself, he <pb id="p.173"/>assumed a body-guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had indeed no right to<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> the throne but might, since he was ruling neither by popular decree nor senatorial sanction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover, as he put no trust in the affection of his people, he was compelled to safeguard his authority by fear. To inspire terror therefore in many persons, he adopted the practice of trying capital causes<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> causes affecting the <hi rend="italics">caput</hi> (which might mean either <quote>life</quote> or <quote>civic rights</quote>) of the accused.</note> by himself, without advisers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and, under the pretext thus afforded, was able to inflict death, exile, and forfeiture of property, not only upon persons whom he suspected and disliked, but also in cases where he could have nothing to gain but plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was chiefly the senators whose numbers were reduced by this procedure, and Tarquinius determined to make no new appointments to the order, that it might be the more despised for its very paucity, and might chafe less at being ignored in all business of state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For this king was the first to break with the custom handed down by his predecessors, of consulting the senate on all occasions, and governed the nation without other advice than that of his own household. War, peace, treaties, and alliances were entered upon or broken off by the monarch himself, with whatever states he wished, and without the decree of people or senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Latin race he strove particularly to make his friends, that his strength abroad might contribute to his security at home. He contracted with their nobles not only relations of hospitality but also matrimonial connections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, a man by long odds the most important of the Latin name, and descended, if we may believe report, from Ulysses and the goddess Circe,<note>Circe bore to Ulysses a son, Telegonus, who founded Tusculum.</note> he gave his daughter in marriage, and in this way attached to himself the numerous kinsmen and friends of the man.
				</p> <pb id="p.175"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Tarquinius had already won great influence<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> with the Latin nobles, when he gave notice that they should assemble on a certain day at the grove of Ferentina, saying that there were matters of common interest which he wished to discuss.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Latins gathered at daybreak in large numbers; Tarquinius himself, though he did indeed keep the day, arrived but a little while before sundown. There had been much talk in the council all day about various subjects. Turnus Herdonius of Aricia had inveighed violently against the absent Tarquinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He said it was no wonder he had been given the name of Superbus at Rome &mdash;for that was the name by which they already called him, secretly and in whispers, but still quite generally; &mdash;could anything be more overbearing than to flout the whole Latin race as he was doing then?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their leaders had been summoned from distant homes, and the very man who had called the council was not there. He was evidently trying their patience, intending, if they submitted to the yoke, to use them as his vassals. For who could fail to see that he was aiming at sovereignty over the Latins?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If his own people had done well to intrust this to him, if indeed it had been intrusted to him at all, and had not been ravished by foul murder, then it was right that the Latins also should intrust it to him &mdash;nay,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> not even then, for he was of foreign birth; but if his own subjects were weary of him, as men who, one after another, were being made to suffer death, exile, confiscation, what better prospect was held out to the Latins? If they were guided by the speaker they would depart every man to his own home, nor observe the day of meeting more than he who had proclaimed it was observing it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As these <pb id="p.177"/>words and others of the same import were being<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> uttered by the factious and turbulent Latin, who owed to these qualities his influence amongst his own people, Tarquinius came up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This was the end of the speech; all turned to salute Tarquinius. Silence was commanded, and the king, being advised by those nearest him to excuse himself for having come so late, declared that he had been chosen arbiter between a father and his son, and had been delayed by his anxiety to reconcile them. He added that since this business had used up that day, he would take up on the morrow the matters which he had meant to bring before them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They say that Turnus would not suffer even this to go unchallenged, asserting that there was no question more quickly settled than one betwixt father and son, for these few words were enough to end it: <quote>Unless you obey your father it will be the worse for you.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Girding thus against the Roman king, the Arician quitted the council. Tarquinius was considerably more vexed than he appeared to be, and at once looked about him for the means of destroying Turnus, that he might inspire in the Latins the same terror with which he had broken the spirit of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And since he could not openly put his man to death by virtue of sovereign right, he charged him with a crime of which he was innocent, and so destroyed him. Through the agency of certain men of the opposite party in Aricia, he bribed a slave of Turnus with gold to allow a large quantity of swords to be brought secretly into his master's lodging.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Having accomplished this in a single night, Tarquinius, shortly before dawn, summoned the chief men of the Latins to his quarters, pretending to <pb id="p.179"/>have received alarming news, and informed them<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> that his tardiness on the preceding day, as though somehow providentially occasioned, had been the means of saving himself and them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For he was told that Turnus was plotting his murder and that of the chief men of the different cities, that he might be sole ruler over the Latins. He would have attacked them the day before in the council, but had postponed the attempt because the summoner of the council, whom he chiefly aimed at, was not there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That was the reason Turnus had railed at him in his absence, for his delay had balked the Arician's expectation. Tarquinius said that he had no doubt, if his information was true, that Turnus would come at dawn, when they had assembled in the council, and would be armed and attended by a band of conspirators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was said that a great quantity of swords had been carried to his lodging; the falsity or truth of this could be ascertained immediately, and he asked them to go with him to Turnus's quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The charge was made plausible both by the aggressive spirit of Turnus and his speech of the day before, and by Tarquinius's delay, since it seemed that the massacre might have been postponed on that account. The nobles went therefore with a disposition to believe the story, but still, if the swords should not be found, they were prepared to conclude the other charges false.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As soon as they reached the place they wakened Turnus from his sleep and surrounded him with guards; and having overpowered the slaves, who out of affection for their master would have resorted to force, they proceeded to pull out the hidden swords from every corner of the inn. There was now no doubt that Turnus was <pb id="p.181"/>caught in the act, and he was cast into chains, while<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> the summons was instantly sent out, amidst intense excitement, for a council of the Latins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There such bitter resentment was aroused by the public display of the swords, that the accused was not permitted to plead his cause, but suffered a new kind of death, being plunged into the source of the Ferentine Water and sunk beneath a wicker crate heaped up with stones.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Tarquinius then called the Latins again to the place of council, and praised them for the punishment which they had justly meted out to the rebellious attempt of Turnus, in view of the treason in which he had just been taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king then went on to say that it was in his power to proceed according to an ancient right, since all the Latins, having sprung from Alba, were included in that treaty by which, from the time of Tullus, the whole Alban state, with its colonies, had come under Rome's dominion.<note>In the account of this treaty at xxiv. 3 no Alban colonies are mentioned, nor do we know of any. Conway and Walters, therefore, keep <hi rend="italics">colonis</hi> of the MSS., but we should rather expect <hi rend="italics">civibus</hi> in this context.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the advantage of all would be better served, he thought, if that treaty were renewed and the good fortune of the Roman people were thrown open to the participation of the Latins, than if they were always to be dreading or enduring the razing of their cities and the devastation of their lands which they had suffered first in Ancus's reign and afterward in that of the speaker's father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was not difficult to persuade the Latins, although the Roman interest preponderated in this treaty. For the rest, they saw that the chiefs of the Latin name stood with the king and took his view of the matter, and they had just been given a demonstration of the danger they would each incur if they opposed the project.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the treaty was renewed, and the Latin <pb id="p.183"/>juniors were commanded to present themselves at<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> the grove of Ferentina on a certain day, armed and in full force, as the treaty prescribed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When they had assembled, agreeably to the king's edict, from the different districts, Tarquinius was unwilling that they should have their own leaders, or a separate command, or their own standards; he therefore mingled Latins and Romans in the maniples, making one maniple of two and two of one, and over the maniples thus doubled he put centurions.<note>A Roman maniple was divided into halves, and each half was combined with the half of a Latin maniple, similarly divided, to form a new unit. The maniples were not, strictly speaking, doubled.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But if the king was unjust in peace, yet he was not a bad general in war. Indeed, he would have equalled in this art the kings who had gone before him, if his degeneracy in other things had not also dimmed his glory here.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was he who began the war with the Volsci which was to last more than two hundred years after his time, and took Suessa Pometia from them by storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, having sold off the booty and raised forty talents of silver,<note>As Livy gives the sum in talents, it has been suggested that he may here be following Fabius Pictor, whose history was written in Greek. The Euboic talent was worth roughly &pound;220 or $1,060.</note> he conceived the project of a temple of Jupiter so magnificent that it should be worthy of the king of gods and men, the Roman empire, and the majesty of the site itself. The money from the captured city he put aside to build this temple.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He then engaged in an unexpectedly tedious war with Gabii, a neighbouring town After first assaulting the place in vain, he laid siege to it, but this attempt was as unsuccessful as the other, for he was driven off from the walls; and he finally resorted to the policy, so unlike a Roman, of deceit <pb id="p.185"/>and trickery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For he pretended to have given up<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> the war and to be engrossed in laying the foundations of his temple and in other city works, arranging meanwhile to let Sextus, who was the youngest of his three sons, desert to Gabii, and there complain that his father was intolerably cruel to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His father's pride, he said, was now diverted from strangers upon his own family. Even his children were too many to please him, and the solitude which he had caused in the senate-house he wished to bring to pass in his own home also, that he might leave no descendant, no heir to his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The young man said that he had himself escaped from amidst the swords and javelins of his father, and had made up his mind that there was no safety for him anywhere save with the enemies of Lucius Tarquinius. Let them not delude themselves, he said; the war which the king pretended to have abandoned was still awaiting them, and when the chance offered he would attack them unawares.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But if they had no room for suppliants, he was prepared to wander all over Latium, and thence seek out the Volsci and the Aequi and the Hernici, till at last he should come to people who knew how to protect a son from the cruel and wicked tortures inflicted on him by a father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Possibly he might even discover some enthusiasm for war and arms against the haughtiest of kings and the most insolent of nations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When it appeared that if they were indifferent he would leave them in anger and continue his flight, the Gabini bade him welcome. They told him not to be surprised if the king had been the same to his children that he had been to his subjects, to his allies; he would end by venting his cruelty upon <pb id="p.187"/>himself if other objects failed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But for their<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> own part, they said, they were glad of his coming, and they believed that in a short time, with his help, the seat of war would be shifted from the gates of Gabii to the walls of Rome.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Sextus next obtained admission to the Gabian councils of state, where, on all subjects but one, he professed a deference for the opinion of those who had long been citizens of Gabii and were better acquainted with the facts. War, however, he did take it upon himself to urge, again and again; and in so doing he assumed a special competence, as one who was acquainted with the strength of both nations, and knew that the king's pride must necessarily be hateful to all the citizens, since even his children had not been able to put up with it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In this way, little by little, he stirred up the leaders of the Gabini to reopen the war. He would himself take the boldest of the young men and go upon raids and forays. All his words and acts were calculated to deceive, and their ill-grounded confidence so increased that in the end he was chosen commander-in-chief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The war began, and the people had no suspicion of what was going forward. Skirmishes took place between Rome and Gabii, in which, as a rule, the Gabini had the best of it. Thereupon their citizens, both high and low, contended who should be loudest in expressing the belief that in Sextus Tarquinius they had a heaven-sent leader.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And the soldiers, seeing him ever ready to share in their dangers and hardships, and ever lavish in distributing the plunder, came to love him so devotedly that the elder Tarquinius was not more truly master <pb id="p.189"/>in Rome than was his son in Gabii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so, when<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> Sextus saw that he had acquired strength enough for any enterprise, he despatched one of his own followers to his father in Rome, to ask what the king might please to have him do, since the gods had granted that at Gabii all power in the state should rest with him alone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To this messenger, I suppose because he seemed not quite to be trusted, no verbal reply was given. The king, as if absorbed in meditation, passed into the garden of his house, followed by his son's envoy. There, walking up and down without a word, he is said to have struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Tired of asking questions and waiting for an answer, the messenger returned to Gabii, his mission, as he thought, unaccomplished. He reported what he had said himself and what he had seen. Whether from anger, or hatred, or native pride, the king, he said, had not pronounced a single word.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As soon as it was clear to Sextus what his father meant and what was the purport of his silent hints, he rid himself of the chief men of the state. Some he accused before the people; against others he took advantage of the odium they had themselves incurred. Many were openly executed; some, whom it would not have looked well to accuse, were put to death in secret.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some were permitted, if they chose, to leave the country; or they were driven into banishment, and once out of the way, their property was forfeited, just as in the case of those who had been put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thence came largesses and spoils, and in the sweetness of private gain men lost their feeling for the wrongs of the nation, until, deprived of counsel and aid, the state of Gabii was handed over unresisting to the Roman king.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having got possession of Gabii, Tarquinius<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> made peace with the Aequian nation and renewed the treaty with the Etruscans. He next turned his attention to affairs in the city. Here his first concern was to build a temple of Jupiter on the Tarpeian Mount<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Capitoline. So Propertius calls the Capitoline Jupiter <quote>Tarpeius Pater</quote> (IV. i. 7).</note> to stand as a memorial of his reign and of his name, testifying that of the two Tarquinii, both kings, the father had made the vow and the son had fulfilled it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And that the site might be free from all other religious claims and belong wholly to Jupiter and his temple, which was building there, he determined to annul the consecration of several fanes and shrines which had been first vowed by King Tatius at the crisis of the battle against Romulus, and had afterwards been consecrated and inaugurated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the very time when he began this task the gods are said to have exerted their power to show the magnitude of this mighty empire. For whereas the birds permitted that the consecrations of all the other shrines should be rescinded, they refused their consent for the shrine of Terminus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This omen and augury was thus construed: the fact that the seat of Terminus was not moved, and that of all the gods he alone was not called away from the place consecrated to him, meant that the whole kingdom would be firm and steadfast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When this auspice of permanence had been received, there followed another prodigy foretelling the grandeur of their empire. A human head, its features intact, was found, so it is said, by the men who were digging for the foundations of the temple.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This appearance plainly foreshowed that here was to be the citadel of the empire and the head of the world, and such was the interpretation of the soothsayers, both those who were in <pb id="p.193"/>the City and those who were called in from Etruria<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> to consider the matter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This made the king all the more ready to spend money on the work. Hence the Pometian spoils, which had been destined to carry the building up to the roof, barely sufficed for the foundations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This disposes me to believe the statement of Fabius (who is, besides, the earlier writer) that the spoils were only forty talents, rather than Piso's, who writes that forty thousand pounds of silver were put aside for this work.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So great a sum of money could not be expected from the booty of a single city of that time, and there is no building, even among those of our own day, for the foundations of which it would not be more than enough.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Being intent upon completing the temple, the king called in workmen from every quarter of Etruria, and used for this purpose not only the state funds but labourers drawn from the commons. This work was far from light in itself, and was added to their military service. Yet the plebeians felt less abused at having to build with their own hands the temples of the gods, than they did when they came to be transferred to other tasks also, which, while less in show, were yet rather more laborious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> I mean the erection of seats in the circus, and the construction underground of the Great Sewer, as a receptacle for all the offscourings of the City, &mdash;two works for which the new splendour of these days has scarcely been able to produce a match.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After making the plebeians toil at these hard tasks, the king felt that a populace which had now no work to do was only a burden to the City; he wished, moreover, by sending out settlers, to extend the frontiers of his dominions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.195"/>He therefore sent colonists to Signia and Circei, to<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> safeguard the City by land and sea.
				</p> 
				<p>While he was thus occupied, a terrible portent appeared. A snake glided out of a wooden pillar, causing fright and commotion in the palace. As for the king himself, his heart was not so much struck with sudden terror as filled with anxious forebodings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Now for public prodigies none but Etruscan soothsayers were wont to be employed, but this domestic apparition, as he regarded it, so thoroughly alarmed him that he determined to send to Delphi, the most famous oracle in the world;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and, not daring to trust the oracle's reply to anybody else, he sent two of his sons, through strange lands, as they were then, and over stranger seas, to Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Titus and Arruns were the ones who went; and, to bear them company, Lucius Junius Brutus was sent too, the son of Tarquinia, sister of the king, a young man of a very different mind from that which he pretended to bear. Having heard that the leading men of the state, and among them his own brother, had been put to death by his uncle, he determined to leave nothing in his disposition which the king might justly fear, nor anything in his fortune to covet, resolving to find safety in contempt, where justice afforded no protection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He therefore deliberately assumed the appearance of stupidity, and permitted himself and his property to become the spoil of the king; he even accepted the surname Brutus,<note>Literally <quote>Dullard.</quote></note> that behind the screen afforded by this title the great soul which was to free the Roman People might bide its time unseen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He it was who was then taken by the Tarquinii to Delphi, more as a butt than as a comrade; and he is said to have carried a golden staff inclosed within one <pb id="p.197"/>of cornel wood, hollowed out to receive it, as a gift<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> to Apollo, and a roundabout indication of his own character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they came there, and had carried out their father's instructions, a desire sprang up in the hearts of the youths to find out which one of them should be king at Rome. From the depths of the cavern this answer, they say, was returned: <quote>The highest power at Rome shall be his, young men, who shall be first among you to kiss his mother.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Tarquinii, anxious that Sextus, who had been left in Rome, might know nothing of the answer and have no share in the rule, gave orders that the incident should be kept strictly secret; as between themselves, they decided by lot which should be first, upon their return to Rome, to give their mother a kiss.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Brutus thought the Pythian utterance had another meaning; pretending to stumble, he fell and touched his lips to Earth, evidently regarding her as the common mother of all mortals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They then returned to Rome, where preparations for war with the Rutuli were being pushed with the greatest vigour.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ardea belonged to the Rutuli, who were a nation of commanding wealth, for that place and period. This very fact was the cause of the war, since the Roman king was eager not only to enrich himself, impoverished as he was by the splendour of his public works, but also to appease with booty the feeling of the common people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> who, besides the enmity they bore the monarch for other acts of pride, were especially resentful that the king should have kept them employed so long as artisans and doing the work of slaves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> An attempt was made to capture Ardea by assault. Having failed in this, the Romans invested <pb id="p.199"/>the place with intrenchments, and began to beleaguer<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Here in their permanent camp, as is usual with a war not sharp but long drawn out, furlough was rather freely granted, more freely however to the leaders than to the soldiers; the young princes for their part passed their idle hours together at dinners and drinking bouts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It chanced, as they were drinking in the quarters of Sextus Tarquinius, where Tarquinius Collatinus, son of Egerius, was also a guest, that the subject of wives came up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Every man fell to praising his own wife with enthusiasm, and, as their rivalry grew hot, Collatinus said that there was no need to talk about it, for it was in their power to know, in a few hours' time, how far the rest were excelled by his own Lucretia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <quote>Come! If the vigour of youth is in us let us mount our horses and see for ourselves the disposition of our wives. Let every man regard as the surest test what meets his eyes when the woman's husband enters unexpected.</quote> They were heated with wine. <quote>Agreed!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> they all cried, and clapping spurs to their horses were off for Rome. Arriving there at early dusk, they thence proceeded to Collatia, where Lucretia was discovered very differently employed from the daughters-in-law of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These they had seen at a luxurious banquet, whiling away the time with their young friends; but Lucretia, though it was late at night, was busily engaged upon her wool, while her maidens toiled about her in the lamplight as she sat in the hall of her house.<note>A similar scene is imagined by Tibullus, I. iii. 83 ff. (p. 211 of the volume in this series).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The prize of this contest in womanly virtues fell to Lucretia. As Collatinus and the Tarquinii approached, they were graciously received, and the victorious husband courteously invited the young princes to his table. It was there <pb id="p.201"/>that Sextus Tarquinius was seized with a wicked desire<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> to debauch Lucretia by force; not only her beauty, but her proved chastity as well, provoked him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> However, for the present they ended the boyish prank of the night and returned to the camp.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When a few days had gone by, Sextus Tarquinius, without letting Collatinus know, took a single attendant and went to Collatia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Being kindly welcomed, for no one suspected his purpose, he was brought after dinner to a guest-chamber. Burning with passion, he waited till it seemed to him that all about him was secure and everybody fast asleep; then, drawing his sword, he came to the sleeping Lucretia. Holding the woman down with his left hand on her breast, he said, <quote>Be still, Lucretia! I am Sextus Tarquinius. My sword is in my hand. Utter a sound, and you die!</quote> In affright the woman started out of her sleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> No help was in sight, but only imminent death. Then Tarquinius began to declare his love, to plead, to mingle threats with prayers, to bring every resource to bear upon her woman's heart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he found her obdurate and not to be moved even by fear of death, he went farther and threatened her with disgrace, saying that when she was dead he would kill his slave and lay him naked by her side, that she might be said to have been put to death in adultery with a man of base condition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At this dreadful prospect her resolute modesty was overcome, as if with force, by his victorious lust; and Tarquinius departed, exulting in his conquest of a woman's honour. Lucretia, grieving at her great disaster, dispatched the same message to her father in Rome and to her husband at Ardea: <pb id="p.203"/>that they should each take a trusty friend and come;<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> that they must do this and do it quickly, for a frightful thing had happened. Spurius Lucretius came with Publius Valerius, Volesus' son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Collatinus brought Lucius Junius Brutus, with whom he chanced to be returning to Rome when he was met by the messenger from his wife. Lucretia they found sitting sadly in her chamber. The entrance of her friends brought the tears to her eyes, and to her husband's question, <quote>Is all well?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> she replied, <quote>Far from it; for what can be well with a woman when she has lost her honour? The print of a strange man, Collatinus, is in your bed. Yet my body only has been violated; my heart is guiltless, as death shall be my witness. But pledge your right hands and your words that the adulterer shall not go unpunished. Sextus Tarquinius is he that last night returned hostility for hospitality, and armed with force brought ruin on me, and on himself no less &mdash;if you are men &mdash;when he worked his pleasure with me.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They give their pledges, every man in turn. They seek to comfort her, sick at heart as she is, by diverting the blame from her who was forced to the doer of the wrong.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They tell her it is the mind that sins, not the body; and that where purpose has been wanting there is no guilt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <quote>It is for you to determine,</quote> she answers, <quote>what is due to him; for my own part, though I acquit myself of the sin, I do not absolve myself from punishment; not in time to come shall ever unchaste woman live through the example of Lucretia.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Taking a knife which she had concealed beneath her dress, she plunged it into her heart, and sinking forward upon the wound, died as she fell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The wail for the dead was raised by her husband and her father.
				</p> <pb id="p.205"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Brutus, while the others were absorbed in<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> grief, drew out the knife from Lucretia's wound, and holding it up, dripping with gore, exclaimed, <quote>By this blood, most chaste until a prince wronged it, I swear, and I take you, gods, to witness, that I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius Superbus and his wicked wife and all his children, with sword, with fire, aye with whatsoever violence I may; and that I will suffer neither them nor any other to be king in Rome!</quote> The knife he then passed to Collatinus, and from him to Lucretius and Valerius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were dumbfounded at this miracle. Whence came this new spirit in the breast of Brutus? As he bade them, so they swore. Grief was swallowed up in anger; and when Brutus summoned them to make war from that very moment on the power of the kings, they followed his lead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They carried out Lucretia's corpse from the house and bore it to the market-place, where men crowded about them, attracted, as they were bound to be, by the amazing character of the strange event and its heinousness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Every man had his own complaint to make of the prince's crime and his violence. They were moved, not only by the father's sorrow, but by the fact that it was Brutus who chid their tears and idle lamentations and urged them .to take up the sword, as befitted men and Romans, against those who had dared to treat them as enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The boldest of the young men seized their weapons and offered themselves for service, and the others followed their example. Then, leaving Lucretia's father to guard Collatia, and posting sentinels so that no one might announce the rising to the royal family, the rest, equipped for battle and with Brutus in command, set out for Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Once there, wherever their armed <pb id="p.207"/>band advanced it brought terror and confusion; but.<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> again, when people saw that in the van were the chief men of the state, they concluded that whatever it was it could be no meaningless disturbance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And in fact there was no less resentment at Rome when this dreadful story was known than there had been at Collatia. So from every quarter of the City men came running to the Forum. No sooner were they there than a crier summoned the people before the Tribune of the Celeres,<note>For the <hi rend="italics">Celeres,</hi> see xv. 8 and note. H. J. Edwards (<hi rend="italics">ad</hi> <hi rend="italics">loc.</hi>) thinks that the office comprised both military and civil functions-the command of the cavalry (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Magister</hi> <hi rend="italics">Equitum</hi> in republican times) and the presidency (as deputy of the king) of comitia and senate.</note> which office Brutus then happened to be holding.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There he made a speech by no means like what might have been expected of the mind and the spirit which he had feigned up to that day. He spoke of the violence and lust of Sextus Tarquinius, of the shameful defilement of Lucretia and her deplorable death, of the bereavement of Tricipitinus, in whose eyes the death of his daughter was not so outrageous and deplorable as was the cause of her death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He reminded them, besides, of the pride of the king himself and the wretched state of the commons, who were plunged into ditches and sewers and made to clear them out. The men of Rome, he said, the conquerors of all the nations round about, had been transformed from warriors into artisans and stone-cutters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He spoke of the shameful murder of King Tullius, and how his daughter had driven her accursed chariot over her father's body, and he invoked the gods who punish crimes against parents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> With these and, I fancy, even fiercer reproaches, such as occur to a man in the very presence of an outrage, but are far from easy for an historian to reproduce, he inflamed the people, and brought them to abrogate the king's authority and to exile Lucius Tarquinius, together with his wife and children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Brutus himself then enrolled the juniors, who <pb id="p.209"/>voluntarily gave in their names, and arming them<note type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> set out for the camp at Ardea to arouse the troops against the king. The command at Rome he left with Lucretius, who had been appointed Prefect of the City by the king, some time before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> During this confusion Tullia fled from her house, cursed wherever she went by men and women, who called down upon her the furies that avenge the wrongs of kindred.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the news of these events reached the camp, the king, in alarm at the unexpected danger, set out for Rome to put down the revolt. Brutus, who had perceived the king's approach, made a circuit to avoid meeting him, and at almost the same moment, though by different roads, Brutus reached Ardea and Tarquinius Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Against Tarquinius the gates were closed and exile was pronounced. The liberator of the City was received with rejoicings in the camp, and the sons of the king were driven out of it. Two of them followed their father, and went into exile at Caere, in Etruria. Sextus Tarquinius departed for Gabii, as though it had been his own kingdom, and there the revengers of old quarrels, which he had brought upon himself by murder and rapine, slew him.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Lucius Tarquinius Superbus ruled for five and twenty years. The rule of the kings at Rome, from its foundation to its liberation, lasted two hundred and forty-four years. Two consuls were then chosen in the centuriate comitia, under the presidency of the Prefect of the City, in accordance with the commentaries of Servius Tullius.<note>The <quote>consuls,</quote> as they were called from the time of the Decemvirate, were originally designated <quote>praetors</quote>; Livy is anachronistic. The <quote>centuriate comitia</quote> was the assembly of the people by centuries, as classified by Servius, primarily for military ends. It is more likely that Lucretius presided over the election in the capacity of interrex (to which office Dion. iv. 84 says Lucretius was appointed by Brutus) than in that of prefect.</note> These were Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus.

				</p>
				<p>He reigned 24 years. In his reign Lucumo, son of the
					Corinthian Demaratus, came from Tarquinii, an Etruscan
					city, to Rome, and being received into the friendship of
					Ancus began to bear the name of Tarquinius Priscus, and
					after the death of Ancus succeeded to the kingship. He

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE new liberty enjoyed by the Roman people,<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> their achievements in peace and war, annual magistracies, and laws superior in authority to men will henceforth be my theme.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This liberty was the more grateful as the last king had been so great a tyrant. For his predecessors so ruled that there is good reason to regard them all as successive founders of parts, at least, of the City, which they added to serve as new homes for the numbers they had themselves recruited.<note>This statement is too sweeping, for Livy nowhere attributes any enlargement of the City to Numa.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor is there any doubt that the same Brutus who earned such honour by expelling the haughty Tarquinius, would have acted in an evil hour for the commonwealth had a premature eagerness for liberty led him to wrest the power from any of the earlier kings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For what would have happened if that rabble of shepherds and vagrants, having deserted their own peoples, and under the protection of inviolable sanctuary having possessed themselves of liberty, or at least impunity, had thrown off their fear of kings only to be stirred by the ruffling storms of tribunician demagogues, breeding quarrels with the senators of a city not their own,
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> before ever the pledges of wife and children and love of the very place and soil (an affection of slow growth) had firmly united their aspirations? The nation would have crumbled away with dissension before it had matured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But it was favoured by the mild restraint of the government, which nursed it up to the point <pb id="p.221"/>where its ripened powers enabled it to bear good<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> fruit of liberty. Moreover you may reckon the beginning of liberty as proceeding rather from the limitation of the consuls' authority to a year than from any diminution of their power compared with that which the kings had exercised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All the rights of the kings and all their insignia were possessed by the earliest consuls; only one thing was guarded against &mdash;that the terror they inspired should not be doubled by permitting both to have the rods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Brutus was the first to have them, with his colleague's consent, and he proved as determined in guarding liberty as he had been in asserting it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To begin with, when the people were still jealous of their new freedom, he obliged them to swear an oath that they would suffer no man to be king in Rome, lest they might later be turned from their purpose by the entreaties or the gifts of princes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the next place, that the strength of the senate might receive an added augmentation from the numbers of that order, he filled up the list of the Fathers, which had been abridged by the late king's butcheries, drawing upon the foremost men of equestrian rank until he had brought the total up to three hundred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> From that time, it is said, was handed down the custom of summoning to the senate the Fathers and the Enrolled, the latter being the designation of the new senators, who were appointed.<note>Later any senator might be called <hi rend="italics">pater conscriptus,</hi> and it is possible that Livy and Festus (p. 254 M) were misled in supposing that originally the <hi rend="italics">patres</hi> were one class of senators and the <hi rend="italics">conscripti</hi> another. See Conway's note.</note> This measure was wonderfully effective in promoting harmony in the state and attaching the plebs to the Fathers.<note>Livy appears to have assumed that the new senators were plebeians, but this is almost certainly wrong. The first definite notice of a plebeian senator occurs at v. xii. 11 (<date value="-400">400 B.C.</date>).</note>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Matters of worship then received attention. Certain public sacrifices had habitually been performed by the kings in person, and that their <pb id="p.223"/>absence might nowhere be regretted, a <quote>king of<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> sacrifices</quote> was appointed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This priesthood they made subordinate to the pontifex, lest the office, in conjunction with the title, might somehow prove an obstacle to liberty, which was at that time their chief concern. Perhaps the pains they took to safeguard it, even in trivial details, may have been excessive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the name of one of the consuls, though he gave no other offence, was hateful to the citizens. <quote>The Tarquinii had become too used to sovereignty. It had begun with Priscus; Servius Tullius had then been king; but not even this interruption had caused Tarquinius Superbus to forget the throne or regard it as another's; as though it had been the heritage of his family, he had used crime and violence to get it back; Superbus was now expelled, but the supreme power was in the hands of Collatinus. The Tarquinii knew not how to live as private citizens. Their name was irksome and a menace to liberty.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Beginning in this way, with a cautious sounding of sentiment, the talk spread through the entire nation, and the plebs had become anxious and suspicious, when Brutus summoned them to an assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There he first of all recited the oath which the people had taken, that they would suffer no king in Rome, nor any man who might be dangerous to liberty. This oath they must uphold, he said, with all their might, nor make light of anything which bore upon it. He spoke with reluctance, on the man's account, nor would he have broken silence unless he had been forced to do so by his love of country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman people did not believe that they had recovered absolute freedom. The royal family, the royal name <pb id="p.225"/>were not only present in the state, but were<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> actually in authority, an obstacle and a stumbling-block in the way of liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <quote>This fear,</quote> he cried, <quote>do you yourself remove, Lucius Tarquinius, of your own free will! We are mindful &mdash;we confess it &mdash;that you drove out the kings; complete the good work you have begun, and rid us of the royal name. Your possessions shall not only be granted you by the citizens, at my instance, but if they are in any way inadequate they shall be generously increased. Depart our friend, and relieve the state of what is, perhaps, an idle fear. The people are persuaded that with the family of Tarquinius the kingship will vanish from amongst us.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul was at first prevented from uttering a word by his astonishment at this strange and unexpected turn; then, when he tried to speak, the chief men of the state surrounded him, and with many entreaties made the same request.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The others had little influence over him, but when Spurius Lucretius, his superior in years and dignity, and his father-in-law besides, began to urge him, with mingled entreaty and advice, to permit himself to yield to the unanimous wish of his fellow-citizens, Collatinus became
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> alarmed lest when his year of office should have ended, his misfortunes might be increased by the confiscation of his property and the addition of yet other ignominies. He therefore resigned the consulship, and transferring all his possessions to Lavinium, withdrew from the Roman state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In pursuance of a resolution of the senate, Brutus proposed to the people a measure which decreed the exile of all the Tarquinian race. To be his colleague the centuriate comitia, under his presidency, elected Publius Valerius, who had helped him to expel the kings.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although no one doubted that the Tarquinii<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> would presently go to war, their attack was delayed beyond all expectation; while a thing men did not fear at all, to wit a treasonable plot, almost cost Rome her liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were among the young men a number of youths, the sons of families not unimportant, whose pleasures had been less confined under the monarchy, who, being of the same age as the young Tarquinii, and their cronies, had grown used to the untrammelled life of princes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This licence they missed, now that all enjoyed equal rights, and they had got into the way of complaining to each other that the liberty of the rest had resulted in their own enslavement. A king was a man, from whom one could obtain a boon, whether it were just or unjust; there was room for countenance and favour; a king could be angry, could forgive, could distinguish between friend and enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The law was a thing without ears, inexorable, more salutary and serviceable to the pauper than to the great man; it knew no relaxation or indulgence, if one exceeded bounds; and, inasmuch as man is so prone to blunder, it was dangerous to rely on innocence alone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thanks to such reflections, they were already infected with disloyalty when envoys from the royal family appeared, who without saying anything about the return of the Tarquinii, sought merely to recover their property. The senate, having given them a hearing, debated the question for several days; for they feared that if they refused to make restitution it would be a pretext for war, if they consented it would be to furnish means and assistance for its prosecution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Meantime the envoys were <pb id="p.229"/>exerting themselves to a different purpose. Ostensibly<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> seeking to recover the property, they secretly laid their plans for winning back the kingdom; and, as if in furtherance of their apparent object, they went about sounding the disposition of the youthful nobles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To those who gave them a friendly hearing they delivered letters from the Tarquinii, and plotted with them to admit the royal family secretly by night into the City. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The brothers Vitellii and Aquilii were the first to be entrusted with the project. A sister of the Vitellii had married the consul Brutus, and there were sons of this marriage who were now young men, Titus and Tiberius; these were also admitted by their uncles to a share in the design.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were besides several other young nobles taken into the secret, but their names are lost in antiquity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate meantime had acquiesced in the opinion of those who were in favour of giving back the property. This very fact gave the agents of the exiles an excuse for lingering in the City, for the consuls had granted them time for obtaining vehicles with which to carry away the belongings of the royal family.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All this time they spent in consultation with the conspirators, whom they urged and at length persuaded to give them letters for the Tarquinii: for otherwise how could the princes be convinced that the statements of their agents regarding matters of such importance were to be relied on?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These letters, being given as a pledge of sincerity, furnished clear proof of the crime, For on the eve of the envoys' setting out to rejoin their masters it happened that they were dining at the house of the Vitellii, where the conspirators, having dismissed all witnesses, had much talk together, naturally enough, about their <pb id="p.231"/>new design. This conversation one of the slaves<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> overheard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had for some time perceived what was in the wind, but was waiting for the opportunity which the delivery of the letters to the envoys would provide, that their seizure might make good his accusation. When he saw that the letters had been given, he laid the matter before the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls left their houses, arrested the agents and the conspirators, and, without making any disturbance, completely crushed the plot, being especially careful not to lose the letters. The traitors were thrown into prison forthwith. As for the envoys, it was uncertain for a little while what would be done with them, but, notwithstanding they appeared to have deserved no less than to be treated as enemies, the law of nations nevertheless prevailed. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question of the royal property, which they had before voted to return, was laid before the Fathers for fresh consideration. This time anger won the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They refused to return it, and refused to confiscate it to the state, but gave it up to the plebeians to plunder, that having had their fingers in the spoils of the princes they might for ever relinquish hope of making their peace with them. The land of the Tarquinii, lying between the City and the Tiber, was consecrated to Mars and became the Campus Martius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It happened, they say, that there was then standing upon it a crop of spelt, ripe for the harvest. Since this produce of the land might not, for religious reasons, be consumed, the grain was cut, straw and all,<note>Ordinarily the Roman farmer cut the stalk close to the ear, but this time it was cut near the ground, that the crop might be completely destroyed.</note> by a large body of men, who were set to work upon it simultaneously, and was carried in baskets and thrown into the Tiber, then flowing with a feeble current, as is usually the case in midsummer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So the heaps <pb id="p.233"/>of grain, caught in the shallow water, settled down<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> in the mud, and out of these and the accumulation of other chance materials such as a river brings down, there was gradually formed an island. Later, I suppose, embankments were added, and work was done, to raise the surface so high above the water and make it strong enough to sustain even temples and porticoes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the chattels of the princes had been pillaged, sentence was pronounced and punishment inflicted upon the traitors &mdash;a punishment the more conspicuous because the office of consul imposed upon a father the duty of exacting the penalty from his sons, and he who ought to have been spared even the sight of their suffering was the very man whom Fortune appointed to enforce it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Bound to the stake stood youths of the highest birth. But the rest were ignored as if they had been of the rabble: the consul's sons drew all eyes upon themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Men pitied them for their punishment not more than for the crime by which they had deserved that punishment. To think that those young men, in that year of all others, when their country was liberated and her liberator their own father, and when the consulship had begun with the Junian family, could have brought themselves to betray all &mdash;the senate, the plebs, and all the gods and men of Rome &mdash;to one who had formerly been a tyrannical king and was then an enemy exile!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls advanced to their tribunal and dispatched the lictors to execute the sentence. The culprits were stripped, scourged with rods, and beheaded, while through it all men gazed at the expression on the father's face, where they might clearly read a father's anguish, as he administered the nation's retribution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the <pb id="p.235"/>guilty had suffered, that the example might be in<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> both respects a notable deterrent from crime, the informer was rewarded with money from the treasury, emancipation, and citizenship.

From his time onwards it was customary to regard those who had been freed by this form as admitted to citizenship.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these occurrences had been faithfully reported to Tarquinius, he was stirred not only by disappointment at the collapse of so great hopes, but also by hatred and anger. He saw that the way was now closed against trickery, and believed it was time to contrive an open war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He therefore went about as a suppliant amongst the cities of Etruria, directing his prayers chiefly to the Veientes and the Tarquinienses. Reminding them that he had come from them and was of the same blood as themselves, and that exile and poverty had followed hard upon his loss of what had been but now great power, he besought them not to let him perish, with his youthful sons, before their very eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Others had been called in from abroad to be kings in Rome: he himself, while actually king, and enlarging Rome's sway by war, had been driven out by his next-of-kin in a wicked conspiracy. His enemies, perceiving that no single claimant was fit to be king, had seized and usurped the power amongst themselves, and had given up his goods to be plundered by the people, that none might be without a share in the guilt. He wished to regain his country and his sovereignty, and to punish the ungrateful Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Let them <pb id="p.237"/>succour and support him, and avenge, as well, their<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> own long-standing grievances, the oft-repeated destruction of their armies, and seizure of their lands. This last plea moved the men of Veii, and they cried out with threatenings that they ought, at all events with a Roman for their commander, to wipe out their disgraces and recover what they had lost in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Tarquinienses were influenced by his name and kinship: it seemed a fine thing to them that one of their blood should be king in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So it came about that two armies, representing two nations, followed Tarquinius, to regain his kingdom for him and to chastise the Romans. When they had come into Roman territory the consuls went out to meet the enemy: Valerius led the foot in defensive formation; Brutus, with the cavalry, went ahead to scout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the same fashion the enemy's horse headed their march, commanded by Arruns Tarquinius, the king's son, while the king himself followed with the legions. Arruns, perceiving a long way off by the consul's lictors that it was he, and then, as they drew nearer together, recognizing Brutus more unmistakably by his countenance, blazed with resentment. <quote>Yonder,</quote> he cried, <quote>is the man who drove us into exile from our native land. Look!
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He is himself decked out with our trappings, as he comes proudly on! O gods, avengers of kings, be with us!</quote> Spurring his horse, he charged straight at the consul. Brutus saw that he was the object of the man's attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In those days it was to a general's credit to take part in the actual fighting, so he eagerly accepted the challenge, and they rushed at one another with such desperation, neither of them taking thought for his own defence if only he might wound his adversary, that <pb id="p.239"/>each was pierced right through his shield by the<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> other's thrust, and, impaled upon the two spears, they fell dying from their horses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At the same time the rest of the cavalry as well began to fight, and not long after the infantry also appeared. In this battle the advantage was divided, and the fortune of war seemed equally balanced: the right wing on each side was victorious, while the left was defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Veientes, used to being beaten by the Roman troops, were routed and dispersed; the men of Tarquinii, a new enemy, not only stood their ground, but drove back the Roman forces which opposed them. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Yet despite the indecisive character of the battle, so great a panic came over Tarquinius and the Etruscans that they gave up the enterprise for lost, and that same night both armies, the Veientine and the Tarquiniensian, marched off every man to his own home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the story of this fight common report adds a prodigy: that in the silence of the following night a loud voice was heard coming out of the Arsian forest, which was believed to be the voice of Silvanus, and that this was what he said: <quote>The Tuscans have lost one more man in the battle-line; the Romans are conquerors in the war.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At all events the Romans left the field like victors, and the Etruscans like an army that has been defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For when it grew light and not a single enemy was to be seen, Publius Valerius the consul gathered up the spoils and returned in triumph to Rome. His colleague's funeral he celebrated with all the pomp then possible; but a far greater honour to the dead man was the general grief, which was particularly conspicuous inasmuch as the matrons mourned a year for him, as for a father, because <pb id="p.241"/>he had been so spirited an avenger of outraged<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> modesty.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Soon after this the surviving consul, so fickle are the affections of the mob, became unpopular; not only did the people dislike him, but they actually suspected him and made cruel charges against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was noised about that he was aspiring to the power of a king, since he had not caused a colleague to be elected in the place of Brutus, and was building a house on the highest part of the Velia, an elevated position of natural strength, men said, which he was converting into an impregnable citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The frequency of these remarks and the general acceptance they met with, shamefully unjust as they were, distressed the consul. He summoned the people to a council, and with lowered fasces<note>Bundles of rods which symbolized the magistrate's authority to scourge, as the axes (<hi rend="italics">secures</hi>) did his right to put to death.</note> mounted the speaker's platform.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was a welcome spectacle to the multitude when they beheld the emblems of authority there abased before them, in acknowledgment that the people's majesty and power were superior to the consul's. Then, bidding them attend, the consul extolled the good fortune of his colleague, who, after his country had thrown off the yoke, had held the highest office in her gift, and, fighting for the state, at the height of a reputation as yet untarnished by envy, had met his death. He had himself outlived his glory, and survived to face accusations and ill-will.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From being the saviour of his country he had sunk to the level of the Aquilii and Vitellii. <quote>Will there never be worth and merit, then,</quote> he exclaimed, <quote>so established in your minds that suspicion cannot wrong it?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Could I possibly have feared that I, well known as the bitterest enemy of kings, should myself incur the charge of <pb id="p.243"/>seeking kingly power? Could I have believed that,<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> though I dwelt in the very Citadel and on the Capitol itself, I could be feared by my fellow-citizens? Can so trivial a cause ruin my reputation with you? Does your confidence rest on so slight a foundation that it makes more difference where I am than who I am?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There shall be no menace in the house of Publius Valerius to your liberties, Quirites; your Velia shall be safe. I will not only bring my house down on to level ground, but will even place it under a hill, that you may live above me, the citizen whom you suspect. Let those build on the Velia who can better be trusted with men's liberty than can Publius Valerius!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Immediately the materials were all brought down below the Velia, and the house was erected where the temple of Vica Pota is now, at the bottom of the slope.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Laws were then proposed which not only cleared the consul from the suspicion of seeking kingly power, but took such an opposite turn that they even made him popular and caused him to be styled Publicola, the People's Friend.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Above all, the law about appealing from the magistrates to the people, and the one that pronounced a curse on the life and property of a man who should plot to make himself king, were welcome to the commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had carried through these measures alone, that he might enjoy without a rival all the favour arising out of them, he finally held an election to choose a colleague for the unexpired term.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The choice fell upon Spurius Lucretius, who by reason of his great age was no longer strong enough for the duties of the consulship, and died within a few days. They elected in Lucretius's place Marcus Horatius <pb id="p.245"/>Pulvillus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In some ancient authorities I do not find<note type="margin">B.C. 509</note> Lucretius given as consul, but Brutus is followed immediately by Horatius; I suppose that because no exploit lent distinction to Lucretius's consulship men forgot it.
				</p> 
				<p>The temple of Jupiter on the Capitol had not yet been dedicated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Valerius and Horatius the consuls drew lots to determine which should do it. Horatius received the lot, and Publicola set out to conduct the war against the Veientes. With more bitterness than was reasonable, the friends of Valerius resented that the dedication of so famous a temple should be given to Horatius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They tried in all sorts of ways to hinder it, but their schemes all came to naught. Finally, when the consul's hand was on the door-post and he was in the midst of his prayers to the gods, they broke in upon the ceremony with the evil tidings that his son was dead, averring that whilst the shadow of death was over his house he could not dedicate a temple.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whether he did not believe the news to be true, or possessed great fortitude, we are not informed with certainty, nor is it easy to decide. Without permitting himself to be diverted from his purpose by the message, further than to order that the body should be buried, he kept his hand upon the doorpost, finished his prayer, and dedicated the temple.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Such were the achievements, at home and in the field, of the first year after the expulsion of the kings.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next Publius Valerius (for the second time)<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> and Titus Lucretius were made consuls.<note>Dion. Hal. (v. 21) says that Valerius was consul for the <hi rend="italics">third</hi> time, and Horatius for the second time, when the war with Porsinna came. Mommsen thought the MSS. had lost these names, and proposed to insert them directly after those in the text. But in chap. xi. 8, T. Lucretius is still the colleague of Valerius.</note> By this time the Tarquinii had sought refuge with Lars <pb id="p.247"/>Porsinna, king of Clusium. There they mingled advice<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> and entreaty, now imploring him not to permit them, Etruscans by birth and of the same blood and the same name as himself, to suffer the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> privations of exile, and again even warning him not to allow the growing custom of expelling kings to go unpunished. Liberty was sweet enough in itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Unless the energy with which nations sought to obtain it were matched by the efforts which kings put forth to defend their power, the highest would be reduced to the level of the lowest; there would be nothing lofty, nothing that stood out above the rest of the state; there was the end of monarchy, the noblest institution known to gods or men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Porsinna, believing that it was not only a safe thing for the Etruscans that there should be a king at Rome, but an honour to have that king of Etruscan stock, invaded Roman territory with a hostile army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Never before had such fear seized the senate, so powerful was Clusium in those days, and so great Porsinna's fame. And they feared not only the enemy but their own citizens, lest the plebs should be terror-stricken and, admitting the princes into the City, should even submit to enslavement, for the sake of peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hence the senate at this time granted many favours to the plebs. The question of subsistence received special attention, and some were sent to the Volsci and others to Cumae to buy up corn. Again, the monopoly of salt, the price of which was very high, was taken out of the hands of individuals and wholly assumed by the government. Imposts and taxes were removed from the plebs that they might be borne by the well-to-do, who were equal to the burden: the poor paid dues enough if they reared children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thanks to this <pb id="p.249"/>liberality on the part of the Fathers, the distress<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> which attended the subsequent blockade and famine was powerless to destroy the harmony of the state, which was such that the name of king was not more abhorrent to the highest than to the lowest;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> nor was there ever a man in after years whose demagogic arts made him so popular as its wise governing at that time made the whole senate.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the enemy appeared, the Romans all, with one accord, withdrew from their fields into the City, which they surrounded with guards. Some parts appeared to be rendered safe by their walls, others by the barrier formed by the river Tiber.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The bridge of piles almost afforded an entrance to the enemy, had it not been for one man, Horatius Cocles; he was the bulwark of defence on which that day depended the fortune of the City of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He chanced to be on guard at the bridge when Janiculum was captured by a sudden attack of the enemy. He saw them as they charged down on the run from Janiculum, while his own people behaved like a frightened mob, throwing away their arms and quitting their ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Catching hold first of one and then of another, blocking their way and conjuring them to listen, he called on gods and men to witness that if they forsook their post it was vain to flee; once they had left a passage in their rear by the bridge, there would soon be more of the enemy on the Palatine and the Capitol than on Janiculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He therefore warned and commanded them to break down the bridge with steel, with fire, with any instrument at their disposal; and promised that he would himself receive the onset of the enemy, so far as it could be withstood by a single body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, striding to the <pb id="p.251"/>head of the bridge, conspicuous amongst the fugitives<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> who were clearly seen to be shirking the fight, he covered himself with his sword and buckler and made ready to do battle at close quarters, confounding the Etruscans with amazement at his audacity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Yet were there two who were prevented by shame from leaving him. These were Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius, both famous for their birth and their deeds. With these he endured the peril of the first rush and the stormiest moment of the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But after a while he forced even these two to leave him and save themselves, for there was scarcely anything left of the bridge, and those who were cutting it down called to them to come back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then, darting glances of defiance around at the Etruscan nobles, he now challenged them in turn to fight, now railed at them collectively as slaves of haughty kings, who, heedless of their own liberty, were come to overthrow the liberty of others. They hesitated for a moment, each looking to his neighbour to begin the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then shame made them attack, and with a shout they cast their javelins from every side against their solitary foe. But he caught them all upon his shield, and, resolute as ever, bestrode the bridge and held his ground; and now they were trying to dislodge him by a charge, when the crash of the falling bridge and the cheer which burst from the throats of the Romans, exulting in the completion of their task, checked them in mid-career with a sudden dismay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then Cocles cried, <quote>O Father Tiberinus, I solemnly invoke thee; receive these arms and this soldier with propitious stream!</quote> So praying, all armed as he was, he leaped down into the river, and under a shower of missiles swam across unhurt <pb id="p.253"/>to his fellows, having given a proof of valour which<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> was destined to obtain more fame than credence with posterity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The state was grateful for so brave a deed: a statue of Cocles was set up in the comitium, and he was given as much land as he could plough around in one day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Private citizens showed their gratitude in a striking fashion, in the midst of his official honours, for notwithstanding their great distress everybody made him some gift proportionate to his means, though he robbed himself of his own ration.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Porsinna, repulsed in his first attempt, gave up the plan of storming the City, and determined to lay siege to it. Placing a garrison on Janiculum, he pitched his camp in the plain by the banks of the Tiber.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He collected ships from every quarter, both for guarding the river, to prevent any corn from being brought into the City, and also to send his troops across for plundering, as the opportunity might present itself at one point or another;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and in a short time he made all the territory of the Romans so unsafe that not only were they forced to bring all their other property inside the walls, but even their flocks too, nor did anybody dare to drive them outside the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This great degree of licence was permitted to the Etruscans not so much from timidity as design. For Valerius the consul, who was eager for an opportunity of assailing a large number at once, when they should be scattered about and not expecting an attack, cared little to avenge small aggressions, and reserved his punishment for a heavier blow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, to lure forth plunderers, he issued orders to his people that on the following day a large number of them should drive out their flocks by the <pb id="p.255"/>Esquiline Gate, which was the most remote from the<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> enemy, believing that they would hear of it, since the blockade and famine were causing desertions on the part of faithless slaves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And in fact the enemy did hear of it from a deserter's report, and crossed the river in much greater force than usual, in the hope of making a clean sweep of the booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Consequently Publius Valerius directed Titus Herminius to lie in ambush with a small force two miles out on the Gabinian Way, and Spurius Larcius with a body of light-armed youths to take post at the Colline Gate, until the enemy should pass, and then to throw themselves between him and the river, cutting off his retreat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of the two consuls, Titus Lucretius went out by the Naevian Gate with several maniples of soldiers, Valerius himself led out some picked cohorts by way of the Caelian Mount.<note>Where there was a gate called <hi rend="italics">Porta Caelimontana,</hi> south of the <hi rend="italics">Porta Esquilina.</hi>v</note> These last were the first to be seen by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Herminius had no sooner perceived that the skirmish was begun than he rushed in from his ambush and fell upon the rear of the Etruscans, who had turned to meet Valerius. On the right hand and on the left,<note>From the standpoint of the inhabitants of the city, looking eastward from the walls.</note> from the Naevian Gate and from the Colline, an answering shout was returned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus the raiders were hemmed in and cut to pieces, for they were no match for the Romans in fighting strength, and were shut off from every line of retreat. This was the last time the Etruscans roamed so far afield.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The blockade went on notwithstanding. The corn was giving out, and what there was cost a very high price, and Porsinna was beginning
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> to have hopes that he would take the City by sitting still, when Gaius Mucius, a young Roman noble, thinking it a shame that although the Roman People had not, in <pb id="p.257"/>the days of their servitude when they lived under<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> kings, been blockaded in a war by any enemies, they should now,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> when free, be besieged by those same Etruscans whose armies they had so often routed, made up his mind that this indignity must be avenged by some great and daring deed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first he intended to make his way to the enemy's camp on his own account. Afterwards, fearing that if he should go unbidden by the consuls and without anyone's knowing it, he might chance to be arrested by the Roman sentries and brought back as a deserter &mdash;a charge which the state of the City would confirm &mdash;he went before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>I wish,</quote> said he, <quote>to cross the river, senators, and enter, if I can, the enemy's camp &mdash;not to plunder or exact reprisals for their devastations: I have in mind to do a greater deed, if the gods grant me their help.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Fathers approved. Hiding a sword under his dress, he set out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Arrived at the camp, he took up his stand in the thick of the crowd near the royal tribunal. It happened that at that moment the soldiers were being paid; a secretary who sat beside the king, and wore nearly the same costume, was very busy, and to him the soldiers for the most part addressed themselves. Mucius was afraid to ask which was Porsinna, lest his ignorance of the king's identity should betray his own, and following the blind guidance of Fortune, slew the secretary instead of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As he strode off through the frightened crowd, making a way for himself with his bloody blade, there was an outcry, and thereat the royal guards came running in from every side, seized him and dragged him back before the tribunal of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But friendless as he was, even then, when <pb id="p.259"/>Fortune wore so menacing an aspect, yet as one<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> more to be feared than fearing, <quote>I am a Roman citizen,</quote> he cried; <quote>men call me Gaius Mucius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I am your enemy, and as an enemy I would have slain you; I can die as resolutely as I could kill: both to do and to endure valiantly is the Roman way. Nor am I the only one to carry this resolution against you: behind me is a long line of men who are seeking the same honour. Gird yourself therefore, if you think it worth your while, for a struggle in which you must fight for your life from hour to hour with an armed foe always at your door.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Such is the war we, the Roman youths, declare on you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Fear no serried ranks, no battle; it will be between yourself alone and a single enemy at a time.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The king, at once hot with resentment and aghast at his danger, angrily ordered the prisoner to be flung into the flames unless he should at once divulge the plot with which he so obscurely threatened him. Whereupon Mucius, exclaiming, <quote>Look, that you may see how cheap they hold their bodies whose eyes are fixed upon renown!</quote> thrust his hand into the fire that was kindled for the sacrifice. When he allowed his hand to burn as if his spirit were unconscious of sensation, the king was almost beside himself with wonder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He bounded from his seat and bade them remove the young man from the altar. <quote>Do you go free,</quote> he said, <quote>who have dared to harm yourself more than me. I would invoke success upon your valour, were that valour exerted for my country; since that may not be, I release you from the penalties of war and dismiss you scathless and uninjured.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then Mucius, as if to requite his generosity, answered, <quote>Since you hold bravery <pb id="p.261"/>in honour, my gratitude shall afford you the<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> information your threats could not extort: we are three hundred, the foremost youths of Rome, who have conspired to assail you in this fashion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> I drew the first lot; the others, in whatever order it falls to them, will attack you, each at his own time, until Fortune shall have delivered you into our hands.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The release of Mucius, who was afterwards known as Scaevola,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> <quote>Left-handed.</quote></note> from the loss of his right hand, was followed by the arrival in Rome of envoys from Porsinna.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king had been so disturbed, what with the hazard of the first attack upon his life, from which nothing but the blunder of his assailant had preserved him, and what with the anticipation of having to undergo the danger as many times more as there were conspirators remaining, that he voluntarily proposed terms of peace to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In these terms Porsinna suggested, but without effect, that the Tarquinii should be restored to power, more because he had been unable to refuse the princes this demand upon their behalf than that he was ignorant that the Romans would refuse it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In obtaining the return of their lands to the Veientes he was successful; and the Romans were compelled to give hostages if they wished the garrison to be withdrawn from Janiculum. On these terms peace was made, and Porsinna led his army down from Janiculum and evacuated the Roman territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Fathers bestowed on Gaius Mucius, for his bravery, a field across the Tiber, which was later known as the Mucian Meadows.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now when courage had been thus distinguished, even the women were inspired to deeds of patriotism. Thus the maiden Cloelia, one of the hostages, eluded <pb id="p.263"/>the sentinels, when it chanced that the Etruscans had<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> encamped not far from the bank of the Tiber, and heading a band of girls swam the river and, under a rain of hostile darts, brought them all back in safety to their kinsmen in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this had been reported to the king, he was at first enraged and sent emissaries to Rome to demand that the hostage Cloelia be given up, for he made no great account of the others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, admiration getting the better of anger, he asserted that her feat was a greater one than those of Cocles and Mucius, and declared that although in case the hostage was not returned he should regard the treaty as broken, yet if she were restored to him he would send her back safe and inviolate to her friends. Both parties kept their word.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Romans returned the pledge of peace, as the treaty required; and the Etruscan king not only protected the brave girl but even honoured her, for after praising her heroism he said that he would present her with half the hostages, and that she herself should choose the ones she wished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they had all been brought out it is said that she selected the young boys, because it was not only more seemly in a maiden, but was unanimously approved by the hostages themselves, that in delivering them from the enemy she should give the preference to those who were of an age which particularly exposed them to injury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When peace had been established the Romans rewarded this new valour in a woman with a new kind of honour, an equestrian statue, which was set up on the summit of the Sacred Way, and represented the maiden seated on a horse.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This peaceful departure of the Etruscan king from Rome is inconsistent with the custom handed down from antiquity even to our own age, <pb id="p.265"/>among other formalities observed at sales of booty,<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> of proclaiming <quote>the goods of King Porsinna.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Such a practice must either have arisen during the war and have been retained when peace was made, or else have had its origin in some kindlier circumstance than would be suggested by the notice that an enemy's goods were to be sold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The most credible of the traditional explanations is that when Porsinna retired from Janiculum he handed over his camp, well stocked with provisions brought in from the neighbouring fertile fields of Etruria, as a gift to the Romans, who were then in a destitute condition after the long siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These supplies were then sold, lest, if people were given a free hand, they might plunder the camp like an enemy; and they were called the goods of Porsinna rather by way of implying thankfulness for the gift than an auction of the king's property, which was not even in the possession of the Roman People.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>On relinquishing his campaign against the Romans, Porsinna was unwilling that he should appear to have led his army into that region to no purpose, and accordingly sent a part of his forces, under his son Arruns, to besiege Aricia. At first the Aricini were paralysed with surprise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Afterwards the auxiliaries whom they called in from the Latin peoples, and also from Cumae, so encouraged them that they ventured to measure their strength with the enemy in the open field. When the battle began, the attack of the Etruscans was so impetuous that they routed the Aricini at the first charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Cumaean levies, employing skill to meet force, swerved a little to one side, and when the enemy had swept by them, faced about and attacked them in the rear, with the <pb id="p.267"/>result that the Etruscans, caught between two lines,<note type="margin">B.C. 508</note> almost in the moment of victory, were cut to pieces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A very small number of them, having lost their leader and finding no nearer refuge, drifted to Rome, unarmed and with all the helplessness and the dejected aspect of suppliants. There they were kindly received and were quartered about among the citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When their wounds had healed, some departed for their homes to report the hospitality and kindness they had met with, but many were persuaded to remain in Rome by the affection they felt for their hosts and for the City. To these a place of residence was allotted which was afterwards called the Vicus Tuscus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius were the<note type="margin">B.C. 507-506</note> next consuls, and after them came Publius Lucretius and Publius Valerius Publicola. In the latter year an embassy was sent to Rome for the last time by Porsinna to negotiate for the restoration of Tarquinius to power. To these envoys the senate replied that they would send representatives to the king, and they forthwith dispatched those of the Fathers who were held in the highest esteem.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It would not have been impossible, they said, to reply shortly that the royal family would not be received. It was not for that reason that they had preferred to send chosen members of the senate to him rather than to give their answer to his ambassadors in Rome. But they had desired that for all time discussion of that question might be ended, and that where there were so great obligations on both sides there might not be mutual irritation, from the king's seeking that which was incompatible with the liberty of the Roman people, while the Romans, unless they were willing <pb id="p.269"/>to sacrifice their existence to their good nature, denied<note type="margin">B.C. 507-506</note> the request of a man whom they would not willingly have denied anything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman people were not living under a monarchy, but were free. They had resolved to throw open their gates to enemies sooner than to kings; in this prayer they were all united, that the day which saw the end of liberty in their City might also see the City's end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They therefore entreated him, if he desired the welfare of Rome, to permit her to be free.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The king, yielding to his better feelings, made answer: <quote>Since this is your fixed resolve, I will neither importune you with repeated insistence upon a hopeless plea, nor will I deceive the Tarquinii with the hope of aid which it is not in my power to grant. Let them seek elsewhere, whether war or peace be their object, for a place of exile, that nothing may hinder my being at peace with you.</quote> His words were followed by yet more friendly deeds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The hostages remaining in his hands he returned, and he gave back the Veientine land which he had taken from the Romans by the treaty made on Janiculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Tarquinius, cut off from all hope of returning, departed for Tusculum, to spend his exile in the home of his son-in-law, Mamilius Octavius. The Romans enjoyed an unbroken peace with Porsinna.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consulship of Marcus Valerius and<note type="margin">B.C. 505-503</note> Publius Postumius. This year a successful war was waged against the Sabines, and the consuls triumphed. More elaborate preparations for war were then made by the Sabines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To confront them, and to prevent any sudden peril arising from Tusculum, in which quarter hostility, though not openly avowed, was none the <pb id="p.271"/>less suspected, Publius Valerius was made consul for<note type="margin">B.C. 505-503</note> the fourth time and Titus Lucretius for the second.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A schism which occurred between the advocates of war and those of peace amongst the Sabines resulted in the transfer of some part of their strength to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For Attius Clausus, afterwards known at Rome as Appius Claudius, himself a champion of peace, was hard bested by the turbulent war-party, and finding himself no match for them, left Inregillus, with a large band of clients, and fled to Rome. These people were made citizens and given land across the Anio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The <quote>Old Claudian Tribe</quote> was the name used later, when new tribesmen had been added, to designate those who came from this territory.<note>By <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date> the number of tribes had grown to thirty-five. After this date no new tribes were added, but newly incorporated districts were assigned to one or another of the already existing tribes. Thus certain members of the Claudian Tribe lived elsewhere than in the district <quote>across the Anio,</quote> and those who came to Rome for elections from the original seat of the tribe were called the <quote>Old Claudian Tribe.</quote> See note in Conway's edition of this Book.</note> Appius, having been enrolled in the senate, came in a short time to be regarded as one of its leading members.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls led an army into the country of the Sabines, and by wasting their fields, and afterwards by a battle, so crushed the enemy's strength that there could be no fear for a long time of any outbreak of hostilities in that region.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They then returned to Rome and triumphed. Publius Valerius, universally regarded as the foremost citizen, both in military and in civil qualities, died in the following year, when Agrippa Menenius and Publius Postumius were consuls. He was a man of extraordinary reputation, but so poor that money was wanting for his burial, and it was furnished from the treasury of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was mourned by the matrons as Brutus had been. In the same year two Latin colonies, Pometia and Cora, revolted to the Aurunci. The <pb id="p.273"/>Aurunci were the first to be attacked. Upon the<note type="margin">B.C. 505-503</note> defeat of the great army which had boldly issued forth to meet the invasion of their territory by the consuls, the whole weight of the Auruncan war fell upon Pometia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the battle, as well as during its progress, no quarter was given. The slain had somewhat outnumbered the prisoners, and the prisoners were indiscriminately slaughtered. Even the hostages, of whom three hundred had been received, were not spared in the rage of war.<note>Livy has nowhere told us about these hostages. In chap. xxii. 2 the same towns give the same number of hostages. Obviously he has made distinct episodes out of different versions of the same story, misled no doubt by the different dates assigned by different annalists to the affair of Pometia.</note> This year also a triumph was celebrated at Rome.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls of the next year, Opiter<note type="margin">B.C. 502</note> Verginius and Spurius Cassius, attempted to capture Pometia, first by assault and then by the use of mantlets and other engines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Against their besiegers the Aurunci, rather of an implacable hatred than for any hope or opportunity offered, rushed out, armed with firebrands for the most part, instead of swords, and carried death and flames in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The mantlets were burned, many of their enemies were wounded or slain, and one of the consuls &mdash;which one the historians do not add &mdash;was seriously wounded, thrown from his horse, and almost killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans then marched home, defeated. Amongst the many wounded they brought the consul, hovering betwixt life and death. When a short time had elapsed, long enough for healing wounds and recruiting the army, they returned, with heightened resentment and also with augmented forces, to the attack of Pometia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They had repaired their mantlets and the rest of their equipment, and they were already upon the <pb id="p.275"/>point of sending their men against the walls when<note type="margin">B.C. 502</note> the town capitulated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the fate of the Aurunci was no less awful from their having surrendered their city than if it had been stormed. Their chief men were beheaded, and the rest of the colonists were sold as slaves.<note>Literally <quote>under the crown,</quote> meaning a chaplet placed on the head of a captive as an indication that he was a part of the spoils.</note> The town was razed; its land was sold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls obtained a triumph, more because they had heavily avenged Rome's wrongs than because of the magnitude of the war which they had successfully concluded.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year after had as its consuls Postumius<note type="margin">B.C. 501</note> Cominius and Titus Largius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In this year, during the celebration of the games at Rome, the Sabine youths, in a spirit of wantonness, forcibly abducted certain harlots. Men gathered hastily and there was a brawl which was almost a battle, and, trifling as its origin was, it seemed to threaten a fresh outbreak of the war.<note>Despite the apparently conclusive victory recorded in chap. xvi. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Besides the Sabine peril, it was generally known that the thirty Latin cities had already conspired, at the instigation of Octavius Mamilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These grave apprehensions having occasioned a general anxiety, the appointment of a dictator was suggested, for the first time. But there is no general agreement as to the year, or which consuls were distrusted as being of the Tarquinian faction &mdash;for this is included in the tradition &mdash;or who it was that was first named dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the oldest writers, however, I find it said that Titus Largius was the first to be made dictator, and that Spurius Cassius was <pb id="p.277"/>master of the horse. They chose men of consular<note type="margin">B.C. 501</note> rank, for so the law prescribed which had been passed to regulate the selection of a dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I am therefore the more disposed to believe that Largius, a consular, rather than Manius Valerius, the son of Marcus and grandson of Volesus, a man who had not yet held the consulship, was assigned to be the director and superior of consuls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and indeed if men had been specially desirous of choosing the dictator from that family, they would much sooner have selected Marcus Valerius the father, a man of proven worth and an ex-consul.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When they had named a dictator for the first time at Rome, and men saw the axes borne before him, a great fear came over the plebs and caused them to be more zealous in obeying orders. For there was no recourse in this case, as with the consuls, who shared the powers of their office equally, to the assistance of the man's colleague, nor was there any appeal nor any help anywhere but in scrupulous obedience.<note>But in <date value="-300">300 B.C.</date> a <hi rend="italics">lex Valeria de provocatione</hi> gave the people the right to appeal from the dictator.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Sabines, too, were inspired with fear by the appointment of the dictator, especially since they believed that it was on their account that he had been created.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Accordingly they sent legates to treat for peace. When they requested the dictator and the senate to pardon an error committed by young men, the answer was given that to pardon young men was possible, but not old men who contrived one war after another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nevertheless negotiations for peace were begun, and it would have been granted to the Sabines, could they have made up their minds to guarantee, as the Romans demanded, the sum which had been expended for the war. Hostilities were declared, but a tacit truce preserved a state of peace through the year.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the consulship of Servius Sulpicius and<note type="margin">B.C. 500-499</note> Manius Tullius nothing worthy of note occurred. They were succeeded by Titus Aebutius and Gaius Vetusius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During their year of office Fidenae was besieged, Crustumeria taken; Praeneste went over from the Latins to the Romans, and it was no longer possible to postpone the Latin war, which had now been smouldering for several years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Aulus Postumius as dictator,<note>Postumius had not held the consulship, which in chap. xviii. 5 Livy stated to have been a necessary qualification for the dictatorship.</note> and Titus Aebutius as master of the horse, set out with large forces of infantry and cavalry, and at Lake Regillus, in the territory of Tusculum, met the enemy's advancing column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans had learned that the Tarquinii were with the Latin army, and were so enraged that they could not be withheld from instantly attacking, and the battle itself, in consequence of this report, was fought with a good deal more determination and bitterness than any other had been.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the leaders were not only in the field to direct the engagement with their strategy, but joined battle and fought in their own persons. Almost none of the nobles on either side came off unscathed, except the Roman dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Postumius was in the front rank encouraging his men and forming them, when Tarquinius Superbus, though now burdened with years and broken in strength, rode full-tilt against him. But the old man received a thrust in the side, and his followers rushed in and rescued him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Similarly on the other wing, Aebutius, the master of the horse, charged Octavius Mamilius. But the Tusculan commander <pb id="p.281"/>saw him coming, and he too spurred his horse to<note type="margin">B.C. 500-499</note> the encounter;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and so great was the force in their levelled lances as they met, that the arm of Aebutius was transfixed, while Mamilius was struck in the breast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Mamilius was received by the Latins within their second line: Aebutius, being unable to manage a weapon with his wounded arm, retired from the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Latin leader, not a jot discouraged by his wound, urged on the fighting, and, because he saw that his men were in retreat, called up a cohort of Roman exiles, commanded by a son of Lucius Tarquinius,<note>Of the sons of Tarquinius, Sextus's death is mentioned in I. lx. 2 and that of Arruns in II. vi. 9. This must therefore have been Titus (I. lvi. 6).</note> and these, fighting with greater fury on account of the loss of their property and native land, restored the battle for a while.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Romans were now beginning to give way in that part of the field, Marcus Valerius, Publicola's brother, espied the young Tarquinius, who was boldly inviting attack in the front rank of the exiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Valerius found in his brother's glory an additional incentive, and resolving that the family which had the honour of expelling the tyrants should also gain the credit for their death, he dug his spurs into his charger and rode at Tarquinius with levelled spear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Tarquinius drew back within the company of his followers to avoid his desperate antagonist. Valerius was plunging blindly into the exiles' line when one of them attacked him in the flank and ran him through the body. But the rider's wound did not check the career of his horse, and the dying Roman came down in a heap upon the ground with his arms upon him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the dictator Postumius perceived that so brave a soldier had fallen, that the exiles
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> were advancing boldly at the double, and that his troops were checked and were giving <pb id="p.283"/>ground, he issued orders to his own cohort, a picked<note type="margin">B.C. 500-499</note> body of men which he kept about his person as a guard, that if they saw any Roman running away they should treat him as an enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Being thus between two dangers, the Romans faced about to meet the foe, and the battle-line was formed again. The cohort of the dictator then entered the engagement for the first time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With fresh strength and spirit they attacked the weary exiles and cut them to pieces. Then began another combat between leaders. The Latin general, perceiving that the cohort of the exiles was nearly cut off by the Roman dictator, took a few companies of his reserves and hurried them to the front.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As they came marching up, Titus Herminius, the lieutenant, caught sight of them, and in their midst, conspicuous in dress and accoutrements, he saw and recognized Mamilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whereupon he hurled himself upon the enemy's commander with so much more violence than the master of the horse had done a little before, that not only did he pierce Mamilius through the side and slay him with a single lunge, but in the act of stripping the body of his antagonist he was himself struck by a hostile javelin, and after being borne off in the moment of victory to the Roman camp, expired just as they began to dress his wound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The dictator then dashed up to the knights and besought them, since the foot-soldiers were exhausted, to dismount and enter the fight. They obeyed: they leaped down from their horses, hastened to the front, and covered the front-rankers with their shields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It restored at once the courage of the foot to see the young nobles on even terms with themselves and sharing in the danger. Then at last the <pb id="p.285"/>Latins received a check, and their battle-line was<note type="margin">B.C. 500-499</note> forced to yield.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The knights had their horses brought up that they might be able to pursue the enemy, and they were followed by the infantry. Then the dictator, neglecting no help, divine or human, is said to have vowed a temple to Castor, and to have promised rewards to the soldiers who should be first and second to enter the camp of the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and so great was the ardour of the Romans, that with a single rush they routed their opponents and took their camp. Such was the battle at Lake Regillus. The dictator and his master of the horse returned to the City and triumphed.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the latter year a temple to Saturn was dedicated and the Saturnalia was established as a festal day.<note>The Saturnalia proper fell on December 17, though as many as seven days came to be devoted to the popular celebration of the festival (Macrobius, I. X. 24), which was a sort of carnival. As an old Italic feast it probably originated earlier than Livy thought. See Macrobius I. viii. 1.</note> Next Aulus Postumius and Titus Verginius were made consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was not until this year, according to some authorities I have consulted, that the battle of Lake Regillus was fought. They say that Aulus Postumius, because his colleague was of doubtful loyalty, resigned the consulship, and was then made dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> One is involved in so many uncertainties regarding dates by the varying order of the magistrates in different lists that it is impossible to make out which consuls followed which, or what was done in each particular year, when not only events but even authorities are so shrouded in antiquity.

				<p>At the next election Appius Claudius and Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> Servilius were chosen consuls. This year was marked by the announcement of Tarquinius's death. He died at Cumae, whither he had gone to the court of Aristodemus after the downfall of the Latin cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These tidings cheered the Fathers and encouraged the plebs. But the Fathers were too inconsiderate, in consequence of their rejoicing at this event; and the plebs, who up to this time had been most studiously deferred to, began to feel the oppression of the nobles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same year the colony of Signia, which King Tarquinius had planted, was recruited with new colonists and established for the second time. At Rome twenty-one tribes were formed. The temple of Mercury was consecrated on the fifteenth of May.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With the Volscian race there had been during the Latin war neither peace nor open hostilities; for while the Volsci had raised levies to send to the aid of the Latins, had the Roman dictator not moved quickly, yet the Romans did move quickly, that they might not have to fight both nations in the same battle Upon this quarrel the consuls led their legions into the country of the Volsci, who, not expecting to be held to account for their design, were surprised and overwhelmed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had no thought of resisting, and surrendered as hostages three hundred children of the nobility of Cora and Pometia, and so the legions were withdrawn without a conflict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Yet it was not long before the Volsci, being relieved of their alarm, resumed their native duplicity; again they made secret preparations for war, and formed a military alliance with the Hernici, while they also sent out envoys, this <pb id="p.289"/>way and that, to instigate the Latins to rebellion.<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the disaster which had recently befallen the Latins at Lake Regillus so filled them with rage and hate against anyone who advised them to go to war, that they did not even abstain from violating an embassy, but seized the Volsci and brought them to Rome. There they delivered them up to the consuls with the information that the Volsci and the Hernici were preparing to attack the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When this service had been reported to the senate the Fathers were so grateful that they released to the Latins six thousand captives, and referred the question of a treaty, which they had all but refused in perpetuity, to the incoming magistrates.<note>Neither captives nor treaty were mentioned in chap. XX., and Livy seems here to be following a different authority, possibly Valerius of Antium, whom at XXXIII. X. 8 he accuses of exaggerating numbers.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, indeed, the Latins rejoiced at the action they had taken, and the advocates of peace were in great repute. They sent a golden crown as a gift to the Capitoline Jupiter. With the envoys who brought the gift came the captives who had been restored to their friends, a vast attendant multitude.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Proceeding to the homes of those whom they had severally served, they thanked them for the liberality and consideration which had been shown them in their adversity, and entered into covenants of hospitality with them. Never before had there been so close a union, both official and personal, between the Latin name and the Roman state.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But not only was war with the Volsci imminent; the citizens were at loggerheads among themselves, and internal dissensions between the Fathers and the plebs had burst into a blaze of hatred, chiefly on account of those who had been bound over to service for their debts.<note>The word <hi rend="italics">nexus</hi> was used (1) of one who had borrowed money by <quote>binding</quote> himself to work out the debt as a virtual slave of his creditor, if unable to repay the money; (2) of one so <quote>bound</quote> and actually serving.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These men complained loudly that while they were abroad <pb id="p.291"/>fighting for liberty and dominion they had been enslaved<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> and oppressed at home by fellow-citizens, and that the freedom of the plebeians was more secure in war than in peace, amongst enemies than amongst citizens. This bitter feeling, which was growing spontaneously, the notable calamity of one man fanned into a flame.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Old, and bearing the marks of all his misfortunes, the man rushed into the Forum. His dress was covered with filth, and the condition of his body was even worse, for he was pale and half dead with emaciation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Besides this, his straggling beard and hair had given a savage look to his countenance. He was recognized nevertheless, despite the hideousness of his appearance, and the word went round that he had commanded companies; yet other military honours were openly ascribed to him by the compassionate bystanders, and the man himself displayed the scars on his breast which bore testimony to his honourable service in various battles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they asked the reason of his condition and his squalor, he replied, while the crowd gathered about him much as though it were an assembly, that during his service in the Sabine war not only had the enemy's depredations deprived him of his crops, but his cottage had been burnt, all his belongings plundered, and his flocks driven off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the taxes had been levied, in an untoward moment for him, and he had contracted debts. When these had been swelled by usury, they had first stripped him of the farm which had been his father's and his grandfather's, then of the remnants of his property, and finally like an infection they had attacked his person, and he had been carried off by his creditor, not to slavery, but to the prison and the <pb id="p.293"/>torturechamber.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then showed them his back, disfigured<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> with the wales of recent scourging. The sight of these things and the man's recital produced a mighty uproar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The disturbance was no longer confined to the Forum, but spread in all directions through the entire City. Those who had been bound over, whether in chains or not, broke out into the streets from every side, and implored the Quirites to protect them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At no point was there any lack of volunteers to join the rising; everywhere crowds were streaming through the different streets and shouting as they hurried to the Forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Great was the peril of those senators who happened to be in the Forum and fell in with the mob, which would not indeed have stopped short of violence had not the consuls, Publius Servilius and Appius Claudius, hurriedly intervened to put down the insurrection. But the crowd turned on them and displayed their chains and other hideous tokens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These, they cried, were the rewards they had earned, and they bitterly rehearsed the campaigns they had each served in various places. They demanded, in a manner much more threatening than suppliant, that the consuls should convene the senate; and they surrounded the Curia, that they might them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> selves witness and control the deliberations of the state. The consuls succeeded in collecting only a few of the senators whom chance had thrown in their way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The rest were afraid to enter not only the Curia but even the Forum, and nothing could be done because those present were too few. Whereat the people concluded they were being flouted and put off, and that the missing senators were absent not from accident, nor fear, but with the intent to hinder action, and that the consuls themselves were paltering; <pb id="p.295"/>nor did they doubt that their misery was made a<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> jest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> A little more and not even the majesty of the consuls could have held in check the angry crowd, when the absent Fathers, uncertain whether they should incur more danger by holding back or by coming forward, finally came into the senate, and the required number being at length assembled, not only the senators, but even the consuls themselves were unable to agree.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Appius, a headstrong man, was for settling the matter by the exercise of consular authority; when one or two men had been arrested, the others, he said, would calm down. Servilius, more inclined to gentle measures, believed that it was safer, as well as easier, to assuage their fury than to quell it.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the midst of the debate a greater alarm arose from a new quarter, for some Latin horsemen galloped up with the disquieting news that a Volscian army was advancing to attack the City. This report awoke very different feelings &mdash;so completely had their dissensions divided the state into two &mdash;in the Fathers and the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The commons were jubilant; they said that the gods were taking a hand in punishing the arrogance of the senators. They encouraged one another not to give in their names; it would be better to perish all together than alone. Let the Fathers serve, let the Fathers take up arms, that those might incur the hazards of war who received its rewards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Curia, on the other hand, was downcast and dismayed. In their twofold fear &mdash;of their fellow-citizens and of the enemy &mdash;they begged Servilius the consul, whose character appealed more to the people than did that of his colleague, that he would extricate the state from <pb id="p.297"/>the fearful perils with which it was beset.<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon the consul adjourned the senate and went before the people. There he declared that the Fathers were anxious to consult the interests of the plebs, but that their deliberations concerning that very important part &mdash;but only a part after all &mdash;of the state had been broken off by their fears for the entire nation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was impossible, when the enemy was almost at the city gates, to consider anything before the war; and even if there should be some slight respite in that regard, it was neither to the credit of the plebs to refuse to arm for their country, unless they should first receive a recompense, nor honourable to the Fathers to be driven by fear into passing measures for the relief of their fellow-citizens which they would have passed later of their own free will.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then confirmed his speech by a proclamation in which he commanded that no one should hold a Roman citizen in chains or durance so that he should not be able to give in his name to the consuls, and that none should seize or sell a soldier's property so long as he was in camp, or interfere with his children or his grandchildren.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this edict had been published, the debtors who were present at once enlisted, and from every quarter, all over the City, they hastened from the houses where their creditors no longer had the right to detain them, and rushed into the Forum to take the military oath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was a great throng, nor were there any soldiers whose courage and usefulness in the Volscian war were more conspicuous. The consul led his troops against the enemy, and pitched his camp at a short distance from theirs.
				</p> <pb id="p.299"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next night the Volsci, relying on the<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> lack of harmony among the Romans, attacked their camp on the chance that the darkness might encourage desertions or treachery. But the sentries perceived them, the army was roused, and, the signal being given, rushed to arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thus the design of the Volsci came to naught, and the remainder of the night was devoted by both armies to sleeping. On the following day at dawn the Volsci filled up the trenches and assaulted the rampart, and soon they were everywhere pulling down the palisades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On every side the consul's men were clamouring for the signal &mdash;none more loudly than the debtors. He waited a moment, to test the temper of the soldiers. When there could no longer be any doubt of their great ardour, he finally gave the command for a sortie and released them, eager for the fray. At the very first onset the enemy were routed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While they ran, the foot-soldiers struck at them from behind as long as they could keep up the pursuit; then the horsemen drove them panic-stricken clear to their camp. Soon the camp itself had been surrounded by the legions, and when the Volsci had fled from it in terror, it was taken and plundered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next day Servilius led his forces to Suessa Pometia, where the enemy had taken refuge, and within a few days took the town and gave it up to be sacked.<note>But it had already been razed, as we read in chap. xvii. 6 &mdash; another indication that Livy is reproducing different versions of the same story (see chap. xvi. 9 and note).</note> This yielded some slight relief to the soldiers, who needed it
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> badly. The consul led his army back to Rome, with great honour to himself. As he was setting out on his return thither ambassadors approached him from <pb id="p.301"/>the Volsci of Ecetra, who were alarmed at their own<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> prospects, in view of the capture of Pometia. A decree of the senate granted them peace, but took away their land.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Directly after this the Sabines also caused an alarm at Rome &mdash;for it was indeed a turmoil rather than war. One night the City got word that a Sabine army bent on pillage had come as near as the river Anio, and was there plundering and burning farmhouses right and left.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans at once dispatched in that direction all their cavalry, under Aulus Postumius, who had been dictator in the Latin war. He was followed by the consul Servilius with a picked body of foot-soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Many stragglers were cut off by the cavalry and, when the column of infantry drew near, no resistance was offered by the Sabine troops. Exhausted not only by their march but by their night of pillage as well, a great part of them had gorged themselves in the farmhouses with food and wine, and had scarcely vigour enough to run away.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A single night having sufficed for hearing of the Sabine war and ending it, men's hopes next day ran high that peace was now assured in every quarter, when legates from the Aurunci appeared before the senate to say that unless the territory of the Volsci were evacuated they should declare war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Auruncan army had set out from home at the same time with the legates, and the report that it had already been seen not far from Aricia threw Rome into such a state of confusion that it was impossible to bring the matter regularly before the senate, or to return a peaceful answer to a people who had already drawn the sword, while they themselves were also arming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They marched on Aricia in fighting order, joined <pb id="p.303"/>battle with the Aurunci not far from the town, and<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> in a single engagement finished the war.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having routed the Aurunci, and having been, within a few days, victorious in so many wars, the Romans were looking for the help which the consul had promised and the senate guaranteed, when Appius, partly out of native arrogance, partly to discredit his colleague, began to pronounce judgment with the utmost rigour in suits to recover debts. In consequence, not only were those who had been bound over before delivered up to their creditors, but others were bound over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whenever this happened to a soldier he would appeal to the other consul. The people flocked to the house of Servilius: it was he who had made them promises; it was he whom they reproached, as each rehearsed his services in the wars and displayed the scars he had received. They demanded that he should either lay the matter before the senate or lend his aid as consul to his fellow-citizens, as general to his soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They moved the consul by this plea, but the situation forced him to temporize, so vehemently was the other side supported, not only by his colleague, but by the entire party of the nobles. And so he steered a middle course, and neither avoided the dislike of the plebs nor gained the goodwill of the Fathers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These considered him a pusillanimous consul and an agitator, while the commons held him to be dishonest; and it was soon apparent that he was as cordially hated as Appius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls had got into a dispute as to which should dedicate the temple to Mercury. The senate referred the case to the people for decision. Whichever consul should, by command of the people, be entrusted with the dedication was to have charge <pb id="p.305"/>of the corn-supply, to establish a guild of merchants,<note>Mercury was the patron of trade.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> and perform the solemn rites in the presence of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> pontifex. The people assigned the dedication to Marcus Laetorius, a centurion of the first rank &mdash;a choice which would readily be understood as intended not so much to honour Laetorius, to whom a commission had been given which was too exalted for his station in life, as to humiliate the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> consuls. Appius and the Fathers were furious then, if they had not been before; but the plebeians had plucked up heart and threw themselves into the struggle with far more spirit than they had shown at
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> first. For, despairing of help from consuls and senate, they no sooner beheld a debtor being haled away than they flew to his assistance from every
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> side. It was impossible for the consul's decree to be heard above the din and shouting, and when it had been pronounced nobody obeyed it. Violence was the order of the day, and fear and danger had quite shifted from the debtors to the creditors, who were singled out and maltreated by large numbers in full sight of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> consul. To crown these troubles came the fear of a Sabine invasion. A levy was decreed, but no one enlisted. Appius stormed and railed at the insidious arts of his colleague, who, he said, to make himself popular, was betraying the state by his inactivity; and to his refusal to give judgment for debt was adding a fresh offence in refusing to hold the levy as the senate had
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> directed. Nevertheless the welfare of the state was not wholly forgotten, nor the authority of the consulate abandoned; he would himself, single-handed, assert both his own and the senate's
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> majesty. When the usual daily throng of lawless men was standing about him, he gave orders <pb id="p.307"/>to seize one who was a conspicuous leader in their<note type="margin">B.C. 495</note> disturbances. The lictors were already dragging the man away, when he appealed; nor would the consul have granted the appeal, for there was no question what the decision of the people would be, had not his obstinacy been with difficulty overcome, more by the advice and influence of the nobles than by the popular outcry, so steeled was he to endure men's
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> hate. From that moment the trouble grew worse each day, and not only were there open disturbances, but what was far more pernicious, secret gatherings and conferences. At last the consuls whom the plebeians so hated went out of office. Servilius had the goodwill of neither party, but Appius was in high esteem with the senators.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Aulus Verginius and Titus Vetusius then<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> entered upon the consulship. Whereat the plebs, uncertain what sort of consuls they would prove to be, held nightly gatherings, some on the Esquiline and other son the Aventine, lest if they met in the Forum they might be frightened into adopting ill-considered measures, and manage all their business rashly and at haphazard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This seemed to the consuls, as indeed it was, a mischievous practice. They laid the matter before the Fathers, but their report could not be discussed in an orderly fashion, so tumultuously was it received, with shouts from every part of the house and expressions of indignation from the senators, that a thing which ought to have been settled by an exercise of consular authority should be invidiously referred by the consuls to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was evident that if only there were magistrates in the nation there would have been no assembly in Rome but the assembly of the people; as it was, the <pb id="p.309"/>government was broken up into a thousand separate<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> curias and meetings. One single <hi rend="italics">man</hi> &mdash;a more significant word than <hi rend="italics">consul</hi> &mdash;of the type of Appius Claudius, would have dispersed those assemblages in a moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the consuls, thus upbraided, asked the Fathers what then they desired them to do, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> promised that their conduct of the matter should be no whit less strenuous and stern than the senate wished, it was resolved that they should hold a levy with the utmost severity: it was idleness that made the plebeians lawless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having adjourned the senate, the consuls mounted the tribunal and cited the young men by name. When no one answered to his name, the crowd, which surrounded the speaker as in a public meeting, declared that it was impossible to deceive the commons any longer;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the consuls would never have a single soldier unless a public guarantee were given: liberty must first be restored to every man before arms were given him, that he might fight for his country and his fellow-citizens, not for a master.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was clear to the consuls what the senate had bidden them do; but of all those who had uttered truculent speeches within the walls of the curia they found not one at their side to share their odium, and they saw before them a terrible struggle with the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly they thought it best, before proceeding to extremities, to consult the senate a second time. When it met, the youngest senators all rushed up in hot haste to the seats of the consuls, bidding them to abdicate their office and to lay down an authority which they lacked the spirit to support.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having sufficiently weighed both the courses open to them,<note>(1) to persuade the senate to content the people; (2) to coerce the people.</note> the consuls finally said: <quote>Lest you should say that you had not been warned, <pb id="p.311"/>Conscript Fathers, we are on the verge of a great mutiny.<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> We demand that those who are loudest in accusing us of cowardice stand by us while we hold the levy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The most severe amongst you, since such is your pleasure, shall guide our procedure.</quote> They returned to the tribunal, and purposely commanded to cite by name one of those who were present. When he stood still without answering, in the midst of a little knot of men who, fearing the possibility of violence, had gathered round him, the consuls sent a lictor to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The lictor was driven back. Whereupon, with a cry of <quote>Shame!</quote> the senators who were attending the consul rushed down from the tribunal to assist the lictor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when the mob turned from the officer, whom they had merely prevented from arresting the man, and assailed the senators, the consuls intervened and checked the brawl, in which no stones had been thrown nor any weapons used, and there were more shouts and expressions of rage than hurts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate was convened in confusion, and they deliberated in still greater confusion. Those who had been roughly handled demanded an investigation, and all the more violent members urged the resolution, not only with speeches but with shouts and uproar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When at length their passions had subsided, and the consuls berated them for showing as little sanity in the Curia as the people had shown in the Forum, they began to deliberate in an orderly manner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Three proposals were made. Publius Verginius advised against a general relief: only those who, relying on the promise of Publius Servilius the consul, had fought in the Volscian, Auruncan, and Sabine wars should, he thought, be considered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Titus Largius held that this was no time for merely requiting services; <pb id="p.313"/>the whole commons was submerged in debt, and<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> the situation could not be remedied unless provision were made for all; indeed, if some were treated in one way and some in another, it would heighten the discontent instead of allaying it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Appius Claudius, naturally harsh, and rendered savage by the hatred of the plebs on the one hand and the praises of the Fathers on the other, said that it was not misery but licence that had stirred up so great a hubbub, and that wantonness was what ailed the plebs rather than anger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That was precisely the mischief which the appeal occasioned; for the consuls might threaten but could not command, when those who had shared in the guilt might be constituted the court of appeal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>Come,</quote> said he, <quote>let us appoint a dictator, from whom there is no appeal.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> At once this frenzy which has now set everything ablaze will be stilled. Let anybody strike a lictor then, knowing that the right to scourge and behead him rests with that one man whose majesty he has violated!</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many felt, and with reason, that the proposal of Appius was stern and cruel; on the other hand those of Verginius and Largius were inexpedient because of the precedent; particularly that of Largius, since it destroyed all credit. The most reasonable and moderate plan, in its regard for both sides, was held to be that of Verginius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But owing to party spirit and consideration for private interests, things which have always been hurtful to public deliberations and always will be, Appius prevailed, and came very near
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> to being himself appointed dictator, a step which would infallibly have estranged the commons, and that at a most dangerous moment, since the Volsci, the Aequi, and the Sabines were all, as it <pb id="p.315"/>chanced, up in arms at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the consuls and<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> the older senators saw to it that a magistracy rendered formidable by its paramount authority should be committed to a man of gentle disposition, and chose for dictator Manius Valerius, son of Volesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The plebs, though they perceived that it was against themselves that the creation of a dictator was aimed, still, since it was through a law proposed by a brother of Valerius that they possessed the right of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> appeal,<note>That is to say, in general; from a dictator, however, there was no appeal until a later period.</note> they had no fear of any harsh or oppressive act on the part of one of that family. An edict which the dictator soon promulgated strengthened their confidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It conformed essentially to the edict of Servilius; but Valerius and the office he held commanded greater confidence, and, ceasing to struggle, men gave in their names. So large an army had never been enrolled before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Ten legions were embodied; each consul was given three of these, and the dictator had four.
				</p> 
				<p>Nor could war be deferred any longer, for the Aequi had invaded Latin territory. Emissaries from the Latins begged the senate either to send them help or permit them to take up arms themselves in defence of their country.<note>Apparently the Latins, perhaps after the battle of Lake Regillus (chap. xix. f.), had been denied the right to make war, save at the pleasure of the Romans.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It seemed safer that the Latins should be defended without arming them, than that they should be suffered to resume their weapons. Vetusius the consul was dispatched to them, and this ended the pillaging. The Aequi left the fields, and trusting more to situation than to arms, secured themselves on the summits of the ridges.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The other consul marched against the Volsci. Lest he too might waste his time, he provoked the <pb id="p.317"/>enemy, chiefly by ravaging their lands, to bring their<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> camp nearer and do battle with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In the plain between the camps the two armies formed their lines, each in front of its own stockade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In numbers the Volsci were somewhat superior, and accordingly they came on in a loose and careless order. The Roman consul did not advance, nor did he allow a response to the enemy's shout. He commanded his men to plant their spears in the ground and stand still until the enemy had come to close quarters; then they were to assail them with all their might, and settle the question with the sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Volsci, weary with running and shouting, hurled themselves upon the Romans, who seemed to be numb with fear. But when the attackers found that their charge was firmly met and saw the swords flash in their faces, they were no whit less confounded than if they had fallen into an ambush, and turned and fled; and even flight was beyond their strength, since they had been running as they entered the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Romans on the contrary, having stood at ease at the beginning of the fight, were fresh and strong; they readily caught up with the exhausted Volsci, and having taken their camp with a rush, pursued their enemies beyond it to Velitrae, where vanquished and victors burst into the city in one body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> More blood was shed there, in the promiscuous slaughter of all sorts of people, than had been in the battle itself. A very few were granted quarter, having come without arms and given themselves up.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on in the Volscian country, the dictator put to rout the Sabines &mdash;by far Rome's most important enemy &mdash;and captured their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Attacking with his cavalry, he <pb id="p.319"/>made havoc of their centre, which, in extending<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> their wings too widely, they had unduly weakened; and in the midst of the disorder the infantry assailed them. By a single rush the camp was captured and the war ended.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From the time of the fight at Lake Regillus no other battle of those days was more famous. The dictator entered the City in triumph. In addition to the customary honours a place was assigned him in the circus, for himself and his descendants, to witness the games, and a curule chair was put there for him.<note>That this apparently unique distinction was actually conferred on the Valerii is confirmed by an honorary inscription (<hi rend="italics">C.I.L.</hi> i. 284).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Volsci, having been conquered, were deprived of the Veliternian land; colonists were sent from the City to Velitrae and a colony was planted. Soon after this there was a battle with the Aequi, though the consul was against it, for it was necessary to approach the enemy from unfavourable ground;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but his men accused him of dragging out the campaign in order that the dictator might relinquish his office before their return to the City, and his promises thus come to naught, as the consul's promises had done before. Vetusius was thus driven to order an advance at random, up the mountains which confronted him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This ill-advised measure the enemy's cowardice turned into success, for before the Romans had come within a spear's throw, the Aequi, appalled at their audacity, abandoned the camp which they had maintained in a highly defensible position, and threw themselves down into the valleys on the other side. There the Romans gained considerable booty and a bloodless victory.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Though a threefold success had thus been gained in the war, neither senators nor plebeians had been relieved of their anxiety respecting the outcome of <pb id="p.321"/>affairs at home, so great was the artfulness, as well<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> as influence, with which the money-lenders had laid their plans to baffle not only the commons but even the dictator himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For after the return of the consul Vetusius, the first business which Valerius brought before the senate was in behalf of the victorious people, that the senate might declare its policy regarding the treatment of those bound over for debt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This resolution having failed to pass, the dictator said: <quote>I do not please you in urging harmony. You will soon wish, I warrant you, that the Roman plebs had men like me for their spokesmen. For my own part I will not be the means of further disappointing my fellow citizens, nor will I be dictator to no purpose.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Internal strife and foreign war made this office necessary to the nation; peace has been secured abroad, but at home it is being thwarted; I will play my part as a private citizen rather than as a dictator, when the mutiny breaks out.</quote> So saying he left the Curia and laid down his office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was evident to the people that resentment of their wrongs had caused him to resign the magistracy. And so, as though he had kept his pledge (for it had not been his fault that it was not being carried out), they attended him as he retired to his house with manifestations of favour and approval.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereupon the senators became alarmed, fearing that if the army should be disbanded there would again be secret gatherings and conspiracies. And so, although the levy had been held by order of the dictator, yet because the men had been sworn in by the consuls they regarded the troops as bound by their oath, and, under the pretext that the Aequi <pb id="p.323"/>had recommenced hostilities, gave orders to lead the<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> legions out of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This brought the revolt to a head. At first it is said, there was talk of killing the consuls, that men might thus be freed from their oath; but when it was explained to them that no sacred obligation could be dissolved by a crime, they took the advice of one Sicinius, and without orders from the consuls withdrew to the Sacred Mount, which is situated across the river Anio, three miles from the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> &mdash;This version of the story is more general than that given by Piso, namely that the Aventine was the place of their secession.<note>Livy appears to have had the other tradition in mind when he wrote iii. liv. 9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;There, without any leader, they fortified their camp with stockade and trench, and continued quietly, taking nothing but what they required for their subsistance, for several days, neither receiving provocation nor giving any.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was a great panic in the City, and mutual apprehension caused the suspension of all activities. The plebeians, having been abandoned by their friends, feared violence at the hands of the senators; the senators feared the plebeians who were left behind in Rome, being uncertain whether they had rather they stayed or went.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Besides, how long would the seceding multitude continue peaceable? What would happen next if some foreign war should break out in the interim?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Assuredly no hope was left save in harmony amongst the citizens, and this they concluded they must restore to the state by fair means or foul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They therefore decided to send as an ambassador to the commons Agrippa Menenius, an eloquent man and dear to the plebeians as being one of themselves by birth.<note>If Menenius was a plebeian, it is improbable that he was also, as Livy rather implies, a senator. <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> i. 11 and note.</note> On being admitted to the camp he is said merely to have related the following apologue, in the quaint and uncouth <pb id="p.325"/>style of that age:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the days when man's members<note type="margin">B.C. 494</note> did not all agree amongst themselves, as is now the case, but had each its own ideas and a voice of its own, the other parts thought it unfair that they should have the worry and the trouble and the labour of providing everything for the belly, while the belly remained quietly in their midst with nothing to do but to enjoy the good things which they bestowed upon it; they therefore conspired together that the hands should carry no food to the mouth, nor the mouth accept anything that was given it, nor the teeth grind up what they received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> While they sought in this angry spirit to starve the belly into submission, the members themselves and the whole body were reduced to the utmost weakness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hence it had become clear that even the belly had no idle task to perform, and was no more nourished than it nourished the rest, by giving out to all parts of the body that by which we live and thrive, when it has been divided equally amongst the veins and is enriched with digested food &mdash;that is, the blood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Drawing a parallel from this to show how like was the internal dissension of the bodily members to the anger of the plebs against the Fathers, he prevailed upon the minds of his hearers.<note>The same apologue is found in Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Mem.</hi>II. iii. 18; Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Off.</hi> III. v. 22; and St. Paul, <hi rend="italics">Cor.</hi>I. xii. 12.</note> 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Steps<note type="margin">B.C. 493</note> were then taken towards harmony, and a compromise was effected on these terms: the plebeians were to have magistrates of their own, who should be inviolable, and in them should lie the right to aid the people against the consuls, nor should any senator be permitted to take this magistracy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so they chose two <quote>tribunes of the people,</quote> Gaius Licinius and Lucius Albinus. These appointed three others to be their colleagues. Amongst the latter, <pb id="p.327"/>Sicinius, the promoter of the revolt, was one, as all<note type="margin">B.C. 493</note> agree; the identity of the other two is less certain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some hold that there were only two tribunes elected on the Sacred Mount, and that the law of inviolability was enacted there.<note>In either case the number was five from the year 471 on (lviii. 1), till it was raised to ten in the year 457.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>During the secession of the plebs Spurius Cassius and Postumus Cominius entered upon their consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In this year a treaty was made with the Latin peoples. In order to make this treaty one of the consuls remained in Rome, while the other was dispatched to the Volscian war, and defeated and put to flight the Volsci of Antium. Forcing them to take refuge in the town of Longula, he followed them up and captured the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thence he proceeded to take Polusca, another Volscian town, after which he directed a strong attack upon Corioli. There was in camp at that time amongst the young nobles Gnaeus Marcius, a youth of active mind and ready hand, who afterwards gained the surname of Coriolanus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans were laying siege to Corioli and were intent upon the townspeople shut up within the walls, with no thought of danger from any attack which might be impending from without, when they found themselves suddenly assailed by a Volscian army from Antium, and simultaneously by the besieged, who made a sortie from the town. It happened that Marcius was on guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Taking a picked body of men he not only repelled the sally, but boldly forced his way through the open gate, and having spread carnage through the adjacent part of the town, caught up a firebrand on the spur of the moment, and threw it upon the buildings which <pb id="p.329"/>overhung the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon the townspeople<note type="margin">B.C. 493</note> raised a shout, mingled with such a wailing of women and children as is generally heard at the first alarm. This brought new courage to the Romans and covered the Volsci with confusion &mdash;as was natural when the city which they had come to relieve was taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thus the men of Antium were routed, and Corioli was won. So completely did the glory of Marcius overshadow the consul's fame, that, were it not for the record on a bronze column of the treaty with the Latins which was struck by Spurius Cassius alone, in the absence of his colleague, men would have forgotten that Postumus Cominius had waged war on the Volsci.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>That same year saw the death of Agrippa Menenius, a man who throughout his life had been equally beloved by patricians and plebeians, and who after the secession was even dearer to the commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This mediator and umpire of civil harmony, this ambassador of the senators to the people, this restorer of the plebs to Rome, did not leave sufficient wealth to pay for a funeral. He was buried by the commons, who contributed a <hi rend="italics">sextans</hi><note>A <hi rend="italics">sextans</hi> was the sixth part of an as, or pound of copper.</note> each to the cost.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls next chosen were Titus<note type="margin">B.C. 492-491</note> Geganius and Publius Minucius. This year, though there was no war to occasion trouble from without and the breach at home had been healed, another and a much more serious misfortune befell the nation;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for first the price of corn went up, from men's failure to cultivate the fields during the withdrawal of the plebs; and this was followed by a famine, such as comes to a beleaguered city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It would have meant starvation for the slaves, at least, and the plebeians, had not the consuls met the situation by sending <pb id="p.331"/>agents far and wide to buy up corn, not only to<note type="margin">B.C. 492-491</note> Etruria, northwards along the coast from Ostia, and south past the Volsci by sea, all the way to Cumae, but even to Sicily &mdash;so far afield had the enmity of Rome's neighbours driven her to seek for help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When grain had been purchased at Cumae the ships were held back by Aristodemus, the tyrant, in satisfaction for the property of the Tarquinii, whose heir he was. Among the Volsci and Pomptini the agents could not even make any purchases, and they were actually in danger from the violence of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From the Tuscans corn came in by way of the Tiber, and with this the plebs were kept alive. A disastrous war would have been added to the distresses arising from the scarcity of provisions, had not a grievous pestilence descended upon the Volsci just as they were beginning hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Its ravages so terrified the enemy that even after the worst of it was over they did not fully recover from their fear, and the Romans increased the number of colonists at Velitrae and sent out a new colony to Norba, in the mountains, as a stronghold for the Pomptine country.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Next year, in the consulship of Marcus Minucius and Aulus Sempronius, a large quantity of grain was imported from Sicily, and the senate debated at what price it should be sold to the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many thought the time had come for repressing the commons, and resuming the rights which they had violently extorted from the Fathers by secession. Conspicuous among these was Marcius Coriolanus, an enemy to the tribunician power, who said: <quote>If they want corn at the old price let them restore to the senate its ancient rights.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Why do I see plebeian magistrates, why do I, after being sent beneath <pb id="p.333"/>the yoke and ransomed, as it were, from brigands,<note type="margin">B.C. 492-491</note> behold Sicinius in power?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Shall I endure these humiliations any longer than I must? When I would not brook Tarquinius as king, must I brook Sicinius? Let him secede now and call out the plebs; the way lies open to the Sacred Mount and the other hills. Let them seize grain from our fields as they did two years ago. Let them enjoy the corn-prices they have brought about by their own madness.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I make bold to say that this evil plight will so tame them that they will sooner till the land themselves than withdraw under arms and prevent its cultivation by others.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is not so easy to say whether it would have been right to do this, as it is clear, I think, that it lay within the Fathers' power to have made such conditions for reducing the price of corn as to have freed themselves from the tribunician authority and all the terms which they had unwillingly agreed to.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Even the senate deemed the proposal too<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> harsh, and the plebs were so angry that they almost resorted to arms. Starvation, they said, was now being employed against them, as though they were public enemies, and they were being defrauded of their food and sustenance; the imported corn, their only supply, unexpectedly bestowed on them by Fortune, was to be snatched from their mouths unless the tribunes should be delivered up in chains to Gnaeus Marcius, unless he should work his will on the persons of the Roman plebeians; in him a new executioner had risen up against them, who bade them choose between death and slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he came out from the Curia they would have set upon him, had not the tribunes, in the nick of time, appointed a day to try him; whereupon their anger subsided, <pb id="p.335"/>for every man saw that he was himself made his<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> enemy's judge, and held over him the power of life and death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With contempt at first Marcius heard the threats of the tribunes, alleging that the right to help, not to punish, had been granted to that office, and that they were tribunes not of the Fathers, but of the plebs. But the commons had risen in such a storm of anger that the Fathers had to sacrifice one man to appease them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For all that, they resisted the hatred of their adversaries and called upon the private resources of the several senators, as well as the strength of the entire order. At first they tried, by posting their clients<note>The clients were a class distinct both from the plebs and the patricians. To the latter they stood in the feudal relation of vassal to lord. They were perhaps originally citizens of conquered towns, and were recruited by manumissions and immigration.</note> here and there, to frighten persons from coming together for deliberation, in the hope that they might thereby break up their plans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then they came out in a body &mdash;you would have said all the members of the senate were on their trial &mdash;and entreated the plebs to release to them one citizen, one senator; if they were unwilling to acquit him as innocent let them give him up, though guilty, as a favour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But when Marcius himself, on the day appointed for the hearing, failed to appear, men's hearts were hardened against him. Condemned in his absence, he went into exile with the Volsci, uttering threats against his country, and even then breathing hostility. When he came among the Volsci they received him with a kindness which increased from one day to the next, in proportion as he allowed a greater hatred of his own people to appear, and was more and more frequently heard to utter both complaints and threats.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His host was Attius Tullius, at that time by far the foremost of the Volscian name and ever unfriendly to the Romans. And so, spurred on, the one by his inveterate hatred and <pb id="p.337"/>the other by fresh resentment, they took counsel<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> together how they might make war on Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They believed that it would be no easy matter to induce the Volscian commons to take up the arms which they had so often unluckily essayed; the destruction of their young men in oft-repeated wars, and finally by the plague, had, they supposed, broken their spirit; artifice must be invoked, where hate had grown dull with lapse of time, that they might find some new cause of anger to exasperate men's hearts.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It so happened that at Rome preparations were making to repeat the Great Games.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Roman Games (cf. I. xxxv. 9).</note> The reason of the repetition was as follows: at an early hour of the day appointed for the games, before the show had begun, a certain householder had driven his slave, bearing a yoke, through the midst of the circus, scourging the culprit as he went.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The games had then been begun, as though this circumstance had in no way affected their sanctity. Not long after, Titus Latinius, a plebeian, had a dream. He dreamt that Jupiter said that the leading dancer at the games<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the slave who had been scourged through the circus.</note> had not been to his liking; that unless there were a sumptuous repetition of the festival the City would be in danger; that Latinius was to go and announce this to the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Though the man's conscience was by no means at ease, nevertheless the awe he felt at the majesty of the magistrates was too great; he was afraid of becoming a laughing-stock.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Heavy was the price he paid for his hesitation, for a few days later he lost his son. Lest this sudden calamity should leave any uncertainty as to its cause in the mind of the wretched man, the same phantom appeared again before him in his dreams, and asked <pb id="p.339"/>him, as he thought, whether he had been sufficiently<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> repaid for spurning the gods; for a greater recompense was at hand unless he went quickly and informed the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This brought the matter nearer home. Yet he still delayed and put off going, till a violent attack of illness suddenly laid him low.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then at last the anger of the gods taught him wisdom. And so, worn out with his sufferings, past and present, he called a council of his kinsmen and explained to them what he had seen and heard, how Jupiter had so often confronted him in his sleep, and how the threats and anger of the god had been instantly fulfilled in his own misfortunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, with the unhesitating approval of all who were present, he was carried on a litter to the consuls in the Forum; and thence, by their command, to the Curia, where he had no sooner told the same story to the Fathers, greatly to the wonder of them all, when &mdash; lo, another miracle!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For it is related that he who had been carried into the senate-house afflicted in all his members, returned home, after discharging his duty, on his own feet.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Games of the greatest possible splendour were decreed by the senate, and to see them came, at the suggestion of Attius Tullius, a host of Volsci.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before the beginning of the spectacle Tullius, in pursuance of the plan he and Marcius had formed at home, went to the consuls and told them that he had something of public importance which he wished to discuss with them in private.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the bystanders had been removed, <quote>I am loath,</quote> he said, <quote>to tell concerning my countrymen what may discredit them. Still I do not come to charge them with having committed any crime, but to put you on your <pb id="p.341"/>guard lest they should commit one.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The disposition<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> of our people is far more fickle than I could wish.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Many disasters have taught us the truth of this, since it is not to our own merit, but to your patience, that we owe our preservation. A great crowd of Volsci is now in Rome; there are games; the citizens will be intent upon the spectacle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I remember what the Sabine youths did in this City on the same opportunity arising; I tremble lest something ill-advised and rash may happen. It has seemed to me that both on our account and on yours I ought to tell you this beforehand, consuls.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For my own part I intend to go home at once, lest being on the spot I might be implicated in some act or word and be compromised.</quote> With this he departed. The consuls laid before the senate this vague warning which came from so reliable a source.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was the source, as often happens, rather than the story, which induced them to take precautions, even though they might prove superfluous. The senate decreed that the Volsci should leave the City, and heralds were sent about to command them all to depart before nightfall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At first they were stricken with a great alarm, as they hurried this way and that to the houses of their hosts to get their things. But when they had started, their hearts swelled with indignation, that like malefactors and polluted persons, they should have been driven off from the games at a time of festival, and excluded, in a way, from intercourse with men and gods. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As they journeyed on in an almost unbroken line, Tullius, who had gone ahead, arrived before them at the source of the Ferentina. There, when any of their chief men arrived, he met them with words of complaint and <pb id="p.343"/>indignation. These leaders, eagerly drinking in the<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> words with which he ministered to their anger, he conducted and, thanks to their influence, the rest of the throng also, to a field which lay below the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There he launched out upon a speech like a general's harangue. <quote>Though you should forget all else,</quote> he cried, <quote>the ancient wrongs done by the Roman People and the disasters that have overtaken the Volscian race, with what feelings, pray, can you bear the insult which this day has brought to us, making our humiliation serve as the opening of their festival?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Or did you not feel that they were triumphing over you to-day? That you furnished a spectacle to everybody when you departed &mdash;to the citizens, to the strangers, to all the neighbouring nations?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That your wives and children were made a mock in the eyes of the world? What of those who heard the words of the herald? What of those who saw us going away? What of those who have met this ignominious procession? What think you they all supposed, but that we were certainly attainted of some sin; that because, were we to be present at the spectacle, we should pollute the games and incur the god's displeasure &mdash;for that reason we were being expelled from the seat of the righteous and from their gathering and their council?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Moreover, does it not occur to you that we are alive because we hastened to depart? &mdash;if, indeed, this is a departure and not rather a flight. And this City &mdash;do you not regard it as a city of enemies, when if you had delayed there a single day, you would all have had to die?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> War has been declared upon you, and greatly shall they rue it who have been responsible, if you are men.</quote> So, their spontaneous anger fanned to a <pb id="p.345"/>flame, they dispersed to their several homes, and,<note type="margin">B.C. 491</note> every man arousing his own people, they brought about a revolt of the entire Volscian name.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As generals for this war the nations all<note type="margin">B.C. 488</note> agreed in choosing Attius Tullius and Gnaeus Marcius, the Roman exile, who inspired rather more hope than did his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This hope he by no means disappointed, so that it was easy to see that Rome's commanders were a greater source of strength to her than her armies were. Marching first to Circei, he drove out the Roman colonists from that city and turned it over, thus liberated, to the Volsci.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He took Satricum, Longula, Polusca, and Corioli, places which the Romans had recently acquired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then recovered Lavinium, and then, passing over by cross-roads into the Latin Way, captured in succession Corbio, Vetelia, Trebium, Labici, and Pedum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From Pedum he finally led his army against Rome and, pitching his camp at the Cluilian Trenches, five miles from the City, laid waste the Roman territory from that base, sending out guards with the pillagers to preserve intact the farms of the patricians, whether from anger at the plebs, or to sow dissension between them and the Fathers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And no doubt it would have sprung up, so vehemently did the tribunes seek by their
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> accusations to rouse the already headstrong commons against the nation's leaders, but dread of invasion, the strongest bond of harmony, tended to unite their feelings, however they might suspect and dislike one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In this one point they were unable to agree, that the senate and the consuls saw no hope anywhere but in arms, while the plebs preferred anything to war. Spurius Nautius and Sextus <pb id="p.347"/>Furius were now consuls.<note>Livy implies that they were not the immediate successors of the consuls for 491, and in fact he seems to have omitted two sets, Q. Sulpicius Camerinus and Serg. Larcius Flavus (490), and C. Julius Iulus and P. Pinarius Rufus (489), though at III. xxxiii. 1 and v. liv. 5 he reckons in these two years. The missing names are supplied by Dion. Hal. vii. 68 and viii. 1.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> While they were<note type="margin">B.C. 488</note> reviewing their levies and distributing garrisons about the walls and the other places where they had seen fit to place pickets and sentries, a great multitude of people demanding peace first terrified them with their rebellious clamour, and then forced them to call the senate together and propose the sending of envoys to Gnaeus Marcius. The Fathers consented to propose it when they saw that the plebeians were growing discouraged, and ambassadors were sent to Marcius to treat for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Stern was the answer they brought back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If the land of the Volsci were restored to them the question of peace could be taken up; if the Romans wished to enjoy the spoils of war without doing anything, he would forget neither the wrong his fellow-citizens had done him nor the kindness of his hosts, but would strive to show that exile had quickened his courage, not broken it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the same envoys were sent back a second time, they were denied admittance to the camp. Even priests, wearing the appropriate fillets, are said to have gone as suppliants to the enemy's camp, where they were no more able than the envoys had been to alter the determination of Marcius.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the married women gathered in large<note type="margin">B.C. 488-487</note> numbers at the house of Veturia, the mother of Coriolanus, and Volumnia, his wife.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whether this was public policy or woman's fear I cannot find out; in any case they prevailed with them that both Veturia, an aged woman, and Volumnia should take the two little sons of Marcius and go with them to the camp of the enemy; and that, since the swords of the men could not defend the City, the women should defend it with their prayers and tears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they reached <pb id="p.349"/>the camp, and the word came to Coriolanus that a<note type="margin">B.C. 488-487</note> great company of women was at hand, at first, as might have been expected of one whom neither the nation's majesty could move, as represented in its envoys, nor the awfulness of religion, as conveyed to heart and eye by the persons of her priests, he showed even greater obduracy in resisting women's tears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then one of his friends, led by Veturia's conspicuous sadness to single her out from amongst the other women, as she stood between her son's wife and his babies, said: <quote>Unless my eyes deceive me, your mother is here and your wife and children.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Coriolanus started up like a madman from his seat, and running to meet his mother would have embraced her, but her entreaties turned to anger, and she said: <quote>Suffer me to learn, before I accept your embrace, whether I have come to an enemy or a son; whether I am a captive or a mother in your camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Is it this to which long life and an unhappy old age have brought me, that I should behold in you an exile and then an enemy? Could you bring yourself to ravage this country, which gave you birth and reared you?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Did not your anger fall from you, no matter how hostile and threatening your spirit when you came, as you passed the boundary? Did it not come over you, when Rome lay before your eyes: ' Within those walls are my home and my gods, my mother, my wife, and my children?'
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So then, had I not been a mother Rome would not now be besieged! Had I no son I should have died a free woman, in a free land!
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But I can have nothing now to suffer which could be more disgraceful to you or more miserable for myself; nor, wretched though I am, shall I be so for long: it is these you must consider, for whom, if you keep on, untimely death or <pb id="p.351"/>long enslavement is in store.</quote> The embraces of his<note type="margin">B.C. 488-487</note> wife and children, following this speech, and the tears of the entire company of women, and their lamentations for themselves and their country, at last broke through his resolution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He embraced his family and sent them back, and withdrew his forces from before the City. Having then led his army out of Rome's dominions he is said to have perished beneath the weight of resentment which this act caused, by a death which is variously described. I find in Fabius, by far the oldest authority, that Coriolanus lived on to old age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At least he reports that this saying was often on his lips, that exile was a far more wretched thing when one was old. There was no envy of the fame the women had earned, on the part of the men of Rome &mdash;so
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> free was life in those days from disparagement of another's glory &mdash;and to preserve its memory the temple of Fortuna Muliebris was built and dedicated.<note>For another account of Coriolanus, see Dion. Hal. viii. 12 and viii. 17-56.</note>
				</p> 
				<p>Afterwards the Volsci again invaded Roman soil, in conjunction with the Aequi, but these would no longer put up with Attius Tullius for their general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Whereupon the dispute as to whether the Volsci or the Aequi should furnish a commander for the allied army, led to a quarrel, and this to a bloody battle. There the good fortune of the Roman People destroyed two hostile armies in one struggle, which was no less ruinous than it was obstinately fought.

Sicinius got the Volscian war for his command, and Aquilius that with the Hernici &mdash;for they too were up in arms. This year the Hernici were conquered, while the campaign against the Volsci was indecisive.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Spurius Cassius and Proculus Verginius were<note type="margin">B.C. 486-485</note> then made consuls. A treaty was struck with the Hernici, and two-thirds of their land was taken from them. Of this the consul Cassius proposed to divide one half amongst the Latins and the other half amongst the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To this gift he wished to add some part of that land which, he charged, was held by individuals, although it belonged to the state. Whereupon many of the Fathers, being themselves in possession of the land, took fright at the danger which threatened their interests. But the senators were also concerned on public grounds, namely, that the consul by his largesses should be building up an influence perilous to liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was the first proposal for agrarian legislation, and from that day to within living memory it has never been brought up without occasioning the most serious disturbances.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul resisted the largess, and the Fathers supported him; nor were the commons solidly against him, for to begin with, they had taken offence that the bounty had been made general, being extended to include allies as well as citizens;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and again, they often heard the consul Verginius declare in his speeches, as though he read the future, that destruction lurked in the gift proposed by his colleague; that those lands would bring servitude to the men who should receive them, and were being made a road to monarchy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For what reason had there been, he asked, in including the allies and the Latin name, and in restoring to the Hernici, who had been enemies a short time before, a third of the land which had been taken from them, if it were not that these tribes might have Cassius in the room of Coriolanus for their captain?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Popular <pb id="p.355"/>favour now began to go over to the opponent and<note type="margin">B.C. 486-485</note> vetoer of the land-legislation. Each consul then began, as if vying with the other, to pamper the plebs. Verginius said that he would permit lands to be assigned, provided they were assigned to none but Roman citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Cassius, having by his proposed agrarian grants made a bid for the support of the allies and thereby lowered himself in the eyes of the Romans, desired to regain the affection of his fellow-citizens by another donation, and proposed that the money received from the Sicilian corn should be paid back to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But this the people spurned, as a downright attempt to purchase regal power; to such an extent did their instinctive suspicion of monarchy render them scornful of his gifts, as if they had possessed a superfluity of everything; and Cassius had no sooner laid down his office than he was condemned and executed, as all authorities agree.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There are those who say that his father was responsible for his punishment: that he tried the case in his house, and that, after causing his son to be scourged and put to death, he consecrated to Ceres his personal property, from the proceeds of which a statue was made and inscribed <quote>the gift of the Cassian family.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I find in certain authors, and this is the more credible account, that the quaestors Caeso Fabius and Lucius Valerius brought him to trial for treason, and that he was found guilty by judgment of the people and his house pulled down by popular decree. Its site is now the open space in front of the temple of Tellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But whether it was a domestic or a state trial, he was condemned in the consulship of Servius Cornelius and Quintus Fabius.
				</p> <pb id="p.357"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was not long before the people forgot<note type="margin">B.C. 484-483</note> the anger they had felt against Cassius. The inherent attractiveness of the agrarian legislation appealed to them on its own account, when its author had been removed, and their desire for it was enhanced by the meanness of the Fathers, who after the defeat in that year of the Volsci and the Aequi defrauded the soldiers of their booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whatever was taken from the enemy Fabius sold and placed the proceeds in the public treasury. The Fabian name was hateful to the plebs, on the last consul's account; nevertheless the patricians succeeded in procuring the election of Caeso Fabius to that office, along with Lucius Aemilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This increased the rancour of the plebeians, and by their seditions at home they brought about a foreign war. The war then caused domestic strife to be interrupted, while with one mind and purpose patricians and plebeians met the rebellious Volsci and Aequi and, led by Aemilius, defeated them in a successful action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Yet more of the enemy perished in flight than in the battle, so relentlessly did the cavalry pursue their routed forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Castor's temple was dedicated the same year, on the fifteenth of July. It had been vowed during the Latin war by Postumius, the dictator. His son, being made duumvir for this special purpose, dedicated it.<note>The temple was erected in honour of both Castor and Pollux, but was commonly referred to by the name of the former alone (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Mil.</hi> 91). The <hi rend="italics">duumviri</hi> were a committee of two, appointed to oversee the construction and dedication of a temple when the man who had vowed it died without accomplishing his task.</note>
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The desires of the plebs were this year again excited by the charms of the land-law. The tribunes of the plebs endeavoured to recommend their democratic office by a democratic law, while the senators, who thought there was frenzy enough and to spare in the populace, without rewarding it, shuddered at <pb id="p.359"/>the thought of land-grants and encouragements to<note type="margin">B.C. 484-483</note> rashness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The most strenuous of leaders were at hand for the senatorial opposition, in the persons of the consuls. Their party was therefore victorious and not only won an immediate success but, besides, elected as consuls for the approaching year Marcus Fabius, Caeso's brother, and one whom, on account of the prosecution of Spurius Cassius, the people hated even more, namely, Lucius Valerius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This year also there was a conflict with the tribunes. Nothing came of the legislation, and its supporters fell into contempt, from boasting of a measure which they could not carry through. The Fabii were thence-forward held in great repute, after their three successive consulships, which had all without interruption been subjected to the proof of struggles with the tribunes; accordingly the office, as if well invested, was permitted to remain some time in that family.<note>For the next four years, making seven successive years in all, the Fabii were represented in the consulate.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> War then broke out with Veii, and the Volsci revolted. But for foreign wars there was almost a superabundance of resources, and men misused them in quarrelling amongst themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To increase the general anxiety which was now felt, portents implying the anger of the gods were of almost daily occurrence in the City and the country. For this expression of divine wrath no other reason was alleged by the soothsayers, when they had enquired into it both officially and privately, sometimes by inspecting entrails and sometimes by observing the flight of birds, than the failure duly to observe the rites of religion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These alarms at length resulted in the condemnation of Oppia, a Vestal virgin, for unchastity, and her punishment.
				</p> <pb id="p.361"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quintus Fabius and Gaius Julius were<note type="margin">B.C. 482-480</note> then made consuls. This year there was no less discord at home, and the menace of war was greater. The Aequi took up arms, and the Veientes even made a foray into Roman territory. During the increasing anxiety occasioned by these campaigns Caeso Fabius and Spurius Furius were elected to the consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ortona, a Latin city, was being besieged by the Aequi; while the Veientes, who by this time had their fill of rapine, were threatening to attack Rome itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These alarms, though they should have restrained the animosity of the plebeians, actually heightened it; and they resumed their custom of refusing service, though not of their own initiative; for it was Spurius Licinius, tribune of the plebs, who, deeming that the moment had come for forcing a land-law on the patricians by the direst necessity, had undertaken to obstruct the preparations for war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But he drew upon his own head all the odium attaching to the tribunician office, nor did the consuls inveigh against him more fiercely than did his own colleagues, and with their help the consuls held a levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Armies were enlisted for two wars at the same time; the command of one, which was to invade the Aequi, was given to Fabius, while with the other Furius was to oppose the Veientes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Against the Veientes nothing worth recording was accomplished; and in the Aequian campaign Fabius had somewhat more trouble with his fellow-Romans than with the enemy. That one man, the consul himself, preserved the state, which the army in its hatred of the consul would, so far as it was able, have betrayed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For when the consul, besides the many other instances of good generalship which he displayed in <pb id="p.363"/>preparing for the war and in his conduct of it, had so<note type="margin">B.C. 482-480</note> drawn up the battle-line that a charge of the cavalry alone sufficed to rout the enemy's army, the foot refused to pursue the flying foe;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> nor could even their own sense of guilt &mdash;to say nothing of the exhortation of their hated general, &mdash;nor even the thought of the immediate disgrace to all, and the danger they must presently incur if the enemy should recover his courage, compel them to quicken their pace, or, if nothing else, to stand in their ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Contrary to orders they retreated and returned to their camp, in such dejection that you would have supposed them beaten, now uttering execrations against their leader and now against the efficient services of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ruinous though their example was, the general found no remedy for it; so true is it that noble minds are oftener lacking in the qualities by which men govern their fellow-citizens than in those by which they conquer an enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consul returned to Rome, having purchased more hatred of his irritated and embittered soldiers than won increase in military fame. Nevertheless the Fathers held out for the retention of the consulship in the Fabian family. Marcus Fabius was the man they elected, and they gave him Gnaeus Manlius as a colleague.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year also had a tribune who advocated<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> a land-law, Tiberius Pontificius. He set out on the same path that Spurius Licinius had trodden, as though Licinius had been successful, and for a time obstructed the levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senators were again thrown into consternation, but Appius Claudius told them that the tribunician power had been overcome the year before, actually for the time being, and potentially <pb id="p.365"/>for ever, since a way had been discovered for<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> employing its resources to its own undoing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For there would always be some tribune who would be willing to gain a personal victory over his colleague, and obtain the favour of the better element, while doing the nation a service. There would be a number of tribunes, if a number should be needed, who would be ready to help the consuls; and a single one was enough, though opposed to all the rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Only let the consuls, and the leading senators as well, make a point of winning over, if not all, at any rate some of the tribunes to the state and the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Acting on the instructions of Appius, the Fathers began as a class to address the tribunes in a courteous and kindly manner; and those who were of consular rank, when it happened that any of them had any private claim upon an individual tribune, brought it about, in part by personal influence, in part by political, that those officials were disposed to use their powers for the good of the state; and four of them, as against one who would have hindered the general good, assisted the consuls to hold the muster.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The army then set out for a war with the Veientes,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to whose help forces had rallied from every quarter of Etruria, not so much roused by goodwill towards the men of Veii as by hopes that civil discord might effect the downfall of the Roman state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And indeed the leading men in the councils of all the Etrurian peoples were wrathfully complaining that there would be no end to the power of the Romans unless factional quarrels should set them to fighting amongst themselves. They asserted that this was the only poison, the only decay which had been found to work upon <pb id="p.367"/>opulent states, so as to make great empires transitory.<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For a long time the Romans had withstood this evil, thanks partly to the prudence of the senate, partly to the patience of the plebs; but they had now come to a crisis. Two states had been created out of one: each faction had its own magistrates, its own laws.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At first, though they had a way of fiercely opposing the levies, yet when war began they had obeyed their generals. No matter what the condition of things in the City, so long as military discipline held it had been possible to make a stand; but now the fashion of disobeying magistrates was following the Roman soldier even to his camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In their latest war, when the army was already drawn up for battle, and at the very instant of conflict, they had with one accord actually handed over the victory to the conquered Aequi, had deserted their standards, had left their general on the field, and had returned, against his orders, to their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Assuredly if her enemies pressed forward they could vanquish Rome by means of her own soldiers. There needed nothing more than to make a declaration and a show of war; Fate and the gods would of their own will do the rest. Such were the hopes which had led the Etruscans to take up arms, after many a shifting hazard of defeat and victory. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman consuls also felt that they had nothing else to dread but their own forces and their own arms. The recollection of the heinous example set in the last war deterred them from offering battle in a situation where they would be in danger from two armies at the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly they kept within their camp, restrained by the thought of so grave a peril: time and circumstances would perhaps assuage the anger of the men <pb id="p.369"/>and bring them to their senses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their enemies the<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> Veientes and the other Etruscans were for that reason the more in haste to act; they attempted to provoke the Romans to fight, at first by riding up to their camp and challenging them to come out, and finally, when they gained nothing by this, by shouting insults both at the consuls themselves and at the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They said that their pretended want of harmony amongst themselves had been resorted to in order to conceal their fear, and that the consuls distrusted the courage of their men even more than their loyalty; it was a strange kind of mutiny where armed men were silent and inactive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To these taunts they added others upon the newness of their race and origin, partly false and partly true. This abuse, noisily uttered beneath the very rampart and the gates, was endured unconcernedly enough by the consuls. But the inexperienced rank and file, stirred now by indignation and now by shame, were diverted from the thought of their domestic troubles; they were unwilling that their enemies should go unpunished;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they were unwilling that the patricians, that the consuls should obtain a success; hatred of the foe contended in their bosoms with hatred of their fellow-citizens. At length the former feeling got the upper hand, so proud and insolent was the jeering of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They gathered in crowds at the praetorium,<note>The headquarters of the consul, who was originally called praetor.</note> demanded battle, requested that the signal should be given. The consuls, as though considering the matter, put their heads together and conferred for a long time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They desired to fight, but it was needful to keep back their desire and conceal it, that by opposition and delay they might stimulate to fury the already eager soldiery. The men were therefore told that the <pb id="p.371"/>thing was premature, that the time for battle had<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> not yet come; that they must keep within the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then the consuls issued an order to abstain from fighting, declaring that if any man fought without orders they should treat him as an enemy. Dismissed with these words, the less inclination the soldiers discovered in the consuls the greater became their own eagerness for the fray.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were still further exasperated by the enemy, who were much bolder even than before, when the consuls' determination not to fight became known: it was clear that they could insult the Romans with impunity; their soldiers were not trusted with weapons, the affair would culminate in absolute mutiny, and the end of the Roman power had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Relying on these convictions, they charged up to the gates, flung gibes at their defenders, and scarcely refrained from assaulting the camp. At this the Romans could no longer brook their insults; from all over the camp they came running to the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There were no more cautious requests, preferred through the chief centurions, but on all sides arose a general clamour. The time was ripe; nevertheless the consuls hung back. Then Fabius, when his colleague, beginning to fear mutiny, was on the point of yielding to the growing tumult, commanded silence by a trumpet-blast and said: <quote>I know, Gnaeus Manlius, that these men have the power to conquer, but their will to do so I know not; and for this they are themselves to blame.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> I am therefore resolved and determined not to give the signal unless they swear that they will return victorious from this engagement. Once, in a battle, the soldiers betrayed a Roman consul: they will never betray the gods.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There was a centurion named <pb id="p.373"/>Marcus Flavoleius, who had been among the foremost<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> in demanding battle. <quote>I will return victorious from the field, Marcus Fabius,</quote> he cried, and invoked the wrath of Father Jupiter, Mars Gradivus, and the other gods, if he failed to keep his vow. The same pledge was then taken in order by the entire army, each man invoking its penalties upon himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When they had sworn, the signal sounded. They armed and entered the fight, angry and confident. Now let the Etruscans fling their taunts!
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Now &mdash;they all cried &mdash;now, when they were armed, let the lip-bold enemy face them! On that day they all showed splendid courage, both commoners and nobles, but the Fabian name was especially distinguished. In the course of many political struggles they had estranged the plebs, and they resolved to regain their goodwill in that battle.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The line was drawn up, nor did the Veientes and the Etruscan levies shun the encounter. They felt almost certain that the Romans would no more fight with them than they had fought with the Aequi. That they might even be guilty of some greater enormity, exasperated as they were, and possessed of a critical opportunity, was not too much to hope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But it turned out quite otherwise. For there had never been a war when the Romans went into battle with a keener hostility &mdash;so embittered had they been, on the one hand by the enemy's insults, on the other by the procrastination of the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Etruscans had barely had time to deploy when their enemies, who in the first excitement' had rather cast their javelins at random than fairly aimed them, were already come to sword-strokes at close quarters, where fighting is the fiercest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Fabian clan was <pb id="p.375"/>conspicuous among the foremost, a spectacle and<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> encouragement to their fellow-citizens. One of them, the Quintus Fabius who had been consul three years before, was leading the attack on the closely marshalled Veientes, when a Tuscan, exulting in his strength and skill at arms, caught him unawares in the midst of a crowd of his enemies and drove his sword through his breast. As the blade was withdrawn Fabius fell headlong upon his wound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was but the fall of one man, but both armies felt it; and the Romans were giving way at that point, when Marcus Fabius the consul leaped over the prostrate corpse and, covering himself with his target, cried, <quote>Was this your oath, men, that you would return to your camp in flight?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Do you then fear the most dastardly of foes more than Jupiter and Mars, by whom you swore? But I, though I have sworn no oath, will either return victorious or fall fighting here by you, Quintus Fabius!</quote> To this speech of the consul Caeso Fabius, consul of the year before, made answer, <quote>Think you that your words will persuade them to fight, brother?
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The gods will persuade them, by whom they have sworn. And let us, as is meet for nobles, as is worthy of the name of Fabius, kindle by fighting rather than by exhortation the courage of our soldiers!</quote> With that the two Fabii rushed into the press with levelled spears and carried the whole line forward with them.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus the fortune of the day was retrieved in one part of the field. On the other wing Gnaeus Manlius the consul was urging on the fight with no less vigour, when almost the same thing happened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For as Quintus Fabius had done on the <pb id="p.377"/>other flank, so here the consul Manlius was personally<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> leading the attack upon the enemy, whom he had almost routed, for his soldiers followed him valiantly, when he was severely wounded and retired from the fighting line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His men believed him to be dead, and faltered; and they would have yielded the position, had not the other consul ridden up at a gallop, with some few troops of horse, and calling out that his colleague was alive, and that he himself had defeated and routed the other wing and was come to help them, in that way put a stop to their wavering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Manlius also showed himself among them, helping to restore the line; and the soldiers, recognizing the features of their two consuls, plucked up courage. At the same time the battle-line of the enemy was now less strong, for, relying on their excess of numbers, they had withdrawn their reserves and dispatched them to storm the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There, having forced an entrance without encountering much opposition, they were frittering away their time, their thoughts more taken up with the booty than with the battle, when the Roman reserves, which had been unable to withstand the first onset, sent word to the consuls how things stood, and then closed up their ranks, returned to the praetorium, and of themselves resumed the battle. Meanwhile Manlius the consul had ridden back to the camp, and by posting men at all the gates had cut off the enemy's egress.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In desperation at this turn the Etruscans had been inflamed to the point rather of madness than of recklessness. For when, as they rushed in whatever direction there seemed a prospect of escape, they had made several charges to no purpose, one band of youths made a dash at the consul himself, whose arms made him <pb id="p.379"/>conspicuous. Their first discharge of javelins was parried<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> by the soldiers who surrounded him, but after that there was no withstanding their violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul fell, mortally wounded, and all about him fled. The Etruscans grew more reckless than before; the Romans were driven, quaking with terror, right across the camp, and their case would have been desperate, had
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> not the lieutenants caught up the body of the consul and opened a way for the enemy by one of the gates. By that they burst forth, and escaping in a disordered column, fell in the way of the other, the victorious consul, where they were again cut to pieces, and dispersed in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A victory of great importance had been won, but it was saddened by the death of two so famous men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul therefore made answer to the senate, when it would have voted him a triumph, that if the army could triumph without its general, its services in that war had been so remarkable that he would readily grant his consent; as for himself, when his family was in mourning for the death of Quintus Fabius his brother, and the state was half orphaned by the loss of the other consul, he would not accept a laurel which was blighted with national and private sorrow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> No triumph ever celebrated was more famous than was his refusal to accept a triumph, so true is it that a seasonable rejection of glory sometimes but increases it. The consul then solemnized, one after the other, the funerals of his colleague and his brother, and pronounced the eulogy of each; but while yielding their meed of praise to them, he gained for himself the very highest praises.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nor was he unmindful of that policy which he had adopted in the beginning of his consulship, of winning the affections of the plebs, but billeted the <pb id="p.381"/>wounded soldiers on the patricians, to be cared for.<note type="margin">B.C. 480</note> To the Fabii he assigned the largest number, nor did they anywhere receive greater attention. For this the Fabii now began to enjoy the favour of the people, nor was this end achieved by aught but a demeanour wholesome for the state.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senators were now therefore not<note type="margin">B.C. 479</note> more forward than the plebeians in choosing Caeso Fabius to be consul, along with Titus Verginius. On taking office his first concern was neither war nor the raising of troops nor anything else, save that the prospect of harmony which had been already partly realized should ripen at the earliest possible moment into a good understanding between the patricians and the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He therefore proposed at the outset of his term that before one of the tribunes should rise up and advocate a land-law, the Fathers themselves should anticipate him by making it their own affair and bestowing the conquered territory upon the plebs with the utmost impartiality; for it was right that they should possess it by whose blood and toil it had been won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senators scorned the proposal, and some even complained that too much glory was spoiling and dissipating that vigorous intellect which Caeso had once possessed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the sequel there were no outbreaks of strife and faction in the City, but the Latins were plagued with incursions of the Aequi. Thither Caeso was dispatched with an army, and passed over into the Aequians' own country to lay it waste. The Aequi retired to their towns and kept within their walls. For this reason there was no memorable battle.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But the Veientes inflicted a defeat on the Romans owing to the rashness of the other consul; and the <pb id="p.383"/>army would have been destroyed if Caeso Fahius<note type="margin">B.C. 479</note> had not come, in the nick of time, to its rescue. Thenceforward there was neither peace nor war with the Veientes, but something very like freebooting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the face of the Roman legions they would retreat into their city; when they perceived the legions to be withdrawn they would make raids upon the fields, evading war by a semblance of peace, and peace in turn by war. Hence it was impossible either to let the whole matter go or to end it. Other wars, too, were immediately threatening &mdash;like the one with the Aequi and the Volsci, who would observe peace only so long as the suffering involved in their latest defeat was passing away, &mdash;or were soon to be begun, by the always hostile Sabines and all Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the enmity of the Veientes, persistent rather than perilous, and issuing in insults oftener than in danger, kept the Romans in suspense, for they were never permitted to forget it or to turn their attention elsewhere.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the Fabian clan went before the senate, and the consul said, speaking for the clan: <quote>A standing body of defenders rather than a large one is required, Conscript Fathers, as you know, for the war with Veii. Do you attend to the other wars, and assign to the Fabii the task of opposing the Veientes. We undertake that the majesty of the Roman name shall be safe in that quarter.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is our purpose to wage this war as if it were our own family feud, at our private costs: the state may dispense with furnishing men and money for this cause.</quote> The thanks of the Fathers were voted with enthusiasm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul came out from the senate-house, and escorted by a column of the Fabii, who had halted in the vestibule of the curia while awaiting <pb id="p.385"/>the senate's decision, returned to his house. After<note type="margin">B.C. 479</note> receiving the command to present themselves armed next day at the consul's threshold, they dispersed to their homes.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The news spreads to every part of the City<note type="margin">B.C. 479-478</note> and the Fabii are lauded to the skies. Men tell how a single family has taken upon its shoulders the burden of a state, how the war with Veii has been turned over to private citizens and private arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If there were two other clans of equal strength in the City, the one might undertake the Volsci, the other the Aequi, and the Roman People might enjoy the tranquillity of peace, while all the neighbouring nations were being subdued. On the following day the Fabii arm and assemble at the designated place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul, coming forth in the cloak of a general,<note>The crimson <hi rend="italics">paludamentum.</hi></note> sees his entire clan drawn up in his vestibule, and being received into their midst gives the order to march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Never did an army march through the City less in number or more distinguished by the applause and the wonder of men: three hundred and six soldiers, all patricians, all of one blood, no one of whom you would have rejected as a leader, and who would have made an admirable senate in any period, were going out to threaten the existence of the Veientine nation with the resources of a single house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were followed by a throng partly made up of people belonging to them, their kinsmen and close friends, whose thoughts were busy with no mean matters, whether of hope or of fear, but with boundless possibilities; partly of those who were moved with concern for the commonwealth, and were beside themselves with enthusiasm and amazement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>Go,</quote> they cry, <quote>in your valour, go with good <pb id="p.387"/>fortune, and crown your undertaking with success as<note type="margin">B.C. 479-478</note> great!</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They bid them look forward to receiving consulships at their hands for this work, and triumphs, and all rewards and all honours. As they pass by the Capitol and the citadel and the other temples, they beseech whatever gods present themselves to their eyes and their thoughts to attend
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that noble band with blessings and prosperity, and restore them soon in safety to their native land and their kindred. Their prayers were uttered in vain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Setting out by the Unlucky Way,<note>A name afterwards given to the arch from the result of this expedition.</note> the right arch of the Porta Carmentalis, they came to the river Cremera, a position which seemed favourable for the erection of a fort.
				</p> 
				<p>Lucius Aemilius and Gaius Servilius were then chosen consuls. And so long as nothing more than plundering was afoot the Fabii were not only an adequate garrison for the fort, but in all that region where the Tuscan territory marches with the Roman they afforded universal security to their own countrymen and annoyance to the enemy, by ranging along the border on both sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then came a brief interruption to these depredations, while the men of Veii, having called in an army from Etruria, attacked the post on the Cremera, and the Roman legions, led thither by Lucius Aemilius the consul, engaged them in a pitched battle;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> though in truth the Veientes had scarcely time to draw up a battle-line, for at the first alarm, while the ranks were falling in behind the standards and the reserves were being posted, a division of Roman cavalry made a sudden charge on their flank and deprived them of the power not only of attacking first, but even of standing their ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so they were driven back upon Saxa Rubra, where they had their camp, and sued for peace. It <pb id="p.389"/>was granted, but their instinctive fickleness caused<note type="margin">B.C. 479-478</note> them to weary of the pact before the Roman garrison was withdrawn from the Cremera.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Again the Fabii were pitted against the people<note type="margin">B.C. 477</note> of Veii. No preparations had been made for a great war, yet not only were raids made upon farming lands, and surprise attacks upon raiding parties, but at times they fought in the open field and in serried ranks;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and a single clan of the Roman People often carried off the victory from that most mighty state, for those days, in all Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first the Veientes bitterly resented this; but they presently adopted a plan, suggested by the situation, for trapping their bold enemy, and they even rejoiced as they saw that the frequent successes of the Fabii were causing them to grow more rash.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so they now and then drove flocks in the way of the invaders, as if they had come there by accident; and the country folk would flee from their farms and leave them deserted; and rescuing parties of armed men, sent to keep off pillagers, would flee before them in a panic more often feigned than real. By this time the Fabii had conceived such scorn for the enemy that they believed themselves invincible and not to be withstood, no matter what the place or time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This confidence so won upon them that on catching sight of some flocks at a distance from the Cremera, across a wide interval of plain, they disregarded the appearance here and there of hostile arms, and ran down to capture them. Their rashness carried them on at a swift pace past an ambuscade which had been laid on both sides of their very road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had scattered this way and that and were seizing the flocks, which had dispersed in all directions, as they do if terrified, <pb id="p.391"/>when suddenly the ambush rose up, and enemies were<note type="margin">B.C. 477</note> in front and on every side of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> First the shout which echoed all along the Etruscan line filled them with consternation, and then the javelins began to fall upon them from every quarter; and as the Etruscans drew together and the Romans were now fenced in by a continuous line of armed men, the harder the enemy pressed them the smaller was the space within which they themselves were forced to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> contract their circle, a thing which clearly revealed both their own fewness and the vast numbers of the Etruscans, whose ranks were multiplied in the narrow space.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Romans then gave up the fight which they had been directing equally at every point, and all turned in one direction. Thither, by dint of main strength and arms, they forced their way with a wedge. Their road led up a gentle acclivity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There they at first made a stand; presently, when their superior position had afforded them time to breathe and to collect their spirits after so great a fright, they actually routed the troops which were advancing to dislodge them; and a handful of men, with the aid of a good position, were winning the victory, when the Veientes who had been sent round by the ridge emerged upon the crest of the hill, thus giving the enemy the advantage again.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Fabii were all slain to a man, and their fort was stormed. Three hundred and six men perished, as is generally agreed; one, who was little more than a boy in years,<note>This was that Fabius, according to the legend, who was to become consul ten years later! See III. X.</note> survived to maintain the Fabian stock, and so to afford the very greatest help to the Roman People in its dark hours, on many occasions, at home and in the field.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this disaster befel, Gaius Horatius<note type="margin">B.C. 477-476</note> and Titus Menenius had begun their consulship. <pb id="p.393"/>Menenius was at once sent out to confront the<note type="margin">B.C. 477-476</note> Etruscans, elated by their victory. Again the Roman arms were unsuccessful, and Janiculum was taken by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They would also have laid siege to Rome, which was suffering not only from war but from a scarcity of corn &mdash;for the Etruscans had crossed the Tiber &mdash;had not the consul Horatius been recalled from the Volscian country; and so nearly did that invasion approach the very walls of the City that battles were fought first at the temple of Hope, where the result was indecisive, and again at the Colline Gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, although the advantage to the Roman side was but slight, still the engagement restored their old-time spirit to the troops and made them the better soldiers for the battles that were to come.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Aulus Verginius and Spurius Servilius were made consuls. After the defeat the Veientes had suffered in the last fight, they avoided a battle and took to pillaging. From Janiculum, as from a citadel, they sent out expeditions far and wide into the territory of the Romans; there was no security anywhere for flocks or country-folk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After a time they were caught by the same trick with which they had caught the Fabii. Having pursued the flocks which had been driven out here and there on purpose to lure them on, they plunged into an ambush, and as their numbers exceeded those of the Fabii so did their losses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This disaster threw them into a violent rage, which proved the cause and the beginning of a greater reverse. For they crossed the Tiber in the night and assaulted the camp of the consul Servilius. There they were routed with heavy losses and regained Janiculum with difficulty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Forthwith the <pb id="p.395"/>consul himself crossed the Tiber and fortified a camp<note type="margin">B.C. 477-476</note> beneath the hill. Next day at dawn, partly because he was emboldened by the successful battle of the day before, but more because the want of corn drove him to the rashest kind of measures, provided only they were speedy, he was
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> so reckless as to lead his army up Janiculum to the enemy's camp, and after suffering a more disgraceful repulse than he had administered the day before, owed his own rescue and that of his army to the arrival of his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Caught between two lines, the Etruscans turned their backs first on one and then on the other, and were cut down with great slaughter. Thus the Veientine invasion was defeated by a lucky temerity.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There came to the City with the return of<note type="margin">B.C. 476-475</note> peace a relaxation in the corn-market; for not only was grain imported from Campania, but now that each had ceased to fear for his own future want, men brought out the stores which they had concealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As a consequence of plenty and idleness a spirit of licence again began to affect men's minds, and they began to seek at home for the old troubles which were no longer to be met with abroad. The tribunes roused the plebs to madness with their usual poison, a land-law. The Fathers resisted, but the tribunes incited the people against them, not as a body merely, but as individuals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quintus Considius and Titus Genucius, the proposers of the agrarian measure, cited Titus Menenius to appear for trial.<note>What was the charge? Perhaps that he had failed to support the Fabii; perhaps that he had lost Janiculum by his incompetence.</note> He had incurred the dislike of the plebs owing to the loss of the outpost on the Cremera, when he as consul had occupied a permanent camp not far away;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and this unpopularity was his undoing, though the senators exerted themselves in his behalf no less <pb id="p.397"/>than they had done for Coriolanus, and though the<note type="margin">B.C. 476-475</note> favour enjoyed by his father Agrippa had not yet passed away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In respect to the penalty the tribunes showed restraint; though they had charged him with a capital offence, they fixed the fine of the condemned at two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi> But it cost him his life; they say that he could not endure the shame and grief, and from this cause fell ill and died.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Another man was then put upon his trial, namely Spurius Servilius. He had laid down the consulship and been succeeded by Gaius Nautius and Publius Valerius, when he was cited, in the very beginning of the year, by the tribunes Lucius Caedicius and Titus Statius. Unlike Menenius, he did not meet the attacks of the tribunes with entreaties, preferred by himself or the senators, but with high confidence in his innocence and popularity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He, too, was accused in connection with the battle against the Etruscans at Janiculum. But the fiery courage of the man had not been more in evidence in the nation's hour of peril than it was then in his own, and he confuted not only the tribunes but the plebs, upbraiding them, in a daring speech, with the condemnation and death of Menenius, to whose father, he declared, the plebs formerly owed their restoration and the possession of those very magistrates and laws which were the tools of their cruelty. This boldness swept away the danger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was helped, too, by Verginius, his colleague, who, being called as a witness, shared his own credit with Servilius. But the trial of Menenius stood him in even better stead, so great a revulsion of feeling had set in.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Domestic strife was at an end; but war broke out with the Veientes, with whom the Sabines had united their arms. Publius Valerius the consul was <pb id="p.399"/>dispatched to Veii with an army to which had been<note type="margin">B.C. 476-475</note> added auxiliaries from the Latins and the Hernici. He at once advanced upon the Sabine camp, which had been established in front of the walls of their allies, and threw the enemy into such confusion that, while they were running out in small groups, some one way and some another, to repel the attack of the Romans, he captured the gate against which he had directed his first assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> What followed within the stockade was a massacre rather than a battle. The sounds of confusion in the camp penetrated even to the city, and the frightened inhabitants ran hastily to their weapons, as though Veii had been surprised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some went to the rescue of the Sabines, others assailed the Romans, who were wholly preoccupied with the camp. For a moment the Romans were disconcerted and thrown into disorder; then they, too, faced both ways and made a stand, and the horse which the consul sent into the fight dispersed and routed the Etruscans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In one and the same hour two armies, two of the greatest and most powerful neighbouring nations, were defeated.
				</p> 
				<p>While these victories were being won at Veii, the Volsci and the Aequi had encamped on Latin soil, and had laid waste the country. These the Latins, acting independently, with the assistance of the Hernici, but without either general or aid from Rome, despoiled of their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Immense booty, in addition to property of their own which they recovered, fell into their hands. Nevertheless a consul, Gaius Nautius, was sent from Rome against the Volsci. The precedent, I suppose, of allies waging wars, without a Roman commander and army, by means of their own forces and their own strategy, was not welcome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.401"/>There was no species of disaster or indignity which<note type="margin">B.C. 476-475</note> was not visited upon the Volsci, yet they could not be forced into giving battle.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Furius and Gaius Manlius were the<note type="margin">B.C. 474-473</note> next consuls. To Manlius fell the command against the Veientes. But there was no war; a truce for forty years was granted, at their solicitation, and corn and a money-indemnity were exacted of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The foreign peace was immediately succeeded by quarrels at home. The land-law with which the tribunes goaded the plebs excited them to the pitch of madness. The consuls, not a jot intimidated by the condemnation of Menenius, not a jot by the danger of Servilius, resisted the measure with the utmost violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As their term expired, Gnaeus Genucius, a plebeian tribune, haled them to trial.
				</p> 
				<p>Lucius Aemilius and Opiter Verginius entered upon the consulship. Vopiscus Julius I find given as consul in certain annals, instead of Verginius. This year &mdash;whoever its consuls were &mdash;Furius and Manlius went about among the people as men accused, in garments of mourning, seeking out the younger patricians, as well as the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They advised them, they warned them to forbear from office-holding and the administration of the public business; as for the consular fasces, the purple-bordered toga, and the curule chair, &mdash;these they should regard in no other light than as the pageantry of burial; for splendid insignia, like the fillets placed on victims, doomed the wearer to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But if the consulship was so alluring to them, let them recognize at once that it had been fettered and enslaved by the might of the tribunes; that the consul, as though an attendant upon those officials, must be subject in all <pb id="p.403"/>he did to their beck and call;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> if he should bestir<note type="margin">B.C. 474-473</note> himself, if he should show consideration for the patricians, if he should believe that the state comprised any other element than the plebs &mdash;let him call to mind the exile of Gnaeus Marcius, the condemnation of Menenius and his death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Fired by these speeches, the senators began to hold councils, no longer publicly, but in private, where the people could not learn their plans. In these deliberations there was but one guiding principle, that by fair means or foul the defendants must be got off. The more truculent a suggestion was, the greater was the favour it evoked, and an agent was not wanting for the most daring crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Well then, on the day of the trial the plebeians were in the Forum, on tiptoe with expectation. At first they were filled with amazement because the tribune did not come down;<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> from his home: the Forum was lower than the residential parts of Rome.</note> then, when at length his delay began to look suspicious, they supposed he had been frightened away by the nobles, and fell to complaining of his desertion and betrayal of the people's cause; finally, those who had presented themselves at the tribune's vestibule brought back word that he had been found dead in his house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When this report had spread through all the gathering, the crowd, like an army which takes to flight at the fall of its general, melted away on every side. The tribunes were particularly dismayed, for the death of their colleague warned them how utterly ineffectual to protect them were the laws that proclaimed their sanctity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor did the senators place a proper restraint upon their satisfaction; so far, indeed, was anyone from repenting of the guilty deed that even the innocent desired to be thought its authors, and men openly asserted that chastisement must be employed to curb the power of the tribunes.
				</p> <pb id="p.405"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately following this pernicious victory<note type="margin">B.C. 473</note> a levy was proclaimed, which the timorousness of the tribunes allowed the consuls to push through without ever a veto.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But this time the commons were fairly roused to anger, more by the silence of the tribunes than by the consuls' power. They declared that it was all up with their liberty; that men had gone back to their old ways; that with Genucius the tribunician power had suffered death and burial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They must adopt another course and other plans to resist the patricians; but the only way was this: that the plebs should undertake their own defence, since they had no one else to help them. Twenty-four lictors were all the retinue of the consuls, and even these were plebeians. Nothing was more contemptible or weaker, if there were any to contemn; it was every man's own imagination that made them great and awe-inspiring.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They had incited one another with arguments of this sort when the consuls sent a lictor to arrest Volero Publilius, a plebeian, who, on the ground that he had been a centurion, denied their right to make him a common soldier.<note>Livy mentions another instance of a conscript's objecting to serve in a rank lower than that he had previously held, in XLII. xxxiii. 3; but it does not appear that the men had any prescriptive right in the matter.</note> Volero called upon the tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When no one came to aid him, the consuls gave orders to strip the man and get out the rods. <quote>I appeal,</quote> cried Volero, <quote>to the people, since the tribunes would rather a Roman citizen should be scourged with rods before their eyes than themselves be murdered in their beds by you.</quote> But the more boldly he shouted the more roughly the lictor fell to tearing off his clothes and stripping him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then Volero, who was himself a powerful man and was helped by those he had called to his assistance, beat off the lictor and, choosing the place where the uproar of his sympathisers <pb id="p.407"/>was the angriest, plunged into the thick of the crowd,<note type="margin">B.C. 473</note> calling out, <quote>I appeal, and implore the protection of the plebs; help, citizens!
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> help, fellow-soldiers! It is useless for you to wait for the tribunes, who themselves stand in need of aid from you.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In their excitement men made ready as if to fight a battle, and it was evident that anything might happen, that nobody would respect any right, whether public or private. The consuls, exposed to this furious tempest, were quickly convinced of the insecurity of majesty when unaccompanied with force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The lictors were roughly handled and their rods were broken, while the consuls themselves were driven out of the Forum into the Curia, with no means of knowing how far Volero might use his victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Afterwards, when the uproar began to die away, they summoned the Fathers into the senate-house and complained of the insults they had suffered, the violence of the plebs, and Volero's outrageous conduct.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Though many daring opinions were expressed, the wishes of the older men prevailed, who had no mind to a conflict between an angry senate and a reckless plebs.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Volero, having been taken into favour by<note type="margin">B.C. 472-471</note> the plebs, was at the next election made plebeian tribune for that year which had Lucius Pinarius and Publius Furius for consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And contrary to the expectation of all, who believed that he would employ his tribuneship in persecuting the consuls of the preceding year, he set the general welfare above his private grievance, and without attacking the consuls by so much as a word, brought a bill before the people providing that plebeian magistrates should be chosen in the tribal assembly.<note>It is not clear how Livy supposed that these officials had formerly been elected. Perhaps Volero merely aimed at securing by legal sanction what the state had always recognized in practice, viz. that plebeian magistrates should be chosen by none but plebeians. But this was not Livy's view, as is clear from lviii. 1.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was no trivial matter which he proposed under this form, which at <pb id="p.409"/>first sight appeared so harmless, but one that<note type="margin">B.C. 472-471</note> completely deprived the patricians of the power of using their clients' votes to select what tribunes they liked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This measure was extremely welcome to the plebs; the Fathers opposed it with all their might, yet the only effectual resistance &mdash;to wit, a veto by some member of the tribunician college &mdash;neither consuls nor nobles were sufficiently influential to command. Nevertheless the legislation, which its very importance rendered difficult, was drawn out by party strife to the end of the year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The plebs re-elected Volero tribune: the senators, thinking the quarrel was sure to proceed to extremities, made Appius Claudius, soil of Appius, consul, a man whose unpopularity with the plebs and hostility towards them went back to the struggles between their fathers. For colleague they gave him Titus Quinctius.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The new year was no sooner begun than discussion of the law took precedence of everything else, and it was urged not only by its author, Volero, but by his colleague Laetorius as well, whose advocacy of it was at once fresher and more acrimonious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was emboldened by the great reputation he enjoyed as a soldier, since no one of that generation surpassed him in physical prowess. While Volero spoke of nothing but the law, and forbore to inveigh against the consuls' persons, Laetorius launched out into an arraignment of Appius and his family, as most cruel and arrogant towards the Roman plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But when he strove to show that the patricians had elected, not a consul, but an executioner, to harass and torture the plebeians, the inexperienced tongue of the soldier was inadequate to express his audacity and spirit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly when words began to fail him he cried, <pb id="p.411"/><quote>Since speech is not so easy for me, Quirites, as it is<note type="margin">B.C. 472-471</note> to make good what I have spoken, be at hand tomorrow.

Laetorius ordered the removal of all but those who were voting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The youthful nobles stayed where they were and would not give way at the officer's behest. Then certain of them were ordered by Laetorius to be seized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consul Appius declared that the tribune had no authority over anybody but a plebeian, seeing that he was not a magistrate of the people, but of the plebs; and even if he were, he could not, consistently with the custom of the Fathers, command the removal of anyone, by virtue of his authority, since the formula ran thus: <quote>If it seems good to you, depart, Quirites.</quote> It was an easy matter to throw Laetorius into a passion by these contemptuous remarks about his rights.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It was therefore in a blaze of anger that the tribune dispatched his attendant to the consul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> while the consul sent his lictor to the tribune, crying out that Laetorius was a private citizen, without power, and no magistrate; and the tribune would have been mishandled, had not the whole assembly rallied fiercely to his support against the consul, while men rushed into the Forum from all over the City, in an excited throng.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Still, Appius was obstinately holding out, despite the fury of the tempest, and a sanguinary battle would have ensued, if Quinctius, the other consul, had not entrusted the senators of consular rank with the task of getting his colleague out <pb id="p.413"/>of the Forum, by force, if they could not achieve<note type="margin">B.C. 472-471</note> it otherwise; while he himself now appealed to the raging populace with soothing entreaties, and now besought the tribunes to dismiss the council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Let them give their anger time: time would not rob them of their power, but would add wisdom to their strength; the Fathers would be subject to the people, and the consul to the Fathers.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was hard for Quinctius to still the<note type="margin">B.C. 471</note> plebs; much harder for the senators to quiet the other consul. At length the council of the plebs was adjourned, and the consuls convened the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At this meeting alternating hope and fear gave rise to conflicting opinions. But in proportion as their passions cooled with the lapse of time and gave way to deliberation, their minds more and more revolted from the struggle; insomuch that they passed a vote of thanks to Quinctius, because it was due to him that the quarrel had been abated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They desired Appius to be content that the majesty of the consul should be no greater than was compatible with harmony in the state, pointing out that while tribunes and consuls were each striving to carry things his own way there was no strength left in the nation at large, and the commonwealth was torn and mangled, the question being rather in whose power it was than how it might be safe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Appius, on the other hand, called gods and men to witness that the state was being betrayed through cowardice, and abandoned; that it was not the consul who was failing the senate, but the senate the consul; that harder terms were being accepted than had been accepted on the Sacred Mount. Nevertheless he was borne down by the senate's unanimity and held his peace. <pb id="p.415"/>The law was passed without opposition. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then<note type="margin">B.C. 471</note> for the first time tribunes were elected in the tribal assembly. That their number was also increased by three, as if there had been only two before, is stated by Piso.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He also gives the names of the tribunes: Gnaeus Siccius, Lucius Numitorius, Marcus Duillius, Spurius Icilius, Lucius Maecilius.
				</p> 
				<p>While Rome was thus distracted, the Volsci and the Aequi began war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had laid waste the fields in order that the plebeians, if they should secede, might find a refuge with them.<note>To <hi rend="italics">lay waste</hi> Roman lands they must first <hi rend="italics">enter</hi> them, and the purpose clause depends really upon this implied meaning of <hi rend="italics">vastaverant.</hi></note> Then, when the matter was settled, they withdrew their camp. Appius Claudius was sent against the Volsci; to Quinctius fell the command against the Aequi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In his conduct in the field Appius displayed the same violence that he had shown in Rome, and it now had freer play because it was not hampered by the tribunes. He hated the plebs with a hatred that surpassed his father's: What?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Had he been beaten by them? Was it in his consulship, who had been chosen as pre-eminently fitted to resist the tribunician power, that a law had been passed which former consuls had prevented, with less effort and by no means so much hope of success on the part of the patricians?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His wrath and indignation at this thought drove his fierce spirit to torment the army with a savage exercise of authority. Yet he was unable by any violence to subdue them, so deeply had their spirits drunk of opposition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Sloth, idleness, neglect, and obstinacy were in all they did. Neither shame nor fear restrained them. If he wished the column to advance more rapidly they deliberately retarded their pace; <pb id="p.417"/>if he stood by to encourage their work, they would<note type="margin">B.C. 471</note> all relax the industry they had manifested of their own accord.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In his presence they sunk their gaze; as he passed by they cursed him under their breath; till that proud spirit, which the hatred of the plebs had never broken, was at times disturbed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After exhausting every species of severity without effect, he would have no more to do with the men; the centurions, he said, had corrupted the army, and he sometimes sneeringly dubbed them <quote>tribunes of the plebs</quote> and <quote>Voleros.</quote>
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Every one of these circumstances was known to the Volsci, and they pressed their enemy the harder, hoping that the Roman army would exhibit the same spirited opposition to Appius which it had evinced towards the consul Fabius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But Appius found his men far more unruly than had Fabius; for not only were they unwilling to conquer, as the Fabian army had been, but they wished to be conquered. Being drawn out into battle-order, they basely fled and sought their camp; nor did they make a stand until they saw the Volsci advancing against their fortifications and inflicting a disgraceful slaughter upon their rearguard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This compelled them to exert themselves and fight, with the result that the enemy was dislodged from the stockade in the moment of victory. Yet it was evident enough that the capture of their camp was the only thing at which the Roman soldiers balked, and that elsewhere they rejoiced at their own defeat and ignominy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These things in no wise daunted the haughty spirit of Appius. But when he would have gone further and have vented his rage upon the army, and was issuing orders for an assembly, the lieutenants and tribunes gathered hurriedly about <pb id="p.419"/>him and warned him upon no account to seek a test<note type="margin">B.C. 471</note> of his authority, when its effectiveness all depended on the goodwill of those obeying it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The men, they reported, were saying that they would not go to be harangued, and everywhere voices were overheard demanding that the camp be removed from Volscian territory. The victorious enemy had a little while before been almost in their gates and on their wall, and a great disaster was not merely to be apprehended, but was openly hovering before their eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Giving way at last, since the soldiers were gaining nothing but a postponement of their punishment, he relinquished the idea of an assembly, and commanded a march for the following day. At daybreak he caused the signal for departure to be sounded on the trumpet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the very instant when the column was getting clear of the camp, the Volsci, as though set in motion by the same signal, fell upon their rear. Thence the confusion spread to the van, and the panic so disordered the standards and the ranks that it was impossible either to hear commands or to form a line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nobody thought of anything but flight, and so demoralised was the rout, as the men escaped over fallen bodies and discarded weapons, that the enemy sooner ceased to pursue than the Romans to flee.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When at last the soldiers had been collected from their scattered flight, the consul, who had followed his men in a vain attempt to call them back, pitched his camp on friendly soil. Then he summoned an assembly and soundly rated them, not without reason, as an army which had been false to military discipline and had deserted its standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Asking them all in turn where their arms and where their standards were, he caused the unarmed soldiers and <pb id="p.421"/>the standard-bearers who had lost their standards,<note type="margin">B.C. 471</note> and in
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> addition to these the centurions and the recipients of a double ration<note>This was granted in recognition of unusual valour. So the Victoria Cross is accompanied by a small stipend.</note> who had quitted their ranks, to be scourged with rods and beheaded; of the remaining number every tenth man was selected by lot for punishment.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To contrast with all this, in the Aequian campaign there subsisted between consul and soldiers an emulation of goodwill and kindness. Not only was it natural to Quinctius to be more gentle, but the unfortunate harshness of his colleague had given him the more reason to be content with his own disposition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Against this complete harmony between commander and army the Aequi ventured no opposition, but suffered their enemies to devastate their fields at will; and in fact no previous war had ever yielded a larger booty from that country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was all given to the troops, and to the spoils were added encomiums, which are no less efficacious than rewards in rejoicing a soldier's heart. Not only their leader, but for their leader's sake the Fathers, too, were looked upon with greater kindness by the army when they returned. They declared that to them the senate had given a parent, to the other army a tyrant.
				</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Varying fortune in war, grievous discord at home and in the field, had characterized the year just ended; but it was chiefly distinguished by the tribal assembly, a matter more important because the men had won a victory in the struggle which they had undertaken than in its practical results;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for the loss of dignity to the assembly itself, caused by the removal from it of the patricians, was greater than the gain in strength by the plebeians or the loss of it by the Fathers.
				</p> <pb id="p.423"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A stormier year succeeded, under the<note type="margin">B.C. 470</note> consuls Lucius Valerius and Titus Aemilius, partly owing to strife between the classes about the land-law, partly to the trial of Appius Claudius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was the bitterest opponent of the law, and was upholding the claim of those who had possession of the public domain as if he had been a third consul, when Marcus Duillius and Gnaeus Siccius lodged an accusation against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Never before had a defendant whom the plebs so detested been brought to trial before the people, burdened as he was with men's hatred, both of himself and of his father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The patricians, for their part, had not lightly put forth such exertions in behalf of any man. They felt that the champion of the senate and the guardian of their own dignity, who had stood firm against all sorts of tribunician and plebeian outbreaks, though he had possibly gone too far in the heat of the struggle, was being exposed to the angry commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Alone amongst the Fathers, Appius Claudius himself regarded tribunes, plebs, and his own trial with perfect unconcern. He was not one whom the threats of the plebeians or the entreaties of the senate could ever prevail upon, I do not say to put on mourning, or to seek men out with appeals for mercy, but even to soften and subdue in a slight degree the accustomed sharpness of his tongue, though it was before the people he must plead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was the same expression on his countenance, the same arrogance in his glance, the same fire in his speech; so markedly, in fact, that a great part of the plebs feared Appius no less when a defendant than they had feared him as consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Once only did he plead his cause, in the tone he had been wont to use on all occasions, namely, that of a <pb id="p.425"/>prosecutor; and so completely did his firmness<note type="margin">B.C. 470</note> overwhelm the tribunes and the commons that they themselves voluntarily adjourned the trial to a later day, and then allowed the affair to drag.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The interval was not very long, but before the appointed day came round Appius fell sick and died.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When his eulogy was being pronounced, the tribunes of the plebs attempted to interfere, but the plebs were not willing that the funeral-day of so great a man should be defrauded of the customary honours. They listened to his praises with as great goodwill, now he was dead, as they had heard the living man accused, and attended his burial in crowds.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same year Valerius the consul, having marched with an army against the Aequi, was unable to entice the enemy into a battle, and directed an assault upon their camp. This was foiled by an awful storm that descended upon them with hail and claps of thunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their amazement was soon increased, on the signal for retreat being given, by the reappearance of so tranquil and cloudless a sky, that, as though some god had defended the camp, they scrupled to attack it a second time, and directed all their hostility towards devastating the fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The other consul, Aemilius, conducted a campaign in the Sabine country. There, too, the enemy kept within his walls, and the Romans laid waste his fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Afterwards, by setting fire not only to farmhouses but even to the villages, where the people lived close together, they aroused the Sabines, who, having met the pillagers and fought a drawn battle with them, next day withdrew their camp to a safer position.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This seemed to the consul a sufficient pretext for leaving the enemy, as conquered, and he retired ere the campaign had fairly begun.
				</p> <pb id="p.427"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="63"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these wars were going on and there<note type="margin">B.C. 469</note> was still discord at home, Titus Numicius Priscus and Aulus Verginius were elected consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was clear that the plebs would endure no further postponement of the land-law, and were preparing to use violent measures, when the approach of a Volscian army was announced by the smoke which rose from burning farmhouses and by the flight of the country people. By this circumstance the insurrection, which was already matured and on the point of breaking out, was repressed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls, being at once commanded to do so by the senate, led the young men out of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> City to the war, a policy which diminished the restlessness of the plebeians who were left behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As for the enemy, they did no more than cause the Romans a needless panic, and hastily retreated. Numicius marched to Antium against the Volsci, Verginius against the Aequi. In the Aequian campaign an ambush nearly resulted in a severe defeat for the Romans, but the courage of the soldiers restored the day, which the carelessness of the consul had almost lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Volscian expedition was better directed: the enemy were routed in the first engagement and driven in flight to Antium, a very opulent city for those days. This place the consul did not venture to assail, but he captured from the Antiates another town, named Caeno, of far less wealth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While the Aequi and Volsci kept the Roman armies busy, the Sabines advanced clear to the gates of the City on a plundering raid. A few days after this they themselves had to confront two armies, for both the consuls indignantly invaded their borders, and they suffered greater losses than they had themselves inflicted.
				</p> <pb id="p.429"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="64"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Towards the close of the year there was a<note type="margin">B.C. 469-468</note> brief season of peace, but, as always on other occasions, a peace distracted by the strife of patricians and plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The angry plebs refused to take part in the consular elections:<note>Held in the centuriate comitia.</note> by the votes of the patricians and their clients Titus Quinctius and Quintus Servilius were chosen consuls. They experienced a year like the preceding one: dissensions, to begin with, then a foreign war and tranquillity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Sabines executed a rapid march across the Crustuminian plains, bringing fire and sword to the country about the river Anio. When almost at the Colline Gate and the City walls they were beaten back, yet they carried off immense spoils of men and cattle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Servilius the consul pursued them with an army, and though he could not overtake the column itself on ground which was suitable for offering battle, he devastated the country so extensively as to leave nothing untouched by the ravages of war, and returned with many times the plunder which the Romans had lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Operations in the Volscian country, too, were very successful, thanks both to the general and to his soldiers. First, there was a pitched battle in the open field, with enormous numbers killed and wounded on both sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans indeed, whose fewness made them feel their loss more sensibly, would have fallen back, had it not been for a salutary falsehood told by the consul, who shouted that the enemy were running away on the other wing, and so aroused the spirits of his troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans charged and, believing themselves to be conquering, they conquered. The consul feared lest by pressing the enemy too hard he might cause a renewal of the struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He therefore gave the signal for the recall. For a few <pb id="p.431"/>days both sides rested, as if they had tacitly agreed<note type="margin">B.C. 469-468</note> on a truce. Meanwhile a great force of men came in from all their tribes to the camp of the Volsci and Aequi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They made no question but that the Romans, if they had perceived them, would retreat in the night, and accordingly at about the third watch<note>The Romans divided the night into four equal watches, beginning at sunset.</note> they came to attack the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Quinctius stilled the tumult which the sudden alarm had raised, and bidding the soldiers remain quietly in their tents, led out a cohort of Hernici to an outpost, and mounting trumpeters and buglers upon horses, ordered them to blow their instruments in front of the rampart and keep the enemy in suspense till daybreak.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the remainder of the night all was so peaceful in camp that the Romans were even able to sleep. But the Volsci, beholding armed foot-soldiers, whom they supposed to be more numerous than they were, and to be Romans; and hearing the stamping and neighing of the horses, which were infuriated not only at finding unaccustomed riders on their backs, but also by the blare of the trumpets, were kept on the alert in anticipation of an attack.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="65"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as it was light, the Romans, who<note type="margin">B.C. 468</note> were fresh and had enjoyed a good sleep, were led out into line of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Volsci, weary from standing and from loss of sleep, were driven back at the first assault; though it was rather a retreat than a rout, for behind them were hills, to which, under cover of the first line, they withdrew safely and in good order. The consul ordered a halt when his army reached rising ground. The infantry could hardly be restrained, noisily demanding permission to press on after the fleeing enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Still more ardent were the cavalry. They swarmed about the general, and shouted that <pb id="p.433"/>they were going on before the standards. While the<note type="margin">B.C. 468</note> consul was hesitating, feeling certain of the valour of his troops but doubtful of the ground, the men cried out that they were going, and instantly made good their word. Planting their spears in the ground, that they might be the lighter for the ascent, they went up at a run.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Volsci, having discharged their javelins at the first onset, picked up the stones which lay about under their feet, and flung them at their enemies as they mounted. Confused by this rain of missiles from above, the left wing of the Romans was nearly overwhelmed, and had already begun to retreat, when the consul, reproaching them at once with rashness and with cowardice, succeeded in shaming them out of their fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> First they made a resolute stand; then, after holding their ground and returning blow for blow, they even dared to press forward and, renewing their cheers, set their line in motion; then with another rush they struggled upward and scaled the height; and they were just emerging upon the summit of the ridge, when the enemy turned and fled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Running at full speed, and almost in one body, the pursued and the pursuers reached the Volscian camp, which was captured in the panic. Those of the Volsci who succeeded in escaping made for Antium, and to Antium marched the Roman army also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After a blockade of a few days the place surrendered; the besiegers had not delivered any new attack, but the Volsci had lost heart from the moment of their unsuccessful battle and the capture of their camp.

			<div1 type="book" n="2s"><head>Summary of book II</head>
				<p>BRUTUS bound the people with an oath to allow no one
					to reign in Rome. Tarquinius Collatinus, his colleague,
					who had incurred suspicion because of his relationship to
					the Tarquinii, he forced to abdicate the consulship and
					withdraw from the state. He ordered the king's goods
					to be plundered, and consecrated his land to Mars. It
					was named the Campus Martius. Certain noble youths&mdash;among them his own sons and his brother's&mdash;he beheaded,
					because they had conspired to bring back the kings. To
					the slave who gave the information, a man called Vindicius, he gave his freedom; from his name came the word
					<hi rend="italics">vindicta.</hi> Having led an army against the princes, who
					had collected forces from Veii and Tarquinii and begun a
					war, he fell in the battle, together with Arruns, the son
					of Superbus, and the matrons mourned for him a year.
					Publius Valerius the consul proposed a law about appealing to the people. The Capitol was dedicated. Porsenna,
					king of Clusium, made war in behalf of the Tarquinii and
					came to Janiculum, but was prevented from crossing the
					Tiber by the bravery of Horatius Cocles, who, while the
					others were cutting down the Sublician Bridge, kept the
					Etruscans at bay, single-handed, and when the bridge
					had been destroyed, threw himself armed into the river
					and swam across to his fellows. Another example of
					courage was exhibited by Mucius. Having entered the
					camp of the enemy with the purpose of killing Porsenna,
					he slew a secretary, whom he had taken for the king.
					Being arrested, he placed his hand upon the altar, where
					sacrifice had been made, and suffering it to be burned off,
					declared that there were three hundred others as determined as himself. Overcome with astonishment at their
					daring, Porsenna proposed terms of peace and, having
					<pb id="p.437"/>
					taken hostages, relinquished the war. One of the hostages, the maiden Cloelia, evaded the sentinels and swam
					across the Tiber to her people. She was given up to
					Porsenna, but was restored by him with marks of honour,
					and was presented with an equestrian statue. Aulus
					Postumius the dictator fought a successful battle against
					Tarquinius Superbus, who was advancing with an army
					of Latins. Appius Claudius came over from the Sabines
					to the Romans. On this account the Claudian tribe was
					added and the number of tribes was increased to twent-yone. The plebs, after seceding to the Sacred Mount because
					of those who had been enslaved for debt, were induced by
					the advice of Menenius Agrippa to cease from their rebellion. The same Agrippa when he died was buried,
					owing to his poverty, at the state's expense. Five
					plebeian tribunes were elected. The Volscian town of
					Corioli was captured by the valiant efforts of Gnaeus
					Marcius, who acquired from this circumstance the name
					of Coriolanus. Titus Latinius, a man of the plebs, was
					warned in a dream to inform the senate regarding certain
					offences against religion. Having neglected to do it, he
					lost a son and was paralysed in his feet. When he had
					been carried to the senate in a litter and had revealed
					these same matters, he recovered the use of his feet and
					returned to his house. When Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus, who had been driven into exile and had been made
					general of the Volsci, had led a hostile army nearly to
					Rome, and when the envoys who had been sent to him
					at first and afterwards the priests had vainly besought
					him not to make war upon his native land, his mother
					Veturia and his wife Volumnia persuaded him to withdraw. For the first time a land-law was proposed.
					Spurius Cassius, the ex-consul, charged with aspiring to
					be king, was condemned and put to death. Opillia, a
					Vestal Virgin, was buried alive for unchastity. The neighbouring Veientes being a troublesome rather than a dangerous enemy, the Fabian family asked to be allowed to
					carry on that war, and dispatched thither 306 armed men,
					<pb id="p.439"/>
					who were all but one killed by the enemy at the Cremera.
					When Appius Claudius the consul had sustained a defeat
					at the hands of the Volsci, owing to the contumacy of
					his army, he caused every tenth soldier to be scourged
					to death. It contains besides campaigns against the
					Volsci, the Hernici, and the Veientes, and the quarrels
					between the patricians and the plebs.
