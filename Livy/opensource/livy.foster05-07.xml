				<p>THE Latin text of Vols. II. to IV. (comprising
					Books III.-X.) has been set up, like that of Vol. I.,
					from the latest revisions of the Weissenborn-Mueller
					edition with German notes, except that the <hi rend="italics">Periochae</hi>
					have been reprinted from the text of Rossbach
					(1910). But the spelling is that adopted by Professors Conway and Walters in their critical edition
					of Books I.-V. and Books VI.-X. (Oxford, 1914 and
					1919), which is the source also of most of the rather
					numerous readings which differ from those of the
					Weissenborn-Mueller text, and has furnished besides
					the materials from which the textual notes have
					been drawn up. I have aimed to record every
					instance where the reading printed does not rest on
					the authority of one or more of the good MSS., and
					to indicate the provenience of the emendation. In
					addition to the symbols used by the Oxford editors,
					I have employed <foreign lang="greek">W</foreign> to designate such of the good
					MSS. as are not cited specifically for some other
					reading, and <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> to designate one or more of the late
					MSS. or early printed texts.</p>
				<p>Besides the translations mentioned in the preface
					to Vol. I. (those of Philemon Holland, George
					<pb id="p.viii"/>
					Baker, and Canon Roberts) I have had by me the
					anonymous version printed in London in 1686, in
					folio, <quote>for Awnsham Churchill at the Black Swan
						in Ave-Mary Lane, near Paternoster Row.</quote> </p>
				<p>I am also indebted to the following editions of
					parts of Livy: Book III. by P. Thoresby Jones,
					Oxford, 1914; IV. by H. M. Stephenson, Cambridge, 1890; V. by Leonard Whibley, Cambridge,
					1910; V.-VII. by Cluer and Matheson, Oxford,
					1904; VI. by F. H. Marshall, Cambridge, 1908;
					IX. by W. B. Anderson, Cambridge, 1909, and by
					T. Nicklin, Oxford, 1910. The commentaries of
					Weissenborn-Mueller and Luterbacher have, of
					course, been constantly consulted.</p>
				<p>The maps illustrating the campaign of the Allia
					have been adapted from Kromayer and Veith,
					Schlachten-Atlas zur antiken Kriegsgeschichte,
					published by Wagner and Debes, Leipzig.</p>

			<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Peace was now established elsewhere, but<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> Romans and Veientes were at war, and their rage and animosity were such that the end was clearly at hand for those that should be vanquished. Each people held an election very different from that of the other.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans enlarged the number of their military tribunes with consular authority, and elected eight,<note>Livy seems to have erred through including the names of the censors, Camillus and Albinus, in his list of tribunes, of whom there were at this time but six. See chap. x. &sect; 1 and chap. xiv. &sect; 5 and notes there.</note> a greater number than ever before, to wit, Manius Aemilius Mamercus (for the second time), Lucius Valerius Potitus (for the third), Appius Claudius Crassus, Marcus Quinctilius Varus, Lucius Julius lulus, Marcus Postumius, Marcus Furius Camillus, Marcus Postumius Albinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the Veientes, weary of annual canvassing, which was sometimes the cause of brawls, chose a king. This gave offence to the feelings of the Etruscan peoples, who loathed not more the institution of kings than the King himself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had for some time been hateful to the nation by reason of his wealth and arrogance, since he had violently broken up a solemn <pb id="p.5"/>festival, which it is impious to interrupt, in his<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> resentment of a political rebuff;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and because the suffrages of the Twelve Peoples had returned another man as priest in preference to him, he had suddenly carried off the actors, most of whom were his own slaves, in the middle of the games.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so the nation which was devoted beyond all others to religious rites (and all the more because it excelled in the art of observing them) voted to refuse its help to the men of Veil, so long as they should obey a king.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This vote the Veientes would not suffer to be mentioned, in their fear of the King, who had a way of treating the man by whom any such saying was reported as a leader in sedition, not as the bearer of an idle tale.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Although the Romans got word that things were quiet in Etruria, still, because they
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> heard that this question came up at all their meetings, they so constructed their works as to have a double fortification, one facing Veii, to oppose the sallies of the townsfolk, the other confronting Etruria, to shut off any assistance that might come from thence.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the Roman generals hoped more from a siege than from an assault, they even began the erection of winter quarters &mdash;a new thing to the Roman soldier &mdash;and planned to carry the campaign on, straight through the winter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When news of this came to Rome, to the plebeian tribunes, who had now for a long time been unable to
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> hit upon any pretext for agitation, they hurried before the assembly and set to work upon the passions of the commons: So this was the reason that the soldiers had been granted pay!
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They had not been mistaken in thinking that this gift of their opponents would be smeared with poison. The liberty of the <pb id="p.7"/>commons had been sold; the young men, having<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> been permanently removed and banished from the City and from the state, were no longer free, even in winter and the stormy season, to see to their homes and their affairs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What, they asked, did their hearers suppose to be the reason for making the service continuous? They would assuredly find no other motive than this:
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> lest, through the presence in large numbers of the young men in whom lay all the vigour of the commons, something might be accomplished for the people's good. Moreover, they were far more ruthlessly abused and trodden down than
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> were the Veientes, who, for their part, spent the winter in their houses, safeguarding their city by means of strong walls and natural defences, whilst the Roman soldiers were enduring toil and danger, overwhelmed with snows and frosts, in tents, not even laying aside their weapons in the winter time, a season of respite from all wars both by land and by sea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Such slavery as this neither kings, nor the proud consuls who came before the establishment of the tribunician power, nor the stern authority of a dictator, nor harsh decemvirs, had laid upon them, &mdash; that they should wage perennial war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pray what would those men do if they should become consuls or dictators, who had made the semblance of consular authority so savage and truculent? But the commons were only getting their deserts. There had been no room even amongst eight military tribunes for a single plebeian.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Heretofore the patricians had been wont with the utmost exertion to fill three places in a year: now they were advancing eight abreast to make good their authority, and there was never a commoner hanging on to the crowd, were it <pb id="p.9"/>only to remind his colleagues that their soldiers were<note type="marg">B c. 403</note> not slaves but freemen and fellow citizens;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> whom, at least in winter, they were bound to bring back to the shelter of their houses, and to leave them some portion of the year to
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> look after their parents, their children, and their wives, and to use their liberty and elect magistrates.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>As they shouted forth these and suchlike arguments, they found an opponent not unequal to them in Appius Claudius, whom his colleagues had left behind to repress sedition on the part of the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He was a man experienced from his youth up in contentions with the plebs, and I have related how, some years before, he had advised that the intervention of their colleagues be used to break the power of the tribunes.<note>See Book IV, chap. xlviii. The Appius Claudius here mentioned was a grandson of the decemvir.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The man not only had a nimble wit but was already a practised orator, and he delivered on this occasion a speech to the following effect:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> "If it has ever been a question, Quirites, whether it was for your sake or their own that the tribunes of the commons have always encouraged sedition, I am certain that the doubt has this year been resolved;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and not only do I rejoice that you have at length cleared up a long misunderstanding, but I congratulate both you, - and on your account the state as well, that it has: happened at a time, of all others, when your affairs are prospering.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Or is there anyone who doubts that no wrongs which you have suffered, if haply such there have sometimes been, have ever so offended and stirred up the plebeian tribunes as has the boon which the Fathers bestowed upon the commons, when they granted pay for military service?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What else do you believe they <pb id="p.11"/>were afraid of then, or are seeking now to shatter,<note type="marg">B. C. 403</note> but the harmony of the orders, which they regard as very apt to overthrow the tribunician authority?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Indeed they are like quack-salvers seeking employment, since they desire that there should always be some disease in the body politic, that there may be something which you may call them in to cure.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Pray, are you tribunes defending the commons, or attacking them? Are you adversaries of the soldiers, or their advocates?
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Or perhaps this is your plea: 'Whatever the Fathers do displeases us, be it in behalf of the commons or against them'; and just as masters forbid outsiders to have aught to do with their slaves, and think it right that they should abstain alike from benefiting and from harming them, so you deny the Fathers intercourse with the commons, lest we by our friendliness and liberality encourage them, or they become dutiful and obedient to us.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> How much more, if you had in you the slightest &mdash;I say not patriotism, but &mdash;humanity, ought you rather to have favoured, and, so far as in you lay, to have encouraged the kindly spirit of the Fathers and the complaisance of the plebs?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And if this harmony should last, who would not make bold to warrant that our empire would soon be the greatest among the neighbouring peoples?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"I shall presently explain, in regard to this plan of my colleagues, who have not been willing to withdraw the army from Veii with its task unaccomplished, &mdash;how not merely profitable but even necessary it was.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But first I wish to speak about the actual condition of the soldiers; and I think that if I should express my meaning not in your presence only but also in the camp, the army itself <pb id="p.13"/>would judge it reasonable. Indeed, though I were<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> unable to think of anything to urge myself, I could be quite content with the speeches of my opponents.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were lately insisting that pay ought not to be given to the men, because it never had been given. How then can they object, if to those who have gained some new advantage be allotted new labour also, in proportion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nowhere, as a rule, is service given without recompense, nor recompense except for service; toil and pleasure, most unlike in nature, have been linked together in a sort of natural bond.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Formerly the soldier was vexed that he must serve the state at his own cost; yet he was happy to be able, for a half of the year, to till his own field and gain the means of keeping himself and his family, whether he were at home or with the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Now he is happy that the state affords him gain, and is glad to receive his pay. Let him therefore be resigned to remaining away a little longer from his home and his property, which is now under no heavy charges.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Why, if the commonwealth should call him to a reckoning, would it not justly say, 'You have a year's stipend, render a year's service; do you think it right that for a campaign of six months you should receive the pay of twelve?'
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I dislike to dwell upon this point, Quirites; for it is thus that men who employ mercenaries ought to argue; we would deal as though with fellow citizens, and we think it only right that you deal with us as with your native country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Either we ought not to have undertaken the war, or we ought to conduct it as befits the Roman People, and end it as quickly as possible.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And we shall end it, if we press our beleaguered foes, and quit them not till we have fulfilled our <pb id="p.15"/>hopes and captured Veii. Truly, if there were no<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> other reason, the very indignity of the thing should compel us to persist!
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Did all Greece once, for one woman's sake, war ten years against a city so far from home, with all those lands and seas between?
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And does it irk us, being less than twenty miles away and almost within sight of Rome, to maintain a siege for a single year? Doubtless our reason for fighting is a trivial one, and we have no proper and sufficient grievance to incite us to persevere!
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Seven times have they renewed the war; never have they kept faith in peace; our fields they have pillaged a thousand times; they forced the Fidenates to forsake us; our settlers there they put to death;
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> it was they who instigated, in violation of the law of nations, the impious murder of our envoys; they sought to raise up all Etruria against us, and they are striving to this end to-day; when our ambassadors sought redress they well-nigh did them bodily injury.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"With such enemies ought we to wage a fainthearted and dilatory war? If so just grounds of resentment have no power to move us, pray have the following considerations none?
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The city is hemmed in with vast siege-works, which confine the enemy within his walls; he has not cultivated his land, and what was cultivated has been laid waste in the war;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> if we bring our army back, who can doubt that not only a desire for revenge, but also necessity, constraining them to plunder others since they have lost their own possessions, will cause them to invade our territory? So we are not postponing the war, if we act on your advice, but are receiving it within our own borders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And what of that matter which <pb id="p.17"/>specially concerns the soldiers, whom the worthy<note type="marg">B. C. 403</note> plebeian tribunes formerly wished to rob of their pay, but are now desirous of protecting? How does it stand with them?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The rampart and the trench, each involving prodigious toil, they have carried all that distance; forts they erected only a few at first, but since then, with the growth of the army, they have built very many; they have thrown up earthworks, not only against the city, but also facing Etruria, if any aid should come from that side; what need to speak of towers, mantlets, penthouses, and the rest of the equipment for storming towns?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When they have expended all this labour, and the end of their task is at last in sight, do you: vote for abandoning these things, that when summer comes they may sweat and toil again to produce them afresh?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> How much less effort it requires to guard what is already made, and to press on and persevere and put an end to our anxiety! For surely it is- a thing soon done, if we carry it through without stopping, and do not ourselves drag out our hopes with these interruptions and delays.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I talk of the loss of time and labour; what of the danger that we run by putting off the war? Do -the frequent debates in Etruria about the dispatch of succours to Veii allow us to forget it?
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Just now they are angry and resentful, and declare that they will send none; for all they care, we may capture Veii. But who is to guarantee that if we postpone the campaign they will hereafter feel the same:
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> since if you slacken, a greater and more numerous embassy will set out, <pb id="p.19"/>and since what now offends the Etruscans &mdash;the<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> setting up of a king at Veii &mdash;may be altered with the lapse of time or by agreement of the citizens, to the end that thereby they may regain the goodwill of Etruria; or with the consent of the King himself, who would not wish his sovereignty to hurt the safety of his people?
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> See how many undesirable consequences attend that line of policy: the loss of works constructed with such effort; the imminent devastation of our fields; the Etruscans, instead of the Veientes only, aroused to war with us.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is thus, tribunes, that you would manage matters, much as though in dealing with a sick man, who if he would undergo a strict regimen might begin at once to recover, you should protract his illness and perhaps render it incurable, by .indulging his immediate desire for meat and drink.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"If it were of no moment to this war, it was yet, I assure you, of the utmost importance for military discipline that our soldiers become accustomed not only to pluck a victory within their grasp, but
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> if a campaign should be even more protracted, to put up with the tedium and await the outcome of their hopes, however long-deferred; and if a war be not finished in a summer, to stay for winter, nor, like birds of passage, cast about at once, on the approach of autumn, for shelter and covert.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Do the eagerness, pray, and delight that men have in hunting carry them through snow and frost into the mountains and the forests; and shall not we use in the stress of war the same resolution which even sport and pleasure are wont to call out?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Do we think the bodies of our soldiers so effeminate, their hearts so faint, that they cannot endure to be one <pb id="p.21"/>winter in camp, away from home; that like sailors<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> they must wage war with an eye on the weather, observing the seasons, incapable of withstanding heat or cold?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They would certainly blush if anyone should charge them with this, and would maintain that manly endurance was in their souls and bodies, and that they could campaign as well in winter as in summer; that they had given the tribunes no commission to protect softness and idleness; and that they were mindful that their grandsires had not founded the tribunician power in the shade or under roofs.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>"It is due to the valour of your soldiers, it is due to the Roman name, that you should look not merely to Veii and this present war that is upon us, but should seek for the years to come a reputation that will serve you in other wars and amongst all other nations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Do you suppose there will be no great difference in men's opinion of us, whether our neighbours conclude the Roman People to be such, that if a city withstand the brunt of their first assault for a very brief time, it need thenceforward have no fears;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> or whether our name inspire such dread, that men believe that once a Roman army has sat down before a town, it will never budge, either from the weariness of a protracted siege or from the rigours of winter, that it knows no other end of war but victory, and relies in its campaigns not more on swiftness than on perseverance?
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For perseverance, needful in every kind of warfare, is especially so in besieging cities, since fortifications and natural advantages make most of them impregnable, and time itself subdues them, with hunger and thirst, and captures them, as it
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> shall capture Veii, unless <pb id="p.23"/>the plebeian tribunes help our enemies, and the<note type="marg">B. C. 403</note> Veientes find in Rome those succours which they are seeking to no purpose in Etruria.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><quote>Could anything happen which would so please the Veientes as that factions should spring up, first in the City of Rome, and then, as though by contagion, in the camp?
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But our enemies, by Heaven, are so well disciplined that no weariness of the blockade nor even of kingly rule has occasioned the smallest revolt among them; neither has the Etruscans' denial of help provoked their spirit; for whosoever prompts sedition shall forthwith die the death;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> nor shall any man there have licence to say what is said with impunity to you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Death by cudgelling is the wage of him who forsakes the standards or quits his post; but those who advise the men to abandon their standards and desert the camp gain a hearing, not with one or two soldiers, but with whole armies, openly, in public meetings;
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> so accustomed are you to hear with complacency whatever a tribune says, even if it tends to betray the City and to undo the state; and captivated by the charm of that authority, you suffer any wickedness whatsoever to lurk beneath it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It only remains for them to utter in camp and in the presence of the soldiers the view which they noisily publish here, and to corrupt the armies and not to suffer them to obey their leaders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For in the upshot liberty has come to mean at Rome, that a man respect neither senate nor magistrates, nor laws, nor ancestral customs, nor institutions of the fathers, nor military discipline.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Appius was already holding his own with the tribunes of the plebs, even in public meetings,<note>Livy implies that the speech which he has reported above was delivered in the Senate.</note> when a sudden disaster, from a source which could <pb id="p.25"/>least have been anticipated, befell the army before<note type="marg">B.C. 403</note> Veii, giving Appius the advantage in the argument, while it increased the mutual good-will of the orders and their ardour for a more vigorous prosecution of the siege.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For when they had pushed forward the terrace towards the town, and had all but brought the mantlets into contact with the walls, &mdash;more intent upon erecting their works by day than on guarding them by night, &mdash;the
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> gate was suddenly flung open, and a vast horde, most of them armed with torches, hurled fire on the works, and in an hour's time terrace and mantlets, that had taken so long to make, were consumed in the flames; and many men perished by the sword or the fire, in vain efforts to save them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the news of this came to Rome, it filled the City with sadness, the senate with anxiety and apprehension, lest they might now indeed be unable to check the disaffection, either in the City or the camp, and the tribunes might crow over the commonwealth as though they had overthrown it; when lo!
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> those who were of equestrian rating, but had not received horses from the state, having first taken counsel together, came to the senate, and being granted a hearing, volunteered to serve on their own horses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These men had no sooner received a vote of thanks from the senate, in the most honourable terms, and the report of it had spread to the Forum and the City, than the plebeians suddenly ran together to the Curia, and:
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> declared that it was now the turn of the foot-soldiers to proffer extraordinary service to the state, whether it would have them march to Veii, or anywhere else;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> if they should be led to Veii, they promised that they would not quit their ground <pb id="p.27"/>until they had taken the enemy's city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then<note type="marg">B. C. 403</note> indeed the senate could scarce control its already overflowing joy; for they did not, as with the knights, issue an order to the magistrates to thank them, nor did they call them into the Curia to receive an answer, neither did the senate keep within the House; but each for himself cried out from above,<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> from the steps that led down to the Comitium.</note> to the multitude standing in the Comitium, and by speech and gesture signified the general joy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Rome was blest, they said, and invincible and eternal, by reason of this noble harmony; they praised the knights, they praised the plebeians, they extolled the very day itself, and confessed that the courtesy and good-will of the senate had been surpassed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Fathers and commoners mingled their tears of joy, till the Fathers were recalled into the senate-house, and
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> decreed that the military tribunes should hold an assembly and thank the infantry and the knights, and say to them that the senate would remember their loyalty to their country, and that it was voted that all who had volunteered to serve out of their due order should receive pay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The knights, too, were granted a definite money allowance. Then for the first time cavalry-men began to serve on their own horses. The volunteer army, having marched to Veii, not only replaced the works that had been lost, but added new ones. The city dispatched provisions with more than its former zeal, that nothing might be lacking to an army that had deserved so well.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The ensuing year had for consular tribunes<note type="marg">B. C. 402</note> Gaius Servilius Ahala (for the third time), Quintus Servilius, Lucius Verginius, Quintus Sulpicius, Aulus Manlius (for the second time), and Manius Sergius <pb id="p.29"/>(for the second time). In their term of office, while<note type="marg">B.C. 402</note> everyone was intent on the war with Veii, the garrison at Anxur was neglected;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> soldiers were given furlough, Volscian traders were admitted without discrimination, and, the sentinels at the gates being suddenly overpowered, the town was taken.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Not many soldiers perished, because they were all, except the sick, occupied, like sutlers, with trafficking in the country-side and the towns near by.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor were things any better at Veii, which was at that time the nation's chief concern; for the Roman commanders showed more jealousy of one another than spirit in dealing with the enemy, whose forces moreover were enlarged by the unexpected accession of the Capenates and the Faliscans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These two Etruscan peoples, being nearest in situation, believed that if the Veientes were conquered it would be their turn next to face a Roman invasion. The Faliscans, besides, had incurred hostility on their own account, because they had been mixed up before in the war with Fidenae.<note>See IV. xvii. 11.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So they exchanged embassies, bound themselves by an oath, and their armies suddenly appeared before Veii. It happened that they attacked the camp at that point where the tribune Manius Sergius was in command, and great was the terror they inspired, since the Romans thought that all Etruria had risen and was come with a mighty array against them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same belief roused up the Veientes in the town. Thus a two-fold attack was directed against the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The soldiers rallied into groups, facing now this way and now that, yet were unable either quite to confine the Veientes within the siege-lines, or to ward off the attack upon their own defences and protect <pb id="p.31"/>themselves from the enemy outside. Their only<note type="marg">B.C. 402</note> hope was if help should come from the larger camp, so that the legions might face different ways, some of them confronting the Capenates and Faliscans, and others the sortie of the townsfolk.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But that camp was under the command of Verginius, who was privately hated by Sergius and returned his enmity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This man, though word was brought that many bastions had been stormed and the ramparts scaled, and that the enemy were attacking on both sides, held his troops under arms, saying that if his colleague needed help he would let him know.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> His pride found a match in the other's obstinacy, and Sergius, lest he should seem to have required any aid of his rival, preferred defeat at the hands of the enemy to victory gained through a fellow citizen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For a long time the Romans were slaughtered between the two attacking armies; finally they abandoned their works, and a very few escaped into the larger camp, while Sergius himself, with the chief part of his men, kept on to Rome. It was there decided, on his throwing all the blame upon his colleague, to summon Verginius from camp, and in the meanwhile put lieutenants in command of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The affair was then debated in the senate and the colleagues heaped abuse on one another. There were but few who spoke for the commonwealth: most of them argued for one or the other disputant, according as each was swayed by private interest or favour.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The leading senators held, that whether the: fault or the misfortune of the commanders were the cause of this shameful disaster, they ought not to await the regular time for elections, but proceed at once to choose new military tribunes, to begin <pb id="p.33"/>their magistracy on the first of October.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While the<note type="marg">B.C. 402</note> members were voting for this proposal, the other military tribunes raised no objection;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but of all people Sergius and Verginius, the very men on account of whom it was evident that the senate was disgusted with the magistrates of that year, first begged to be spared the humiliation, then vetoed the senate's decree,<note>The <hi rend="italics">senatus consultum</hi> was no more than a 'resolution' which the presiding magistrate might, if he chose, refuse to carry out.</note> declaring that they would not resign their authority before the thirteenth of December, the accustomed day for entering upon office.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whereupon the tribunes of the plebs, who so long as harmony prevailed and the affairs of the City prospered, had reluctantly held their tongues, suddenly broke out and threatened the tribunes of the soldiers, that unless they submitted to the senate they would send them to prison.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then Gaius Servilius Ahala, a military tribune, said: <quote>So far as concerns you, tribunes of the commons, and your menaces, I should indeed willingly put it to the proof how you have in your threats as little legality as courage; but it is impious to oppose the authority of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly do you give over seeking in our quarrels occasion for working mischief, and my colleagues shall either do as the senate decrees, or if they persist in stubborn opposition, I will forthwith name a dictator, to compel them to lay down their authority.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech was universally approved, and the Fathers rejoiced that they needed not the trumpery threats of the tribunician power, but had found another and a greater force to coerce the magistrates;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and the latter, overborne by the unanimity of feeling, held an election of military tribunes, to begin service on October the first, and before that date resigned their office.</p> <pb id="p.35"/>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consular tribuneship of Lucius Valerius<note type="marg">B.

The error here and in chap. i. &sect; 2 (see note) is tacitly corrected in chap. xiv. &sect; 5.</note> ), Manius Aemilius Mamercus (for the third), Gnaeus Cornelius Cossus (for the second), Caeso Fabius Ambustus, and Lucius Julius lulus,<note>Not the same man as mentioned in chap. i. &sect; 2.</note> was a time of great activity both at home and in the field.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For they made war at many points simultaneously, before Veii, at Capena, at Falerii, and in the Volscian country &mdash;to recover Anxur from the enemy; &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> in Rome both the levy and the payment of the war-tax occasioned difficulties, a quarrel sprang up over the co-optation of plebeian tribunes, and the trials: of the two who had lately exercised consular powers aroused no small commotion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The first concern of the military tribunes was to levy troops, and they not only enrolled the younger men, but also compelled the seniors to enlist for service in guarding the City. But the more they increased the number of the soldiers, the more money they required for pay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This they tried to collect by taxation; but those who remained at home contributed with reluctance, because they had also in defence of the City to perform the labour of soldiers and serve the commonwealth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To make this obligation, heavy in itself, seem yet more grievous, the tribunes of the plebs delivered seditious speeches, in which they alleged that the senators had established pay for the troops for this reason, that they might ruin one half of the plebs with fighting and the other half with taxation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were now drawing out a single war into its third year, and were purposely misconducting it, that they might conduct it the longer. Again, with one levy they had enrolled armies for four wars, and <pb id="p.37"/>had haled away even boys and old men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now they<note type="marg">B.C. 401</note> were confounding winter with summer, to allow no rest ever to the unhappy commons, on whom finally they had even imposed a tax;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that when they should drag home their bodies spent with toil, with wounds, and at last with old age, and should then find all things gone to waste in the long absence of the owners, they might pay tribute out of their diminished property, and return to the state many times, as it were with usury, the wages they had received as soldiers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>What with the levy and the tax and the weightier cares that preoccupied men's minds, they were unable on the day of election to return the full number of plebeian tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> An effort was then made to obtain the co-optation of patricians for the vacant places. When this failed, nevertheless, in order to invalidate the law, it was brought about that Gaius Lacerius and Marcus Acutius should be chosen tribunes, without doubt through patrician influence.<note>From the beginning no patrician might become a tribune of the plebs (II. xxxiii. 1) and in 448 the Trebonian law forbade co-optation to that office (III. lxv. 4).</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It so happened that in that year one of the tribunes was Gnaeus Trebonius, whose name and family seemed to make it his duty to defend the Trebonian law.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This man said that what the Fathers had formerly aimed at (and had been foiled on their first attempting), the tribunes of the soldiers had finally extorted; he asseverated that the Trebonian law had been done away with, and that the tribunes of the plebs had been appointed not by the votes of the people but at the dictation of the nobles;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that things had come to such a pass, that they must perforce have either patricians or the satellites of patricians for tribunes of the plebs; their sacred laws were being taken <pb id="p.39"/>away, the tribunician power wrested from them.<note type="marg">B.C. 401</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was done, he declared, by the knavery of the patricians, the rascality and the treason of his colleagues.</p> 
			<p>Men were burning with resentment, not only against the patricians, but also against the tribunes of the plebs, both those who had been co-opted and those who had co-opted them, when three of the college, Publius Curatius, Marcus Metilius, and Marcus Minucius, being alarmed at their own situation, I fell violently upon Sergius and Verginius, the military tribunes of the previous year, and by appointing them a day for trial turned against them the anger and displeasure which the plebs had evinced towards themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They reminded their hearers, that those who were aggrieved by the levy, or the tax, or the protracted service and the long duration of the war, those who sorrowed for the calamity that befell at Veii, those whose houses were in mourning for the loss of sons, brothers, kinsmen or connexions, &mdash;that
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> all those now had the right and the power, thanks to the speakers, of avenging the nation's grief and their own private sorrow on the two culprits; for of all their sufferings Sergius and Verginius were the cause;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and this their accusers were not more forward to maintain than the defendants to confess, who, equally guilty, threw the blame on one another, Verginius taxing Sergius with his flight, while Sergius complained of Verginius's treachery.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Their madness had been so incredible, that it was much more probable that they had done the thing upon agreement, with the collusion of the senators;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> who having before given opportunity to the Veientes to set fire to their works, in order to <pb id="p.41"/>prolong the war, had now betrayed the army and<note type="marg">B. C. 401</note> delivered up a Roman camp to the Faliscans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were doing everything to wear out the young men before Veii, and prevent the tribunes from bringing before the people the question of land and other advantages to the plebs, and from pushing their measures in well-attended assemblies and thwarting the conspiracy of the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Judgment was already given against the accused both by the senate and by the Roman People, and also by their own college; for the senate had by its decree removed them from authority, and when they refused to abdicate their office, their colleagues had coerced them by threatening to appoint a dictator, and the Roman People had elected tribunes to assume their duties, not on the thirteenth of December, the usual date, but immediately, on October the first, believing that the state could endure no longer if the incumbents should remain in place;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> yet, in spite of all, these men, stigmatized and fore-judged by so many adverse verdicts, presented themselves for trial by the people, and fancied that they were quit and sufficiently mulcted because they were made private citizens two months before their time;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> not perceiving that they had then merely been deprived of the power to do further mischief, not punished, since their colleagues, too, were turned out of office, though they had certainly done no wrong.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Let the Quirites call back the spirit they had shown when the recent calamity had occurred, when they had beheld the flight and confusion of their troops, as they stumbled, wounded and dismayed, through the City gates, accusing neither fortune nor any of the gods, but these their <pb id="p.43"/>leaders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> They were sure that there was not a man<note type="marg">B. C. 401</note> present in the assembly who had not on that day cursed and execrated the lives, the houses, and the fortunes of Lucius Verginius and Manius Sergius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It was not reasonable that their hearers, having a legal and moral right in the matter, should not use their power against those upon whom each one of them had invoked the wrath of Heaven. The gods themselves never laid hands upon the guilty; it was enough if they armed with an opportunity for vengeance those who had been wronged.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Incited by these speeches, the plebs<note type="marg">B.C. 400</note> condemned the accused to pay each a fine of 10,000 pounds of bronze. It was in vain that Sergius blamed Fortune and the common chance of war, while Verginius begged that he might
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> not be more unlucky at home than he had been in the campaign.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On them the wrath of the people was poured out, and the co-optation of the tribunes and the evasion of the Trebonian law were almost forgotten.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The victorious tribunes, that the plebs might have an immediate reward for its judgment, proposed a land-law and forbade the gathering of the war-tax, notwithstanding that pay was needed for so many armies, whose campaigning, though successful, yet failed to realize the desired end in any war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus, at Veii, they recovered the lost camp and strengthened it with fortresses and garrisons, led by the military tribunes Manius Aemilius and Caeso Fabius; Marcus Furius in the Faliscan country, and Gnaeus Cornelius in the territory of Capena, meeting no enemies afield, drove off booty, and burning farmhouses and crops, laid waste the land, but the towns they neither assaulted nor besieged;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> in the Volscian <pb id="p.45"/>country, however, after ravaging the fields, they<note type="marg">B. c. 400</note> made a futile attack on Anxur, which was seated on an eminence, and finding force to be unavailing, began to invest it with a stockade and trench, under Valerius Potitus, who had got the command against the Volsci.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>While military affairs were in this posture, a quarrel that broke out at home aroused more energy than went to their making of wars; and since the tax could not be taken up, on account of the tribunes, and the generals were sent no money, while the soldiers were clamouring for their pay, the camp, too, was like to have been disrupted by the contagion of mutiny in the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the midst of this hostility which the plebs felt towards the patricians, though the plebeian tribunes said that the time was now come to establish liberty, and to transfer the highest office from such as Sergius and Verginius to
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> stout and courageous commoners, yet they got no further than the election of one plebeian (by way of asserting their right), namely, Publius Licinius Calvus, to be military tribune with consular powers;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the others chosen were patricians: Publius Manlius, Lucius Titinius, Publius Maelius, Lucius Furius Medullinus, Lucius Publilius Volscus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The plebeians themselves were amazed that they had gained so important a point, and not alone the man who had been chosen, one that had held no offices before, but was only a senator of long standing, now well on in years.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There is no unanimity of opinion why he was selected as the first and fittest to taste of the new honours. Some think it was the favour of his cousin<note>Or, perhaps, step-brother.</note> Gnaeus Cornelius, who as tribune of the soldiers the year before had granted triple pay <pb id="p.47"/>to the cavalrymen, ' that got him his promotion to so<note type="marg">B. C. 399</note> great an office; others, that he himself made a timely speech on the harmony of the orders, which pleased both patricians and plebeians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Overjoyed at their victory in this election, the tribunes of the plebs withdrew that opposition to the tax which was the greatest obstacle to the business of the state, and it was obediently paid in and dispatched to the army.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Anxur of the Volsci was speedily recaptured, a holiday having relaxed the vigilance of their guard. This year was remarkable for so cold and snowy a winter, that the roads were blocked and the Tiber became unnavigable. The price of corn, owing to the supply which they had brought in before, did not go up.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Licinius had obtained his magistracy without any disorders, rejoicing the commons more than he offended the patricians, and in the same spirit he conducted it; the people therefore became desirous of returning plebeians at the next election of consular tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcus Veturius was the sole patrician candidate to get in; all the other military tribunes with consular authority were commoners, as the result of an all but unanimous vote of the centuries. Their names were Marcus Pomponius, Gnaeus Duillius, Volero Publilius, Gnaeus Genucius, Lucius Atilius</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The severe winter was succeeded, whether in consequence of the sudden change from such inclement weather to the opposite extreme, or for some other reason, by a summer that was noxious and baleful to all living creatures.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Unable to discover what caused the incurable ravages of this distemper, or would put an end to them, the senate voted to consult the Sibylline Books.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The duumvirs <pb id="p.49"/>in charge of the sacred rites then celebrated the<note type="marg">B. C. 399</note> first lectisternium<note>From <hi rend="italics">lectus,</hi> <quote>couch</quote> and <hi rend="italics">sternere,</hi> <quote>to spread.</quote> The images of the gods were placed on banqueting couches and served with food.</note> ever held in Rome, and for the space of eight days sacrificed to Apollo, to Latona and Diana, to Hercules, to Mercury and to Neptune, spreading three couches for them with all the splendour then attainable.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They also observed the rite in their homes. All through the City, they say, doors stood wide open, all kinds of viands were set out for general consumption, all comers were welcomed, whether known or not, and men even exchanged kind and courteous words with personal enemies; there was a truce to quarrelling and litigation;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> even prisoners were loosed from their chains for those days, and they scrupled thenceforth to imprison men whom the gods had thus befriended.</p> 
			<p>Meantime alarms were multiplied at Veii, where three wars were rolled into one.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For, precisely as before, the Capenates and the Faliscans came suddenly to raise the siege, and the Romans fought about their works against three armies, which attacked them on both sides. What helped them most, was the recollection how Sergius and Verginius had been condemned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so from the principal camp, where the delay had occurred on the former occasion, troops were dispatched by a short circuit and fell upon the Capenates in the rear, as they faced the rampart of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Beginning there, the battle carried terror even among the Faliscans, who were wavering, when a timely sally from the camp put them to flight. Then, as they retreated, the victors pursued them with great slaughter;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and not long after a party that was raiding the territory of the Capenates happened to fall in with them and destroyed such as had survived the battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Of the <pb id="p.51"/>Veientes likewise, many, as they fled back to the<note type="marg">B.C. 399</note> town, were slain before the gates, when their friends, fearing lest the Romans should burst in along with them, had closed the portals, and barred out the hindmost of their own people.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the events of this year. And<note type="marg">B.C. 398</note> now the time drew near for choosing military tribunes and the Fathers were almost more concerned about the election than about the war, perceiving that the highest authority had been not merely shared with the plebs, but well-nigh lost to themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They therefore arranged that their most distinguished members should stand, &mdash;men whom they believed the electors would be ashamed to pass over, &mdash;and at the same time they themselves, as if they had all been candidates, left no stone unturned, and called to their aid not only men, but the gods as well, by raising a religious scruple anent the election held two -years before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the year before the last, they said, there had been an intolerable winter, like a warning from Heaven.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Last year had come not prodigies but actual realities: a pestilence had descended upon the fields and the City, clearly proceeding from the anger of the gods, whom they must propitiate in order to avert the plague, as the fateful Books had indicated; it had seemed to the gods an affront that an election held under their auspices should prostitute honours and confound family distinctions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The people were awed not only by the dignity of the candidates, but by the fear of Heaven, and to be military tribunes with consular powers chose all patricians, and chiefly the most illustrious among them, as follows:
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Valerius Potitus (for the fifth time), Marcus Valerius Maximus, Marcus Furius Camillus (for the second <pb id="p.53"/>time), Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the third), Q.<note type="marg">B. C. 398</note> Servilius Fidenas (for the second), Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus (for the second). These tribunes achieved absolutely nothing noteworthy at Veii, but employed all their strength in pillaging.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The two chief commanders, Potitus and Camillus, &mdash;one at Falerii, the other at Capena, &mdash;carried off huge spoils and left nothing untouched that iron or fire could destroy.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile many portents were reported, most of which, because they had only one witness each to vouch for them, obtained no credence and were slighted; and, besides, when the Etruscans, whose services they employed to avert evil omens, were at war with them, they had no soothsayers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One thing occasioned universal anxiety, namely that the lake in the Alban Wood, without any rains or other cause to make it less than a miracle, rose to an unwonted height.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To inquire what the gods could possibly foretell by that prodigy, envoys were sent to the Delphic oracle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But a nearer interpreter of the fates presented himself, an old man of Veii, who, while the Roman and Etruscan soldiers were scoffing at one another as they stood guard at the outposts, declared in a prophetic strain that until the water should be drawn off from the Alban Lake the Romans never could take Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first they made light of this as an idle taunt; then they began to talk it over; presently one of the Roman outpost inquired of the townsman nearest him (for owing to the long continuance of the war they had now got into the way of conversing together) who that man was who threw out mysterious hints regarding the Alban Lake.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he heard that he was a soothsayer, being himself not without a touch of <pb id="p.55"/>superstition, he alleged a desire to consult him<note type="marg">B.C. 398</note> about the averting of a domestic portent, if he could spare the time, and so enticed the seer to a conference.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And when they had walked a little way apart from the friends of both, unarmed and fearing nothing, the stalwart young Roman laid hold of the feeble old man in the sight of them all, and despite an unavailing hubbub raised by the Etruscans, bore him off to his own fellows.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There they had him before the general, who sent him on to Rome, to the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the Fathers questioned him what it was he had meant about the Alban Lake, he answered that the gods must surely have been incensed at the people of Veii on the day when they put it into his:
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> mind to reveal the destruction destined to befall his native city; and so what he had then uttered under divine inspiration, he could not now unsay and recall; and perhaps in concealing what the immortal gods wished to be published guilt was incurred no less than by disclosing what should be hid.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thus then it was written in the books of fate, thus handed down in the lore of the Etruscans, that when the Alban water should overflow, if then the Romans should duly draw it off, they would be given the victory over the Veientes; until that should come, to pass, the gods would not abandon the walls of Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then went on to explain the appointed method of draining it. But the senators, making slight account of his authority, as not sufficiently trustworthy in so grave a matter, determined to wait for their deputies with the response of the Pythian oracle.<note>A tunnel to drain the flood-waters of the Alban Lake, 1300 yards long and from seven to ten feet high, was actually cut through the solid rock, not to bring about the capture of Veil, but to save a few hundred acres of arable land on the sloping edge within the crater (Tenney Frank, <hi rend="italics">Economic</hi> <hi rend="italics">History of Rome,</hi> p. 7).</note></p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But before these envoys could return from<note type="marg">B.C. 397</note> Delphi or an expiation be devised for the Alban <pb id="p.57"/>portent, new military tribunes with consular authority<note type="marg">B.C. 397</note> came in; these were Lucius Julius lulus,<note>For the second time (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. x. &sect; 1).</note> Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the fourth time), Lucius Sergius Fidenas, Aulus Postumius Regillensis, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, and Aulus Manlius.<note>For the third time (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. viii. &sect; 1).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In that year a new enemy arose in the Tarquinienses, who seeing the Romans beset with many wars at once, &mdash;against the Volsci, who were laying siege to the garrison at Anxur, against the Aequi, who were attacking the Roman colony at Labici, and also against the men of Veii, of Falerii, and of Capena, &mdash; and perceiving that affairs within the City were no less troubled, owing to contentions betwixt the patricians and the plebs, believed that in these circumstances they had an opportunity to do the Romans a hurt, and sent out light-armed detachments to raid their territory;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for they thought that either the Romans would put up with the wrong, to avoid the burden of another war, or would take the field with a small and therefore inadequate army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The indignation of the Romans was greater than their concern for the damage wrought by the Tarquinienses; so they neither made strenuous efforts to prepare, nor deferred taking action to a distant date.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Aulus Postumius and Lucius Iulus, without holding a regular levy &mdash;for this the plebeian tribunes hindered &mdash;but with a company consisting almost solely of volunteers whom they had induced to join by their exhortations, marched out by cross-country ways through the territory of Caere, and surprised the Tarquinienses as they were returning from their depradations laden with booty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Many men they slew, all they stripped of their baggage; and having recovered the spoils of their own fields, <pb id="p.59"/>returned to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two days were allowed the<note type="marg">B.C. 397</note> owners to identify their property; on the third all that had not been recognized &mdash;chiefly things belonging to the enemy themselves &mdash;was sold under the spear<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> at public auction, the spear being set up to advertise such a sale.</note> and the proceeds divided amongst the soldiers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The other campaigns, especially the one at Veii, were indecisive. And now the Romans, despairing of human aid, were looking to destiny and the gods, when the deputies returned from Delphi, bringing the oracle's response, which corresponded with the utterance of the captive seer:
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>Roman, see that thou suffer not the Alban water to be confined within the lake, nor to fret its own channel to the sea; thou shalt draw it forth and water the fields withal, and spread it abroad till it be lost in rivulets;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> after that press boldly on against the walls of the foe, and know that over that city which thou dost beleaguer for so many years, the fates now disclosed have given thee the victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When thou hast ended the war with conquest, bring to my temple an ample gift, and repeat and accomplish in customary wise the ancestral rites thou hast neglected.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The captive soothsayer began from that moment to be held in great repute, and the military tribunes, Cornelius and Postumius, set out to employ him about the expiation of the Alban prodigy and the due appeasement of the gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length it was discovered wherein the gods taxed them with neglecting ceremonies or omitting a festival: it was assuredly nothing else than that magistrates in whose election there had been a flaw had improperly proclaimed the Latin games
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> and the sacrifice on the <pb id="p.61"/>Alban Mount<note>The Latin Festival (in honour of Jupiter Latiaris, who presided over the Latin League) was held each year, and was followed by a sacrifice, on the date proclaimed by the new consuls, or consular tribunes.</note> ; only one atonement for these errors<note type="marg">B. C.397</note> was open to them, to make the tribunes of the soldiers resign their office, to take the auspices afresh, and to begin an interregnum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By decree of the senate these things were done.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were three successive interreges, Lucius Valerius, Quintus Servilius Fidenas, Marcus Furius Camillus, In the meantime there were continuous disturbances, and the plebeian tribunes blocked the election, until it had first been agreed that the majority of the military tribunes should be chosen out of the commons.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>While this was going on, the Etruscans met in council at the Fane of Voltumna; where the Capenates and Faliscans proposed that all the nations of Etruria should unite in a common resolution 'and design to raise the siege of Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The council made answer that they had before refused the Veientes this request, on the ground that they had no right to ask help from those whom they had not cared to look to for advice in so weighty a matter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Just then, however, the plight of their country itself denied the petition. There was now in the greatest part of Etruria a strange race, new settlers, with whom they were neither securely at peace nor yet certain to have war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nevertheless, out of regard for the blood and the name and the present perils of their kinsmen, they would grant that if any of their young men wished to serve in that war, they might do so without let or hindrance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Of such recruits it was said at Rome that a great number had come in; and so domestic differences began to subside, as generally happens, in the face of a common danger.</p> <pb id="p.63"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It occasioned the Fathers no displeasure<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> when the prerogative centuries<note>The <hi rend="italics">praerogatives</hi> were the eighteen centuries of knights, which voted first; if they agreed, the other centuries were not called. See I. xliii. 11.</note> chose Publius Licinius Calvus tribune of the soldiers, without his seeking office; he was a man whose moderation had been proven in his former term, but was now become superannuated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was clear that all who had been his colleagues in that same year would also be returned, one after the other, to wit: Lucius Titinius, Publius Maenius, Gnaeus Genucius, Lucius Atilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But before they were declared to the duly assembled tribes, Licinius spoke as follows, having obtained permission of the interrex: <quote>It is an omen of harmony, as I perceive, Quirites, a thing most needful at this juncture, that you seek for the ensuing year, when in your voting you remember our former magistracy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but whereas in my colleagues you are choosing again the same men, and all the better for experience, in me you see no longer the same Publius Licinius, of whom but the shadow and the name are left.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> My strength of body is decayed, my sight and hearing dulled, memory fails me, and the vigour of my mind is impaired. Here,</quote> he cried, laying hold of his son, <quote>here is a young man, the effigy and likeness of him you formerly chose for military tribune first of all plebeians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Him have I bred up in my own principles, and in my stead I give and dedicate him to the state, and I pray you, Quirites, who without my seeking have offered me the office, that you grant it to him, who seeks it, and to the prayers I have added in his behalf.</quote> The father was granted his request, and the son, Publius Licinius, was declared military tribune with consular powers, together with those I have named above.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Titinius and Genucius, tribunes of the soldiers, <pb id="p.65"/>having marched against the Faliscans and Capenates,<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> brought more spirit than generalship to their conduct of the war, and plunged into an ambush.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Genucius, atoning for his rashness by an honourable death, fell fighting among the foremost, in front of the standards; Titinius rallied his men, who had been thrown into great confusion, on a little eminence, and made a stand, yet he would not risk an engagement on level ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The disgrace outweighed the defeat, which had almost proved disastrous, so great was the panic which it caused, not only in Rome, where a greatly exaggerated report of the affair had been received, but also in the camp before Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There the soldiers could hardly be restrained from flight, for a rumour had run through the camp that the victorious Capenates and Faliscans, having slaughtered the Roman commanders and their army, were close at hand, with all the manhood of Etruria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accounts even more alarming had been credited at Rome: that the camp at Veii was already under attack; that already a division of the enemy was marching to assail the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There was a rush to the walls, and the women, drawn from their houses by the general consternation, betook themselves to prayer in the temples, and besought the gods to ward off destruction from the houses and shrines of the City and from the walls of Rome, and to turn that panic against Veii, if the sacred rites had been duly renewed and the portents expiated.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And now the games and the Latin Festival had been repeated, now the water had been let out from the Alban Lake upon the fields, and the doom of Veii drew on apace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly the commander destined to destroy that city and to save his country, <pb id="p.67"/>Marcus Furius Camillus, was appointed dictator, and<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> named Publius Cornelius Scipio as his master of the horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The change in the command at once made a change in all things else; there was new hope and a new spirit, and even the fortune of the City seemed to be renewed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The dictator's first act was to visit military punishment upon those who had fled from Veil in the panic there, and to teach his men that the enemy was not the worst thing they had to fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then fixed the levy for a certain day, and in the interval hastened to Veii to encourage his soldiers; thence he returned to Rome to enroll the new army, and found no one who refused to serve.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even foreign troops, Latins and Hernicans, came with promises to help in this war, and the dictator thanked them in the senate.<note>Livy's brevity here makes the sentence a little obscure. No doubt the Latins and Hernicans first sent envoys, and these were introduced into the senate and there thanked by the dictator.</note> All things being now in readiness for the campaign, Camillus vowed, in pursuance of a senatorial decree, to celebrate the great games,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> votive games in recognition of some special favour of the gods.</note> if he should capture Veii, and to restore and dedicate anew the temple of Mater Matuta, which in time gone by had been consecrated by King Servius Tullius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Marching out from the City, where he left a greater feeling of suspense than of confidence, he first engaged the Faliscans and Capenates, in the Nepesine country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There all his measures, being executed with consummate skill and prudence, were attended, as generally happens, with good fortune. Not only did he rout the enemy in battle, but he also deprived them of their camp and got possession of enormous booty, the chief part of which was made over to the quaestor, and no great quantity given to the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then led his army to Veii, where he increased the number of redoubts, and withdrawing the troops from the <pb id="p.69"/>skirmishes which frequently took place, on the spur<note type="marg">B.C. 398</note> of the moment, in the space between the town wall and the stockade, by an edict forbidding
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> any man to fight without orders, he employed them in digging. Of all the works, much the greatest and most laborious was a mine they began to drive into the enemy's citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That this work might not be interrupted nor the same men become exhausted by perpetually toiling under ground, he divided the workers into six parties and assigned them six-hour shifts in rotation; night and day the work went on unceasingly, till they had made a way into the citadel.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dictator saw that victory was at last within his grasp, and that a city of great wealth was on the point of being taken, with booty more than if all previous wars had been put together.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lest, therefore, he might incur either the resentment of the soldiers, in consequence of a niggardly division of the spoils, or the ill-will of the Fathers, if he were lavish in sharing them out, he wrote to the senate, that thanks to the
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> favour of the immortal gods, his own direction, and the patient efforts of his troops, Veii would presently be in the power of the Roman People, and asked what disposition they proposed making of the plunder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate was divided between two opinions; the aged Publius Licinius, who was the first, they say, that his son called upon to speak,<note>Livy is perhaps following Licinius Macer (Introd. Vol. I, p. xxix), in recording the very irregular procedure by which the tribune passed over the patrician senators to honour his plebeian father.</note> advised making public proclamation that the people decreed that whoso desired a share in the spoils should proceed to the camp at Veii;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the other plan was that of Appius Claudius, who declared that such largess was without example,<note>The booty was regularly sold and the proceeds placed in the treasury.</note> reckless, unfair, and ill-advised; if they were <pb id="p.71"/>persuaded once for all that it was wicked that money<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> captured from the enemy should lie in the treasury, which had been exhausted by the wars, he urged them to pay the soldiers out of it, that
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the plebs might have so much the less war-tax to contribute<note>The patricians also paid the tax; but it bore harder upon the plebeians, owing to their poverty.</note> ; this was a boon of which all families alike would feel the benefit, nor would the hands of idle city-folk, greedy of pillage, pluck away the rewards of valiant fighting men &mdash;since it commonly turned out that in proportion as a man was prone to seek a leading share of toil and danger, he was slow in plundering.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Licinius argued, on the other hand, that this money would breed endless suspicion and hate, and would furnish grounds for accusations before the plebs, and so for agitation and revolutionary laws;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> it was better, therefore, to win over by this gift the sympathies of the commons, to succour them, exhausted and impoverished as they were by so' many years' taxation, and to let them enjoy the spoils and fruits of that war in which they had well-nigh grown old men; there would in every instance be more satisfaction and pleasure in what a man took with his own hand from the enemy and brought home, than if he received many times its value at the discretion of another;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the dictator himself would fain avoid the enmity and charges arising from this business, and therefore had handed it over to the senate; the senate, likewise, in its turn, should refer the question to the plebs, and let every man keep what the fortune of war might give him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This policy seemed the safer, since it would make the senate popular. Accordingly, proclamation was made that all who liked might go to the dictator in camp, to share in the plunder of Veii.</p> <pb id="p.73"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A vast throng went out, and filled the camp.<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> Then the dictator, after taking the auspices, came forth and commanded the troops to arm.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>Under thy leadership,</quote> he cried, <quote>Pythian Apollo, and inspired by thy will, I advance to destroy the city of Veii, and to thee I promise a tithe of its spoils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the same time I beseech thee, Queen Juno, that dwellest now in Veii, to come with us, when we have gotten the victory, to our City &mdash;soon to be thine, too &mdash;that a temple meet for thy majesty may there receive thee.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These prayers uttered, he set forward with overwhelming numbers to assault the town on every side, that the inhabitants might not perceive the danger pressing upon them from the mine.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Veientes, unconscious that they were already given up by their own soothsayers, and by foreign oracles, that some of the gods had already been invited to share in their despoiling, while others having been entreated to quit their city were beginning to look to new homes in the temples of their enemies, and that this was the
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> last day they were themselves to live, feared nothing less than that their defences were undermined and their citadel already filled with foemen, and, each for himself, took up arms and ran out to the ramparts;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> marvelling what it meant that whereas for so many days not a Roman had stirred from his post, they should now, as though they had suddenly gone mad, be rushing blindly against the walls.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>At this point men introduce a tale, how, as the King of the Veientes was sacrificing, the Roman soldiers in the mine overheard the soothsayer declare that to him who should cut up<note>The Latin word is a technical term which is used of carving up, in a specified way, the entrails (<hi rend="italics">prosiciae</hi>) which were to be burnt on the altar.</note> the inwards of that victim would be given the victory, and were <pb id="p.75"/>moved to open the mine and seize the entrails,<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> which they bore off to the dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But in matters of so great antiquity I should be content if things probable were to be received as true: this story, more fit to be displayed on the stage, that delights in wonders, than to be believed, it is worth while neither to affirm nor to refute.<note>With this sentence compare Livy's Preface, &sect; 6.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The mine, which was then filled with picked troops, suddenly discharged its armed men into the temple of Juno, on the Veientine citadel; some of them assailed the backs of their enemies, who were on the walls; others wrenched off the bars that made fast the gates; others, when the women and slaves cast down stones and tiles from roofs, fetched fire against them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The air resounded with shouts; discordant threats of the attackers and despairing shrieks of the defenders were blended with the wailing of women and children.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In a moment the armed soldiers were everywhere hurled from the walls, and the gates thrown open. A part of the Romans poured through them in a body, others scaled the deserted walls; the city was overrun with enemies; the battle raged in every quarter;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> then, when there had already been great carnage, the fighting began to flag, and the dictator bade the heralds proclaim that those without arms should be spared. This ended the slaughter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The unarmed began to give themselves up, and the Romans scattered, with the dictator's permission, in quest of booty. When this was brought before him, and he saw that it was considerably larger and comprised effects of greater value than he had hoped or thought, it is said that he raised his
				<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> hands to heaven and prayed that if any god or man deemed his good fortune and that of the Roman People to be excessive, it might be granted <pb id="p.77"/>him to appease that envy with the least harm to his<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> own private interests and to the public welfare of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> As he turned, while making this prayer, tradition states that he slipped and fell, and that this omen was seen (when men came later to gather its meaning from the event) to point to the condemnation of Camillus himself, and in the second place, to the capture of Rome, a disaster which befell a few years afterwards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> So that day was spent in the slaughter of enemies and the sack of a most opulent city.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day the dictator sold the free-born inhabitants into slavery.<note>Literally, <quote>under the chaplet,</quote> alluding to the garlands worn by captives when they were put up for sale (Aulus Gellius, VI. iv.).</note> This was the only money that went into the state treasury, but the commons were angry about it; as for the booty they brought back themselves, they gave the credit not to their commander, who had referred to the Fathers, that they might support his niggardliness, a matter which had lain
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> within his own discretion, nor yet to the senators, but- to the house of the Licinii, whose son had brought to a vote in the senate that popular measure which his father had proposed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the wealth that belonged to men had now been carried away out of Veii, they began to remove the possessions of the gods and the gods themselves, but more in the manner of worshippers than of pillagers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For out of all the army youths were chosen, and made to cleanse their bodies and to put on white garments, and to them the duty was assigned of conveying Queen Juno to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Reverently entering her temple, they scrupled at first to approach her with their hands, because this image was one that according to Etruscan practice none but a priest of a certain family was wont to <pb id="p.79"/>touch; when one of them, whether divinely inspired<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> or out of youthful jocularity, asked, <quote>Wilt thou go, Juno, to Rome?</quote> &mdash;whereat the others all cried out that the goddess had nodded assent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was afterwards added to the story that she had also been heard to say that she was willing. At all events we are told that she was moved from her place with contrivances of little power, as though she accompanied them voluntarily, and
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> was lightly and easily transferred and carried safe and sound to the Aventine, the eternal home to which the prayers of the Roman dictator had called her; and there Camillus afterwards dedicated to her the temple which he himself had vowed.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Such was the fall of Veii, the wealthiest city of the Etruscan race, which gave evidence of its greatness even in its final overthrow; since after a blockade of ten continuous summers and winters, during which time it had inflicted considerably heavier losses than it had sustained, it yet was ultimately taken, when at last even destiny fought against it, by siege-works and not by force.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When word came to Rome that Veii was taken, although the portents had been averted and the answers of the soothsayers and the Pythian oracle were known; and though they had done all that human wisdom could do to help, in choosing Marcus Furius Camillus, greatest of all generals, to lead them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> nevertheless, because they had warred there so many years with varying fortune and had suffered many a reverse, their joy, as though unexpected, knew no bounds; and ere the senate could act, the temples were all thronged with Roman matrons giving thanks to the gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The <pb id="p.81"/>senate decreed supplications for four days, a longer<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> period than in any former war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover, as the dictator drew near, all sorts and conditions of men ran forth to meet him in such numbers as had never welcomed a general before, and the triumph far exceeded the measure of honour usual on that day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was himself the most conspicuous object in it, as he rode into the City on a chariot drawn by white horses; an act which struck men as being not only undemocratic, but irreverent, for they were troubled at the thought that in respect to his steeds the dictator was made equal to Jupiter and the sun-god;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and the triumph, chiefly for this one reason, was more brilliant than popular.<note>Livy is probably mistaken in ascribing the unpopularity of the triumph to the supposed presumption of Camillus, since it was traditional for the triumphator to suggest a likeness to Jupiter, both in his chariot and in his costume. Resentment over the disposal of the booty is more likely to have been the reason.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then let the contract for the temple of Queen Juno on the Aventine, and dedicated one to Mater Matuta;<note>This temple was in the cattle-market, the Forum Boarium.</note> and having fulfilled these obligations to gods and men, laid down the dictatorship.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The next thing to be discussed was the gift to Apollo, to whom Camillus said that he had solemnly promised a tenth part of the spoils. The pontiffs ruled that the people must discharge this obligation, but it was not easy to devise a method
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> for compelling them to return the booty, that out of it the due proportion might be set apart for the sacred object.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They finally resorted to what seemed the least oppressive plan, namely, that whosoever wished to acquit himself and his household of obligation on the score of the vow, should appraise his own share of the spoils, and pay in a tenth part of its value to the public treasury, to the
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> end that it might be converted into an offering of gold befitting the grandeur of the temple and the power of the god and corresponding to the majesty of the Roman <pb id="p.83"/>People. This contribution still further alienated<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> the affections of the commons from Camillus.<note>See chap. xxii. &sect; 1 and chap. xxiii. &sect; 5.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In the midst of these affairs came envoys from the Volsci and the Aequi seeking peace, and their suit was granted, more that the state, worn out with so long a war, might be at rest, than because the petitioners deserved it.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year which followed the capture of<note type="marg">B.C. 395</note> Veii had six consular tribunes, to wit, the two Publii Cornelii, Cossus and Scipio, Marcus Valerius Maximus (for the second time), Caeso Fabius Ambustus (for the third), Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the fifth), Quintus Servilius (for the third). To the Cornelii was allotted the Faliscan war, to Valerius and Servilius the war with Capena.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They attempted no cities, either by assault or by siege, but wasted the countryside and despoiled the farmers of their possessions, leaving not one fruit-tree in the land nor any productive plant. This devastation overcame the resistance of the Capenates; they begged for peace and it was granted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the Faliscan country the war went on.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At Rome, meanwhile, there were disturbances of many sorts, to quiet which the senate had voted to plant a colony on the Volscian frontier, and to enroll for that destination three thousand Roman citizens, to each of whom a board of three, appointed for the purpose, had proposed to assign three iugera<note>The <hi rend="italics">iugerum</hi> contained 28,800 square feet, while the English acre contains 43,560.</note> and seven-twelfths.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This donation men were disposed to spurn, regarding it as a sop intended to divert their hopes from greater things: for why should the plebs be banished to the Volscian country, when the fair city of Veii and the Veientine lands (more fertile and extensive than those of Rome) were there <pb id="p.85"/>in plain sight?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The city, too, they preferred to<note type="marg">B.C. 395</note> the City of Rome, whether for situation, or for the splendour of its public and private buildings and its places.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nay, they even mooted the plan which certainly had a great following later, when the Gauls had captured Rome, of migrating to Veii.<note>See chap. xlix.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For the rest, they intended that half of the plebs and half of the senate should dwell in Veii, regarding it as possible for the Roman people to inhabit two cities with a common polity.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>This proposal the patricians opposed with such vehemence as to declare that they would sooner die in the sight of the Roman People than suffer anything of the sort to come to a vote; for when there was already so much dissension in a single city, what would it be in two?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Was it possible that any man should prefer a vanquished to a victorious city, and suffer Veii captured to enjoy a greater fortune than Veii free?
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In fine, it was conceivable that they should be left behind in their native city by their fellow Romans; but to forsake their country and their fellow-citizens no violence should ever force them; they had no mind to follow Titus Sicinius &mdash;the tribune of the plebs who had proposed the bill &mdash;to Veii, as their founder, abandoning the god Romulus, the son of a god, the Father and Author of the Roman City.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These differences gave rise to disgraceful contentions &mdash;for the Fathers had won over some of the plebeian tribunes<note>Only two, in fact, according to chap. xxix. &sect; 6, but one was enough to veto the motion.</note> to their opinion &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the only thing that compelled the plebs to stay their hands was this, that as often as they raised a shout, in order to begin a riot, the leaders of the senate were the first to confront the mob, bidding them visit blows, <pb id="p.87"/>wounds, and death on them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The grey hairs of<note type="marg">B.C. 395</note> these men, their distinctions, and their honours, they shrank from outraging, and shame thwarted their rage in all similar attempts.</p> 
			<p>Camillus harangued the people constantly, and in all places.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was no wonder, he said, that the citizens had gone mad, since, bound though they were to carry out their vow, they were more concerned about everything else than about the discharge of their obligation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He would say nothing of their penny contribution &mdash;a truer name for it than tithe &mdash;since in this regard each man had bound himself as an individual, and the state was freed;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but there was one thing his conscience would not suffer him to pass over in silence; to wit, that the tithe should be defined as consisting of that part only of the booty which was movable; and that nothing should be said of the captured city and its territory, which were likewise included in the vow.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Unable to agree on this point, the senate referred it to the pontiffs, who decided, after consulting with Camillus, that so far as these things had belonged to the Veientes before the vow was made, and had subsequently come into the possession of the Roman People, a tithe thereof was sacred to Apollo. Thus the city and the land came into the estimate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Money was drawn from the treasury, and the tribunes of the soldiers with consular rank were directed to purchase gold with it; and there being not enough of this metal, the matrons held meetings to consider the need, and binding themselves by a common resolution to supply the tribunes with gold, brought in all their ornaments to the treasury.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> No act was ever more acceptable to the senate, and to <pb id="p.89"/>honour the matrons for their generosity, it is said to<note type="marg">B.C. 395</note> have voted that they might drive in four-wheeled carriages to festivals and games, and in two-wheeled cars on holy and working days.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the gold received from each had been appraised, in order that the moneys might be repaid, it was determined to make a golden bowl and carry it to Delphi as an offering to Apollo.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>No sooner had they eased their minds of the vow, than the tribunes of the commons began again their agitation, inflaming the populace against all the nobles, but especially against Camillus, whom they charged with having reduced to naught the spoils of Veii, by devoting them to the state and to religion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If any of the leaders were absent, they were fiercely denounced; being present they outfaced their angry critics and shamed them into silence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As soon as the people saw that the question would be carried over from that year, they worked for the re-election of the tribunes of the plebs who were backing the measure;<note>The proposed law mentioned in chap. xxiv. &sect; 7.</note> and the patricians exerted themselves to do the same for its opponents. So, for the most part, the same tribunes were returned to office.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the voting for military tribunes, the<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> senators with much ado obtained the election of Marcus Furius Camillus.<note>For the third time. See chap. xiv. &sect; 5.</note> The need of a commander for the wars was their pretext, but what they really wanted was a man who would combat the lavishness of the tribunes.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>, their proposal to divide up the lands of Veii.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With Camillus were elected to that office, Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the sixth time), Gaius Aemilius, Lucius Valerius Publicola, Spurius Postumius, and (for the second time) Publius Cornelius.<note>Either Scipio or Cossus (chap. xxiv. &sect; 1), or possibly Maluginensis (chap. xiv. &sect; 1).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the outset of the year the tribunes of the commons made no move, until Marcus Furius <pb id="p.91"/>Camillus should march against the Faliscans, for to<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> him this war had been committed. Then came delays, and men's enthusiasm waned, while Camillus, the opponent whom they chiefly feared, won fresh renown in the Faliscan country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For though at first the enemy kept within their walls, deeming this their safest course, he compelled them, by ravaging their fields and burning their farm-houses, to come out of their city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Still, they were afraid to advance very far, and pitched their camp about a mile from the town, trusting that it was quite safe, without other reason than the difficulty of approaching it; for the ground about it was rough and broken, and the roads were either narrow or steep.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But Camillus, employing a prisoner taken in that very region for his guide, broke camp in the dead of night, and showed himself at earliest dawn in a considerably superior position. The Romans, divided into three shifts, began to build a rampart, the soldiers who were not working standing by in readiness to fight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There, when the enemy sought to hinder the work, he defeated and routed them; and so great was the panic that came over the Faliscans, that they fled in disorder past their camp, which was the nearer refuge, and made for the town; and many were slain or wounded, before, in their terror, they could rush in through the gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The camp was taken, and the booty was paid over to the quaestors. This incensed the troops, but they were overborne by the strictness of the discipline, and admired, while they detested, their general's probity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then came a blockade of the town, and the construction of siege works; and sometimes, when opportunity offered, the townsfolk would raid the Roman outposts and <pb id="p.93"/>skirmishes would ensue.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Time wore on, without<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> bringing hope to either side; the besieged had corn and other supplies, which they had laid up beforehand in greater abundance than the besiegers; and it began to seem as though the struggle would be as long drawn out as at Veii, had not Fortune, at one stroke, given the Roman general an opportunity to display the magnanimity already familiar from his exploits in war, and an early victory.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was customary amongst the Faliscans to employ the same person as teacher and attendant of their children, and they used to intrust a number of lads at the same time to the care of one man, a practice which still obtains in Greece.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The children of the chief men, as is commonly the case, were under the tuition of one who was regarded as their foremost scholar. This man had in time of peace got into the way of leading the boys out in front of the city for play and exercise, and during the war made no change in his routine, but would draw them sometimes a shorter, sometimes a longer distance from the gate, with this and that game and story, until being farther away one day than usual, he seized the opportunity
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to bring them amongst the enemy's outposts, and then into the Roman camp, to the headquarters of Camillus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then followed up his villainous act with an even more villainous speech, saying that he had given Falerii into the hands
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> of the Romans, having delivered up to them the children of those whose fathers were in power there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On hearing this Camillus answered: <quote>Neither the people nor the captain to whom you are come, you scoundrel, with your scoundrel's gift, is like yourself. Between us and the Faliscans is no <pb id="p.95"/>fellowship founded on men's covenants; but the fellowship<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> which nature has implanted in both sides is there and will abide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There are rights of war as well as of peace, and we have learnt to use them justly no less than bravely. We bear no weapons against those tender years which find mercy even in the storming of a city, but against those who are armed themselves, who, without wrong or provocation at our hands, attacked the Roman camp at Veii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those people you have done your best to conquer by an unheard-of crime. I shall conquer them, as I conquered Veii, in the Roman way, by dint of courage, toil, and arms.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then had the fellow stripped, his hands bound behind his back, and gave him up to the boys to lead back to Falerii, providing them with rods to scourge the traitor as they drove him into town.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To behold this spectacle, there was at first a great gathering together of the people, and presently the magistrates called a meeting of the senate about the strange affair, and men underwent such a revulsion of feeling, that those who a short time before, in the fury of their hate and resentment would almost have preferred the doom of Veii to the peace of Capena, were now calling for peace, with the voice of an entire city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The honesty of the Romans, and the justice of their general, were praised in market-place and senate-house, and, with the consent of all, envoys proceeded to Camillus in his camp, and thence, by his permission, to the Roman senate, to surrender Falerii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Being introduced into the Curia they are said to have spoken as follows: <quote>Conscript Fathers, you and your general have won a victory over us which no one, whether God or man, could begrudge you, and we <pb id="p.97"/>give ourselves into your hands, believing (than which<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> nothing can be more honourable to a victor) that we shall be better off under your government than under our own laws.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The outcome of this war has afforded the human race two wholesome precedents: you have set fair-dealing in war above immediate victory; and we, challenged by your fair-dealing, have freely granted you that victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> We are under your sway; send men to receive our arms and hostages, and our city, the gates of which stand open.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Neither shall you be disappointed in our fidelity nor we in your rule.</quote> Camillus was thanked both by his enemies and by his fellow citizens. The Faliscans were commanded to pay the soldiers for that year, that the Roman People might be exempted from the war tax. Peace being granted, the Roman army was led home.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Camillus, having returned to the City distinguished by a far better kind of glory than when he had entered it in triumph drawn by white horses &mdash;for he had conquered his enemies by justice and fair-dealing &mdash;uttered no reproaches, but the senators were ill-at-ease till they should free him, without delay, from the obligation of his vow.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so, to carry the golden bowl as a gift to Apollo at Delphi, they appointed Lucius Valerius, Lucius Sergius, and Aulus Manlius, who, being dispatched in a single warship, were captured by Liparaean pirates not far from the Sicilian Straits and carried to Liparae.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was the manner of that people to divide up the booty which they had obtained by a kind of public piracy, but it chanced that year that one Timasitheus was chief magistrate, a man more resembling the Romans than his own countrymen;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.99"/>who, himself revering the title of the envoys and<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> their gift, as well as the god to whom it was being sent and the cause of the oblation, imbued also the people, who are almost always like their ruler, with a due sense of religious awe; and after entertaining the ambassadors in the guest-house of the state, even sent ships to convoy them to Delphi, and thence brought them safely back to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A covenant of hospitality was made with him by decree of the senate, and gifts were presented him in the name of the state.</p> 
			<p>The same year there was a war with the Aequi, of so varied fortune that it was not clear, either at the front itself or in Rome, whether the upshot had been victory or defeat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman generals were two of the military tribunes, Gaius Aemilius and Spurius Postumius. At first they exercised the command conjointly; afterwards, when they had routed the enemy in battle, they arranged that Aemilius should hold Verrugo with a garrison, while Postumius should lay waste the country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As he was leading his troops in irregular formation, somewhat carelessly in consequence of his success, the Aequi fell upon them and throwing them into confusion drove them to the nearest hills, whence the panic spread even to Verrugo, to the other army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Postumius having rallied his men in a position of safety, called them together and chid them for their alarm and flight, telling them they had been discomfited by the most craven and fugitive of foes. Whereat the army cried out as one man, that they deserved his reproaches, and confessed the enormity of their misconduct, but promised that they would themselves mend it, and that their <pb id="p.101"/>enemies' joy should be short-lived.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Demanding to<note type="marg">B.C. 394</note> be led forthwith against the camp of the Aequi &mdash; which was in full sight in the plain where they had pitched it &mdash;they professed themselves willing to undergo any punishment if they should not have stormed it before nightfall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Postumius commended them and bade them sup and be ready at the fourth watch. The enemy, too, that they might cut off any retreat by night along the road to Verrugo, from the hill where the Romans lay, were afield and met them, and the battle began before daylight, but there was a moon all night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They could see to fight as well as in the daytime; but the shouts were heard in Verrugo, the soldiers believed the Roman camp was being attacked, and so great was their consternation that, despite the efforts of Aemilius to check them and despite his appeals, they fled in a scattered rout to Tusculum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> From thence a rumour was carried to Rome that Postumius and the army were destroyed. But Postumius, as soon as the first rays of light had removed all fear of ambuscades in case of a wide-spread pursuit, rode down the line, reminding his men of the promises they had given him, and inspired such ardour that the Aequi could no longer withstand their charge, and were slaughtered while they fled (as happens when rage is more concerned than valour), till their army was clean destroyed;
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and the gloomy tidings from Tusculum which had thrown the City into a needless fright, were succeeded by a laurel-wreathed letter from Postumius, announcing the victory of the Roman People and the annihilation of the Aequian army.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The measures introduced by the tribunes<note type="marg">B.C. 393</note> <pb id="p.103"/>of the plebs being still undecided, the commons<note type="marg">B.C. 393</note> strove to prolong the tenure of the supporters of the bill,<note>Providing for the division of the Roman People between Rome and Veii. See chap. xxiv. &sect; 7.</note> and the patricians to re-elect the tribunes who had vetoed it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but in the election of their own magistrates the plebeians proved the stronger, a disappointment which the Fathers avenged by passing a resolution in the senate providing for the election of consuls &mdash;a magistracy odious to the plebs. There had been no consuls for fifteen years, when they elected Lucius Lucretius Flavus, and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the beginning of this year, the tribunes united in a spirited attempt &mdash;for none of the college was disposed to object &mdash;to carry the bill; and the consuls, for that very reason, were quite as active in opposing them. While the whole body politic was absorbed in this one concern, Vitellia, a Roman colony, was captured by the Aequi, in whose territory it was situated.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The greatest part of the settlers escaped, for the place was taken by treachery at night and their flight through the opposite quarter of the town was unopposed, and made their way to Rome in safety.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To Lucius Lucretius the consul fell the command in this affair. Marching out with his army, he defeated the enemy in a battle and returned victorious to the City, where he found a far more serious struggle impending.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A day of trial had been appointed for the plebeian tribunes of two years before, namely Aulus Verginius and Quintus Pomponius, to defend whom the senate, as the patricians all agreed, was in honour bound; for no man brought any charge against their lives or the conduct of their office, except their having, out of complaisance to the Fathers, opposed the tribunician law.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the <pb id="p.105"/>influence of the senators was out-weighed by the<note type="marg">B.C. 393</note> resentment of the plebs, and a shameful precedent was set, when the innocent men were condemned each to pay a fine of 10,000 asses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This roused the indignation of the senate. Camillus frankly denounced the depravity of the commons, who having turned against their own representatives, failed to perceive that they had by their wicked judgment of the tribunes done away with the veto, and that in doing away with the veto they had overthrown the tribunician power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For if they supposed that the unbridled licence of that office would be tolerated by the Fathers, they were mistaken; if tribunician violence could not be resisted by the help of tribunes, the senators must find some other weapon.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He rebuked the consuls also, because they had, without protesting, allowed those tribunes who had followed the guidance of the senate to suffer for their reliance on the guarantee of state protection. By such sentiments, publicly expressed in speeches, he angered the people more and more from day to day.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As to the senate, he ceased not to encourage it in opposing the law: they must go down into the Forum, when the day should arrive for voting on it, in no other spirit than that of men who realized that they had to fight for hearth and home, for the temples of their gods, and for the soil of their birth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So far, indeed, as the question touched his private interest, it would actually be an honour to him, if it were not sinful to be thinking of his own renown while his country was struggling for life, that the city he had, won should be thronged with people; that he should <pb id="p.107"/>daily be reminded of his glory, and have before his<note type="marg">B.C. 393</note> eyes the town which had figured in his triumph;<note>Livy is thinking of the custom which grew up later of exhibiting in the triumphal procession models or pictures of towns, rivers, and mountains, belonging to the conquered nation.</note> that all men should tread in the footsteps of his fame.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But he thought it an offence against Heaven that a city deserted and forsaken by the immortal gods should be inhabited, and that the Roman People should dwell on conquered soil, exchanging their victorious City for a vanquished one.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>These earnest words of their leading member so stirred the senators, old men as well as young, that on the day the law was proposed they formed in a body and came into the Forum, where they dispersed among the tribes, and canvassing every man
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> his own tribesmen, began with tears to beseech them, that they would not forsake that City for which both they and their fathers had fought with the greatest courage and good fortune.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They pointed to the Capitol, to the shrine of Vesta, and to the other temples standing all about them; they begged them not to drive the Roman People, an exile, and a wanderer from its native land and its household gods, to the city of its enemies, nor to carry things so far that it would be better that Veii had not been taken, so that Rome might not be deserted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since the patricians used not force but entreaties, and in their entreaties made many a reference to the gods, the greater part felt the prick of conscience, and the law was rejected by one more tribe than voted in its favour.<note>There were at this time twenty-one tribes.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so greatly did this victory rejoice the Fathers, that next day, at the instance of the consuls, a decree was passed by the senate, that seven <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> of the Veientine land should be apportioned to every plebeian, and not alone to the heads of families, but so as to reckon in all the free-born members of the <pb id="p.109"/>household, that with such a prospect before them<note type="marg">B. C. 393</note> men might be willing to rear children.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Appeased by this largess, the plebs made<note type="marg">B. C. 392</note> no objection to an assembly for the election of consuls, and the choice fell on Lucius Valerius Potitus and Marcus Manlius, afterwards surnamed Capitolinus.<note>At vi. xvii. 5 Livy implies that Manlius was given the cognomen because of his defence of the Capitol (chap. xlvii.), but at IV. xlii. 2 a L. Manlius Capitolinus had been mentioned, and the surname was probably due to the family's residing on the Capitoline.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These consuls celebrated the Great Games, which Marcus Furius the dictator had vowed in the war with Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This year saw also the dedication of a temple to Queen Juno, vowed by the same dictator in the same war; and tradition relates that the ceremony was attended by throngs of enthusiastic matrons.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A campaign in no way memorable was fought with the Aequi on Mount Algidus, the enemy being routed before they had well begun to fight. Valerius was the more persistent in cutting them down as they fled, and to him was decreed a triumph; Manlius was allowed to enter the City in an ovation.<note>A lesser triumph, in which the victorious general entered the City on foot.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this year also a new war broke out, namely with the people of Volsinii. Owing to a famine and pestilence which arose in the Roman territories on account of drought and excessive heat, it was impossible to send an army against them; and in consequence of this the Volsinienses, having added the Sappinates<note>Sappinum, a town otherwise unknown, is presumed to have been situated near Volsinii.</note> to their forces, were puffed up with pride and made an incursion themselves into the fields of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> War was then declared against both nations.</p> 
			<p>Gaius Julius, the censor, died, and Marcus Cornelius was substituted in his place, a circumstance <pb id="p.111"/>which was afterwards thought to have offended the<note type="marg">B. C. 392</note> gods, because in this lustrum Rome was captured;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> nor from that day has a censor ever been appointed in the room of one who has died.<note>Thereafter the survivor resigned and two new censors were appointed (ix. xxxiv. 21).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls, too, caught the plague, and it was voted that fresh auspices should be obtained by means of an interregnum. Accordingly, when the consuls, in obedience to the senate's decree, had abdicated, Marcus Furius Camillus was appointed interrex, and named as his successor Publius Cornelius Scipio, who, in turn, named Lucius Valerius Potitus interrex;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> under whom they elected six military tribunes of consular rank, so that even if any of them should fall ill the state might still have magistrates.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the first day of July they entered<note type="marg">B.C. 391</note> office, to wit, Lucius Lucretius, Servius Sulpicius, Marcus Aemilius, Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the seventh time), Furius Agrippa, and (for the second time) Gaius Aemilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of these, Lucius Lucretius and Gaius Aemilius were assigned the war with Volsinii as their province, while the Sappinates fell to Agrippa Furius and Servius Sulpicius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Volsinienses were encountered first, in a campaign of great magnitude in respect to the enemy's numbers, though the engagement with them was no very sharp affair. Their line broke at the first assault, and in the rout eight thousand soldiers were cut off by the cavalry, and laying down their arms, surrendered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the Sappinates heard of this campaign, they refused to risk a battle, but retired within their walls and prepared to defend themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans plundered right and left, both the lands of Sappinum and those of Volsinii, without finding any to resist their force, until the <pb id="p.113"/>Volsinienses wearied of the war; and upon their agreeing<note type="marg">B.C. 391</note> to restore the goods of the Roman People and furnish pay for the army for that campaign, they were granted a truce of twenty years.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The same year Marcus Caedicius, a plebeian, reported to the tribunes, that in the Nova Via, where the chapel now stands above the temple of Vesta, he had heard in the silence of the night a voice more distinct than a man's, which bade him tell the magistrates that the Gauls were approaching.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This portent was neglected, as often happens, because of the informant's humble station, and because that race was remote and therefore not well known. And not only did they reject the warnings of Heaven, as their doom drew nearer, but they even sent away from the City the only human assistance present with them, in the person of Marcus Furius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had been indicted by Lucius Apuleius, tribune of the plebs, on account of the spoils of Veii, just at the time of losing his youthful son. Summoning to his house his fellow tribesmen and his clients (who formed a good part of the plebs), he sounded their feelings, and having been answered that they would make up such an amount as he might be
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> fined, but that they could not acquit him, he departed into exile, beseeching the immortal gods that if he were an innocent man to whom that wrong was done they would speedily make his thankless fellow citizens wish to have him back. He was fined in his absence in the sum of 15,000 asses.</p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the expulsion of that citizen whose presence, if anything in this life is certain, would have made the capture of Rome impossible, disaster approached the ill-fated City with the arrival of <pb id="p.115"/>envoys from the men of Clusium seeking help<note type="marg">B.C. 391</note> against the Gauls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The story runs that this race, allured by the delicious fruits and especially the wine &mdash;then a novel luxury &mdash;had crossed the Alps and possessed themselves of lands that had before been tilled by the Etruscans;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and that wine had been imported into Gaul expressly to entice them, by Arruns of Clusium, in his anger at the seduction of his wife by Lucumo. This youth, whose guardian he had been, was so powerful that he could not have chastised him without calling in a foreign force.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He it was who is said to have guided the Gauls across the Alps, and to have suggested the attack on Clusium. Now I would not deny that Arruns or some other citizen brought the Gauls to Clusium, but that those who besieged Clusium were not the first who had passed the Alps is generally agreed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Indeed it was two hundred years before the attack on Clusium and the capture of Rome, that the Gauls first crossed over into Italy; neither were the Clusini the first of the Etruscans with whom they fought;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but long before that the Gallic armies had often given battle to those who dwelt between the Apennines and the Alps.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Tuscan sway, down to the rise of the Roman domination, stretched over a wide expanse of land and sea. How great their power was on the upper and the lower seas, by which Italy is surrounded like an island, is apparent from the names, since the Italian races have called one of them Tuscan, the
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> general designation of the race, and the other Hadriatic, from Hatria, an Etruscan colony; and the Greeks know the same seas as Tyrrhenian and Adriatic.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the lands which slope on either side <pb id="p.117"/>towards one of these seas, they had twice twelve<note type="marg">B. C. 391</note> cities; first the twelve on this side the Apennines, towards the lower sea;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> to which afterwards they added the same number beyond the Apennines, sending over as many colonies as there were original cities, and taking possession of all the transpadane region (except the angle belonging to the Veneti who dwell about the gulf) as far as the Alps.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Alpine tribes have also, no doubt, the same origin, especially the Raetians; who have been rendered so savage by the very nature of the country as to retain nothing of their ancient character save the sound of their speech, and even that is corrupted.</p> 
			<p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Concerning the migration of the Gauls into Italy we are told as follows: While Tarquinius Priscus reigned at Rome, the Celts, who make up one of the three divisions of Gaul, were under the domination of the Bituriges, and this tribe supplied the Celtic nation with a king.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ambigatus was then the man, and his talents, together with his own and the general good fortune, had brought him great distinction; for Gaul under his sway grew so rich in corn and so populous, that it seemed hardly possible to govern so great a multitude.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king, who was now an old man and wished to relieve his kingdom of a burdensome throng, announced that he meant to send Bellovesus and Segovesus, his sister's sons, two enterprising young men, to find such homes as the gods might assign to them by augury;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and promised them that they should head as large a number of emigrants as they themselves desired, so that no tribe might be able to prevent their settlement. Whereupon to Segovesus were by lot assigned the Hercynian highlands<note>The <hi rend="italics">Hercynei saltus</hi> were the upland districts of South Germany (including the Black Forest, Bohemia, and the Hartz) where both Caesar and Tacitus intimate that Celts had formerly established settlements (<hi rend="italics">B.G.</hi> VI. xxiv.; <hi rend="italics">Germ.</hi> xxviii.).</note> ; but to <pb id="p.119"/>Bellovesus the gods proposed a far pleasanter road, into<note type="marg">B.C. 391</note> Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Taking out with him the surplus population of his tribes, the Bituriges, Arverni, Senones, Haedui, Ambarri, Carnutes, and Aulerci, he marched with vast numbers of infantry and cavalry into the country of the Tricastini.<note>Tribes in central Gaul some of whose names survive in the modern Bourges, Auvergne, Sens, and Chartres. The Tricastini were in the Roman province (Provence).</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>There the Alps stood over against them; and I for one do not wonder that they seemed insuperable, for as yet no road had led across them &mdash;as far back at all events as tradition reaches &mdash;unless one chooses to believe the stories about Hercules.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While they were there fenced in as it were by the lofty mountains, and were looking about to discover where they might cross, over heights that reached the sky, into another world, superstition also held them back, because it had been reported to them that some strangers seeking lands were beset by the Salui.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These were the Massilians, who had come in ships from Phocaea. The Gauls, regarding this as a good omen of their own success, lent them assistance, so that they fortified, without opposition from the Salui, the spot which they had first seized after landing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They themselves crossed the Alps through the Taurine passes and the pass of the Duria; routed the Etruscans in battle not far from the river Ticinus, and learning that they were encamped in what was called the country of the Insubres, who bore the same name as an Haeduan canton, they regarded it as a place of good omen, and founded a city there which they called Mediolanium.<note>Now Milan.</note></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Presently another band, consisting of Cenomani led by Etitovius, followed in the tracks <pb id="p.121"/>of the earlier emigrants; and having, with the<note type="marg">B.C. 391</note> approval of Bellovesus, crossed the Alps by the same pass, established themselves where the cities of Brixia and Verona are-now.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After these the Libui came and settled, and the Salluvii &mdash;taking up their abode hard by the ancient tribe of the Laevi Ligures, about the river Ticinus. Then, over the Poenine Pass, came the Boii and Lingones, who finding everything taken up between the Po and the Alps, crossed the Po on rafts, and drove out not only the Etruscans, but also the Umbrians from their lands; nevertheless, they kept on the further side of the Apennines.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the Senones, the latest to come, had their holdings from the river Utens all the way to the Aesis. This was the tribe, I find, which came to Clusium and from thence to Rome, but whether alone or assisted by all the peoples of Cisalpine Gaul, is uncertain.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The men of Clusium, alarmed by this strange invasion, when they beheld the numbers and the unfamiliar figures of the men and their novel weapons, and heard that on many afield, this side the Po and beyond it, they had put to flight the levies of Etruria; though they had no rights of alliance or of friendship with the Romans, except that they had refused to defend their kinsmen the Veientes against the Roman People; did yet dispatch envoys to Rome to ask help of the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As for the help, they were unsuccessful; but the three sons of Marcus Fabius Ambustus were sent as ambassadors to remonstrate with the Gauls, in the name of the senate and the Roman People, against their attack on those who had done them no wrong, and were the Roman People's allies and friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans, <pb id="p.123"/>they said, would be obliged to defend them, even<note type="marg">B.C. 391</note> going to war, if circumstances should make it necessary; but it had seemed preferable that the war itself should, if possible, be avoided, and that they should make the acquaintance of the Gauls &mdash; a new race to them &mdash;in a friendly rather than in a hostile manner.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was a peaceful embassy, had it not<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> been for the violence of the ambassadors, who were more like Gauls than Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To them, when they had made known their mission in the council, the Gauls replied, that although they then heard for the first time the name of Roman, they could yet believe them to be stout-hearted men, since the Clusini had sought their aid in time of danger;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and inasmuch as they had chosen to defend their allies by negotiation rather than by the sword, they would not, for their own part, spurn the peace which the Romans proposed, if the men of Clusium, who possessed more land than they could till, would surrender to the Gauls, who needed land, a portion of their territory; on no other terms could they consider granting peace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They added that they desired to be answered in the presence of the Romans, and that if land were refused them, it was under the eyes of these same Romans that they meant to fight, that they might be able to tell their friends how greatly the Gauls excelled all other men in prowess.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the Romans asked what conceivable right they had to demand land of its occupants under threat of war, and what business Gauls had in Etruria, they were truculently informed, that the new-comers carried their right at the point of the sword and that all things belonged to the brave.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So, angry passions <pb id="p.125"/>being kindled on both sides, they ran to their<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> weapons and joined battle; and the envoys, impelled by the fate which was even then urging Rome to its doom, took up arms, in defiance of the law of nations. Nor could it pass unnoticed, when in the very fore-front of the Tuscan line there were fighting three of the noblest and most valiant of the Roman youth, so conspicuous was the strangers' bravery.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nay, Quintus Fabius even rode out in front of the line, and meeting the Gallic leader as he charged boldly at the very standards of the Etruscans, ran his spear through his side and killed him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As he was engaged in despoiling his man, the Gauls recognized him, and the word passed through all the army that it was the Roman envoy. Thereupon, they gave over their anger at the Clusini and sounded the retreat, uttering threats against the Romans. Some were for marching at once on Rome; but the older men brought them over to send envoys first to complain of their wrongs, and to demand the surrender of the Fabii, in satisfaction for their violation of the law of nations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the Gallic emissaries had stated their mission according to instructions, the senate disapproved of the conduct of the Fabii and felt the demands of the barbarians to be just; but private interest could not suffer them, in the case of men of such exalted station, to decree what they approved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so, that the blame might not rest with the senate, if a Gallic war should chance to bring disaster, they referred the demands of the Gauls to the people for consideration; and with them wealth and influence carried so much more weight, that the men whose punishment was under discussion were elected consular tribunes for <pb id="p.127"/>the ensuing year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At this the Gauls were enraged,<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> as they had every right to be, and returned to their people with open threats of war. The tribunes of the soldiers chosen with the three Fabii were Quintus Sulpicius Longus, Quintus Servilius (for his fourth term), and Publius Cornelius Maluginensis.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now that so heavy a calamity drew towards,-such is the blindness Fortune visits on men's minds when she would have her gathering might meet with no check, &mdash;that state which against the Fidenates and Veientes and other neighbouring tribes had on many occasions resorted to the last expedient and named a dictator &mdash;that
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> state, I say, though now an enemy never yet seen or heard of was rousing up war from the ocean and the remotest corners of the world, had recourse to no unusual authority or help.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes whose rashness had brought on the war were in supreme command; they conducted the levy with no greater care than had usually been employed in preparing for ordinary campaigns,<note>According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (XII. xix) four legions were embodied, and so many allies and auxiliary troops that at the Allia the Roman army numbered 40,000 (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Plut. <hi rend="italics">Cam.</hi> XVIII).</note> and even disparaged the rumoured seriousness of the danger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Gauls, meanwhile, on learning that honours had actually been conferred on men who had violated the rights of mankind and that their embassy had been made light of, were consumed with wrath (a passion which their race is powerless to control), an straightway catching up their standards, set their column in rapid motion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As they marched swiftly and noisily on, the terrified cities armed in haste, and the peasants fled; but they signified with loud cries, wherever they came, that Rome was their goal, and their horse and foot in an extended line covered a vast tract of ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Yet, though rumour and the report of the Clusini preceded them, and <pb id="p.129"/>after that successive messages from other peoples,<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> the utmost consternation was wrought in Rome by the enemy's swiftness, which was
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> such that the army, albeit levied as it were <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> and hurriedly led out, barely covered eleven miles before confronting him, at the point where the river Allia descends in a very deep channel from the Crustuminian mountains, and mingles, not far south of the highway, with the waters of the Tiber.<note>The exact position of the battlefield is uncertain, as the town Crustumerium has disappeared and left no trace. A brook called <hi rend="italics">Fosso Aaecstro,</hi> which empties into the Tiber about eleven miles from Rome, has been thought to be the ancient Allia.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Gauls had already overrun all the ground in front and on both sides, and &mdash;the race being naturally given to vainglorious outbursts &mdash;their wild songs and discordant shouts filled all the air with a hideous noise.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There the tribunes of the soldiers, without having selected a place for a camp or fortified a position to which they might retreat, and, forgetting even the gods, to say nothing of men, without auspices or sacrificial omens, drew up their line with the wings extended to prevent being outflanked by the numbers of the enemy; yet could not stretch their front as wide as his, though they thinned it till the centre was weak and scarce held together.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was a little eminence on the right which they decided to occupy with their reserves, a measure which, though it was the beginning of their panic and flight, was also the sole salvation of the fugitives.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For Brennus, the Gallic chieftain, seeing the Romans to be so few, was especially apprehensive of a stratagem. He supposed that they had seized the higher ground' for this purpose, that when the Gauls had made a frontal attack on the battle-line of the legions, the reserves might assail them in the flank and rear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore directed his assault against the reserves, not doubting that, if he could <pb id="p.131"/>dislodge them, it would be easy for his greatly<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> superior numbers to obtain a victory in the plain. Thus not only luck but generalship as well were on the side of the barbarians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the other army there was no resemblance to Romans, either amongst officers or private soldiers. Terror and dismay had got hold of their spirits, and such complete forgetfulness of everything that a much greater number fled to Veii, a hostile city, though the Tiber was across their way, than by the straight road to Rome, to their wives and children. For a little while the reserves were protected by their position.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the rest of the field, no sooner had those who were nearest heard the shouting on their flank, and those who were farthest the outcry in their rear, than &mdash; fresh and unhurt &mdash;they ran away from their strange enemies, almost before they had caught sight of them; and so far were they from risking a combat, that they did not even return their battle-cry.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> None were slain in fight; but they were cut down from behind as they blocked their escape by their own struggles in the disordered rout.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the bank of the Tiber, whither the whole left wing had fled, after throwing away their arms, there was great slaughter, and many who could not swim, or lacked the strength, weighed down by their corslets and other armour, sank beneath the flood.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nevertheless, the chief part got safely to Veii, whence they not only sent no succours to Rome, but dispatched not even a messenger to tell of the defeat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From the right wing, which had stood at a distance from the river and closer to the foot of the mountain, the fugitives all made for Rome, and without stopping even to shut the city gates, sought refuge in the Citadel.</p> <pb id="p.133"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The very Gauls themselves, stunned by<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> the marvellous victory they had so suddenly gained, at first stood rooted to the spot with amazement, like men that knew not what had happened; then they feared an ambush; after that they fell to collecting the spoils of the slain and erecting piles of arms, as their custom is; then at last having discovered no hostile movement anywhere, they began their march, and a little before sunset reached the environs of Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, when the cavalry had reconnoitred and had reported that the gates were not closed, that no out-guards were watching before the gates, that no armed men were on the walls, astonishment held them spell-bound as before;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and fearful of the night and the lie of the unknown : City, they went into camp between Rome and the Anio, after sending off patrols about the walls and the rest of the gates, to find out what the enemy in their desperate case could possibly be at.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the Romans, inasmuch as more, on escaping from the battle, had fled to Veii than to Rome, and no one supposed that any were left alive except those who had found refuge in the City, they mourned for all alike, both the living and the dead, and well nigh filled the City with lamentation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But presently their personal griefs were overwhelmed in a general panic, with the announcement that the enemy was at hand; and soon they could hear the dissonant howls and songs of the barbarians, as their squadrons roamed about the walls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During all the time that intervened before the following morning their hearts were. in, such. suspense, that each moment they anticipated an immediate attack:. on the first arrival of the enemy, because they had come close to the <pb id="p.135"/>City &mdash;for they would have stopped at the Allia, had<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> this not been their design; &mdash;again,
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> towards sundown, because there was little daylight left, they thought that they would enter the City before nightfall; then they concluded that they had put it off till night, to strike more fear into them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finally the approach of dawn put them beside themselves, and close upon these restless apprehensions came the evil they were dreading, when the hostile forces entered the city gates. Yet neither that night nor the following day did the citizens at all resemble those who had fled in such consternation at the Allia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For having no hopes that they could protect the City with so small a force as remained to them, they resolved that the men of military age and the able-bodied senators should retire into the Citadel and the Capitol, with their wives and children;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and, having laid in arms and provisions, should from that stronghold defend the gods, the men, and the name of Rome;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that the flamen and the priestesses of Vesta should remove the sacred objects pertaining to the State far from the bloodshed and the flames, nor should their cult be abandoned till none should be left to cherish it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If the Citadel and the Capitol, where dwelt the gods; if the senate, the source of public wisdom; if the young men capable of bearing arms survived the impending destruction of the City, they could easily bear to lose the crowd of old men left behind them, who were bound to die in any case.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And in order that the multitude of commoners might endure it with the more composure, the old men who had triumphed and those who had been consuls declared publicly that they would perish with those others, nor burden with bodies <pb id="p.137"/>incapable of bearing arms in defence of the country<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> the scanty stores of the fighting men.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the consolations which the old men appointed to die exchanged among themselves; then, directing their encouragement to the band of youths whom they were escorting to the Capitol and the Citadel, they committed to their valour and their young strength whatever fortune might yet be in store for a City that for three hundred and sixty years had been victorious in every war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the departure of those who carried with them all hope and help, from those who had resolved not to
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> survive the capture and destruction of their City, though the separation was a pitiful thing to see, yet the tears of the women, as they, ran distractedly up and down, and following now these, -now those, demanded of husbands and sons to what fate they were consigning them, supplied the final touch of human wretchedness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Still, the greater part of them followed their sons into the Citadel, though none either forbade or encouraged it, since what would have helped the besieged to lessen the number of non-combatants would have been inhuman.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Another host &mdash;consisting chiefly of plebeians &mdash;too large for so small a hill to receive, or to support with so meagre a supply of corn, streamed out of the City as though forming at last one continuous line, and took their way towards Janiculum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thence some of them scattered through the country-side, and others made for the towns near by. They had neither leader nor concerted plan; each followed the promptings of his own hopes and his own counsels, in despair of the: commonwealth.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Meanwhile the flamen of Quirinus and the Vestal <pb id="p.139"/>virgins, with no thought for their own belongings,<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> were consulting which of the sacred things they should carry with them, and which, because they were not strong enough to carry them all, they must leave behind, and, finally, where these objects would be safe.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They judged it best to place them in jars and bury them in the shrine adjoining the flamen's house, where it is now forbidden to spit; the rest of the things they carried, sharing the burden amongst them, along the road which leads by the Sublician Bridge to Janiculum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As they mounted the hill they were perceived by a plebeian named Lucius Albinius, who had a waggon in which he was conveying his wife and children, amidst the throng of those who, unfit for war, were leaving the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Preserving even then the distinction between divine and human, and holding it sacrilege that the priestesses of his country should go afoot, bearing the sacred objects of the Roman People, while his family were seen in a vehicle, he commanded his wife and children to get down, placed the virgins and their relics in the waggon, and brought them to Caere, whither the priestesses were bound.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome meantime such arrangements for defending the Citadel as the case admitted of were now fairly complete, and the old men returned to their homes to await the coming of their enemies with hearts that were steeled to die.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Such of them as had held curule magistracies, that they might face death in the trappings of their ancient rank and office, as beseemed their worth, put on the stately robes which are worn by those who conduct the <hi rend="italics">tensae</hi><note>Cars used in the games of the Circus to carry the images of the Gods.</note> or celebrate a triumph, and, thus habited, seated themselves on ivory chairs<note>The curule chair was inlaid with ivory. At this period the only curule magistrates were dictators, masters of the horse, consuls, and censors.</note> in the middle of <pb id="p.141"/>their houses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some historians record that Marcus<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> Folius, the pontifex maximus, led in the recitation of a solemn vow, by which they devoted themselves to death, in behalf of their country and the Roman Quirites.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Gauls found their lust for combat cooled by the night which had intervened. At no point in the battle had they been pushed to desperate exertions, nor had they now to carry the City by assault. It was therefore without rancour or excitement that they entered Rome, on the following day, by the Colline Gate (which lay wide open), and made their way to the Forum, gazing about them at the temples of the gods and at the Citadel, which alone presented some show of war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thence, after leaving a moderate guard to prevent any attack upon their scattered forces from Citadel or Capitol, they dispersed in quest of booty through streets where there was none to meet them, some rushing in a body into whatever houses were nearest, while others sought out the most remote, as though supposing that only such would be intact and full- of plunder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But being frightened out of these by their very solitude, lest the enemy should by some ruse entrap them as they wandered apart, they came trooping back to the Forum and the places near it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There they found the dwellings of the plebeians fastened up, but the halls of the nobles open; and they hesitated almost more to enter the open houses than the shut, &mdash;so
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> nearly akin to religious awe was their feeling as they beheld seated in the vestibules, beings who, besides that their ornaments and apparel were more splendid than belonged to man, seemed also, in their majesty of countenance and in the gravity of their expression, most like to gods.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><pb id="p.143"/>
			<p>While they stood reverentially before them, as<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> if they had been images, it is related that a Gaul stroked the beard of one of them, Marcus Papirius, &mdash; which he wore long, as they all did then, &mdash;whereat the Roman struck him over the head with his ivory mace, and, provoking his anger, was the first to be slain; after that the rest were massacred where they sat;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and when the nobles had been murdered, there was no mercy then shown to anyone; the houses were ransacked, and after being emptied were given to the flames.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But whether it was that not all the Gauls desired to destroy the City, or that their leaders had resolved to make a certain show of burning, to inspire alarm, in hopes that the besieged might be driven to capitulate by affection for their homes, but not to
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> burn up all the houses, in order that they might hold whatever remained of the City as a pledge to work on the feelings of their enemies &mdash; however this may have been, the fire spread by no means so freely or extensively on the first day as is commonly the case in a captured town.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As the Romans looked down from their fastness and saw the City full of enemies running up and down in all the streets, while first in one quarter and then in another some new calamity would be occurring, they were unable, I do not say to keep their heads, but even to be sure of their ears and eyes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherever the shouting of the invaders, the lamentations of the women and children, the crackling of the flames, and the crash of falling buildings drew their attention, trembling at each sound, they turned their thoughts and their gaze that way, as though Fortune had placed them there to witness the <pb id="p.145"/>pageant of their dying country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Of all their<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> possessions nothing was left them to defend save their persons alone; and so much more wretched was their plight than that of all others who have ever been beleaguered, that they were cut off from their native City and confined where they could see all that belonged to them in the power of their enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor was the night more tranquil, after a day of such distress; and the night was followed by a restless day, with never a moment that had not still some fresh calamity to unfold.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Yet, oppressed as they were, or rather overwhelmed, by so many misfortunes, nothing could alter their resolve; though they should see everything laid low in flames and ruins, they would stoutly defend the hill they held, however small and naked, which was all that Liberty had left.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And now that the same events were occurring every day, like men grown used to grief, they had ceased to feel their own misfortunes, looking solely to their shields and the swords in their right hands as their only remaining hope.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Gauls likewise, having vainly for some days waged war against only the buildings of Rome, when they saw that there was nothing left amidst the smouldering ruins of the captured City but armed enemies, who for all their disasters were not a jot appalled nor likely to yield to anything but force, took a desperate resolution to attack the Citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At daybreak the signal was made; and the entire host, having formed up in the Forum, gave a cheer, and raising their shields above their heads and locking them, began the ascent. The defenders on the other hand did nothing rashly <pb id="p.147"/>or in confusion. At all the approaches they had<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> strengthened the guard-posts, and where they saw the enemy advancing they stationed their best soldiers, and suffered them to come up, persuaded that the higher they mounted up the steep the easier it would be to drive them down.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They made their stand about the middle of the declivity, and there, launching their attack from the higher ground, which seemed of itself to hurl them against the foe, dislodged the Gauls, with such havoc and destruction that they never attempted to attack in that manner again, with either a part or the whole of their strength. So, relinquishing all hope of getting up by force of arms, they prepared for a blockade.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having never till that moment considered such a thing, they had destroyed all the corn in the City with their conflagrations, and what was in the fields had all been hurriedly carried off, within the last few days, to Veil.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They therefore arranged to divide their army, and employ part of it to pillage the neighbouring nations and part to invest the Citadel, in order that those who held the lines might be provisioned by the foragers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the Gauls departed from the City, Fortune's own hand guided them to Ardea, that they might make trial of Roman manhood.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Camillus was languishing there in exile, more grieved by the nation's calamity than by his own; and as he sorrowfully inveighed against gods and men, and asked, with wonder and humiliation, where those heroes were who had shared with him in the capture of Veii and Falerii, and whose gallantry in other wars had ever outrun their success,
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> of a sudden he heard that the army of the Gauls was coming, and that the Ardeates <pb id="p.149"/>in alarm were deliberating what to do about it. With<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> an inspiration nothing less than divine, he pushed into the midst of their conference, &mdash;though before accustomed to avoid these councils &mdash;and there, 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<quote>Men of Ardea,</quote> he said, <quote>my ancient friends, and of late my fellow citizens, &mdash;since your goodness would have it so and my own fortune has made it necessary, &mdash;let none of you suppose me to have come forward in forgetfulness of my condition; but circumstances and our common peril oblige every man at this crisis to contribute what he can to the general defence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And when shall I show gratitude for your great kindnesses to me, if I am backward now? Or when shall you have need of me, if not in war? 'Twas by this art that I stood secure in my native City: unbeaten in war, I was driven out in time of peace by the thankless citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But you, men of Ardea, have now an opportunity of requiting the Roman People for such great benefits as you yourselves are mindful of, &mdash;nor need I cast upto you things which you remember; &mdash;and your city has an opportunity to win from our common enemy great renown in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> That people now drawing near in loose array has been endowed by nature with bodily size and courage, great indeed but vacillating; which is the reason that to every conflict they bring more terror than strength. This may be seen in their defeat of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They captured the City, which lay wide open; but a handful of men in the Citadel and the Capitol are holding them at bay; already, oppressed by the tedium of the siege, they are departing and roaming aimlessly through the country-side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They greedily gorge themselves with food and wine, and when <pb id="p.151"/>night approaches they erect no rampart, and without<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> pickets or sentries, throw themselves down anywhere beside a stream, in the manner of wild beasts. Just now success has rendered them even more careless than they are wont to be.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If you have a mind to protect your city and not to suffer all this country to become Gaul, arm yourselves in the first watch, and follow me in force, not to a battle but a massacre. If I do not deliver them up to you fast asleep, to be butchered like cattle, I am ready to submit at Ardea to the same fate that I endured at Rome.</quote></p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Well-wishers and opponents were alike persuaded that there was no such warrior in those days anywhere. Breaking up the council, they supped, and waited intently for the signal. On its being given, in the silence of the early night, they presented themselves before Camillus at the gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had not left the city very far behind them, when they came to the camp of the Gauls, unguarded, just as he had prophesied, and open on every side, and, giving a loud cheer, rushed upon it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was no resistance anywhere: the whole place was a shambles, where unarmed men, relaxed in sleep, were slaughtered. Those, however, who were farthest off were frightened from the places where they lay, and ignorant of the nature of the attack or its source, fled panic-stricken, and some ran unawares straight into the enemy. The most of them were carried into the territory of Antium, where they wandered about until the townspeople sallied out and cut them off.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A similar overthrow was experienced, in the region of Veii, by the Etruscans. So far were they from <pb id="p.153"/>pitying a City that had been their neighbour for<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> close upon four hundred years, and was now overwhelmed by an enemy never seen or heard of before, that they chose that time to make incursions into the lands of the Romans; and laden with spoils, even meditated an attack on Veii and its garrison, the last hope of the Roman name.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman soldiers had seen them, as they ranged through the fields and afterwards, gathering in a body, drove the booty off before them, and could descry their camp, which was pitched not far from Veii.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This made them at first to compassionate themselves; then they were seized with resentment, which soon gave way to rage: were even the Etruscans, whom they had saved from the Gauls by incurring war themselves, to make sport of their calamities?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They could hardly curb an impulse to assail them on the instant; but being restrained by the centurion Quintus Caedicius, whom they had chosen to be their commander, they postponed the affair till dark.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The only thing wanting was a leader like Camillus; in all else the order followed was the same, and the same success was achieved. Indeed, under the guidance of captives who had survived the nocturnal massacre, they set out on the following night and came to another band of Etruscans, at the salt-works,<note>Established according to tradition, by King Ancus (I. xxxiii. 9), on the right bank of the Tiber, not far from Ostia.</note> whom they surprised and defeated with even greater carnage; and so, rejoicing in their double victory, returned to Veii.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome meanwhile the siege was for the most part languishing and all was quiet on both sides, the Gauls being solely concerned with preventing the escape of any enemy through their lines, when suddenly a young Roman attracted the <pb id="p.155"/>wondering admiration of fellow citizens and foes.<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was an annual sacrifice to be made on the Quirinal Hill by the family of the Fabii. To celebrate it Gaius Fabius Dorsuo, in the Gabinian cincture,<note>This was a mode of girding up the toga traditional in religious ceremonies.</note> with the sacred vessels in his hands, descended from the Capitol, passed out through the midst of the enemy's pickets, and regardless of any words or threats, proceeded to the Quirinal, where he duly accomplished all the rites.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then returned by the same way, with the like resolute countenance and gait, in the full assurance of the favour of the gods whose service not even the fear of death could cause him to neglect, and rejoined his friends on the Capitol, leaving the Gauls dumbfounded by his astonishing audacity, or perhaps even moved by religious awe, a sentiment to which that race is far from indifferent.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At Veii, all this while, they were gathering from day to day, not courage merely, but strength as well. Not only were Romans coming in from the country-side, &mdash;men who had been wanderers since the defeat, or the capture of the City, &mdash;but volunteers were also pouring in from Latium, that they might share in the spoils.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It seemed therefore that the time was now ripe to return to their native City and wrest it from the hands of the enemy; but their strong body lacked a head.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The place itself reminded men of Camillus, and there were many of the soldiers who had fought successfully under his leadership and auspices. Moreover, Caedicius declared that he would suffer neither god nor man to put an end to his authority, but, remembering his station, would himself demand the appointment of a general.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With the consent of all they resolved <pb id="p.157"/>to send for Camillus from Ardea, but not till the<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> senate at Rome had been consulted; so modest were they in their conduct of everything, preserving the proper distinctions even in their well-nigh desperate case. It was necessary at enormous risk to pass the enemy's outposts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This an active youth named Pontius Cominus undertook to do, and supporting himself on a strip of cork, floated down the Tiber to the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Once there, he passed by the shortest way from the bank up a cliff so steep that the enemy had neglected to guard it, to the Capitol, and being brought before the magistrates delivered to them the message from the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, on the senate's resolving that the <hi rend="italics">curiate</hi> <hi rend="italics">comitia</hi> should recall Camillus from exile, and that, even as the people commanded he should straightway be appointed dictator, and the soldiers have the general they desired, the messenger returned by the same route and came in haste to Veii;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> whence envoys were despatched to Ardea for Camillus, and fetched him to Veii; or rather &mdash;as I prefer to believe that he did not quit Ardea until he had learnt that the law was passed, since he could not change his residence without the People's command, nor take the auspices in the army till he had been appointed dictator-the curiate law was passed and Camillus declared dictator, in his absence.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on at Veii, the Citadel of Rome and the Capitol were in very great danger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the Gauls had noticed the tracks of a man, where the messenger from Veii had got through, or perhaps had observed for themselves that the cliff near the shrine of Carmentis<note>The mother of Evander, whose name appears in I. vii. 8 in the form Carmenta.</note> afforded an easy ascent. So on a starlit night they first sent <pb id="p.159"/>forward an unarmed man to try the way;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> then<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> handing up their weapons when there was a steep place, and supporting themselves by their fellows or affording support in their turn, they pulled one another up, as the ground required, and reached- the summit, in such silence that not only the sentries but even the dogs &mdash;creatures easily troubled by noises in the night &mdash;were not aroused.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But they could not elude the vigilance of the geese, which, being sacred to Juno, had, notwithstanding the dearth of provisions, not been killed. This was the salvation of them all; for the geese with their gabbling and clapping of their wings woke Marcus Manlius, &mdash;consul of three years before and a distinguished soldier, &mdash;who, catching up his weapons and at the same time calling the rest to arms, strode past his bewildered comrades to a Gaul who had already got a foothold on the crest and dislodged him with a blow from the boss of his shield.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As he slipped and fell, he overturned those who were next to him, and the others in alarm let go their weapons and grasping the rocks to which they had been clinging, were slain by Manlius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And by now the rest had come together and were assailing the invaders with javelins and stones, and presently the whole company lost their footing and were flung down headlong to destruction.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then after the din was hushed, the rest of the night &mdash;so far as their excitement would permit, when even a past peril made them nervous &mdash;was given up to sleep. At dawn the trumpet summoned the soldiers to assemble before the tribunes. Good conduct and bad had both to be requited.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> First Manlius was praised for his courage and presented with gifts, not only by <pb id="p.161"/>the tribunes of the soldiers, but by agreement<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> amongst the troops, who brought each half a pound of spelt and a gill of wine to his house, which stood in the Citadel. It is a little thing to tell, but the scarcity made it a great token of affection, since everyone robbed himself of his own sustenance and bestowed what he had subtracted from his physical necessities to do honour to one man.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then the watchmen of the cliff which the enemy had scaled without being discovered were called up.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Quintus Sulpicius, the tribune, announced his intention to punish them all in the military fashion; but deterred by the cries of the soldiers, who united in throwing the blame upon a single sentinel, he spared the others. This man was guilty beyond a doubt, and was flung from the rock with the approval of all.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> From that time the guards on both sides were more alert: the Gauls, because it had been put about that messengers were passing between Veii and Rome, the Romans, from their recollection of the peril of the night.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But worse than all the evils of the blockade and the war was the famine with which both armies were afflicted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Gauls suffered also from a pestilence, being encamped between hills on low ground, parched and heated by the conflagration, where the air was filled with ashes, as well as dust, whenever a breeze sprang up.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These annoyances were intolerable to a race accustomed to damp and cold, and when, distressed by the suffocating heat, they began to sicken of diseases that spread as though the victims had been cattle, they were soon too slothful to bury their dead singly, and piling the bodies up in promiscuous heaps, they burned them, <pb id="p.163"/>causing the place to be known from that<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> circumstance as the Gallic Pyres.<note>Livy tells us in xxii. xiv. 11, that the <hi rend="italics">Busta Gallica</hi> were in the middle of the City, but the exact site cannot be determined.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A truce was afterwards made with the Romans, and the commanders allowed their soldiers to talk together. Since in these conversations the Gauls used frequently to taunt their enemies with their famished state, and call on them to yield to that necessity and surrender, the Romans are said, in order to do away with this opinion, to have cast bread down from the Capitol in many places, into the outposts of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Yet at last they could neither dissemble their hunger nor endure it any longer. The dictator was now holding a levy of his own at Ardea, and having ordered the master of the horse, Lucius Valerius, to bring up his army from Veii, was mustering and drilling a force with which he might cope with the Gauls on equal terms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the army on the Capitol was worn out with picket duty and mounting guard; and though they had got the better of all human ills, yet was there one, and that was famine, which nature would not suffer to be overcome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Day after day they looked out to see if any relief from the dictator was at hand; but at last even hope, as well as food, beginning to fail them, and their bodies growing almost too weak to sustain their armour when they went out on picket duty, they declared that they must either surrender or ransom themselves, on whatever conditions they could make; for the Gauls were hinting very plainly that no great price would be required to induce them to raise the siege.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon the senate met, and instructed the tribunes of the soldiers to arrange the terms. Then, at a conference between Quintus Sulpicius the tribune and the Gallic chieftain Brennus, the affair <pb id="p.165"/>was settled, and a thousand pounds of gold was<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> agreed on as the price of a people that was destined presently to rule the nations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The transaction was a foul disgrace in itself, but an insult was added thereto: the weights brought by the Gauls were dishonest, and on the tribune's objecting, the insolent Gaul added his sword to the weight, and a saying intolerable to Roman ears was heard, &mdash;Woe to the conquered!</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But neither gods nor men would suffer the Romans to live ransomed. For, by some chance, before the infamous payment had been consummated, and when the gold had not yet, owing to the dispute, been all weighed out, the dictator appeared and commanded the gold to be cleared away and the Gauls to leave.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They objected vehemently, and insisted on the compact; but Camillus denied the validity of that compact which, subsequently to his own appointment as dictator, an inferior magistrate had made without his authorization, and warned them to prepare for battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His own men he ordered to throw their packs in a heap, make ready their weapons, and win their country back with iron instead of gold; having before their eyes the temples of the gods, their wives and their children, the soil of their native land, with the hideous marks of war upon it, and all that religion called upon them to defend, recover, or avenge.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then drew up his line, as well as the ground permitted, on the naturally uneven surface of the half-ruined City, and saw to it that his soldiers had every advantage in choice of position and in preparation which the art of war suggested.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Gauls were taken aback; they armed, and, with more rage than judgment, <pb id="p.167"/>charged the Romans. But now fortune had turned;<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> now the might of Heaven and human wisdom were engaged in the cause of Rome. Accordingly, at the first shock the Gauls were routed with as little effort as they had themselves put forth to conquer on the Allia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They afterwards fought a second, more regular engagement, eight miles out on the Gabinian Way, where they had rallied from their flight, and again the generalship and auspices of Camillus overcame them. Here the carnage was universal; their camp was taken; and not a man survived to tell of the disaster.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The dictator, having recovered his country from her enemies, returned in triumph to the city; and between the rough jests uttered by the soldiers, was hailed in no unmeaning terms of praise as a Romulus and Father of his Country and a second Founder of the City.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>His native City, which he had saved in war, he then indubitably saved a second time, now that peace was won, by preventing the migration to Veil: though the tribunes were more zealous for the plan than ever, now that the City lay in ashes, and the plebs were of themselves more inclined to favour it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This was the reason of his not resigning the dictatorship after his triumph, for the senate besought him not to desert the state in its hour of uncertainty. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>His first act, in conformity with his scrupulous attention to religion, was to lay before the senate such matters as pertained to the immortal gods, and to obtain the
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> passage of a decree that all shrines, in so far as they had been in the enemy's possession, should be restored, their boundaries established, and rites of purification celebrated, and that the duumvirs should <pb id="p.169"/>search the Books<note>The Sybilline Books.</note> for the proper rites;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that a covenant<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> of hospitality should be entered into by the state with the people of Caere, because they had received the holy things of the Roman People and its priests, and thanks to their good offices worship of the immortal gods had not been interrupted;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that Capitoline Games should be held, because Jupiter Optimus Maximus had protected his own abode and the Citadel of the Roman People in its time of danger; and that Marcus Furius the dictator should to that end constitute a board consisting of men who lived on the Capitol and the Citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A proposal was made, too, for propitiating the voice which was heard in the night to foretell disaster before the Gallic War, and was disregarded, and a temple was ordered to be built in the Nova Via to Aius Locutius.<note>The god of Utterance. This <quote>temple</quote> is evidently the <quote>chapel</quote> spoken of at chap. xxxii. &sect; 6.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The gold which had been carried away from the Gauls and that which had been collected from other temples during the alarm and carried into the shrine of Jupiter, since there was no clear recollection where it ought to be returned, was all adjudged to be sacred and ordered to be deposited under the throne of Jupiter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even before this the scrupulousness of the citizens had been apparent in this connexion, for when the gold in the public coffers was insufficient to make up to the Gauls the stipulated sum, they had accepted what the matrons got together, that they might not touch the sacred gold. For this a vote of thanks was given to the matrons, and they were granted the honour of having eulogies pronounced at their funerals, as in the case of the men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After these measures, which related to the gods and lay within the competence of the senate, had been enacted, then, and only then, heeding the importunity of the <pb id="p.171"/>tribunes, who were urging the plebs unceasingly to<note type="marg">B. C. 390</note> quit their ruins and emigrate to a city ready to their hand at Veii, Camillus went up into the assembly, attended by the entire senate, and discoursed as follows:</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"So painful to me, Quirites, are these controversies with the tribunes of the plebs, that my most bitter exile knew no other solace but this, all the time that I lived at Ardea, that I was far away from these contentions. And they are likewise the cause that though you had a thousand times recalled me by resolution of the senate and the people's vote, I intended never to return.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor have I now been induced to do so by any change in my desires, but by the alteration in your fortunes. For the issue was this, that my countrymen should abide in their own home, not that I, at any or all costs, should be with my countrymen. Even now I would gladly stop and hold my peace, were not this too the quarrel of my country; whom to fail while life endures is in other men disgraceful, but in Camillus impious.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For why did we seek to win her back, why rescue her, when besieged, from the hands of the enemy, if, now that she is recovered, we voluntarily abandon her? And although, while the Gauls were victorious and in possession of the entire City, the Capitol nevertheless and the Citadel were held by the gods and men of Rome, shall we now, when the Romans are victorious and the City is regained, desert even Citadel and Capitol? Shall our prosperity make Rome more desolate than our adversity has done?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Indeed, if we had no religious rites established with the founding of the City and by tradition handed down, <pb id="p.173"/>yet so manifest has at this time the divine purpose<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> been in the affairs of Rome, that I for one should suppose it no longer possible for men to neglect the worship of the gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For consider these past few years in order, with their successes and reverses; you will find that all things turned out well when we obeyed the gods, and ill when we spurned them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> First of all, the war with Veii. How many years we fought, and with what painful exertion! And the end came not, until, admonished by Heaven, we drew the water off from the Alban Lake.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What, I beseech you, of this strange disaster that lately overwhelmed our City? Did it come before we disregarded the voice from Heaven that announced the approach of the Gauls? before the law of nations was violated by our envoys? before we, that ought to have punished their fault, had passed it by, with the same indifference towards the gods?
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Therefore were we conquered, led captive, and put to ransom; and suffered such punishments at the hands of gods and men as to be a warning to all the world.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Adversity then turned our thoughts upon religion. We fled for refuge to the Capitol and its gods, to the seat of Jupiter Optimus Maximus; of our holy things, some, in the ruin of our fortunes, we concealed in the earth, others we removed to neighbouring cities out of sight of our enemies; in the worship of the gods, albeit forsaken of gods and men, yet were we unceasing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Therefore have they given us our native land again, and victory, and our ancient renown in war that we had forfeited; and against our enemies, who, blinded with greed, broke treaty and troth in the weighing of the gold, have they turned dismay and rout and slaughter.</p> <pb id="p.175"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"As you consider these momentous effects<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> upon the affairs of men, of serving the deity and of neglecting him, do you begin, Quirites, to perceive how, though yet scarce clear of the wreckage of our former guilt and calamity, we are headed towards a grievous sin?
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> We have a City founded with due observance of auspice and augury; no corner of it is not permeated by ideas of religion and the gods; for our annual sacrifices, the days are no more fixed than are the places where they may be performed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Do you intend, Quirites, to abandon all these gods, both of state and of family? How squares your conduct with that of the noble young man Gaius Fabius in the recent siege, which the enemy beheld with no less astonishment and admiration than yourselves, when he descended from the Citadel through the missiles of the Gauls and offered the annual sacrifice of the Fabian clan on the Quirinal Hill?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What? Would you suffer no interruption, even in war, of family rites, but desert the national worship and the gods of Rome in time of peace?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Would you have the pontiffs and the flamens less careful of the ceremonies of the state religion than a private citizen has been of the anniversary of his clan? Perhaps someone may say that we shall either do these things at Veii, or thence dispatch our priests to Rome to do them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but of these courses neither can be followed without violation of the sacred usages.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For, not to enumerate all the kinds of rites and all the gods, is it possible at the feast of Jupiter<note>On the 15th of November the senate held a stately banquet at which a couch was placed for Jupiter, and Juno and Minerva occupied stools on either side of the god.</note> that the couch should be spread elsewhere than in the Capitol? Why need I speak of Vesta's eternal fires, and the image<note>The image of Pallas (Palladium), fabled to have bee brought to Italy by Aeneas.</note> which is preserved as a pledge of empire in her temple? or of your sacred <pb id="p.177"/>shields,<note>See I. xx. 4, and note.</note> O Mars Gradivus and Quirinus our Father?<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> All these holy things would you leave behind on unconsecrated ground &mdash;things coeval with the City, and some more ancient than its origin?</p> 
			<p>"And mark what a difference between us and our forefathers! They handed down to us certain rites to be solemnized on the Alban Mount and in Lavinium. But if we scrupled to transfer sacred rites from hostile cities to ourselves in Rome, can we shift them without sin from Rome to Veii, city of our enemies?
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Recollect, I beg you, how often sacrifices are renewed because some point of antique ritual has been, through carelessness or accident, omitted. What was it, a while ago, after the portent of the Alban Lake, that brought relief to the commonwealth &mdash;then in the throes of war with Veii &mdash;if not a renewal of the sacred rites and auspices?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But, more than that, like men mindful of their old religious fervour, we have both brought in foreign deities to Rome and established new ones.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Queen Juno was lately conveyed from Veii and enshrined on the Aventine, and how notable was that day, for the zeal of the matrons and the throng! We have ordered a temple to be built for Aius Locutius because of the voice from heaven, clearly heard in the Nova Via.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> We have added Capitoline Games to the other annual festivals, and by authority of the senate have established a new college for this purpose. Was there any of these things we needed to have undertaken, if we meant to retire from Rome along with the Gauls; if we remained not voluntarily in the Capitol, through so many months of siege, but constrained by fear of the enemy?
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> We talk of sacred rites and temples; <pb id="p.179"/>pray, what about the priests? Do you never think<note type="marg">B.C. 390</note> what a sacrilege you are about? The Vestals surely have but that one dwelling-place, from which nothing ever caused them to remove but the capture of the City; the Flamen Dialis may not lie for a single night outside the City, without sin.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Will you make these priests Veientine instead of Roman? Shall thy Virgins forsake thee, Vesta, and the Flamen, as he dwells abroad, bring, night after night, such guilt upon himself and the republic?
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> What about the other matters nearly all of which<note>Livy has in mind one important exception: the centuriate comitia met outside the pomerium, usually in the Campus Martius.</note> we transact, after taking auspices, within the pomerium? To what oblivion and neglect do we consign them?
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The curiate comitia which deals with the business of war, the centuriate comitia, where you elect the consuls and military tribunes &mdash;where can these be held, with due observance of the auspices, save in the customary places?
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Shall we transfer them to Veii? Or shall the people, for the sake of the comitia assemble with enormous inconvenience in this City, forsaken of god and man?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"'But,' you will say, 'while it is obvious that everything will be polluted beyond all possibility of purification, yet the situation itself compels us to leave a City which fires and falling buildings have made a wilderness, and emigrate to Veii, where everything is untouched, nor vex the helpless commons with building here.'
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But that this is rather a pretext than a true reason is, I think, apparent to you, Quirites, without my saying so; for you remember how, before the coming of the Gauls, when our roof-trees, public and private, were unharmed and our City stood uninjured, that this same proposal was <pb id="p.181"/>urged, of migrating to Veii.<note>Chap. xxiv. &sect; 7.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And consider, tribunes,<note type="marg">B.C. 396</note> how wide is the difference between my view and yours. You think that even if then it ought not to have been done, yet now at any rate it ought; I on the contrary &mdash;and be not astonished at this, till you have heard what my meaning is, &mdash;even if it had been right to migrate then, with the City all intact, should not think it right to abandon these ruins now.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For then our victory would have been a reason for migrating to a captured city &mdash;a reason glorious to ourselves and our posterity; but now such a removal is for us a wretched and humiliating course, and a glory to the Gauls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For we shall not seem to have left our country as victors, but to have lost it as men vanquished. It will be thought that the rout on the Allia, the capture of the City, the blockade of the Capitol, have compelled us to forsake our family gods, and sentence ourselves to banishment and exile from that place which we were powerless to defend.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Have Gauls then been able to cast Rome down; and must Romans appear unable to have raised her up?

			<p>AT the siege of Veii winter quarters were constructed
				for the soldiers. This, being a new departure, stirred the
				ire of the tribunes of the plebs, who complained that the
				plebs were given no rest from warfare even in winter.
				The cavalry began then for the first time to serve on their
				own mounts. An inundation from the Alban Lake having
				occurred, a soothsayer was captured from the enemy that
				he might explain it. Furius Camillus the dictator captured Veii in a ten years' siege, transferred to Rome the
				image of Juno, and sent a tithe of the spoils to Apollo at
				Delphi. When the same man was besieging the Falisci
				as military tribune, he restored to their parents the sons
				of the enemy who had been betrayed, whereupon the
				Falisci surrendered and he obtained the victory by his
				justice. On the death of one of the censors, Gaius Julius,
				Marcus Cornelius was chosen to fill out his term, but
				this was never afterwards done because in that five-year
				period Rome was taken. Furius Camillus, having been
				cited for trial by Lucius Apuleius, a tribune of the
				plebs, went into exile. When the Gallic Senones were
				besieging Clusium and the envoys sent by the senate to
				arrange a peace between them and the Clusini fought in
				the army of the Clusini, the Senones were angered and
				marched to the attack of Rome. Defeating the Romans on
				the Allia they captured the City, all but the Capitol, in
				which the Romans of fighting age had taken refuge, and
				slew the elders, who, dressed in the insignia of the offices
				which they had held, were sitting in the vestibules of their
				houses. And when, climbing up on the other side of the
				Capitol, they had already come out on the top of it, they
				were betrayed by the gabbling of geese and&mdash;chiefly by the
				efforts of Marcus Manlius&mdash;were flung down. Later the
				<pb id="p.191"/>
				Romans were reduced so low by hunger as to offer a
				thousand pounds of gold and with this price to purchase
				an end of the siege. Furius Camillus, having been
				appointed dictator in his absence, came up with his
				army in the midst of this very conference about the
				terms of peace, and six months after their coming drove
				out the Gauls from Rome and cut them to pieces. Men
				said that they ought to remove to Veii because the City
				had been burned and overthrown, but this counsel was
				rejected, at the instance of Camillus. The people were
				moved also by the omen of certain words that a centurion
				was heard to utter, when having come into the Forum he
				said to his company: <quote>Halt, soldiers, we shall do well to
					stop here.</quote> A temple was erected to Jupiter Capitolinus,
				because a voice had been heard before the capture of
				the City, which declared that the Gauls were coming.</p></div1>

			<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE history of the Romans from the founding<note type="marg">B. C. 389</note> of the City of Rome to the capture of the same &mdash;at first under kings and afterwards under consuls and dictators, decemvirs and consular tribunes &mdash;their
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> foreign wars and their domestic dissensions, I have set forth in five books, dealing with matters which are obscure not only by reason of their great antiquity &mdash;like far-off objects which can hardly be descried &mdash;but also because in those days there was but slightly and scanty use of writing, the sole trustworthy guardian of the memory of past events, and because even such records as existed in the commentaries of the pontiffs and in other public and private documents, nearly all perished in the conflagration of the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From this point onwards a clearer and more definite account shall be given of the City's civil and military history, when, beginning for a second time, it sprang up, as it were from the old roots, with a more luxuriant and fruitful growth.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now it stood at first by leaning on the same support by which it had raised itself up, that is on Marcus Furius, its foremost citizen;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> neither would men suffer him to resign the dictatorship till the completion of the year.<note>Livy means the year (ending June 30th) for which the consular tribunes were elected whom Camillus, as dictator, superseded.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That elections for the ensuing year should be held by the tribunes, in whose magistracy the City had been captured, was considered inadvisable, and the state reverted to an <pb id="p.197"/>interregnum. While the citizens were engrossed in<note type="marg">B.C. 389</note> unremitting toil and labour to restore the City, Quintus Fabius had no sooner quitted his magistracy than he was indicted by Gnaeus Marcius, a tribune of the plebs, on the ground of his having fought in violation of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> law of nations against the Gauls, to whom he had been sent as an envoy &mdash;a trial which he escaped by a death so opportune that the majority believed it voluntary.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The interregnum began: Publius Cornelius Scipio was interrex; and after him Marcus Furius Camillus, who effected the election, as tribunes of the soldiers with consular authority, of Lucius Valerius Publicola (for the second time) Lucius Verginius, Publius Cornelius, Aulus Manlius, Lucius Aemilius, and Lucius Postumius.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Having, immediately<note>On July 6th at the earliest.</note> after the interregnum, entered upon their term, they consulted the senate before everything else on questions of religious observance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Among the first decrees they passed was one for searching out the treaties and laws &mdash; to wit, the twelve tables and certain laws of the kings, &mdash;so far as they could be discovered. Some of these were made accessible even to the common people, but such as dealt with sacred rites were kept private by the pontiffs, chiefly that they might hold the minds of the populace in subjection through religious fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then they proceeded to deliberate about days of evil omen. The 18th of July was notorious for a double misfortune, since it was on that day that the Fabii were massacred at the Cremera and that subsequently the rout at the Allia occurred, which resulted in the destruction of the City. From the latter disaster they named it the Day of the Allia, and forbade any public or <pb id="p.199"/>private business to be done that day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some think,<note type="marg">B. C. 389</note> because Sulpicius had, on the day after the Ides of July, made an unacceptable sacrifice, and, without having gained the divine approval, had two days later exposed the Roman army to the enemy, that therefore religious rites were omitted also on the days after the several Ides; and that afterwards it became traditional that the morrow after Kalends and Nones should likewise be avoided, from the same scruple.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the Romans were not left long to the peaceful consideration of plans for raising their state after its grievous fall.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the one hand the Volsci, their ancient foes, had armed for the purpose of extinguishing the Roman name: on the other, merchants brought word from Etruria that the leading men of all her nations had met at the shrine of Voltumna and conspired to make war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A fresh alarm, too, was occasioned by the revolt of the Latins and the Hernici, who since the battle fought at Lake Regillus had continued for close upon a hundred years, with unquestioned loyalty, in the friendship of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so, when such dangers threatened them on every side, and it was clear to all that the name of Rome was not only held in hatred by her enemies, but even in contempt by her allies, it was
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> resolved that the republic should be defended under the same auspices under which it had been redeemed and that Marcus Furius Camillus should be named dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Being appointed dictator he designated Gaius Servilius Ahala master of the horse, and after proclaiming a cessation of legal business, held a levy of the juniors, yet without excluding such of the older men as still <pb id="p.201"/>possessed any vigour, to whom also he administered<note type="marg">B.C. 389</note> the oath and mustered them into centuries.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Having enrolled the army and equipped it, he divided it into three parts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> One division he stationed in the Veientine district to confront Etruria; a second he ordered to encamp before the City. These divisions were put under the command of military tribunes, Aulus Manlius for the home troops, Lucius Aemilius for those which were being dispatched against the Etruscans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The third division he led himself against the Volsci, and not far from Lanuvium &mdash;<hi rend="italics">ad Mecium</hi> the place is called &mdash;advanced to attack their camp. The enemy had gone to war from a feeling of contempt for the Romans, believing that their fighting strength had been nearly wiped out by the Gauls, but merely on hearing that Camillus was their general, they were so terrified that they protected themselves with a rampart and
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the rampart with a barricade of logs, that the Romans might nowhere be able to penetrate to their defences. On perceiving this, Camillus ordered his men to throw fire on the barrier.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It so happened that there was a high wind blowing towards the enemy, which not only caused the blaze to open a path, but what with the flames making towards the camp, and the heat and smoke and the crackling of the green wood, so alarmed the enemy, that the Roman soldiers experienced less difficulty in scaling the fortifications of the Volscian camp than they had met with in crossing the burnt barricade.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Having routed and slain his enemies and taken their camp by assault, the dictator gave the booty to his soldiers, an act which, coming unexpectedly from a commander who <pb id="p.203"/>was by no means open-handed, was all the more<note type="marg">B.C. 389</note> acceptable to the men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then after pursuing the fugitives and laying waste all the Volscian countryside, he forced the Volsci to surrender at last, after seventy years of war.<note>Writing of Tarquinius Superbus, Livy says (I. liii. 2) that he began a war with the Volsci which was to last more than two hundred years after his time. It is not known where he could have found the seventy years tradition.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The victor, leaving the Volsci, crossed over to the Aequi, who were themselves making preparations for war; their army he surprised at Bolae, and carried not only their camp but their city, too, at the first assault.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While affairs were thus prosperous in that region where Camillus commanded for Rome, in another direction a great danger threatened. Well-nigh the whole of Etruria was in arms and was laying siege to Sutrium, an ally of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Envoys of the Sutrines had appeared before the senate to beg for assistance in their distress, and had obtained a decree that the dictator should march to the aid of their people at the earliest opportunity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the plight of the besieged would not admit of their waiting till this hope was realized; and the population of the little town, exhausted with the labour, guard-mounting, and wounds, which fell always to the lot of the same men, had come to terms, and having surrendered their city to the enemy, were leaving their homes in a sad procession, unarmed and with but a single garment each, when, as it chanced, Camillus appeared on the scene with a Roman army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The disconsolate rabble cast themselves at his feet, while their leading men addressed him with words drawn from them by the direst necessity and accompanied by the wailing of the women and children, who were being dragged along as the companions of their exile. He bade the Sutrines spare their lamentations; the Etruscans <pb id="p.205"/>were those to whom he was bringing grief and tears.<note type="marg">B.C. 389</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then gave orders that the packs should be set down; that the Sutrines should stop there, with a small guard which he left them; and that his soldiers should take their weapons and follow him. So, with his army in light marching order, he set out for Sutrium, where he was not surprised to find everything at loose ends, as a consequence &mdash;common enough &mdash;of their success; there was no outpost before the walls; the gates were open; and the victors had dispersed and were fetching the booty out of the houses of their enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the second time, therefore, on the same day, Sutrium was captured.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The victorious Etruscans were everywhere slaughtered by the new enemy, and had no time given them to assemble and unite their forces or to arm. As they tried, every man for himself, to reach the gates, if by chance they might somehow escape out into the fields, they found them shut, for so the general had ordered in the beginning.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After that some caught up their swords; others, whom the sudden attack had found already armed, tried to call their fellows together for a battle, and this would have been hotly fought, because of the enemy's despair, had not heralds been dispatched through the town who made proclamation that arms should be laid down and the unarmed receive quarter, and that none should suffer any violence except those that carried weapons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then even such as had in their extremity resolved to fight to the death, now that hope of life was held out to them, began everywhere to throw down their swords, and to go unarmed &mdash;for fortune had made this the safer way &mdash;to meet their enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The <pb id="p.207"/>great throng was divided among companies of<note type="marg">B.C. 389</note> guards; and before night the town was restored to the Sutrines, unharmed and without scathe of war, because it had not been carried by assault, but had been surrendered upon terms.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Camillus returned to the City and triumphed<note type="marg">B.C. 388</note> for his victories in three simultaneous wars.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By far the greatest number of the captives led before his chariot were Etruscans; they were sold under the spear,<note>A sign that booty was to be sold at auction.</note> and fetched so large a sum that after the matrons had been repaid for their gold,<note>See v. 1. 6-7.</note> the surplus sufficed to make three golden bowls, which were inscribed, as is well known, with
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the name of Camillus, and kept, until the burning of the Capitol,<note>July 6th, <date value="-83">83 B.C.</date> The restoration of the temple was completed <date value="-69">69 B.C.</date></note> in the chapel of Jupiter, at Juno's feet.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This year were received into the state such of the Veientes, Capenates, and Faliscans as had come over to the Romans in the course of these wars, and lands were allotted to these new citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were also recalled from Veii to the City, by senatorial decree, those who being too indolent to build in Rome had taken possession of empty houses in Veii and had gone there to live. They had indeed murmured at first, and had flouted the order; but the designation of a day and the threat of a capital penalty for failure to return to Rome reduced them from a defiant group to obedient individuals, as each became alarmed for himself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Rome was now growing in numbers, and in every part at once new buildings were springing up; the state contributed towards the costs, and the aediles forwarded the work as though it had been public business, while the citizens themselves, incited by their desire to be <pb id="p.209"/>using it, hurried their building to a conclusion;<note type="marg">B.C. 388</note> and within the year there was a new City standing.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At the close of the year an election of military tribunes with consular powers was held. Those chosen were Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus, Quintus Servilius Fidenas (for the fifth time), Lucius Julius Iulus, Lucius Aquilius Corvus, Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These men led one army against the Aequi, not to war &mdash;for they confessed themselves vanquished &mdash;but from hatred, in order to waste, their territories and leave them with no strength to make new trouble; with another they invaded the district of Tarquinii, where they captured by assault the Etruscan towns Cortuosa and Contenebra.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At Cortuosa there was no struggle: in a surprise attack they carried the place at the first shout and onset, and then sacked and burned it. Contenebra held out for a few days, but the continuous fighting, without respite either day or night, overcame them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Roman army had been divided into six corps, of which each in its turn went into battle for six hours; while the townsmen were so few that the same men were exposed to an attack that was constantly renewed, until at last they gave way and afforded the Romans an opening to enter the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The tribunes decided that the booty should go to the state, but were less prompt in issuing orders than in planning; and, while they procrastinated, it was already in the hands of the soldiers and could not be taken away without offending them.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>That same year, that the City might not grow in private buildings only, the Capitol was provided with a substructure of hewn stone, a work which even <pb id="p.211"/>amidst the present splendours of the City is deserving<note type="marg">B.C. 388</note> of remark.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And now, while the citizens were taken up<note type="marg">B. C. 387</note> with building, the tribunes of the plebs were trying to attract crowds to their meetings by proposals for agrarian laws.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They held out hopes of the Pomptine district, of which the Romans had then for the first time &mdash;since the defeat inflicted on the Volsci by Camillus &mdash;acquired undisputed control.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes brought the charge that this district was worse plagued by the nobility than it had been by the Volsci; for the latter, as long as they were strong enough and had arms, had done no more than make incursions into it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but the nobles were taking violent possession of the public domain, and unless it should be parcelled out before they seized it all, there would be no room there for the commons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They made no great impression on the plebs, who were seldom in the Forum, because they were so intent on building, and, exhausted with the expense thereby incurred, had no thought of land, which they lacked the means of stocking.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The citizens were much given to religious fears, and at that time, owing to the recent calamity, even the leaders were a prey to superstition; so, in order that new auspices might be had, the state went into an interregnum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The office of interrex was successively held by Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, Servius Sulpicius Camerinus, and Lucius Valerius Potitus. Finally, the last-named held an election of military tribunes and announced that the choice had fallen on Lucius Papirius, Gaius Cornelius, Gaius Sergius, Lucius Aemilius (for the second time), Lucius <pb id="p.213"/>Menenius and Lucius Valerius Publicola (for the<note type="marg">B.C. 387</note> third time). These men took office at the conclusion of the interregnum.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In that year the temple of Mars vowed in the Gallic war was dedicated by Titus Quinctius, duumvir for sacrifices.<note>The <hi rend="italics">duumviri</hi> had charge of the Sibylline Books, which they were directed to consult in times of stress to ascertain what expiation Heaven demanded for the sins of the people Their number was raised to ten in <date value="-367">367 B.C.</date> and later (in <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>) to fifteen.</note> Four additional tribes were formed out of the new citizens, the Stellatina, Tromentina, Sabatina, and Arniensis; these filled up the number of tribes to twenty-five.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question of the Pomptine territory was<note type="marg">B. C. 386</note> brought up by Lucius Sicinius, a tribune of the plebs, in popular meetings which were now more numerously attended, and by men more easily induced to covet land, than had been the case before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate talked also of war with the Latins and the Hernici, but dread of a greater war &mdash;Etruria being up in arms &mdash;caused them to defer it.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The government passed to Camillus, as tribune of the soldiers with consular authority. He was given five colleagues: Servius Cornelius Maluginensis, Quintus Servilius Fidenas (for a sixth term), Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, Lucius Horatius Pulvillus, and Publius Valerius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Early in the year the general concern was diverted from the Etruscan war, when a band of fugitives from the Pomptine district suddenly appeared in Rome with tidings that the Antiates were in arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Latin communities, so they reported, had sent their soldiers to help in the war, but asserted that their government was not involved, since they had merely, as they said, not forbidden their young men to serve, as volunteers, where they liked.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.215"/>
			<p>The Romans had ceased by this time to make light<note type="marg">B.C. 386</note> of any wars. And so the senate gave thanks to the gods that Camillus was in office, for in sooth they would have been obliged to make him dictator, if he had been a private citizen;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and his colleagues declared that the general control, when any warlike danger threatened, belonged to one man alone, and that they were resolved to subordinate their own authority to Camillus; nor did they believe that there was any derogation of their own dignity in such concessions as they might make to his. The senate commended the tribunes, and Camillus himself, deeply moved, expressed his thanks.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A heavy responsibility he said, was placed upon him by the Roman People, who had now elected him for the fourth time; no small one by the senate, in so judging of him; but the greatest of all proceeded from the deference accorded him by such distinguished colleagues.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly, if it were possible to add to his exertions and his vigilance, he should vie with himself in an effort to make the very high opinion which his fellow citizens so unanimously entertained of him an abiding one.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As for the war with the men of Antium, there was more bluster in that quarter than real danger; nevertheless, as he would have them fear nothing, so he would counsel them to despise nothing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The City of Rome was ringed about by the envy and ill-will of her neighbours; consequently there needed several generals and armies to administer the interests of the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>It is my wish,</quote> said he, <quote>that you, Publius Valerius, should share my authority and deliberations, and join me in leading the legions against the enemy at Antium;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that you, Quintus Servilius, should organize <pb id="p.217"/>and equip a second army, and maintain your camp<note type="marg">B.C. 386</note> near Rome, on the alert, in case any move should be made in the meantime from Etruria, as happened recently, or from this new source of anxiety, the Latins and Hernici; certain I am that you will discharge the commission in a manner worthy of your father, your grandfather, and yourself, and of your six tribuneships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Let a third army be enrolled by Lucius Quinctius, out of those who are invalided or over age, to defend the City and the walls. Let Lucius Horatius provide arms, missiles, corn, and what else the exigencies of the war demand.

			<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>All promised loyally to do their best in their respective departments of their office; and Valerius, who had been selected to share in the command, added that he should regard Marcus Furius as a dictator and himself as his master of the horse;
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> in proportion therefore to men's confidence in their unique commander should be their hopes of the outcome of the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Whereat the senators in their enthusiasm shouted that they hoped right well of the war, and of the peace, and of the common weal in general; adding that the state would never need a dictator if it might have such men in office, united in such loving concord, equally ready to command and obey, and rather contributing to the common stock of glory than drawing upon it for their own behoof.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After proclaiming a suspension of legal business and holding a levy, Furius and Valerius set <pb id="p.219"/>out for Satricum, where the Antiates had collected<note type="marg">B.C. 386</note> not only the fighting men of the Volsci, recruited from a new generation,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi>since the disastrous defeat they had suffered in 389 (chap. ii. &sect; 12).</note> but also a large force of Latins and Hernici, nations which, having been long at peace, were extremely strong. The consequence of this addition of new enemies to their old ones was to trouble the spirit of the Roman soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But when the centurions reported to Camillus, as he was already drawing up his line, that the men were demoralized; that they had been loath to arm and had hesitated and delayed in leaving the camp, nay, that some had even been heard to say that they would be one against a hundred in the battle, and that so great a host could hardly be withstood even though unarmed, much less when provided with weapons &mdash;being
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> told of this, I say, Camillus vaulted upon his horse, and riding along the ranks in front of the standards, faced his troops and thus addressed them:</p> 
			<p>"Soldiers, what means this gloom and this unwonted reluctance? Are you strangers to the enemy, or to me, or to yourselves?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The enemy &mdash;what else are they but inexhaustible material for you to fashion into glorious deeds of valour? As for yourselves, when acting as my soldiers, though I say nothing of your capturing Falerii and Veii and routing the Gallic legions in your captured City, you celebrated, only the other day, a three-fold triumph for a triple victory over these very Volsci and Aequi and over Etruria.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Or is it that I, having given you the signal not as dictator but as tribune of the soldiers, am not recognized as your commander? And yet neither do I desire supreme authority over you, nor ought you to regard in me anything but myself; for <pb id="p.221"/>the dictatorship could never give me resolution, nor<note type="marg">B. C.386</note> could even exile deprive me of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We are all, therefore, exactly as we were, and since we bring the same qualities in all respects to this campaign that we brought to earlier ones, let us look forward to the same result. As soon as you have joined battle, every man will do what he has learned and has become accustomed to: you will conquer, they will run away.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He then sounded the charge, and leaping from his horse, caught hold of the nearest standard bearer and hurried him towards the enemy, calling out: <quote>Forward soldiers!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But when they saw Camillus, who for bodily feats was now grown old and infirm, advancing in person against the foe, they all gave a cheer and rushed forward together, and every man took up the cry of <quote>Follow the General!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is even said that Camillus bade the standard-bearer hurl his ensign into the press of enemies, and urging the front ranks to recover it, then for the first time discomfited the Antiates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The panic did not stop with the first line, but spread even to the troops in support.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was not only the dash of the Roman soldiers, inspired by their leader's presence, which overcame them; for nothing so daunted the spirits of the Volsci as the sight of Camillus himself, when they happened to encounter him &mdash;so surely, wherever he went, did he carry victory with him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was especially apparent on the left. That wing had already nearly given way, when Camillus suddenly threw himself upon a horse, and, armed with an infantry-shield, rode up and by his presence retrieved the battle, calling out that the rest of the army was conquering.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fortune of the day had now turned, <pb id="p.223"/>but the enemy's numbers were an obstacle even to<note type="marg">B.C. 386</note> their flight, and a great multitude remained for the weary soldiers to dispatch with long-drawn massacre, when suddenly great gusts of wind brought on a downpour of rain, which broke off what was rather a certain victory than a battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thereupon the recall was sounded, and the night that followed finished the campaign for the Romans, while they slept. For the Latins and Hernici abandoned the Volsci and marched off to their homes, their evil counsels rewarded with as evil an outcome;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and the Volsci, perceiving themselves to be deserted by those on whom they had relied in their rebellion, forsook their camp and shut themselves up within the walls of Satricum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Camillus at first set about confining them with a palisade and mound, intending to lay siege to them; but finding the enemy made no sorties to interrupt the work, he concluded they had not sufficient resolution to make him wait so long for victory. He therefore encouraged his troops not to wear themselves out with protracted toil, as though they were besieging Veii, when victory was within their grasp; and with great alacrity on the part of the soldiers, he approached the walls from every side and captured the town with scaling ladders. The Volsci threw away their weapons and surrendered.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the general's thoughts were turning to a matter of greater moment, namely Antium, which, as being the Volscian capital, he held responsible for the last war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But because, without extensive equipment of artillery and engines, it was impossible to take so strong a town, he left his colleague in command of the army and proceeded to Rome, that he might <pb id="p.225"/>urge the senate to undertake the destruction of<note type="marg">B. C. 386</note> Antium.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While he was speaking &mdash;I suppose it was Heaven's will that the Antian state should continue somewhat longer<note>With this remark compare I. iv. 1.</note> &mdash;envoys from Nepete and Sutrium appeared, who asked for help against the Etruscans, saying that the opportunity of lending aid would soon be past. To this quarter Fortune diverted the energies of Camillus, away from Antium.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For since these places were on the frontier of Etruria, and were the barriers, so to speak, and gateways of that region, the Etruscans were concerned to seize them, as often as they had any new design in hand, and the Romans to recover or defend them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate therefore resolved to request of Camillus that he should relinquish Antium and undertake the Etruscan war, and voted him the city levies which had been under the command of Quinctius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although Camillus would have preferred the army, disciplined and used to his authority, which lay in the Volscian country, he made no objection, only stipulating that Valerius should be associated with him in the command.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius and Horatius were dispatched to succeed Valerius against the Volsci.</p> 
			<p>Leaving the City and marching to Sutrium, Furius and Valerius found that a part of the town was already captured by the Etruscans, and that in the other part the townspeople had barricaded the streets and were defending themselves with great difficulty from the onslaughts of their enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The arrival of succour from Rome, and particularly the great reputation which Camillus enjoyed with both friends and foes, checked for the moment the disastrous course of events and afforded time to render assistance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Accordingly, Camillus divided the army, <pb id="p.227"/>and directed his colleague to make a circuit with his<note type="marg">B. C. 386</note> forces and to attack the walls on the side which was held by the enemy. His hope was not so much that the city would be taken by escalade, as that the enemy might be diverted to that quarter &mdash;easing thereby the strain upon the townsmen, who were already worn out with fighting &mdash;and that he might himself have an opportunity of entering the place without encountering resistance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But on this plan being put into effect simultaneously at both points, the Etruscans, finding themselves threatened on either side and seeing that the walls were being violently assailed and that the enemy was inside the city, threw themselves out by the only gate which chanced to be unguarded, in one panic-stricken throng.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Great was the carnage they suffered as they fled, both in the city and in the fields. Furius's men slew more within the walls; the soldiers of Valerius were more lightly equipped for pursuit, and kept up the massacre until night made it impossible to see.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Having retaken Sutrium and restored it to our allies, the army marched to Nepete, which had surrendered to the Etruscans, who were now in complete possession.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It appeared likely that this town would be more troublesome to recover, not only because it was wholly in the hands of the enemy, but also because a faction of the Nepesini had betrayed their state and arranged the capitulation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was nevertheless decided to send word to their leaders, that they should sever themselves from the Etruscans and extend to the Romans the same trusty aid which they had requested at their hands.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the reply came <pb id="p.229"/>back that they were powerless, that the Etruscans<note type="marg">B. C. 386</note> held the walls and guarded the gates, the Romans first laid waste their fields, in an effort to frighten the townsfolk;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> then, when the sanctity of their surrender proved to be more binding on them than that of their alliance, they gathered osiers from the fields and made fascines, and the army being led against the walls filled up the moat, erected scaling ladders, and carried the town at the first shout and charge.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Nepesini were then commanded to lay down their weapons and the order was given to spare such as were unarmed. The Etruscans were put to death, whether armed or not. Of the Nepesini, too, those who were responsible for the surrender were executed; the innocent populace were given back their possessions, and the town was left with a garrison.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After thus regaining from the enemy two cities of the allies, the victorious army under its tribunes marched gloriously back to Rome.</p> 
			<p>The same year demands for reparation were made upon the Latins and the Hernici, and they were asked why, during recent years, they had furnished no soldiers, as they had agreed to do.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both nations replied in plenary assemblies that no blame or evil purpose attached to the state because a few of their young men had served with the Volsci.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These men had, for that matter, paid the penalty for their distorted judgment, and not one of them had come back; as to their having furnished no soldiers, this had been due to their constant fear of the Volsci &mdash;a pest that clung so fast to them that with all that long succession of wars they had been unable to shake it off.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On learning of this answer, the <pb id="p.231"/>senators were of opinion that they lacked not so<note type="marg">B. C. 386</note> much the ground for war as a favourable opportunity.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the following year, when the consular<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> tribunes were Aulus Manlius, Publius Cornelius, Titus and Lucius Quinctius Capitolinus, Lucius Papirius Cursor (for the second time) and Gaius Sergius (for the second time), a serious foreign war broke out, and an even more serious domestic schism.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war was set on foot by the Volsci, in conjunction with a revolt on the part of the Latins and Hernici; the schism originated where such a thing was least to be apprehended, with a man of patrician family and high renown, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This man, scorning, in his overweening pride, the other nobles, but envying the one who excelled them all in honours and good qualities, namely Marcus Furius, could ill endure that Camillus should at last have attained to such solitary eminence, both amongst the magistrates and in the armies, as to have those who had been chosen under the same auspices not for colleagues but for servants;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> whereas &mdash;if one considered the situation fairly &mdash;it would have been impossible for Marcus Furius to redeem his native City from the leaguer of her enemies, unless Manlius himself had before that saved the Capitol and Citadel.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Camillus had assailed the Gauls while they were receiving the gold and while their resolution was relaxed by thoughts of peace; but he himself had driven them back, as they came on, sword in hand, in the act of taking the Citadel. Of the glory of Camillus a goodly portion belonged to all the soldiers who had conquered with him: in his own victory it was acknowledged that no mortal soever had a share.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Puffed up with these <pb id="p.233"/>opinions, and being besides, through a defect of<note type="marg">B. C. 385</note> nature, impetuous and passionate, when he perceived that his abilities did not bring him that leadership amongst the nobles
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> which he thought they merited, he was the first of all the patricians to turn demagogue and to cast in his lot with the plebeian magistrates. He abused the nobles, he courted the favour of the plebs; and swept along by the breath of popularity and not by good counsel chose rather to be reputed great than virtuous.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Moreover, not content with agrarian proposals, which had ever served the tribunes to stir up sedition, he began an attack on credit; for he held that debt was a sharper goad, since it not only threatened poverty and shame, but terrified the freeman with the thought of shackles and imprisonment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And in fact there had been a vast piling up of debts, by reason of a thing that is ruinous even to the rich, to wit, building. And so the Volscian war, grave in itself and made still graver by the defection of the Latins and Hernici, was alleged as a reason for seeking a greater authority;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but the revolutionary schemes of Manlius were the more compelling cause of the senate's naming a dictator. They appointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus, who appointed as his master of the horse Titus Quinctius Capitolinus.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dictator perceived that a greater struggle was impending at home than abroad. But either the war demanded haste, or he believed that by a victory and triumph he could add power to the dictatorship itself. So he mustered his forces and proceeded to the Pomptine territory, which he had heard was invaded by a Volscian army.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I doubt not that those who are surfeited with <pb id="p.235"/>reading in all these books about endless wars waged<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> with the Volsci will ask, as with great astonishment I did myself, on examining the historians who were nearer in point of time to those events, where the so oft defeated Volsci and Aequi got their supply of soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since the ancients have passed over this question in silence, what can I adduce other than an opinion such as everyone can by conjecture arrive at for himself?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is probable either that in the intervals between wars successive generations sprang up &mdash;as happens nowadays in the levies of the Romans &mdash;which they used for their frequent renewals of war; or that it was not always the same tribes from which they enrolled their armies &mdash;though it was always the same nation which made war;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> or else that there was an innumerable multitude of freemen in those regions which in our day scarce afford a scanty seed-plot for soldiers, and are only saved from becoming a waste desert by gangs of Roman slaves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In any case, all the authorities would agree that the army of the Volsci was an enormous one, although their state had recently suffered a heavy blow from the generalship and auspices of Camillus. There were, besides, additional forces of Latins and Hernici, as well as a certain number from Circeii, and even Roman colonists from Velitrae.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>On the morning after he had made his camp, the dictator took the auspices, and coming forth from his tent offered up a victim and besought the favour of Heaven. He then with great cheerfulness presented himself before the soldiers, who were already arming by the first rays of light, as they had been warned to do when the signal for battle<note>A red flag flown from the general's tent.</note> should be displayed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <quote>Ours is the victory, soldiers,</quote> he <pb id="p.237"/>exclaimed, <quote>if the gods and the soothsayers who<note type="marg">B. C. 385</note> interpret them can at all see what is coming. And so, as befits men who with sure confidence are about to fight with those who are no match for them, let us lay our javelins at our feet and arm our right hands with swords only. I would have none run out from the line, but all stand firmly planted and receive the onset of our enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they have discharged their missiles without effect, and come thronging upon you where you stand, then let your blades flash out, and let every man of you bethink him that the gods are the Roman's helpers, that the gods have with fair omens sent him into battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Do you, Titus Quinctius, hold back your cavalry and watch for the first beginning of the mellay; when you see that the lines are already close-locked, foot to foot, then loose the terrors of your horse against them, while they are taken up with another fear; charge them as they fight, and break their ranks.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> so horse and foot fought exactly as they had been ordered; the general failed not his legions, nor fortune the general.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The hostile multitude, relying on numbers only and measuring both armies with their eyes, recklessly began the fight and as recklessly gave it up;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> their boldness went no further than the battle-cry, the discharge of missiles, and the first fury of the onset; the play of swords, when foot met foot, and the glance of the foeman that darted out the fire of his spirit, they could not abide.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their front was first driven in and communicated its disorder to the supports; the horsemen, too, inspired a terror of their own; next the ranks were broken at many points, and all was in commotion, and the line <pb id="p.239"/>resembled a surging wave. Then, as soon as each<note type="marg">B. C. 385</note> began to see that with the fall of those in front his own turn to be killed would soon be coming, they turned and fled.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans pressed on after them, and as long as they retained their arms and withdrew in masses, it was the infantry's task to pursue them; but when the enemy were seen to be throwing away their weapons on every hand and their army to be dispersed in flight over the fields; then the cavalry squadrons were let loose, with orders not to stop to kill single fugitives and afford meanwhile an opportunity to the main body of escaping;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> it was sufficient if by darting missiles at them to alarm them, and by riding across their path, they should hold the column in check, till the infantry could overtake the enemy and utterly destroy them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Flight and pursuit continued until nightfall. The Volscian camp was also captured the same day and sacked, and all the booty except the persons of freemen was turned over to the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The chief part of the prisoners consisted of Latins and Hernici, not all of whom were plebeians, such as might be supposed to have served as mercenaries, but certain youths of high rank were discovered, a clear proof that their states had publicly countenanced the Volscian enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Some, again, were recognized as being from Circeii and from the colony at Velitrae. They were all sent to Rome, and being questioned by the chief senators, gave the same answers they had given the dictator, and in no uncertain terms laid bare the defection of their respective peoples.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dictator maintained his army in camp, not doubting in the least that the senate would <pb id="p.241"/>declare war on those nations;<note>Actually the senate could only recommend a declaration of war, the ultimate decision resting with the <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata.</hi></note> when a greater<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> disturbance broke out at home and obliged them to summon him to the City, where the sedition was increasing from day to day, and occasioned more than the usual alarm by reason of the man who was behind it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For now not only the speeches of Marcus Manlius, but his actions as well, while ostensibly democratic, were really revolutionary, considering the purpose which inspired them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A centurion renowned for military prowess had been condemned for debt. As he was being led away, Manlius caught sight of him, and hastening to his side through the midst of the Forum with his band of retainers, he laid hold of him, and exclaiming at the arrogance of the patricians, the heartlessness of the money-lenders, the sufferings of the plebs, and the merits and misfortunes of this man,
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> <quote>Then in very truth,</quote> he cried, <quote>was it all in vain that with this right hand I saved the Capitol and the Citadel, if I am to see my fellow citizen and fellow soldier carried off a captive &mdash;as though the Gauls had conquered us &mdash;to servitude and chains!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then paid the money to the creditor in full sight of the people, and with the ceremony of the scales and bronze<note>Symbolical of the <hi rend="italics">sale</hi> by which the debtor was conceived to be transferred from the ownership of his creditor to that of Liberty.</note> redeemed the debtor and set him free, to invoke the blessing of gods and men on Marcus Manlius, his liberator, the father of the Roman plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The man was at once received into the midst of a tumultuous throng, and added to the tumult by displaying the scars he had received in the Veientine, the Gallic, and other successive wars.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While he had himself been fighting, he said, and rebuilding his ruined home, he had been overwhelmed with usury, though he had paid already many times the amount of the capital <pb id="p.243"/>debt, for the interest always swallowed up the<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> principal;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that he beheld the light of day, the Forum, the faces of his fellow citizens, he owed to the generosity of Marcus Manlius, at whose hands he had experienced all the loving-kindness of parents; to him he solemnly devoted his remaining strength and life and blood; what ties soever bound him to native land and the gods of his state and family, bound him to one man alone.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Excited by these words, the commons were already at the beck of a single man, when Manlius did another thing even better calculated to promote a general embroilment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For he gave a farm in the Veientine district, which formed the main part of his fortune, to an auctioneer to sell, &mdash;<quote>that I may not suffer one of your number, Quirites,</quote> said he, <quote>to be condemned, made over, and carried off to slavery, so long as anything of my estate remains.</quote> At this their ardour was so kindled that it was clear that in every measure, right or wrong, they would follow the champion of their liberty.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Besides this he delivered in his house harangues that were full of accusation against the patricians; amongst other things, he declared, with reckless indifference to truth or falsehood, that the patricians were concealing treasures of Gallic gold, and were no longer content with possessing the state lands, unless they could also divert to their own use the money of the state &mdash;money which, if it were employed for the common weal, would suffice to clear the plebs of debt. On this hope being held out to them, the commons felt that they were indeed ill-used.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When, they said, it had been necessary to raise gold for the redemption of their City from the <pb id="p.245"/>Gauls, it had been collected by taxation; but this<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> same gold, after being captured from the enemy, had become the spoil of a few.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They therefore persistently demanded to be told where all that stolen money was hid; and when he put them off with the promise that he would tell them at the proper time, they dropped their other concerns and became one and all so absorbed in this, that it was evident he would reap no little gratitude if his report proved true, and no small offence if it turned out to be false.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the critical state of affairs when the dictator was sent for from the army and came to Rome. Next day he held a meeting of the senate, and having satisfied himself of the people's support, he commanded the senators not to leave him, and coming forth with a great company of them into the Comitium, he there set up his curule chair and dispatched an officer for Marcus Manlius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Being thus summoned by order of the dictator, Manlius signalled to his friends that the struggle was
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> at hand, and advanced with a great train of followers to the tribunal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On this side were ranged the senators, on that the plebs, looking, every man of them, to his respective leader, as though they had formed up for battle. Then, having obtained silence, the dictator began: <quote>I would,</quote> said he, <quote>that I arid the senators of Rome might agree with the plebs in all things else as readily as I am confident we shall do regarding you, Manlius, and the demand I am about to make of you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I perceive that you have caused the citizens to hope that the money which has been lent may be repaid, without injury to credit, out of Gallic treasure which prominent <pb id="p.247"/>patricians are concealing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This proposal I am so<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> far from hindering, that on the contrary I exhort you, Marcus Manlius, to free the Roman plebs from usury, and dislodge from their secret hoards those men who are brooding jealously over the public treasure; which if you do not, whether that you may share the spoil yourself, or because your story is a lie, I shall order you into custody, nor suffer you any longer to excite the multitude with delusive hopes.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>To this Manlius replied that he had not failed to perceive that the appointment of a dictator was aimed, not at the Volsci, who were enemies whenever it suited the convenience of the patricians, nor at the Latins and Hernici, whom they were driving by false accusations to take up arms, but at himself and the Roman plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And now they had dropped their pretended war and were attacking him; now the dictator was coming out as the champion of the money-lenders against the plebs; and they were seeking now to derive from the people's friendliness to him some charge that might lead to his destruction.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>Does it offend you,</quote> he asked, <quote>Aulus Cornelius, and you, Conscript Fathers, that a crowd attends me? Why do you not take it from me by doing, each of you, acts of kindness, by saving debtors, by rescuing your fellow citizens from prison, by preventing the enslavement of those who have been condemned and assigned, by employing your superfluity of wealth to sustain the necessities of others?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But why should I ask of you that you spend of your own money? Receive what is outstanding of the original debts, after deducting from the principal what has been paid in interest, and <pb id="p.249"/>my retinue will soon attract no more notice than<note type="marg">B.C. 385</note> any man's. But why, you will ask, am I the only man to be concerned for my fellow citizens?
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I can no more answer you than if you were to ask why I was the only man to save the Capitol and Citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As then &mdash;to the best of my ability &mdash;I helped the people at large, so now will I help single persons. And touching the Gallic treasure &mdash;the thing itself is simple, but your questioning makes it difficult. For why do you ask about a thing you know? Why do you bid us shake out what is in your purses, and not rather lay it down yourselves &mdash;unless there is some cheat involved?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The more you bid us expose your sleight-of-hand, the more I fear you may have robbed us even of our eyes, while we were watching you. And so it is not I that must be forced to tell of your plunder, but you that must be compelled to give it up.</quote></p> 
			<p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the dictator bade him cease to quibble, and insisted that he should either make his indictment good or confess to the crime of having accused the senate falsely and exposed it to the unmerited odium of a charge of theft; and when Manlius refused to speak at the pleasure of his enemies, he commanded him to be imprisoned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On being arrested by the attendant, Manlius cried out, <quote>Jupiter Optimus Maximus, and Queen Juno and Minerva, and all ye other gods and goddesses that dwell in the Capitol and in the Citadel, is it thus ye suffer your soldier and protector to be tormented by his adversaries?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Shall this right arm wherewith I routed the Gauls from your shrines be now chained and fettered?</quote> There was none that could endure to behold or hear this shame; but there were <pb id="p.251"/>certain rules of conduct which the citizens, deeply<note type="marg">B. C. 385</note> submissive to regular authority, had made inviolable; nor did either the tribunes of the plebs or the plebs themselves dare to lift their eyes or open their mouths against the power of the dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But after Manlius was cast into gaol, it is certain that a great part of the people put on mourning, and that many men permitted their hair and beards to grow, and that a mournful throng hung about the entrance to the prison.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The dictator triumphed over the Volsci, but gained more ill-will thereby than glory; for men murmured that he had earned it, not in the field, but at home, not over an enemy, but over a citizen; one thing only had been lacking to his arrogance, in that Marcus Manlius had not been led before his car.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By this time the feeling was grown well-nigh seditious; and to appease it the senate &mdash;though none demanded it &mdash;became all at once a voluntary giver, and commanded two thousand Roman citizens to be led out to plant a colony at Satricum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi>and a half<note>About one and two-thirds acres. The allotment of Veientine land had been seven <hi rend="italics">iugera.</hi></note> of land were allotted them; but since they chose to regard it as too little, and only given to a few, and as being the price of Manlius's condemnation, the remedy but aggravated the sedition.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And now the Manlian party were more conspicuous than before, both for their sordid dress and for the sorrowful countenances of defendants; men's fears had been removed by the abdication of the dictator, following his triumph, and their tongues and spirits had been set free.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly one began to hear the opinion openly expressed that the people were to blame, because they always by their favours raised their <pb id="p.253"/>champions to a dizzy eminence, and then at the<note type="marg">B. C. 385</note> critical juncture left them in the lurch:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> it had been so with Spurius Cassius and with Spurius Maelius, of whom the former was destroyed while summoning the people to the land, and the latter while endeavouring at his own expense to stave off starvation from his fellow citizens;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it was so with Marcus Manlius, who, finding a part of the citizens overwhelmed and sunk in debt, was dragging them out into light and liberty, when they betrayed him to his adversaries; the plebs fattened their own defenders for the shambles. Was this the penalty a consular must undergo, if he answered not when the dictator nodded to him?
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Let them assume that he had lied before, and for that reason was then unable to reply: what slave had ever been cast into prison for a lie? Did they not recall that night which had almost been the last eternal night of the Roman name? Could they not see the line of Gauls scaling the Tarpeian Rock? Could they not see Marcus Manlius himself, as they had seen him, covered with sweat and blood, when he had rescued as it were Jupiter himself from the hands of our enemies?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Had their half-pound measures of meal requited the saviour of their country?<note>See v. xlvii. 8.</note> Would they suffer one whom they had well-nigh made a god, and in surname, at any rate, the equal of Jupiter Capitolinus, to be confined in prison, and to draw his breath in darkness, at the mercy of the executioner? When one man had been quite able to help them all, was there no help in so many men for one?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By this time the crowd would not even leave the place at night and were threatening that they would force the gaol, when suddenly, just as <pb id="p.255"/>they were about to rescue Manlius, the senate voted<note type="marg">B. C. 385</note> to release him &mdash;an act which, instead of ending the sedition, supplied it with a leader.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At about this time came Latins and Hernici, with colonists from Circeii and from Velitrae, to clear themselves of the charge of joining in the Volscian war and to ask for the release of the captives, that they might punish them in accordance with their own laws. They were harshly answered &mdash;especially the colonists, because, though Roman citizens, they had formed the impious design of attacking their native country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so they were not only denied the captives, but received a rebuke which the allies were spared; being commanded in the name of the senate to make haste and depart the City, out of the presence and sight of the Roman People, lest they should find no protection in the rights of envoys, which were meant for foreigners, not for citizens.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The sedition of Manlius was breaking out<note type="marg">B. C. 384</note> afresh, towards the end of the year, when an election was held which resulted in the choice of the following consular tribunes: Servius Cornelius Maluginensis (for the second time), Publius Valerius Potitus (for the second), Marcus Furius Camillus (for the fifth), Servius Sulpicius Rufus (for the second), Gaius Papirius Crassus, and (for the second time) Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The peace which was enjoyed in the early part of this year was equally advantageous to the patricians and to the plebs; to the plebs because, not being called to service by the levy, they had hopes that they might be able under their powerful leader to storm the stronghold of usury; to the patricians, because they desired not to be diverted by any foreign peril from healing the <pb id="p.257"/>sores of the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly both sides had taken<note type="marg">B. C. 384</note> the field with much more spirit, and the hour of conflict was now at hand. Manlius indeed was inviting the plebeians to his house, and night and day discussing with their leaders plans for accomplishing the revolution, for he was much bolder and more resentful than before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His wrath had been kindled by his recent humiliations, for his pride was a stranger to insult; and his courage had waxed, as he considered that the dictator had not dared to serve him as Quinctius Cincinnatus had served Spurius Maelius, and that his imprisonment had aroused such hatred as not only the dictator had resigned his office to escape, but even the senate had been unable to endure.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At once elated and exasperated by these thoughts, he began to work upon the already excited emotions of the plebs.</p> 
			<p><quote>How long, pray,</quote> he asked them, <quote>will you remain ignorant of your own strength, which nature has willed that even brutes shall know? At least count up your numbers and the number of your adversaries. For as many as you were that gathered as clients about a single patron, so many shall you now be against a single enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If you were going to meet them man for man, I should still believe that you would fight more fiercely for your liberty than they for domination.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Make but a show of war, and you shall have peace. Let them see you ready to resist, and they will give you your rights of their own accord.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> We must all unite in some bold stroke, or else, divided, submit to every evil. How long will you keep looking round for me? It is true I shall not fail a single one of you; but you must see to it that fortune fail not me. I myself, your champion, <pb id="p.259"/>was suddenly brought to naught, when it pleased<note type="marg">B.C. 384</note> your enemies; and you all beheld that man dragged off to prison who had protected each of yourselves from imprisonment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What can I expect, if my enemies grow bolder? Must I look forward to dying like Cassius and Maelius? You do well to express abhorrence. The gods <hi rend="italics">will</hi> forbid such a thing; but they will never come down from heaven on my account; they must give you the inspiration to forbid it, as they gave me, in war and in peace, the inspiration to defend you from the barbarity of your foes and the arrogance of your fellow citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Is there so little spirit in this great people that you are always satisfied with the help your tribunes lend you against your adversaries, and never quarrel with the senators, save as to the length you will suffer them to go in ruling you? And this is no native trait in you, but you are slaves by use.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Why, pray, are you so high and mighty with foreigners as to deem yourselves meet to be their lords?
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is because you have been used to vie with them for sovereignty; but against these men, though you make attempts at gaining your liberty, you are not used to defend it. Nevertheless, with such leaders as you have had, and such courage as you yourselves could muster, you have thus far obtained, by violence or good fortune, whatever you have sought.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The time has come to attempt even greater things. Do but make trial of your own good fortune and of me, whom, as I think, you have already happily proved; you will find it less trouble to impose a ruler on the patricians, than you encountered in imposing tribunes on them to resist their rule.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Dictatorships and consulships must be levelled with <pb id="p.261"/>the ground, that the Roman plebs may be enabled<note type="marg">B. C. 384</note> to lift its head.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Stand by me, then; prevent all court-proceedings regarding moneys; I avow myself the patron of the commons &mdash;a title with which my zeal and loyalty have invested me: if you choose to give your leader a more striking title of authority or honour, you will find him the more able to make good your wishes.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It was thus, they say, that the agitation for kingly power was begun; but there is no very clear tradition with whom or to what length his plans were matured.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the other side the senate were discussing the secret gathering of the plebs in a private house &mdash;a house, too, that, as it happened, was situated in the Citadel &mdash;and the grave danger that threatened liberty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The majority exclaimed that a Servilius Ahala was needed, one who would not exasperate a public enemy by ordering his imprisonment, but would sacrifice a single citizen to end a domestic war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> However, they had recourse to a proposal which sounded milder, though its force was identical, namely, that the magistrates should see to it that the republic took no harm by the ruinous devices of Marcus Manlius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thereupon the consular tribunes and the tribunes of the plebs &mdash;for they too, perceiving that their own authority would come to an end with the general liberty, had made their submission to the Fathers &mdash;all these men, I say, thereupon took counsel together, what was needful to be done.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They could none of them see any way but violence and bloodshed, which would clearly involve a mighty struggle, when Marcus Menenius and Quintus Publilius, tribunes of the plebs, addressed them as follows: <quote>Why do we make a conflict between patricians and <pb id="p.263"/>plebeians out of what ought to be the quarrel of the<note type="marg">B. C. 384</note> state with a single pestilent citizen?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Why in attacking him do we attack the plebs as well, when it is safer to attack him by the help of this same plebs, that his very strength may bring about his ruin?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We propose to summon him to trial. Nothing is less popular than kingly power. As soon as the populace, perceiving that our quarrel is not with them, are changed from supporters into judges, and see that the prosecutors are plebeians, the defendant a patrician, and the accusation that of seeking to set up a kingdom, they will not favour any man at the expense of their own liberty.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This argument won universal approbation, and Manlius was indicted. The first effect of this was to rouse
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> great feeling in the commons, especially when they saw the defendant meanly clad and not attended by a single senator, or even by his kinsmen or connexions, or indeed by his own brothers, Aulus and Titus Manlius. That a man's nearest friends should not join him in assuming mourning in an hour so fraught with danger to him, was something that had never until that day occurred.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They remembered that on the imprisonment of Appius Claudius, his enemy Gaius Claudius and all the Claudian family had gone into mourning; and they concluded that there must be a general conspiracy to put down the people's friend because he had been the first to forsake the patricians for the plebs.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The day of the trial came, but I do not find it stated in any authority what facts were alleged by his accusers that bore directly on the charge of plotting to establish a kingdom, except gatherings of the populace and seditious expressions and his <pb id="p.265"/>largesses and false charge;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and yet I doubt not they<note type="marg">B. C. 384</note> were of moment, since the reluctance of the plebs to condemn him was not owing to his cause but to the place.<note>The Campus Martius, from which they could see the Capitol (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> &sect; 10).</note> One thing appears worthy of remark, that men may know what great and glorious achievements a vile lust for regal power rendered not merely thankless but actually hateful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is said that he brought forward nearly four hundred men to whom he had lent money without interest, thus saving their goods from being sold and their persons from enslavement;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that besides this the military distinctions which he not only enumerated but produced for all to see, comprised the spoils of thirty enemies whom he had slain, and some forty decorations from his generals, amongst which were conspicuous two mural and eight civic crowns;<note>A mural crown was conferred on the soldier who was the first to scale the enemy's wall, a civic crown on one who had saved a fellow citizen (Aulus Gellius v. vi. 11).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that he told, besides, of citizens saved from the enemy, and among these named Gaius Servilius, the master of the horse, who was not present.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And after rehearsing his services in war, in a speech as magnificent as the height of his achievements and equalling his deeds with its words, he is said to have bared his breast, marked with the scars of battle, and gazing steadily at the Capitol to have called on Jupiter and the other gods to help him, that they might inspire the Roman People in his hour of danger with the same spirit they had given him when he- defended the Capitoline Hill; and to have implored the Romans one and all to fix their eyes on the Capitol and Citadel, and turn to the immortal gods while they judged him.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>In the Campus Martius, when the people were being called by centuries,<note>The <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata</hi> being a military organisation might not assemble within the pomerium. The meeting referred to in the preceding paragraph was a <hi rend="italics">contio,</hi></note> and the defendant, <pb id="p.267"/>stretching forth his hands to the Capitol, had turned<note type="marg">B.C. 384</note> from men to make his prayers to the gods, the tribunes clearly saw that unless they could also emancipate men's eyes from the associations of so glorious a deed, no accusation, however true, could ever find lodgment in their grateful hearts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so they adjourned the day of trial and appointed a council of the people to meet in the Peteline Wood outside the Flumentane Gate,<note>The <hi rend="italics">Porta Flumentana</hi> was at a point in the wall between the Aventine and the Capitoline.</note> whence no prospect of the Capitol was afforded. There they made good their charge; men steeled their hearts and pronounced a dolorous judgment, abhorrent to the very ones who rendered it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some authorities assert that he was condemned by duumvirs appointed to deal with a charge of treason.<note>For another instance of this procedure, see I. xxvi. 5.</note> The tribunes flung him from the Tarpeian Rock, and the same spot served to commemorate extraordinary fame and the extremity of punishment, as experienced by the self-same man.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>To his death were added marks of ignominy: one of a public nature, because the people were asked to vote that, since his house had stood where the temple and mint of Moneta now are,<note>The temple of Juno Moneta, vowed by Lucius Furius Camillus (<date value="-345">345 B.C.</date>) was dedicated June 1st, 344. Money was coined in this temple.</note> no patrician might dwell in the Citadel or the Capitol;
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> the other proceeding from his family, in that the Manlian clan made a decree forbidding anyone thenceforth to bear the name of Marcus Manlius.<note>As a matter of fact, no patrician Marcus Manlius of a later date is known to us.</note> Such was the end of a man who, had he not been born in a free state, would have left a memorable name.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> In a short time the people, remembering &mdash;now that he was no longer a source of danger &mdash;only his good qualities, regretted him. Moreover a pestilence soon ensued, and caused a heavy mortality for which there were no obvious causes, and this many people ascribed to the execution of Manlius:
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> the Capitol, they said, had <pb id="p.269"/>been polluted by the blood of its saviour, and the<note type="marg">B. C. 384</note> gods had not been pleased that the man who had rescued their temples from the hands of the enemy, should be punished almost under their very eyes.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The pestilence was succeeded by a scarcity<note type="marg">B. C. 383</note> of corn, and in the following year, when the rumour of these two misfortunes had got abroad, by various wars. The consular tribunes were Lucius Valerius (for the fourth time), Aulus Manlius (for the third), Servius Sulpicius (for the third), Lucius Lucretius, Lucius Aemilius (for the third time) and Marcus Trebonius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Besides the Volsci, who had been provided, as it were by a kind of fatality, to furnish perpetual occupation for the Roman arms, and the colonies of Circeii and Velitrae, which had long been scheming a rebellion, and the Latins, whose loyalty was suspected, a new enemy suddenly rose up at Lanuvium, a city which until then had been very faithful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Believing that they were now actuated by contempt, on finding the revolt of the Veliterni, who were Roman citizens, to go so long unpunished, the senate decreed that a proposal should be laid before the people, at the earliest possible moment, for declaring war on them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and, to make the plebs readier for this campaign, they appointed five commissioners to divide up the Pomptine land, and three to conduct a colony to Nepete.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They then asked the people for a declaration of war, and notwithstanding the opposition of the plebeian tribunes, all the tribes voted for war.<note>Livy has perhaps made a slip in ascribing this action to the <hi rend="italics">tribes,</hi> as it was regularly the assembly of <hi rend="italics">centuries</hi> which declared war.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Preparations for the campaign were made that year, but owing to the pestilence the army did not take the field. This delay would have given the colonists time to sue the senate for pardon &mdash; and in fact a majority of them were in favour of <pb id="p.271"/>sending an embassy to Rome to make submission &mdash;<note type="marg">B.C. 383</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but danger to the commonwealth was bound up, as often happens, with that of individuals, and the ring-leaders of the revolt were so afraid of the Romans &mdash;lest they alone might be charged with the crime and offered up as a sacrifice to Roman indignation &mdash;that they turned the colonies away from peaceful counsels.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Moreover, not content with merely opposing the embassy in their senate, they egged on a great part of the commons to go out and pillage the Roman lands; and this new outrage destroyed all hope of peace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Praenestines, too, were that year, for the first time, reported as disloyal; evidence against them was given by the Tusculans, the Gabini, and the Labicani, whose borders they had invaded; but the senate returned so mild an answer that it was evident that they refused to believe in the charges because they wished them not to be true.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next year Spurius and Lucius Papirius,<note type="marg">B.C. 382-381</note> the new consular tribunes, led the levies to Velitrae, while their four colleagues, Servius Cornelius Maluginensis (in his third term), Quintus Servilius, Gaius Sulpicius, and Lucius Aemilius (in his fourth term), remained behind to protect the City and to guard against any fresh commotion which might be reported from Etruria &mdash;a quarter from which everything was suspected.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Near Velitrae the Romans defeated an army in which auxiliaries from Praeneste almost outnumbered the colonists themselves; but the city was so close at hand that, as it occasioned their early retreat, so it afforded them their only refuge. The tribunes abstained from attacking the place; they were not certain of succeeding, nor did they think it right to aim at the extermination of the colony.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In <pb id="p.273"/>the letter which they sent to the senate in Rome,<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> announcing the victory, they were more severe upon the enemies from Praeneste than upon those of Velitrae.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And so, by resolution of the senate and popular enactment, war was proclaimed against the people of Praeneste; who, uniting in the following year with the Volsci, attacked the Roman colony of Satricum, and having carried it, despite the obstinate resistance of the colonists, abused their victory by cruel treatment of the captives.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This incensed the Romans, and they elected Marcus Furius Camillus tribune of the soldiers, for the sixth time. To be his colleagues they gave him Aulus and Lucius Postumius Regillensis and Lucius Furius, together with Lucius Lucretius and Marcus Fabius Ambustus.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Volscian war was entrusted, out of the regular course, to Marcus Furius. Of the other tribunes, Lucius Furius was assigned him by lot for his assistant, not so much (it should seem) for the good of the commonwealth, as that he might be the source of all honour to his colleague; who gained it in his public capacity because he made good what the other's rashness had lost, and as a man because he used the error of Lucius to earn his gratitude rather than glory for himself. Camillus was now extremely old.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the election he was prepared to excuse himself by taking the customary oath on the score of health, had not the unanimous wishes of the people prevented him. But a lusty spirit flourished in his sturdy breast, and his senses were as keen as ever; and though he no longer much concerned himself with politics, wars excited him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He enrolled four legions, each of four thousand men, appointed <pb id="p.275"/>the army to assemble on the following day<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> at the Esquiline Gate, and marched on Satricum. There the conquerors of the colony were waiting for him, undismayed, for they confided in their numbers, in which they possessed a considerable superiority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On perceiving the approach of the Romans they formed up at once. It was their purpose to engage immediately in a decisive battle; for so the numerical weakness of their enemies would derive no help from the skill of their unique commander, which constituted &mdash;so they assumed &mdash;their sole reliance.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was the same ardour in the Roman army, and in one of its generals. The hazard of an immediate battle was only postponed by the wisdom and the authority of one man, who sought an opportunity to supplement his resources with strategy, by prolonging the campaign.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This made the enemy the more urgent, and, no longer content with deploying their line before the camp, they advanced into the middle of the field, and, marching up almost to the rampart of the Romans, displayed the proud confidence which their strength gave them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman soldiers were mortified at this, and even more mortified was one of their two tribunes, Lucius Furius. His youth and native disposition made him head strong, and the utterly baseless enthusiasm of the rank and file filled him with assurance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The soldiers were already in a state of excitement, but he further instigated them by disparaging his colleague in the only possible way, on the score of age.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Wars, he insisted, were the province of youth; the growth and decay of the spirit kept pace with those of the body; the most energetic of soldiers was become a procrastinator, and he who had been wont to storm a camp <pb id="p.277"/>or a city on the first approach, was sitting still and<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> wasting time behind intrenchments.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What accession to his own strength did he look for, or what diminution of the enemy's? What opportunity, what favourable moment, what ground for an ambush was he making ready?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The old man's strategy was cold and torpid. But why, though Camillus had had enough both of life and of glory, should they permit the state, which ought to be immortal, to sink into decrepitude in company with the mortal body of one man?</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When he had won over the entire army by these speeches, and the men were everywhere demanding battle, he said to his colleague: <quote>Marcus Furius, we can no longer resist the enthusiasm of the soldiers; and the enemy, whose courage we have augmented by our delay, is insulting us with an arrogance no longer to be endured. Give way, for you are alone against us all, and suffer yourself to be overcome in counsel, that you may overcome the sooner in war.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To this Camillus replied that in the wars which up to that day had been conducted under his sole auspices neither the Roman People nor himself had repented of his strategy or fortune; he was aware that he had now a colleague of equal commission and authority, and of more vigorous years;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and so, although &mdash;as regarded the army &mdash;he was accustomed not to be governed but to govern, yet he had no power to thwart the authority of his associate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Let him proceed, with Heaven's blessing, to do what he thought best for the commonwealth: for his own grey hairs he begged this favour, that he might not be assigned to the front; of such duties as belonged in war to an old man he would not be <pb id="p.279"/>negligent. One thing he entreated of the immortal<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> gods: that no mischance might occur, to make his own appear to have been the wiser plan.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But neither did men heed these salutary words, nor the immortal gods his loyal prayers. The man responsible for the engagement marshalled the battle-line. Camillus provided adequate supports, and stationed a strong out-guard before the camp; he then took up his post on an eminence, and watched intently for the issue of another's strategy. 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the very instant of the first clash of arms the enemy gave ground, not out of fear, but guile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Behind them the ground sloped gently up from the battle-line to their camp; and having plenty of men they had left a few strong cohorts armed and drawn up within the camp, which were to sally forth when the fighting had got under way, and the Romans had approached the rampart.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans pursued the retreating enemy without order, and were drawn into an unfavourable position, where this attack could be made upon them with advantage. Thus the victors were threatened in their turn, and, what with the new foe and the declivity, the Roman line gave way.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were closely pressed by the fresh Volsci who had made the sortie, and those, too, who had pretended flight renewed the battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now the Roman soldiers were no longer retiring in order, but regardless of their late impetuosity and their ancient fame, had turned their backs and were everywhere in full flight towards the camp; when Camillus was lifted into the saddle by his attendants, and rapidly throwing his reserves into the fight, <quote>Soldiers,</quote> he cried, <quote>is this the battle you demanded? What man, what god is there, whom <pb id="p.281"/>you could accuse? Yours was the rashness then,<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> now the infamy is yours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> You have followed another leader: follow now Camillus, and, as your habit is when I am leading, conquer. Why do you look on the rampart and the camp? Not one of you shall find entrance there, save as a victor.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>A sense of shame at first checked their headlong flight; then, as they saw the standards face about and the line form up against the enemy, while their general, distinguished for his many triumphs and rendered venerable by his age, exposed himself at the front amidst the ensigns, where the fighting and the danger were the greatest, they began each and every one to cry out against themselves and their fellows, and their mutual encouragements ran through the entire army in a ringing cheer.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor was the other tribune behindhand, but being sent by his colleague &mdash;who was re-forming the line of foot &mdash;to rally the horse, he did not chide them &mdash;for his share in their fault would have made this of little use &mdash;but turning wholly from commands to entreaties, he besought them one and all to save him from the guilt of that day's mishap, for which he was responsible.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>Notwithstanding,</quote> he said, <quote>the refusal and the opposition of my colleague, I gave my adhesion to the general recklessness in preference to the prudence of one man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Camillus sees glory for himself, whichever way your fortune turns; but I, if the battle is not restored, shall experience the utter misery of sharing with everybody the disaster, while enduring the infamy alone.</quote> It seemed best, as the battle-line was wavering, to dismiss the horses and attack the enemy on foot. Conspicuous for their arms and their courage, they advanced where <pb id="p.283"/>they saw the foot-soldiers hardest pressed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Neither<note type="marg">B.C. 382-381</note> generals nor soldiers relaxed their utmost efforts, and the help afforded by their brave exertions was felt in the result. The Volsci fled in a genuine panic over the ground where they had lately pretended fear. Great numbers of them were slain both in the battle itself and in the flight which followed; the others were cut down in the camp, which was captured in the same charge; but more were made prisoners than were slain.<note>Niebuhr thinks that this battle was a pure invention, for there is no indication that it had any effect: Satricum was not taken, nor was a triumph decreed.</note></p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In taking account of the prisoners, they recognized some as being Tusculans. These were separated from the rest and brought before the tribunes, to whom they confessed, on being questioned, that they had served at the bidding of the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The danger of so near a war disturbed Camillus, who declared that he would straight-way carry the prisoners to Rome, that the Fathers might not be kept in ignorance how the Tusculans had broken the alliance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the meantime he proposed that his colleague should, if agreeable, take charge of the camp and the army. A single day had taught Lucius Furius not to prefer his own to wiser counsels, yet neither he nor anyone in the army supposed that Camillus would condone his fault, which had plunged the commonwealth into such desperate peril;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and everybody, not in the army only, but also in Rome, agreed in saying, that in the ups and downs of the Volscian war, the responsibility for the defeat and flight lay with Lucius Furius, and all the credit for the victory with Camillus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But when the prisoners had been introduced into the senate, and the Fathers, having decided that they must make war on Tusculum, had <pb id="p.285"/>designated Camillus to conduct it, he requested that<note type="marg">B.C. 382-381</note> he might have a single lieutenant to assist him, and being permitted to select any one of his colleagues whom he might desire, contrary to everybody's expectation he selected Lucius Furius &mdash;an instance of magnanimity which, while it lightened the disgrace of his colleague, also brought great honour to himself.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But no war was, in fact, waged with the Tusculans: by their steadfast adherence to peace they saved themselves from violation by the Romans, as they could not have done by resorting to arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the Romans entered their territory, they did not withdraw from the places near the line of march, nor break off their labour in the fields; the gates of their city stood wide open; the citizens, wearing the toga, came out in great numbers to meet the generals;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and provisions for the army were obligingly brought into the camp from the city and the farms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Camillus set up his camp before the gates, and desirous of knowing whether the same aspect of peace prevailed within the walls that was displayed in the country, entered the city and beheld the house-doors open, the shops with their shutters off and all their wares exposed, the craftsmen all busy at their respective trades, the schools buzzing with the voices of the scholars, crowds in the streets, and women and children going about amongst the rest, this way and that, as their several occasions called them &mdash;with
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> never anywhere an indication of surprise, much less of fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He looked everywhere for any visible evidence that a war had been on foot; but there was no sign that anything had been either removed or brought out for the moment; everything looked so undisturbed and <pb id="p.287"/>peaceful that it seemed scarce credible that so much<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> as a rumour of war should have come there.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Overcome therefore by the enemy's submissiveness, he commanded their senate to be called. <quote>Men of Tusculum,</quote> he said, <quote>until now you alone have discovered the right weapons and the right resources with which to defend your possessions from the resentment of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Go to Rome, to the senate; the Fathers will determine whether you have deserved more punishment hitherto or pardon now. I will not forestall them by accepting your gratitude for a favour that must be granted by the state; from me you shall have an opportunity to solicit mercy; the answer to your suit must be such as the senate sees fit to make.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the Tusculans arrived in Rome, and the senators of a people who before had been faithful allies appeared in the vestibule of the Curia, covered with dejection, the Fathers were straightway moved, and in a spirit that had already more in it of hospitality than hostility<note>For a similar play on words see I. lviii. 8.</note> bade them be at once admitted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Tusculan dictator thus addressed them: <quote>Though you declared war on us and invaded our country, Conscript Fathers, we went forth to meet your generals and your legions armed and accoutred exactly as you now behold us standing in the entrance of your senate-house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Such has ever been our garb and the garb of our people &mdash;ay, and ever shall be &mdash;save at such times as we have been armed by you and for your defence. We give thanks to your commanders and your armies, since they have believed their eyes more than their ears, and where they encountered no hostility, themselves have showed none.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The peace we have used towards you, we ask <pb id="p.289"/>of you in return; direct your war, we beseech you,<note type="marg">B. C. 382-381</note> to that quarter where war, if anywhere, exists; if we must try, by suffering, what your arms can achieve against ourselves, we will try unarmed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such is our resolution; Heaven send it be not less fortunate than loyal. As to the charges which stirred you to declare a war, though it skills not to disprove with words what facts have already confuted, still, even were they true, we think we might safely plead guilty to them, since our repentance is so evident. Let men wrong you, so long as you continue worthy to receive such amends.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the honour done you by our confiding in your mercy should outweigh the injury.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this purport was the speech of the Tusculans. They were granted peace for the present, and not long after were even admitted to be citizens. The legions were withdrawn from Tusculum.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Renowned for his strategy and courage<note type="marg">B.C. 380</note> in the Volscian war and his success in the expedition against Tusculum, and for his singular gentleness and generosity on both occasions towards his colleague, Camillus laid down his office, after announcing the election of military tribunes for the ensuing year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The successful candidates were Lucius and Publius Valerius (Lucius for the fifth and Publius for the third time), Gaius Sergius (for the third time), Lucius Menenius (for the second time), Publius Papirius, and Servius Cornelius Maluginensis.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was need also this year of censors, chiefly on account of the uncertain reports which were going about in regard to debt. The tribunes of the plebs even exaggerated the extent of this grievance, whereas it was understated by those who were interested in having it appear that loans were more in danger from the bad faith than the bad fortune of the debtors.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The censors <pb id="p.291"/>chosen were Gaius Sulpicius Camerinus and Spurius<note type="marg">B.C. 380</note> Postumius Regillensis, and they had already set about their task, when it was interrupted by the death of Postumius; for there were religious scruples against replacing the colleague of a censor.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> v. xxxi. 6.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So then, Sulpicius resigned, and other censors were elected, but, owing to a defect in the election, did not serve. The senate could not bring itself to proceed to a third election, being persuaded that the gods would permit no censorship that year.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But this irresolution the tribunes characterized as an intolerable mockery of the plebs. The senate, they said, was seeking to avoid the evidence of witnesses and public records regarding the property of every man, because they were unwilling it should be seen how great was the volume of debt, which would show that half of the state had been ruined by the other half, while the debt-ridden plebs were in the meantime being exposed to one enemy after another;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> wars were now sought indiscriminately, far and wide; from Antium the legions had been marched to Satricum, from Satricum to Velitrae, from there to Tusculum; now it was the Latins, the Hernici and the Praenestini who were threatened with attack, more out of hatred of Rome's citizens than of her enemies. The object was to wear the plebeians out with service and give them no time to take breath in the City, or leisure to bethink them of liberty or to stand in the assembly, where they might sometimes hear the voice of a tribune urging the reduction of interest and the removal of their other grievances.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But if the plebs had the spirit to recall their fathers' liberty, they would allow no Roman citizen to be bound to a creditor, nor any levy to be held, until the amount of <pb id="p.293"/>indebtedness had been examined and a plan for<note type="marg">B.C. 380</note> lessening it put into operation, that every man might know what was his own and what another's, and whether his person was still free, or whether even that was owing to the gaol.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The reward held out to sedition soon brought sedition to a head. For many were being bound over,<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi>, to their creditors, to work out their debts.</note> and the senate had voted to enlist new levies on the rumour of hostilities at Praeneste. Both these proceedings began at the same time to be interfered with by the exercise of the tribunician protection and the common action of the plebs; for the tribunes would not allow those who had been bound over to be led away, nor would the young men give in their names.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The patricians were for the moment less concerned with enforcing the law of debt than with the levy &mdash;not unnaturally, since the enemy were reported as having already set out from Praeneste and encamped in the territory of Gabii &mdash;but
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> on the tribunes of the plebs this intelligence had acted more as an incentive to the struggle they had undertaken than as a deterrent, and the only thing that was able to allay the quarrel in the City was the approach of the enemy to its very walls.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For when the Praenestini were informed that no army had been enrolled in Rome, that there was no one definitely in command, that patricians and plebeians had turned against each other, their leaders
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> concluded that their opportunity had come, and quickly putting their troops in motion, they devastated the fields along their line of march and advanced against the Colline Gate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Great was the consternation in the City. The call to arms was given, and men hurried to the walls and gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They <pb id="p.295"/>had turned at last from domestic strife to war, and<note type="marg">B. C. 380</note> proceeded to make Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus dictator, who named Aulus Sempronius Atratinus master of the horse. No sooner was this known &mdash;so great was the terror the dictatorship inspired &mdash;than the enemy at once withdrew from before the walls, and the Romans of military age assembled without offering objection, in accordance with the edict.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>While the army was being enrolled at Rome, the enemy had gone into camp not far from the Allia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From this centre they pillaged in all directions, and boasted to one another that they had occupied a position that was fraught with fate for the City of Rome; there would be another rout there like the one in the Gallic war; for if the Romans feared a day infected with evil omen and marked it with the name of that place, how much more than the Day of the Allia would they dread the Allia itself, that memorial of their great defeat?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were sure to behold there apparitions of ruthless Gauls, and to have the sound of their voices in their ears. Indulging these idle speculations on idle themes, they had rested their hopes on the fortune of the place.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Romans on the other hand were well assured that wherever their Latin enemy was, he was one whom they had conquered at Lake Regillus and had held in peaceable subjection for a hundred years; a place notorious for the memory of disaster would rather inspire them to wipe out the recollection of the disgrace than cause them to fear that any ground was inauspicious for their victory;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> nay, if the Gauls themselves should confront them on that spot, they would fight as they had fought at Rome in recovering <pb id="p.297"/>their City and on the following day at Gabii, when<note type="marg">B. C. 380</note> they left no enemy who had entered the walls of Rome, to bear home tidings either of weal or woe.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the feelings on either side when the Romans arrived at the Allia. As they came within sight of the enemy, drawn up and eager for the fray, the dictator addressed Sempronius. <quote>Do you see,</quote> he said, <quote>how they have made their stand at the Allia, putting their trust in the fortune of the place? We shall find the immortal gods have given them no surer grounds for confidence nor any more substantial help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But do you confide in arms and valour, and charge their centre at the gallop; I, with the legions, will attack them when they are in disorder and confusion. Be with us, gods of the treaty, and exact the penalties due to you for the injury you have suffered and to us for the deception put upon us in your holy name!</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The men of Praeneste could cope with neither horse nor foot. Their ranks were broken at the first shout and charge; then, as their line yielded at every point, they turned and fled, and in their confusion were carried even beyond their own camp; neither did they check their headlong flight until they had come within sight of Praeneste.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There the scattered remnants of the rout took up a position which lent itself to hasty fortification, lest, if they sought refuge within the walls, they might immediately find the torch put to their crops, and, after losing everything, be subjected to a siege.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But no sooner had the victorious Romans appeared, fresh from plundering the camp on the Allia, than they abandoned these defences also, and, regarding even walls as little enough protection, immured themselves in the town of Praeneste.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There were eight <pb id="p.299"/>other towns which were under the sway of the<note type="marg">B. C. 380</note> Praenestini.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Against these the Romans directed their campaign, and having taken them, with no great exertion, one after the other, marched to Velitrae and stormed that place also.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Coming then to Praeneste, the fountain-head of the war, they got possession of it not by force but through capitulation. Titus Quinctius had gained one pitched battle, captured two camps, taken nine towns by assault, and received the surrender of Praeneste. He returned to Rome bringing with him from Praeneste the image of Jupiter Imperator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This he bore in triumph to the Capitol, where he dedicated it, between the shrine of Jupiter and that of Minerva.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Below it he placed a tablet, in commemoration of his deeds, with an inscription to the following effect: <quote>Jupiter and all the gods granted Titus Quinctius the dictator that he should take nine towns.</quote><note>According to Festus (p. 363) the offering was a golden crown weighing 2 1/3 lbs.</note> On the twentieth day after his appointment he resigned the dictatorship.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the ensuing election of military tribunes<note type="marg">B. C. 379</note> with consular powers, patricians and plebeians came off alike.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of the patricians Publius and Gaius Manlius were successful, along with Lucius Julius; the plebs returned Gaius Sextilius, Marcus Albinius, and Lucius Antistius. The Manlii were superior in birth to their plebeian colleagues, and in popularity to Julius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To them, therefore, by special enactment, without reference to the lot or to mutual agreement, was given the command against the Volsci &mdash;an honour which they rued in the upshot, as did also the senators who had conferred it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Without reconnoitring they sent some troops to forage, and believing them to be cut of, for they had received a false <pb id="p.301"/>report that such was the case, they hastened to<note type="marg">B.C. 379</note> their assistance, without so much as securing the author of the story &mdash;a Latin enemy who had deceived them in the guise of a Roman soldier, &mdash;and plunged into an ambuscade.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While they were making a stand there on unfavourable ground, by the sheer courage of the men, who were selling their lives dearly, the Roman camp which lay in the plain was attacked by the enemy on the opposite side. In both places victory was thrown away by the rashness and ignorance of the generals.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Whatever was left of the good fortune of the Roman People was saved by the pluck of the soldiers, which continued steadfast even when it lacked guidance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the announcement of these events at Rome, it was at first resolved to appoint a dictator; but later, when word came that things were quiet in the Volscian country, and it appeared that the enemy knew not how to use his victory and opportunity, even the armies and commanders which were there were withdrawn, and thereafter there was no trouble as far as the Volsci were concerned;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the only disturbance &mdash;towards the close of the year &mdash;was a mutiny of the Praenestini, who had stirred the peoples of Latium to revolt.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>That same year new colonists were enrolled for Setia, whose inhabitants themselves were complaining of their lack of men. For the ill success of the war there was consolation in the tranquillity at home, which was due to the influence of the plebeian military tribunes and the honour in which their order held them.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following year started off in a blaze<note type="marg">B. C. 378</note> of party strife. The military tribunes with consular powers were Spurius Furius, Quintus Servilius (for <pb id="p.303"/>the second time), Lucius Menenius (for the third),<note type="marg">B. C. 378</note> Publius Cloelius, Marcus Horatius, and Lucius Geganius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Now the subject and reason of the strife was debt. But when Spurius Servilius Priscus and Quintus Cloelius Siculus had been made censors in order that they might investigate the situation, they were prevented from doing so by a war;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for first frightened messengers, and then the country-folk fleeing from the fields, brought word that the Volscian legions had crossed the border, and were everywhere devastating Roman territory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Yet with all this alarm, the danger from abroad was so far from restraining dissensions at home, that on the contrary the tribunes but acted with the greater violence, in exerting their powers to block the levy; until the senate submitted to their terms, and agreed that till the war was finished no one should pay a war-tax or give judgment in a case of debt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The plebs, on obtaining this relief, ceased to obstruct the levy. When the new legions had been enrolled, it was resolved to divide them and form two armies to invade the country of the Volsci. Spurius Furius and Marcus Horatius marched to the right, towards Antium and the coast; Quintus Servilius and Lucius Geganius to the left, in the direction of Ecetra and the mountains.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In neither region did they find the enemy. They accordingly laid waste the country, not in the desultory fashion of the Volsci, who like bandits, trusting in the discord of their foes but fearing their courage, had made a hasty foray in fear and trembling, &mdash;but with a regular army, justly provoked, and the more destructive in that they took more time.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In fact, the Volsci had confined their pillaging to the borders, because of their fear lest an <pb id="p.305"/>army might come out from Rome while they were<note type="marg">B.C. 378</note> at it; the Romans, on the contrary, were partly actuated, in remaining on hostile ground, by the desire of luring the enemy into a battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So they burned all the farm-houses everywhere, and even certain villages, and leaving not a single fruit-tree nor the standing corn with its hope of harvest, they carried off as booty all the men and beasts outside the towns, and led both armies back to Rome.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The debtors had been given a little time<note type="marg">B.C. 377</note> for breathing, but no sooner did hostilities cease than the courts began once more to be alive with prosecutions, and not only was there no prospect of obtaining relief from the old debts, but further debts were incurred through the levying of a tax to build a wall of hewn stone,<note>The reference is probably to a section of the city wall, damaged in the Gallic war.</note> which the censors had contracted for.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To this burden the plebs were forced to submit, in the absence of any levy which their tribunes could obstruct.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The nobles even possessed sufficient influence to oblige the plebs to elect all patricians to the millitary tribunate; these were Lucius Aemilius, Publius Valerius (for the fourth time), Gaius Veturius Servius Sulpicius, Lucius and Gaius Quinctius Cincinnatus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The same influence enabled them to carry through their plans against the Latins and the Volsci, who had united their forces and were encamped near Satricum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No one objected when the men of military age were all compelled to take the oath, and three armies were enrolled: one was intended to defend the City; another was for use in sudden expeditions, if a revolt should break out anywhere; a third &mdash;much the strongest &mdash;marched to Satricum, under Publius Valerius and Lucius Aemilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There they found the <pb id="p.307"/>enemy drawn up in a strong position, and at once<note type="marg">B.C. 377</note> attacked them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and though victory was not yet assured, yet the battle was in a hopeful state, when great gusts of wind brought on a heavy downpour of rain and interrupted it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Next day the combat was renewed, and for some little time the enemy &mdash;particularly the Latin legions, schooled in Roman discipline by their long alliance &mdash;resisted with equal courage and success. But the cavalry were sent against them and threw their ranks into confusion, and before they could recover, the infantry were upon them;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> in proportion as the Roman line advanced, was the enemy forced out of his position; and when once the tide of battle turned, there was no stopping the onrush of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The routed enemy made for Satricum, two miles away, instead of their camp, and suffered great slaughter, especially at the hands of the cavalry. Their camp was taken and sacked. The night after the battle they fled rather than marched towards Antium; and though the Roman army followed hard after, fear proved swifter than wrath.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So the enemy got within the walls before the Romans could harass or delay their rear. A few days were then consumed in ravaging the land, since the Romans had not enough equipment to attack the walls, nor the enemy to risk a battle.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A quarrel now broke out between the Antiates and the Latins. The men of Antium, overwhelmed by their misfortunes and worn out by a war which had lasted from their birth to their old age<note>These words are really applicable to the Volsci in general, but not to the Antiates in particular. In &sect; 4 the word <hi rend="italics">Volscos</hi>is used as though equivalent to <hi rend="italics">Antiates.</hi></note> were minded to capitulate:
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Latins had but just revolted after a long peace; their spirits were still fresh; and they meant to continue boldly with <pb id="p.309"/>the war. The dispute came to an end as soon as<note type="marg">B.C. 377</note> each party saw that the other could not prevent it in any way from carrying out its policy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Latins departed, and freed themselves from all share in what they considered a degrading peace; the Antiates, being rid of inconvenient witnesses to their salutary measures, surrendered their city and lands to the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The frenzied wrath of the Latins sought relief &mdash;since they could neither do the Romans any injury in war nor retain the Volsci under arms &mdash;in burning Satricum, the town which had been their first place of refuge after their defeat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They applied the torch without discrimination both to sacred and to secular buildings, and not one escaped destruction, except the temple of Mater Matuta;<note>An ancient Italian deity worshipped by matrons and having to do with birth, and perhaps with the dawn. She had a temple in Rome and in Praeneste, and appears to have been the principal god of Satricum.</note> from this they were kept away, according to the story, neither by their own scruples, nor by their reverence for the gods, but by an awe-inspiring voice that issued from the temple and threatened dire retribution if they did not remove those impious fires to a distance from the sacred walls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Crazed and infuriated, a sudden impulse carried them to Tusculum. They were angry that the Tusculans had deserted the common council of the Latins and had yielded themselves to be not only allies but citizens of Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The gates were open, for their attack was unexpected, and the first shout had not died away when the town was taken, all except the citadel. To this the townsfolk fled for safety, with their wives and children, and sent off messengers to Rome to let the senate know of their predicament.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With a promptness worthy of the honour of the Roman People, an army marched to Tusculum, commanded by the military tribunes Lucius Quinctius <pb id="p.311"/>and Servius Sulpicius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They found the gates of<note type="marg">B. C. 377</note> Tusculum closed and the Latins at once besiegers and besieged; on the one hand they were defending the walls of the town, on the other assailing the fortress, and they experienced themselves the same terror they inspired.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The arrival of the Romans produced a change in the spirits of both sides: the Tusculans were roused from the depths of despair to the greatest cheerfulness; the Latins, who had felt almost certain that since the town was theirs they would soon possess the citadel, were reduced almost to despair of their own lives.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Tusculans in the citadel gave a cheer and were answered by one much louder from the Roman army. On both sides the Latins were hard pressed: they could neither resist the charges of the townsmen, as they rushed down from above, nor drive back the Romans, who were coming up under the walls and forcing the bars of the gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The walls were first scaled and captured; then the fastenings of the gates were burst. The Latins were caught between two enemies, who assailed them hotly in front and rear; they had no strength to fight and no room to escape, and were slain where they stood, to the very last man. Having recovered Tusculum from its enemies, the army returned to Rome.</p> 
			<p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But in proportion as the successful wars of that year had everywhere secured tranquillity abroad, in the City the violence of the patricians and the sufferings of the plebs were increasing from one day to another, since the very fact that payment was compulsory made it more difficult to pay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so, now that a man could make no compensation with his property, his reputation and his person <pb id="p.313"/>were made over and assigned to his creditor by way<note type="marg">B. C. 377</note> of satisfaction, and punishment had come to take the place of payment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So abject indeed was the surrender not only of the lowest of the plebs but even of their leaders, that, far from contending with patricians for the military tribuneship &mdash;a
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> privilege for which they had striven with such energy &mdash;there was not a man of them of sufficient force and enterprise to seek or to administer the plebeian magistracies. The patricians seemed therefore to have regained possession in perpetuity of an office which the plebeians had merely assumed for some few years.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>That this state of affairs might not inspire excessive joy in the patricians, a trivial cause &mdash;as often happens &mdash;set on foot a mighty change. Marcus Fabius Ambustus<note>Father of the three envoys to the Gauls whose story is told at v. xxxv.-xxxvi.</note> was very influential, not only amongst his fellows, but with the plebs as well, for the members of that class felt that he was far from looking down upon it. This man had married his two daughters, the elder to Servius Sulpicius, the younger to Gaius Licinius Stolo, a man of mark, albeit a plebeian; and the very fact that he had not rejected such an alliance had won regard for Fabius with the common people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It fell out that the sisters Fabia were together in the house of Servius Sulpicius, then a consular tribune, and were whiling away the time in talk, as women will, when a lictor of Sulpicius, who was returning from the Forum, rapped on the door, in the usual manner, with his rod. At this the younger Fabia, being unused to the custom, went white, which made the elder laugh with surprise at her sister's ignorance. But that laugh rankled in the other's mind, for a woman's feelings <pb id="p.315"/>are influenced by trifles.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I suppose, too, that the<note type="marg">B.C. 37</note> crowd of people who attended the tribune and took a ceremonious leave of him made her look upon her sister's marriage as a fortunate one and regret her own, in that ill-judging spirit which makes us all so very loath to be outdone by our nearest friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> She was still suffering from the smart of wounded pride, when her father, happening to see her, asked if anything was wrong.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> She would fain have concealed the reason of her grief, which was too little consistent with sisterly affection and did no great honour to her husband; but he brought her by tender inquiries to confess that she was unhappy in being mated to one beneath her, having married into a house where neither dignities nor influence could enter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ambustus then comforted his daughter and bade her be of good cheer: she would see ere long in her own home the same state she beheld at her sister's.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> From that moment he began to make plans with his son-in-law, taking into their counsels also Lucius Sextius, a strenuous youth, whose aspirations were thwarted only by his lack of patrician blood.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>An opportunity for innovation was<note type="marg">B.C. 375-371</note> presented by the enormous load of debt, which the plebs could have no hope of lightening but by placing their representatives in the highest offices.<note>Livy has omitted the military tribunes for A.U.C. 378 = B.C. 376.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They therefore argued that they must gird themselves to think of this: with toil and effort the plebeians had already advanced so far that it was in their power, if they continued to exert themselves, to reach the highest ground, and to equal the patricians in honours as well as in worth.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the present it was resolved that Gaius Licinius and <pb id="p.317"/>Lucius Sextius should be elected tribunes of the<note type="marg">B.C. 375-379</note> plebs, a magistracy in which they might open for themselves a way to the other distinctions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Once elected, they proposed only such measures as abated the influence of the patricians, while forwarding the interests of the plebs. One of these had to do with debt, providing that what had been paid as interest should be deducted from the original sum, and the remainder discharged in three annual instalments of equal size.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A second set a limit on lands, prohibiting anyone from holding more than five hundred <hi rend="italics">iugera.</hi><note>This law appears to have had reference only to the public lands. The reduction of excessive holdings was intended to make the land accommodate a large number of poorer tenants. In the year <date value="-357">357 B.C.</date> Licinius was punished for transgressing his own law (vii. xvi. 9).</note> A third did away with the election of military tribunes, and prescribed that of the consuls one, at any rate, should be chosen from the plebs. These were all matters of great moment, and it would not be possible to carry them without a tremendous struggle.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now when all the things that men immoderately covet, lands, money, and promotion, were jeopardized at once, the patricians became thoroughly alarmed; and failing, after frightened conference in public and private gatherings, to devise any other remedy than that veto which they had already tried before in many struggles, provided themselves with friends amongst the colleagues of the tribunes, to oppose their measures.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These men, seeing Licinius and Sextius summon the tribes to vote, came up in the midst of a body-guard of patricians, and refused to permit the bills to be recited or anything else to be done that was usual in passing a resolution of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And now the assembly had been summoned repeatedly without avail, and the rogations were as though they had been voted down, when Sextius cried out, <quote>So be it! Since it is your pleasure that <pb id="p.319"/>the intercession should be so powerful, we will use<note type="marg">B.C. 375-371</note> that very weapon for the protection of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Come now, senators, and proclaim an assembly for the choice of military tribunes; I warrant you shall have no joy of that word <hi rend="italics">veto,</hi> which you now hear with such satisfaction from the chorus of our colleagues.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His threats were no idle ones: except for the aediles and tribunes of the plebs, there was not an election held. Licinius and Sextius were chosen again, and suffered no curule magistrates to be elected; and this dearth of magistrates continued in the City for five years, while the plebs continued to re-elect the two men tribunes, and they to prevent the election of military tribunes.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was fortunately a respite from<note type="marg">B.C. 370-369</note> other wars, but the colonists of Velitrae, growing insolent in time of peace, because they knew that the Romans had no army, not only made several incursions into Roman territory, but went so far as to lay siege to Tusculum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This circumstance affected not only the senators but even the plebeians; that the Tusculans, who had long been their friends and were now their fellow citizens, should be imploring aid filled them with shame.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes of the plebs relaxing their opposition, elections were held by an interrex, which resulted in the choice of the following military tribunes: Lucius Furius, Aulus Manlius, Servius Sulpicius, Servius Cornelius, and Publius and Gaius Valerius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They found the plebs much less submissive to the levy than they had been to the election; but by strenuous efforts they enrolled an army, and, marching out, not only drove the enemy away from
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Tusculum, but even shut him up within his own walls, and Velitrae was besieged with far <pb id="p.321"/>more vigour than Tusculum had been. Yet those<note type="marg">B. C. 370-369</note> who had begun the siege were not able to conclude it before the election of new military tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The candidates chosen were Quintus Servilius, Gaius Veturius, Aulus and Marcus Cornelius, Quintus Quinctius, and Marcus Fabius. Even these tribunes accomplished nothing memorable at Velitrae.</p> 
			<p>At home the situation was more dangerous.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For besides Sextius and Licinius, who had proposed the laws and were now for the eighth time re-elected tribunes of the plebs, the military tribune Fabius, Stolo's father-in-law, was openly advocating the adoption of the measures he had himself suggested.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And whereas there had been at first eight members of the college of plebeian tribunes who opposed the bills, there were now but five; and these, puzzled and confounded, as is apt to be the case with men who forsake their party, were no more than mouthpieces, repeating in justification of their vetoes only what they had been privately schooled to say, to wit, that a majority of the plebeians were absent at Velitrae with the army;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and that the assemblies ought to be put off until the return of the soldiers, so that the entire body of the plebs might vote on matters that concerned them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Sextius and Licinius, with some of their colleagues and one of the military tribunes, Fabius, being experts now &mdash;after so many years of practice &mdash;in the art of playing on the passions of the commons, would bring the leading senators forward and ply them with questions about each of the measures they were laying before the people: Had they the hardihood to demand that, when land was being assigned to the plebs in parcels of two <hi rend="italics">iugera,</hi> they themselves should be authorized to hold more <pb id="p.323"/>than five hundred <hi rend="italics">iugera?</hi>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Did they desire that single<note type="marg">B.C. 370-369</note> patricians should possess the allotments of almost three hundred citizens; and that the plebeian should have a farm scarce large enough to contain a shelter for his necessities or a place of burial?
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Or was it their wish that the plebs, undone with usury, should give up their bodies to imprisonment and torture, instead of paying the principal sums they owed? Did they mean every day to drag off gangs of condemned debtors from the Forum? to fill with prisoners the houses of the nobles? to make of every patrician's dwelling a private gaol?</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The shame and pity of these conditions awoke more indignation in their hearers, who feared for their own safety, than the speakers had themselves felt in denouncing them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And yet the patricians &mdash;as they proceeded to assert &mdash;would never check their greed for land, nor cease murdering the plebs with usury, until the commons should elect one of the two consuls from their own number, to guard their liberties.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Contempt, they argued, was now become the portion of the plebeian tribunes, for they used the veto to break down their own power.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There could be no question of equal rights, where the other side commanded and they themselves could do nothing but protest. Until they shared in the authority,<note><hi rend="italics">Imperium,</hi>which the tribunes of the plebs did not possess.</note> the plebs would never have an equal footing in the state. And let no one think that it would be sufficient if plebeians were accepted as candidates at the consular elections: unless it were required that at least one consul must be chosen from the commons, none ever would be.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Had they already forgotten, that although the election of tribunes of the soldiers rather than <pb id="p.325"/>consuls had been resolved upon, expressly in order<note type="marg">B.C. 370-369</note> that the highest honour might be open even to plebeians, yet for four and forty years no commoner had been chosen to that office?
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> How could they suppose, that with two places only now available, the patricians would of their own volition bestow the office on the plebs, when they had habitually claimed eight places in electing military tribunes? Would those men allow the consulship to be approached, who had blocked so long the road to the tribuneship?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The law must make good for them what they could not gain by favour at the elections; one of the two consulships must be set apart for the undisputed use of the plebs, for if left in dispute it would always fall a prize to the more powerful.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Neither could it any longer be maintained &mdash;as the nobles had been wont to assert &mdash; that among the plebeians were none who were suitable for curule magistracies. Had the public administration been a jot more indifferent or slipshod since the tribuneship of Publius Licinius Calvus, who was the first man elected from the plebs,<note>In <date value="-400">400 B.C.</date> (v. xii. 9).</note> than it had been during those years in which none but patricians had been military tribunes?
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nay, on the contrary, several patricians had been impeached after holding the tribuneship, but not one plebeian. Quaestors, too, like military tribunes, had begun a few years before to be elected from the commons, nor had the Roman People regretted it in a single case.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consulship remained for the commons to achieve; this was the citadel of liberty, this its pillar. If they attained to this, then would the Roman People hold that the kings had been really driven from the City, and their freedom <pb id="p.327"/>firmly based;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> for the commons would thenceforward<note type="marg">B.C. 319-369</note> be partakers in all that made the patricians now surpass them, &mdash;authority and honour, martial renown, birth and nobility,<note>The nobles were those who had held &mdash;or whose ancestors had held &mdash;curule chairs. Originally nobility had been confined to the patriciate, with which, indeed &mdash;since most patrician families could point to some office-holding ancestor,  &mdash;it had been practically identical. The new nobility comprised plebeians as well as patricians, and owing to the tendency of the electorate to continue the same families in office, it became almost as exclusive a body as the old patriciate.</note> &mdash;great things for themselves to enjoy, but even greater to bequeath to their children.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Perceiving that speeches of this sort were well received, they introduced a new measure, providing that in place of two men vested with superintendence of the sacred rites, a board of ten should be elected, with a proviso that half the number should be of the plebs, and half patricians; the voting on all these bills they deferred until the return of the army which was besieging Velitrae.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A year rolled round before the legions<note type="marg">B. C. 368</note> could be brought back from Velitrae; consequently the question of the laws remained in abeyance and was put off until the coming in of the new military tribunes; for as to the tribunes of the plebs, the commons chose the same men over again &mdash;the two, at any rate, who had brought in the bills.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The military tribunes chosen were Titus Quinctius, Servius Cornelius, Servius Sulpicius, Spurius Servilius, Lucius Papirius, and Lucius Veturius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the very outset of the year came a final struggle over the laws; and when the tribes were summoned to vote, and the proposers of the measures would not yield to the vetoes of their colleagues, the frightened patricians were put to their two last shifts &mdash;the greatest office, and the greatest of the citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They voted to name a dictator, and appointed Marcus Furius Camillus, who chose Lucius Aemilius for his master of the horse. To meet these formidable preparations of their adversaries, the proposers <pb id="p.329"/>of the laws on their side armed the commons with<note type="marg">B.C. 368</note> tremendous enthusiasm for the cause, and proclaiming a council of the plebs, called up the tribes to vote.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Attended by a body of patricians, and breathing wrath and menaces, the dictator took his seat, and the affair began with the usual skirmish between the tribunes of the plebs, some of whom urged the passing of the law while others interposed their vetoes. But powerful as the veto was on the legal side, it was being overcome by the popularity of the bills themselves and their proposers, and the tribes which had been summoned first were voting <quote>Ay,</quote> when Camillus addressed the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <quote>Quirites,</quote> he said, <quote>since you are now swayed not by the authority of the tribunes but by their lawlessness, and are bringing to naught the right of protest &mdash;obtained through the secession of the plebs &mdash;with the same violence with which you won it; for your own sake no less than for the sake of tile whole republic, I shall, as dictator, sustain the veto, and safeguard with my absolute authority your defence which you are overthrowing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If then Gaius Licinius and Lucius Sextius yield to the protest of their colleagues, I will in no way intrude a patrician magistracy upon a council of the plebs; but if, in defiance of the protest, they try to impose their terms, as though upon a conquered state, I will not permit the tribunician power to work its own undoing.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>This warning the tribunes treated with contempt, and were proceeding with unabated energy to carry out their plans, when Camillus, in high dudgeon, sent his lictors to turn the commons out; and threatened, that if they continued in their course, he would <pb id="p.331"/>administer the oath to all of military age, and<note type="marg">B.C. 368</note> forthwith lead the army out of the City.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The plebs were greatly dismayed; but the courage of their leaders was rather kindled than damped by his vehemence. Yet before the matter had been decided either way, Camillus resigned his office, whether because there had been a flaw in his election &mdash;as certain writers have held &mdash;or because the tribunes proposed to the plebs and the plebs decreed, that if Marcus Furius should take any action in the capacity of dictator, he should be fined five hundred thousand asses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But that the auspices, and not a law without a precedent, were responsible for his withdrawal, the very nature of the man inclines me to believe; also the fact that Publius Manlius was at once made dictator in his place &mdash;for what good would his appointment do, in a struggle in which Marcus Furius had been beaten?
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Besides, Marcus Furius himself was dictator again in the following year, and he would surely have been ashamed to resume an authority which had broken down in his own hands the year before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Moreover at the time when the proposal to fine him is said to have been made, either he had the power to resist this order &mdash;which
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> deprived him, as he could see, of all authority, &mdash;or else he lacked the power to obstruct even those measures in defence of which this order had been proposed. Finally, whatever conflicts have occurred between tribunes and consuls, down to the times we can ourselves remember, the dictatorship has always towered above them.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the interval between the abdication of the earlier dictator and the entrance upon his office of the new one, Manlius, the tribunes &mdash;as <pb id="p.333"/>though there were an interregnum<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the consular tribunes counted for nothing, and the tribunes of the plebs could proceed without let or hindrance.</note> &mdash;held a council<note type="marg">B.C. 368</note> of the plebs, and it became evident which of the measures proposed were more acceptable to the plebeians, and which to their introducers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the tribes were on the point of passing the bills relating to interest and land, and of rejecting the one about the plebeian consul, and both policies would have been finally
				<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> disposed of, if the tribunes had not said that they were putting all these questions to the plebs collectively.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then Publius Manlius, becoming dictator, gave the affair a turn in favour of the plebs by naming Gaius Licinius,<note>Not the tribune of the plebs, but possibly his father. Livy perhaps included him among the consular tribunes for <date value="-378">378 B.C.</date> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. xxxi. &sect; 1; where the text is uncertain) or should have included him among those for the year <date value="-376">376 B.C.</date>, but has omitted the entire list (chap. xxxiv). <hi rend="italics">Diod.</hi> xv. 57, gives Gaius Licinius as one of four consular tribunes for the year <date value="-378">378 B.C.</date></note> who had been military tribune and was a commoner, his master of the horse. I find that the patricians took offence at this, but that the dictator was wont to excuse himself to them by alleging his close relationship to Licinius, and asserting that a master of the horse possessed no greater authority than a consular tribune.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Licinius and Sextius, when an assembly had been proclaimed for the election of plebeian tribunes, so bore themselves that while professing an unwillingness to be re-elected, they furnished the plebs with the strongest incentives to give them what they pretended not to covet.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They said it was now nine years that they had stood embattled, as it were, against the optimates, with the greatest danger to themselves and no advantage to the public.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The measures they had proposed and the whole power of the tribunate had, like themselves, grown old and useless. First the intercession of their colleagues had been employed to attack their laws; then the young men had been banished to the seat of war at Velitrae; finally they had themselves been menaced <pb id="p.335"/>with the thunderbolt of the dictatorship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At present<note type="marg">B.C. 368</note> they were thwarted neither by their colleagues, nor by war, nor even by the dictator, for he had actually given them a presage of plebeian consuls by appointing a plebeian master of the horse:
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> no, it was the plebs themselves who stood in the way of their own advancement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A City and a Forum rid of creditors, and lands delivered from unlawful occupation, were things they might enjoy at once, if they would. When, pray, did they expect to weigh these blessings and be duly grateful, if at the very moment of entertaining measures for their own advantage they cut off all hope of office from the men who introduced them? It was not like the reasonableness of the Roman People to ask to be relieved themselves of usury and settled on lands which the nobles had unjustly held, while leaving the men to whom they owed these advantages to grow old as tribunicians &mdash;not only without honours, but even without the hope of them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So let them first make up their minds what it was they wished; and then declare their wishes at the election of the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If they desired to enact together the measures which the tribunes had brought forward, there was some reason for re-electing them; for they would carry through what they had advocated; but if every man cared only for the adoption of such clauses as concerned him personally, there was no use in an invidious prolongation of their term; they would do without the tribuneship, and the people would do without the proposed reforms.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On hearing the tribunes make this stubborn speech, though the other senators were dazed and dumbfounded by such outrageous arguments, they
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> <pb id="p.337"/>say that Appius Claudius Crassus, the decemvir's<note type="marg">B.C. 368</note> grandson, moved more by hate and resentment than by hope, came forward to oppose them, and spoke to the following purpose:
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> "It would be no strange or surprising thing to me, Quirites, if on this occasion I, too, should be taunted with the one reproach that rebellious tribunes have ever directed at our family, to wit, that the Claudian gens from its very origin has regarded no feature of our public life as more important than the majesty of the senate and has always opposed the interests of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The former of these charges I neither deny nor seek to refute &mdash;namely, that we have striven with all our might, from the day we were first called to be citizens and senators,<note>See ii. xvi. 4-5.</note> that, so far as in us lay, the dignity of those families with which you proposed to rank us might truthfully be said to have rather gained than lost;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> as to the other charge, I would venture to maintain, Quirites, speaking for myself and for my forefathers, that unless one should assume that what is done for the good of the whole nation is opposed to the welfare of the plebs, &mdash;as though they inhabited another city, &mdash;we have never wittingly done anything, whether as private citizens or magistrates, disadvantageous to the plebs; and that no word or act of ours can be truthfully alleged as being against your interests, though some there may have been which ran counter to your wishes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But were I not a Claudius, nor sprung from a patrician line, but were merely any one of the Quirites, assuming only that I knew my parents had both been born to freedom and that I lived in a free state, could I pass this by in silence?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Are Lucius Sextius yonder and Gaius Licinius, our perpetual tribunes &mdash; <pb id="p.339"/>save the mark! &mdash;grown so presumptuous in the nine<note type="marg">B. C. 368</note> years of their reign, as to threaten that they will leave you free to exercise your right of suffrage neither in elections nor in enacting laws?</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>"' On a certain condition,' says one of them, ' you shall elect us tribunes for the tenth time '; as though he were to say,' What others sue for we are so surfeited withal that we will not accept it without a great reward.'
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But what in short is that reward by the grant of which we may always have you for tribunes of the plebs? ' That you adopt,' says he, 'all our rogations in a lump, whether you like them or detest them, &mdash;be they good or bad.'
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I beseech you, Tarquin tribunes of the plebs,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi> tribunes as tyrannical as the Tarquin kings.</note> imagine me a simple citizen calling out from the midst of the assembly, ' By your good leave, suffer us to choose from these proposals those we regard as wholesome for us, and to reject the rest.'
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> 'No,' he answers, 'you shall not have leave to enact the measures that concern you all, touching interest and lands, unless you will put up with the monstrous sight in Rome of Lucius Sextius and Gaius Licinius here as consuls &mdash;an idea you loathe and abominate; &mdash;accept everything, or I offer nothing.'
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As though a man were starving, and one should serve poison to him with his food, and command him either to abstain from what would give him life, or mix the deadly with the life-giving. Well then! If this state were free, would not the people have cried out to you in full assembly, 'Begone, with your tribuneships and your rogations!' Come! If you will not propose what is profitable to the people to accept, shall there be none to do it?
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Suppose that some patrician, or &mdash;what those fellows would make out to be still more hateful &mdash;some <pb id="p.341"/>Claudius, should say, ' Either take all or I will propose<note type="marg">B.C. 368</note> nothing,' which of you, Quirites, would endure it?
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Will you never choose rather to look at facts than at advocates, but always lend ready ears to the utterances of that noble magistrate, and refuse to hear what is said by any of us?</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>"<hi rend="italics">His language,</hi> you will admit, is far from appropriate in a free state; well, what of his <hi rend="italics">rogation,</hi> which they resent your refusal to accept? Quirites, it is all of a piece with his words. ' I propose,' he says, 'that it shall not be permitted you to choose such consuls as you will.'
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For can aught else be his meaning, when he commands that in any case one consul be chosen from the plebs, and deprives you of the power to name two patricians?
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> If wars should arise in these days, like the Etruscan war, when Porsinna held Janiculum, or like the Gallic war a little while ago, when all this City &mdash;except the Capitol and the Citadel &mdash;was in the hands of your enemies; and if Lucius Sextius were standing for the consulship, along with Marcus Furius here, and any other patrician whomsoever; could you endure that Lucius Sextius should be certain of election, while Camillus had to risk defeat?
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Is it thus they would equalize the opportunities of office? Would they authorize the election of two plebeian consuls, and forbid the choice of two patricians? Must we perforce take one plebeian, while for both places we may pass the patricians by? What sort of fellowship, of partnership, is this? Are you not satisfied to get a part of that in which you had no part before, unless in reaching for the part you can seize the whole?

				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Satisfied with their victory, the plebs gave way to the patricians, and relinquishing for the moment discussion about the consuls, permitted the election of military tribunes. Those chosen were Aulus and Marcus Cornelius (for their second terms), Marcus Geganius, Publius Manlius, Lucius Veturius, and (for the sixth time) Publius Valerius.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Rome's foreign relations were now peaceful everywhere except for the siege of Velitrae &mdash;the result of which, though delayed, was scarce in doubt &mdash;when a sudden rumour of a Gallic war drove the state to appoint Marcus Furius to his fifth dictatorship.

				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Claudius<note>Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius, the annalist, <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Vol. I., introd., p. xxx, and note 2.</note> relates that the<note type="marg">B.C. 367</note> battle with the Gauls took place that year near the river Anio; and that this was the occasion of the famous duel on the bridge in which Titus Manlius slew a Gaul who had challenged him to combat, and despoiled him of his chain, while the two armies looked on.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But I am more inclined to believe, with the majority of our authorities, that this exploit took place no less than ten years later,<note>Livy himself narrates the episode as having occurred <hi rend="italics">six</hi> years later cf. Book VII. chapters ix-x. (<date value="-361">361 B.C.</date>).</note> and that in the year of which I am now writing, the dictator, Marcus Furius, fought a battle against the Gauls on Alban soil.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Notwithstanding the great terror occasioned by the invasion of the Gauls and the recollection of their old defeat, the Romans gained a victory that was neither difficult nor uncertain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many thousands of barbarians fell in battle, and many after the camp was taken. The others roamed about, making mostly towards Apulia, and owed their escape from the Romans to their distant flight and the dispersion which resulted from their panic and their straggling.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The dictator was awarded a triumph with the consent of both senate and plebs.</p> 
			<p>Hardly had Camillus brought the war to an end, when he was confronted with a fiercer opposition in the City. After desperate struggles the senate and the dictator were beaten, and the measures advocated by the tribunes were adopted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> An election of consuls was held, against the wishes of the nobles, and resulted in the choice of Lucius Sextius, the first of the plebeians to attain that honour. Even this did not end their disputes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The patricians declared that they would not ratify the election, and the affair had almost led to a <pb id="p.351"/>secession of the plebs and threatened other terrible<note type="marg">B.C. 367</note> embroilments, when the dictator finally proposed a compromise which allayed the discord; the nobles gave way to the plebs in regard to the plebeian consul, and the plebs conceded to the nobles that they might elect from the patricians one praetor to administer justice in the City.<note>This step was made necessary by the growth of the City and the increasing burden laid upon the consuls; but, as Livy intimates, it also served as partial compensation to the patricians for the privileges they were now forced to share with the plebs-until, in <date value="-337">337 B.C.</date> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> VIII. xv. 9), the praetorship, too, was thrown open to the plebs.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus after their long quarrel the orders were reconciled at last.

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year will stand out as the one in which a<note type="marg">B.C. 366-365</note> <quote>new man</quote> held the consulship, and also for the establishment of two new magistracies, the praetorship and the curule aedileship. These dignities the patricians had devised for themselves, to compensate them for the second consulship, which they had granted to the commons.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The plebs bestowed their consulship on Lucius Sextius, by whose law it had been won. The patricians, through their influence in the Campus Martius,<note>Where the voting took place.</note> obtained the praetorship for Spurius Furius Camillus, the son of Marcus, and the aedileship for Gnaeus Quinctius Capitolinus and Publius Cornelius Scipio, who belonged to their own houses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Lucius Aemilius Mamercus was chosen from the patricians as colleague of Lucius Sextius. Early in the year there was some talk about the Gauls &mdash;who having at first scattered through Apulia were now rumoured to be gathering &mdash;and about a defection on the part of the Hernici.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The patricians purposely deferred all action, in order that the plebeian consul might have no hand in anything;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> it seemed from the general hush and lack of bustle as though a cessation of the courts had been proclaimed; save that the tribunes would not suffer it to pass in silence that the nobles, in return for one plebeian consul, had got three patrician magistrates for themselves, who wore the purple-bordered toga and sat, like consuls, <pb id="p.359"/>in curule chairs, while the praetor even dealt out<note type="marg">B.C. 366-365</note> justice &mdash;having
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> been elected as a colleague to the consuls and under the same auspices. In consequence of this criticism the senate was ashamed to order that the curule aediles be chosen from the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first it was arranged to take them from the plebs in alternate years: later the election was thrown open without distinction.</p> 
			<p>Then came the consulship of Lucius Genucius and Quintus Servilius. There was neither party strife nor war to disturb the peace, but lest there should ever be freedom from fear and danger, a great pestilence broke out.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is stated that a censor, a curule aedile, and three plebeian tribunes died, with a correspondingly large number from the rest of the population. But what chiefly made this pestilence noteworthy was the death of Marcus Furius, who, though ripe in years, was bitterly regretted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For he was truly a man of singular excellence whether in good or evil fortune; foremost in peace and in war before his banishment, and in exile even more distinguished, whether one thinks of the yearning of his countrymen who called on him in his absence to save their captured City, or of the success with which on being restored to his country he restored the country itself at the same time;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> after this for five and twenty years &mdash;for he survived so long &mdash;he maintained his glorious reputation, and was deemed worthy of being named next after Romulus, as Rome's second Founder.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The pestilence lasted during both this and the<note type="marg">B.C. 364</note> following year, the consulship of Gaius Sulpicius Peticus and Gaius Licinius Stolo.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the latter year nothing memorable occurred, except that with the <pb id="p.361"/>object of appeasing the divine displeasure they made<note type="marg">B.C. 364</note> <hi rend="italics">a lectisternium,</hi> or banquet to the gods, being the third in the history of the City;<note>The first lectisternium was in 399 B.., and is described at v. xiii. 5 sq. The second is not mentioned by Livy. It may have occurred in 392 (v. xxxi. 5).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and when neither human wisdom nor the help of Heaven was found to mitigate the scourge, men gave way to superstitious fears, and, amongst other efforts to disarm the wrath of the gods, are said also to have instituted scenic entertainments.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was a new departure for a warlike people, whose only exhibitions had been those of the circus; but indeed it began in a small way, as most things do, and even so was imported from abroad.<note>Livy distinguishes five stages in the development of scenic entertainments: (1) dances, accompanied by the flute; (2) improvisation of rude verses in addition to the music and dancing; (3) medleys, of a musical character, accompanied by flute and dance; (4) the comedy with a regular plot, special singers for the lyric parts, etc.; (5) the addition of an after-play, <hi rend="italics">exodium</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Atellana.</hi> With this account, Horace, <hi rend="italics">Epistles</hi> II. i. 139 ff. should be compared.</note> Without any singing, without imitating the action of singers, players who had been brought in from Etruria danced to the strains of the flautist and performed not ungraceful evolutions in the Tuscan fashion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next the young Romans began to imitate them, at the same time exchanging jests in uncouth verses, and bringing their movements into a certain harmony with the words.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so the amusement was adopted, and frequent use kept it alive. The native professional actors were called <hi rend="italics">histriones,</hi> from <hi rend="italics">ister,</hi> the Tuscan word for player; they no longer &mdash;as before &mdash;alternately
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> threw off rude lines hastily improvised, like the Fescennines,<note>The name was derived by the ancients either from Fescennia, a place in Etruria, or from <hi rend="italics">fascinum,</hi> a phallic symbol.</note> but performed medleys, full of musical measures, to melodies which were now written out to go with the flute, and with appropriate gesticulation.</p> <pb id="p.363"/>
			<p>Livius<note>Livius Andronicus, a Greek captured at Tarentum, produced the first translation of a Greek play into Latin, in <date value="-240">240 B.C.</date></note> was the first, some years later, to abandon<note type="marg">B.C.</note> 364 <hi rend="italics">saturae</hi> and compose a play with a plot.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Like everyone else in those days, he acted his own pieces; and the story goes that when his voice, owing to the frequent demands made upon it, had lost its freshness, he asked and
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> obtained the indulgence to let a boy stand before the flautist to sing the monody, while he acted it himself, with a vivacity of gesture that gained considerably from his not having to use his voice.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From that time on actors began to use singers to accompany their gesticulation, reserving only the dialogue parts for their own delivery. When this type of performance had begun to wean
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the drama from laughter and informal jest, and the play had gradually developed into art, the young men abandoned the acting of comedies to professionals and revived the ancient practice of fashioning their nonsense into verses and letting fly with them at one another; this was the source of the after-plays which came later to be called <hi rend="italics">exodia,</hi> and were usually combined with Atellan farces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Atellan was a species of comedy acquired from the Oscans,<note>Atella was a little town in Campania. <hi rend="italics">Atellanae</hi> were coarse farces presenting certain stock characters, Maccus. Pappus, Bucco, and Dossenus. The Oscans were a branch of the Samnites and lived in Campania.</note> and the young men kept it for themselves and would not allow it to be polluted by the professional actors; that is why it is a fixed tradition that performers of Atellan plays are not disfranchised, but serve in the army as though they had no connexion with the stage.<note>Actors were regularly reckoned in the <hi rend="italics">aerarii</hi> or lowest class of citizens, who were not permitted to serve in the army.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Amongst the humble origins of other institutions it has seemed worth while to set down the early history of the play, that it might be seen how sober were the beginnings of <pb id="p.365"/>an art that has nowadays reached a point where<note type="marg">B.C. 364</note> opulent kingdoms could hardly support its mad extravagance.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However, the plays thus for the first time<note type="marg">B.C. 363</note> introduced by way of expiation neither freed men's minds of religious fears nor their bodies of disease.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Indeed, it fell out quite otherwise; for the games were in full swing when an inundation of the Tiber flooded the circus and put a stop to them, an accident which &mdash;as though the gods had already turned away, rejecting the proffered appeasement of their anger &mdash;filled the people with fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And so when Gnaeus Genucius and Lucius Aemilius Mamercus (for the second time) were consuls, and men's minds were more troubled by the search for means of propitiation than were their bodies by disease, it is said that the elders recollected that a pestilence had once been allayed by the dictator's driving a nail.<note>The instance here referred to may have occurred in <date value="-435">435 B.C.</date>, when Quintus Servilius Prisous was dictator (Iv. xxi 6-9).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Induced thereto by this superstition, the senate ordered the appointment of a dictator to drive the nail.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius Manlius Imperiosus was appointed, and named Lucius Pinarius master of the horse.</p> 
			<p>There is an ancient law, recorded in archaic words and letters, that the chief magistrate shall on the thirteenth of September drive a nail; the tablet was formerly affixed to the right side of the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, where Minerva's chapel is.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This nail served, they say, in those days of little writing, to mark the number of years, and the law was confided to the chapel of Minerva, for the reason <pb id="p.367"/>that number was an invention of that goddess.<note type="marg">B. C. 363</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> (Cincius, a careful student of such memorials, asserts<note>We do not know whether Livy alludes to a book or to an oral communication. It has been suggested that Cinciusnot otherwise known &mdash;may have been an antiquary of Livy's own time.</note> that at Volsinii, too, nails may be seen in the temple of Nortia,<note>A goddess of Fortune.</note> an Etruscan goddess, driven in to indicate the number of
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> years.) Marcus Horatius the consul dedicated the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in accordance with this law, in the year after the expulsion of the kings;<note>The text here is uncertain, but Livy seems to mean that Horatius in dedicating the temple also drove the first nail.</note> later the ceremony of driving the nail was transferred from consuls to dictators, because theirs was the higher authority. Then, after the custom had been allowed to lapse, it was thought to be of sufficient importance to warrant the appointment of a dictator for that very
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> purpose. It was for this reason that Manlius was designated, who, however, as though appointed to wage war and not to discharge a religious obligation, aspired to conduct the war with the Hernici, and hunted down the men of military age in a rigorous levy; but in the upshot, opposed by the united efforts of all the tribunes of the plebs, he yielded either to force or to a sense of shame, and resigned his dictatorship.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nevertheless, at the beginning of the ensuing<note type="marg">B.C. 362</note> year &mdash;the consulship of Quintus Servilius Ahala and Lucius Genucius &mdash;Manlius was put upon his trial by Marcus Pomponius, a tribune of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The people hated him for the severity of his levy, in which they had endured not only fines but bodily distress, some having suffered stripes for failure to respond to their names and others having been dragged off to prison;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but more than all else they hated the man's cruel disposition and his surname, Imperiosus, which offended a free state and had been assumed in ostentation of the truculence which <pb id="p.369"/>he used as freely with his nearest friends and his<note type="marg">B.C. 362</note> own family as with strangers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Amongst other charges the tribune cited the man's behaviour to his son: the youth, he said, had been found guilty of no misconduct, yet Manlius had excluded him from the City, from his home and household gods, from the Forum, the light of day, and the fellowship of his young friends,
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> consigning him to slavish drudgery in a kind of gaol or work-house, where a youth of distinguished birth and the son of a dictator might learn by his daily wretchedness how truly <quote>imperious</quote> was the father that had begot him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Yes, but what was the young man's fault? Why, he had been a little slow of speech &mdash;unready with his tongue! But ought not his father to have healed and mended this infirmity of nature &mdash;if he had a particle of humanity about him &mdash;instead of chastising it and by persecution making it conspicuous? Why even the dumb brutes, if one of their young is unfortunate, do none the less cherish it and foster it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But Lucius Manlius was aggravating his son's evil plight by evil treatment, and was doubling the burden on his heavy wits; and any spark of native talent that might be there he was quenching in the rustic life and clownish bringing up amongst the dumb brutes where he kept him.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Everyone was incensed by these charges, except the young man himself. He, on the contrary, was vexed to be the cause of additional dislike and accusation of his father;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that all gods and men might know that he had rather help his father than his father's enemies, he conceived a plan, in keeping to be sure with his rude and uncouth spirit, which, though it set no pattern of civic conduct, was yet <pb id="p.371"/>praiseworthy for its filial piety.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Without anybody's<note type="marg">B. C. 362</note> knowledge, he girded himself with a knife in the early morning, and coming to the City, made his way at once from the gate to the house of Marcus Pomponius, the tribune. There he told the porter that he must see his master instantly, and bade him say that it was Titus Manlius, the son of Lucius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Being presently admitted &mdash;for it seemed likely that he was moved with wrath against his father, or was bringing some fresh charge or plan of action &mdash;he received and returned the salutation of his host, and then announced that there were matters of which he wished to speak to him without witnesses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they had all been sent away, he drew his knife, and standing over the tribune's couch with his weapon ready, he threatened that unless the man should swear, in the terms he himself should dictate, never to hold a council of the plebs for the purpose of accusing his father, he would immediately stab him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The frightened tribune, seeing the blade flash in his face, and perceiving himself to be alone and unarmed, and the other to be a stalwart youth, and, what was no less terrifying, foolhardy by reason of his strength, took the oath that was required of him, and afterwards publicly declared that he had been compelled by force to relinquish his undertaking.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And the plebs, however much they would have liked to be given the opportunity to cast their votes in the case of so cruel and insolent a defendant, were yet not displeased that a son had dared such a deed in defence of his parent; and they praised it all the more, because the father's shocking harshness had made no difference in the son's filial devotion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so not only was the arraignment of the father <pb id="p.373"/>dismissed, but the youth himself gained distinction from<note type="marg">B.C. 362</note> the affair;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for in the election of military tribunes for the legions, which had that year for the first time been resolved upon &mdash;until then the generals themselves had nominated them, as they do to-day those who are known as <hi rend="italics">Rufuli</hi><note>Pseudo-Asconius, on Cic. <hi rend="italics">Act. 1 in Verr.</hi> 30 says: <quote>There are two kinds of military tribunes, the first consisting of those called <hi rend="italics">Rufuli;</hi> these are ordinarily appointed in the army; the others are the <hi rend="italics">comitiati,</hi> who are designated at the comitia in Rome.</quote></note> &mdash;he was chosen second of the six, though neither at home nor in the field had he done aught to merit popularity, and no wonder, since his youth had been passed in the country, remote from the gatherings of men.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That same year, whether owing to an earthquake or to some other violent force, it is said that the ground gave way, at about the middle of the Forum, and, sinking to an immeasurable depth, left a prodigious chasm.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This gulf could not be filled with the earth which everyone brought and cast into it, until admonished by the gods, they began to inquire what it was that constituted the chief strength of the Roman People;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for this the soothsayers declared that they must offer up, as a sacrifice to that spot, if they wished the Roman Republic to endure. Thereupon Marcus Curtius, a young soldier of great prowess, rebuked them, so the story runs, for questioning whether any blessing were more Roman than arms and valour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A hush ensued, as he turned to the temples of the immortal gods which rise above the Forum, and to the Capitol, and stretching forth his hands, now to heaven, and now to the yawning chasm and to the gods below, devoted himself to death.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After which, mounted on a horse caparisoned with all possible splendour, he plunged fully armed into the gulf; and crowds of men and women threw offerings and fruits in after him. It was he, they say, and not Curtius Mettius, the soldier <pb id="p.375"/>of Titus Tatius in days of old, who gave his name to<note type="marg">B. C. 362</note> the Curtian Lake.<note>See I. xii. 10 and xiii. 5, with note.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Diligence would not be wanting, were there any path which could lead the inquirer to the truth; as it is, one must hold by the tradition, where antiquity will not allow us to be certain; and the name of the pool is better known from this more recent legend.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After the expiation of this great portent, the senate dealt in the same year with the question of the Hernici, and having dispatched fetials to demand reparations, without avail, resolved to submit to the people for their approval, at the earliest possible day, a declaration of war against that nation. In a crowded assembly the people voted for war, and the consul Lucius Genucius was by lot intrusted with the conduct of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The citizens were in a fever of suspense, since he would be the first plebeian consul to conduct a war under his own auspices, and they would judge by the sequel whether they had done well or ill to throw these honours open.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It so happened that Genucius, marching in great force against the enemy, plunged into an ambuscade. The legions, in a sudden panic, were put to flight, and the consul was surrounded and slain by men who knew not whom they had taken.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the news reached Rome, the patricians, by no means so cast down by the general disaster as elated at the unlucky generalship of the plebeian consul, filled the City with their taunts. Let them go and choose consuls from the plebs! Let them transfer the auspices to those who might not have them without sin!
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They had been able by a plebiscite to expel the patricians from their rightful honours: had their unsanctioned<note>The law had been passed in an assembly presided over by a tribune, who had not the right to take auspices.</note> law prevailed also against the immortal gods? The gods <pb id="p.377"/>themselves had vindicated their divine authority and their<note type="marg">B. C. 362</note> auspices; for these had no sooner been touched by one who had no legal or religious warranty for so doing, than the army and its general had been annihilated, as a lesson never again to overturn the rights of the patrician families in conducting an election. Such words as these resounded through the Curia and the Forum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Appius Claudius had urged the rejection of the law, and this now gave his words the greater weight, as he denounced the outcome of a policy which he himself had censured. Him, therefore, the consul Servilius, with the approval of the patricians, appointed dictator. An enrolment was proclaimed, and the courts were suspended.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But before the dictator and his new levies were got to the country of the Hernici, the lieutenant Gaius Sulpicius, profiting by a favourable opportunity, had fought a brilliant engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Hernici, whom the consul's death had made contemptuous, approached the Roman camp with every expectation of taking it by storm; but the soldiers, heartened by their general and bursting with anger and resentment, made a sortie, and so far were the Hernici from attacking the stockade, as they had hoped to do, that they actually fell back in confusion from the ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then came the dictator, and the new army was joined to the old and the forces doubled. Calling the men together, Appius lauded the lieutenant and his soldiers, by whose bravery the camp had been defended; thus at the same stroke he encouraged those who heard themselves deservedly commended, and stimulated the others to emulation of their conduct.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor were the enemy less energetic in making ready for the war; mindful of the glory they had won <pb id="p.379"/>before, and aware that the forces of their adversaries<note type="marg">B. C. 362</note> had been augmented, they also strengthened theirs. All who bore the name of Hernici and were of military age were called upon, and eight cohorts were formed, each numbering four hundred of their best men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This choice flower of their manhood they inspired with additional hope and courage by a decree which allowed them double pay. They were exempted, also, from military tasks, in order that, being reserved for the one labour of fighting, they might be sensible of an obligation to exert themselves beyond the capacity of ordinary men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Finally, they were assigned a post in the battle outside the line, to make their bravery the more conspicuous.</p> 
			<p>A plain extending for two miles separated the Roman camp from the Hernici. In the middle of this plain, at a spot almost equidistant from both camps, the battle was fought.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first the event of the struggle was in doubt and nothing came of the oft-repeated attempts of the Roman horse to break the enemy's line.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finding their charges ineffectual, despite their efforts, they consulted the dictator and with his permission left their horses, and, rushing to the front with a mighty cheer, inaugurated a new kind of fighting.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There would have been no stopping them, had it not been for the special cohorts, who flung themselves across their path with a vigour and gallantry equal to their own.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The struggle then lay between the best men of both nations, and whatever losses the chance of war inflicted on either side were serious out of all proportion to their number. The common herd of soldiers, as though they had made over the battle to their betters, rested their future on the bravery of <pb id="p.381"/>others. Many on both sides were slain and more<note type="marg">B.C. 362</note> were wounded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length the knights began to rail at one another. What else, they asked, was there to do, if they had neither beaten the enemy when mounted, nor were able to accomplish anything on foot? What third kind of battle were they waiting for?
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What good had they done by dashing boldly out in front of the line and fighting in a place that belonged to others? Stirred by these mutual reproaches, they advanced with renewed cheering, and first they made the enemy yield, then forced them back, and finally routed them in no uncertain fashion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What it was that turned the scale, where forces were so evenly matched, would be hard to say, unless the fortune regularly attendant on each nation had the power to quicken or to daunt their resolution.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans chased the fleeing Hernici clear to their camp, which, owing to the lateness of the hour, they refrained from attacking; &mdash;the dictator had been unable to give the battle-signal before noon, having failed for a long time to obtain favourable omens, for which reason the struggle had been protracted until night.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> &mdash;On the following day the camp was discovered to have been deserted by the fleeing Hernici, and a few of their wounded were found, whom they had left behind. The column of fugitives was passing the walls of Signia, when the townsfolk espied their thinly attended ensigns, and falling upon them, scattered them in headlong flight across the country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Yet the Romans got no bloodless victory: they lost a fourth part of their foot, and a number of Roman horsemen fell, which was no less grave a loss.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next year the consuls Gaius Sulpicius and<note type="marg">B. C. 361</note> Gaius Licinius Calvus led an army against the <pb id="p.383"/>Hernici, and not finding the enemy abroad, captured<note type="marg">B. C. 361</note> their city of Ferentinum by assault. As they were returning thence, the men of Tibur closed their gates against them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Many complaints had before this been bandied back and forth between the two peoples, but this new offence made the Romans finally determine that after sending the fetials to demand redress they would declare war on the Tiburtine people.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It is well established that Titus Quinctius Poenus was dictator that year and that Servius Cornelius Maluginensis was master of the horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Licinius Macer<note>Tribune of the plebs in <date value="-73">73 B.C.</date> and author of annals written from the democratic standpoint (Introd. p. xxix).</note> states that the appointment was for the purpose of holding an election and was made by Licinius the consul, who, because his colleague was in haste to hold the election before the campaign, so that he might succeed himself in the consulship, felt obliged to thwart his evil designs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the praise which he seeks to bestow on his own family makes the testimony of Licinius less weighty, and since I find no mention of the circumstance in the older annals, I am more disposed to think that it was a Gallic war which occasioned the appointment of a dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In any case, this was the year in which the Gauls encamped at the third milestone on the Salarian road, beyond the bridge over the Anio.</p> 
			<p>The dictator having, by reason of the Gallic rising, proclaimed a suspension of the courts, administered the oath to all of military age. Then marching out of the City with a great army he pitched his camp on the hither bank of the stream.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The bridge lay between, and neither side would break it down, lest it be regarded as a sign of fear. There were frequent skirmishes for the possession of the bridge, and yet, so evenly matched were their forces, it could not be <pb id="p.385"/>determined who were masters of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then a Gaul<note type="marg">B. C. 361</note> of extraordinary size advanced upon the empty bridge, and making his voice as loud as possible, cried out, <quote>Let him whom Rome now reckons her bravest man come out and fight, that we two may show by the outcome which people is the superior in war.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The young Roman nobles were for a long time silent. Ashamed to decline the challenge, they were loath to volunteer for a service of transcendent peril.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then Titus Manlius, the son of Lucius, who had rescued his father from the persecution of the tribune, left his station and went to the dictator. <quote>Without your orders, General,</quote> he said, <quote>I would fain never leave my place to fight, not though I saw that victory was assured;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but if you permit me, I would show that beast who dances out so boldly before the standards of the enemy, that I come of the family that hurled the column of Gauls from the Tarpeian Rock.</quote> To whom the dictator made answer, <quote>Success attend your valour, Titus Manlius, and your loyalty to father and to country!
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Go, and with Heaven's help make good the unconquerable Roman name.</quote> The young man's friends then armed him; he assumed the shield of a foot-soldier, and to his side he buckled a Spanish sword, convenient for close fighting.<note>The Spanish sword was short and pointed, and a sword of this type
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> &mdash;required by the story &mdash;is what Livy means. The <hi rend="italics">name</hi> for it is anachronistic here.</note> Armed and accoutred, they led him forth to the Gaul, who in his stupid glee &mdash;for the ancients have thought even this worth mentioning &mdash;thrust his tongue out in derision. They then retired to their station, and the two armed men were left by themselves in the midst, like gladiators more than soldiers, and by no means evenly matched, to judge from
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> outward show. One <pb id="p.387"/>had a body extraordinary for its size, and resplendent<note type="marg">B.C. 361</note> in a coat of shifting hues and armour painted and chased with gold: the other was of a middling stature for a soldier, and his arms were but indifferent to look at, being suitable but
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> not ornate. He neither sang nor danced about with idle flourishes of his weapons, but his bosom swelled with courage and silent wrath, and all his ferocity was reserved for the crisis of
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the combat. When they had taken their ground between the two embattled armies, while the hearts of the surrounding multitude were suspended betwixt hope and fear, the Gaul, whose huge bulk towered
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> above the other, advanced his shield with the left arm, to parry the attack of his oncoming enemy, and delivered a slashing stroke with his sword, that made a mighty clatter but did
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> no harm. The Roman, with the point of his weapon raised, struck up his adversary's shield with a blow from his own against its lower edge; and slipping in between the man's sword and his body, so close that no part of his own person was exposed, he gave one thrust and then immediately another, and gashing the groin and belly of his enemy brought him headlong to the ground, where he lay stretched out over a
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> monstrous space. To the body of his fallen foe he offered no other indignity than to despoil it of one thing &mdash;a chain which, spattered with blood, he cast round his
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> own neck. The Gauls were transfixed with fear and wonder, while the Romans, quitting their station, ran eagerly to meet their champion and brought him with praise and gratulation to
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the dictator. Amidst the rude banter thrown out by the soldiers in a kind of verse, was heard the appellation of Torquatus,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the man with a chain, or necklace.</note> and thereafter <pb id="p.389"/>this was given currency as an honoured surname,<note type="marg">B. C. 361</note> used even by descendants of
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> the family. The dictator gave him, besides, a golden chaplet, and loudly extolled that fight of his in a public speech.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And in fact the combat was of so great<note type="marg">B. C. 360</note> consequence to the issue of the whole war, that the army of the Gauls withdrew in trepidation from their camp on the succeeding night and crossed over into the territory of Tibur. There they formed a military alliance with the Tiburtes, and having been liberally assisted by them with provisions, they soon departed and went into Campania.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was the reason why in the following year the consul Gaius Poetelius Balbus, when his colleague Marcus Fabius Ambustus had been appointed to the campaign with the Hernici, was commanded by the people to march against the men of Tibur.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To aid their allies, the Gauls returned from Campania, and the cruel devastations which ensued in the districts of Labici, Tusculum, and Alba were clearly instigated and directed by the Tiburtes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Against the Tiburtine foe the state was satisfied to be commanded by a consul; but the Gallic invasion required the appointment of a dictator. The choice fell on Quintus Servilius Ahala, who designated Titus Quinctius master of the horse, and, instructed by the senate, made a vow to celebrate the great games, in the event of a successful termination of the war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Directing the consular army to remain where they were, in order to confine the Tiburtes to their own field of action, the dictator administered the oath to all the young men, none of whom endeavoured to avoid the service.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The battle was fought not far from the Colline <pb id="p.391"/>Gate. The Romans put forth all their strength<note type="marg">B. C. 360</note> in full sight of their parents and their wives and children. These are powerful incentives to courage even when unseen, but being then in full view, set the soldiers on fire with a sense of honour and compassion.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The slaughter was great on both sides, but at last the Gallic army was driven off. In their flight they turned towards Tibur, as though it had been the stronghold of the Gallic war; as they straggled on, they encountered the consul Poetelius, not far from the town, and when the Tiburtes came out to their assistance they were beaten back through the gates along with the Gauls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The affair was admirably handled by the consul as well as by the dictator. And the other consul Fabius defeated the Hernici &mdash;at first in little skirmishes, but ultimately in one remarkable battle, in which the enemy attacked with all their forces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The dictator, having handsomely lauded the consuls in the senate and before the people, even giving them the credit for his own achievements, resigned his office. Poetelius celebrated a double triumph over the Gauls and the Tiburtes: it was thought enough for Fabius that he should enter the City in an ovation.</p> 
			<p>The Tiburtes ridiculed the triumph of Poetelius. Where was it, they asked, that he had fought a battle with them?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A handful of people had gone outside the gates to look on at the flight and panic of the Gauls, and finding that they too were attacked and that all who came in the way of the Romans were cut down without discrimination, had retired within their walls; this was the great achievement that the Romans had deemed worthy of a triumph!
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That they might not regard it as too wonderful and <pb id="p.393"/>great a thing to cause a flurry at their enemy's<note type="marg">B. C. 360</note> gates, they should themselves behold a greater panic in front of their own walls.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly, in the following year, when<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> Marcus Popilius Laenas and Gnaeus Manlius were consuls, a hostile expedition set out from Tibur and arrived in the first silence of the night, at the walls of Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was terrifying to be suddenly waked out of sleep by a surprise and a night alarm; moreover many of the people knew not who their enemies were nor whence they had come; nevertheless the call to arms was quickly given, and watches were set at the gates and the walls were manned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And when the first light showed the enemy before the City to be in no great force, and only the men of Tibur, the consuls sallied out at two gates and assailed them on both flanks as they were now drawing near the walls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was evident that in coming they had relied more on opportunity than on courage, for they scarcely withstood the first shock of the Roman onset.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In fact their expedition was confessedly a good thing for the Romans, and the fear occasioned by so near an enemy repressed a quarrel that was already in the air, between the patricians and the plebs.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Another hostile incursion was more terrifying to the countryside. The Tarquinienses, bent on plundering, ranged over the Roman territory, particularly that part which adjoins Etruria; and demands for reparation proving futile, the new consuls, Gaius Fabius and Gaius Plautius, declared war against them, as commanded by the people. This campaign fell to Fabius, that against the Hernici to Plautius.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><pb id="p.395"/>
			<p>Rumours of a Gallic war began also to be rife.<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> But with many perils, there was this consolation, that they had granted peace to the Latins, at their desire, and had received a large force of soldiers from them, under the terms of an ancient treaty which the Latins had for many years disregarded.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus strengthened, the Romans heard soon after with small concern that the Gauls had come to Praeneste and had then pitched their camp in the vicinity of Pedum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They resolved on making Gaius Sulpicius dictator, and sent for Gaius Plautius the consul to appoint him; Marcus Valerius was named as his master of the horse. These two marched against the Gauls, with the choicest troops from both the consular armies.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The war was considerably more protracted than was pleasing to either side. At first only the Gauls had been eager for battle; but later the Romans far exceeded the Gauls in the ardour with which they would run to arm themselves and fight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Yet the dictator was by no means willing, being under no compulsion, to hazard his fortune against an enemy whom each day made less formidable, as he lingered on in an unfriendly country, without a magazine of food, and without adequate defences &mdash;an enemy, too, whose strength and courage lay wholly in attacking, and languished as soon as there came a slight delay.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Upon these considerations the dictator spun out the war and threatened to punish anyone severely who should fight the enemy without his orders. The soldiers were mortified at this. At first they grumbled among themselves about the dictator, when on picket-duty or watching in the night, and <pb id="p.397"/>sometimes railed at the senators collectively for not<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> having given the consuls charge of the war; a fine general they had chosen, a unique commander, who thought that without his lifting a finger victory would fly down from heaven into his lap!
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But they presently began to utter these same sentiments quite openly and in the light of day, and even bolder things than these: they would not wait, they declared, for the general's orders, but would either fight or go in a body to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The centurions began to mingle with the soldiers; the murmuring was not confined to little knots of men, but in the main street and before the commander's tent there was now one general clamour; the throng increased to the bigness of an assembly, and on every side shouts were heard that they should go instantly to the dictator, and that Sextus Tullius should be spokesman for the army, as became his courage.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now the seventh campaign in which Tullius had served as first centurion, nor was there anyone in the army, at least among the foot-soldiers, more distinguished for his services.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the head of the men, who followed in a body, he approached the platform, where the amazement of Sulpicius on seeing the mob was not greater than at seeing it led by Tullius, a soldier most obedient to authority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>By your leave, Dictator,</quote> he began, <quote>the entire army, deeming itself condemned in your mind for cowardice and almost deprived of its arms by way of humiliation, has asked me to plead its cause with you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For my part, even if we could be taunted with anywhere quitting a post, with turning our backs on the foe, with shamefully losing our standards, I should still think you ought to hearken <pb id="p.399"/>to our entreaty that we be permitted to redeem our<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> fault with valour, and by winning new renown blot out the memory of our disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even the legions that were routed at the Allia afterwards set out from Veii and by manful conduct won back the very City their cowardice had lost. In our case, thanks to the kindness of the gods and to your good fortune and that of the Roman People, both our cause and our glory are unimpaired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Yet I hardly dare to mention glory, since the enemy flout us with every species of insult, as though we were women cowering behind our rampart; and since you, our general &mdash;a thing far harder to bear &mdash;regard us as an army without spirit, without swords, and without hands, and ere you have given us a trial, have so despaired of us as to reckon yourself a commander of cripples and weaklings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For how else can we account for it, that you, an experienced and fearless general, should, as they say, be sitting down with folded hands? Indeed, however this may be, it is more reasonable that you should seem to distrust our bravery, than that we should seem to distrust yours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But if this is not your own but public policy, and if some agreement amongst the senators, and not the Gallic war, keeps us in exile from the City and from our homes, then I beg you to hear what I have to say, as though it were spoken not by his soldiers to a general but by the plebs to the patricians &mdash;for if the plebs, even as you have your policies, should assert that they proposed likewise to have theirs, who, pray, could be angry with them?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I say, then, we are your soldiers, not your slaves; you have sent us to war, not into banishment; if anyone would give us the signal and lead us into battle, we are <pb id="p.401"/>ready to quit us in the fight like men and Romans:<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> but if there be no occasion for our arms, we had rather spend our leisure in Rome than in a camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thus much we would say to the patricians. But of you, our general, we, your soldiers, beg that you give us an opportunity of fighting. We are eager not only to conquer, but to conquer under your leadership; to win for you the glorious laurel; to enter the City with you in the march of triumph; and following your chariot, to approach the throne of Jupiter Optimus Maximus with gratulations and rejoicings.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The speech of Tullius was supported by the entreaties of the crowd, who on all sides clamoured for the signal and the command to arm.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though the dictator felt that a good thing had been carried out in a way to set a bad example, yet he undertook to do as the soldiers wished.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In private he questioned Tullius what this proceeding meant and on what precedent he had acted. Tullius earnestly besought the dictator not to believe that he had forgotten the training of a soldier, nor forgotten himself and the honour due to his commander: the crowd, he said, had become excited; crowds were generally like their leaders, and he had not refused to lead it, for fear that some other might come forward, of the sort that an unruly mob was likely to choose; for his own part he would do nothing without the approval of his general.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But Sulpicius, he continued, must none the less be very wary himself, to keep the army in hand; postponement would not do, where feelings were so exasperated; the men would choose for themselves a time and place for fighting, if their general did not provide them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While they were talking thus, <pb id="p.403"/>it chanced that a Gaul attempted to drive off certain<note type="marg">B.C. 359-358</note> sumpter animals that were grazing outside of the stockade, and two Roman soldiers took them away from him. These men were stoned by the Gauls. Whereupon a shout arose in the Roman outpost, and men ran forward on both sides.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now the mellay was likely to end in a regular battle, had not the centurions speedily parted the combatants. Sulpicius was assured by this incident that Tullius spoke truth, and, the situation admitting of no delay, he announced a general engagement for the morrow.</p> 
			<p>Yet the dictator was entering a struggle in which he relied more on the spirit of his troops than on their strength.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He began therefore to cast about and every way to consider how he might strike terror into the enemy by some stratagem. His cleverness produced a new expedient, which many generals both of our own and foreign countries &mdash;some even in the present age &mdash;have since employed.<note><hi rend="italics">e. g.</hi> C. Marius at Aquae Sextiae (Frontinus, II. iv. 6), and Julius Caesar at Gergovia (<hi rend="italics">Bell. Gall.</hi> VII. xlv. 2). Bannockburn has been cited as a modern instance.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Commanding the muleteers to remove the packsaddles from the mules, leaving only a pair of saddle-cloths on each, and arming them, partly with captured weapons, partly with those belonging to the sick, he mounted them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Having in this way made out near a thousand, he mixed a hundred cavalrymen with them and ordered them to go up by night on to the mountains above the camp and conceal themselves in the woods, and not to stir from thence until they received a signal from him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The dictator himself, as soon as it was light, began to deploy his front along the lower slopes, on purpose to make the enemy take their stand facing the mountains where the preparations had been made for inspiring them with a fear which, groundless <pb id="p.405"/>though it was, yet served the Romans almost better<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> than actual strength.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At first the Gallic leaders supposed that the Romans would not come down into the plain; then, when they saw that they had suddenly begun to descend, they also, being themselves eager for the combat, rushed into battle, and the fighting began before the signal could be given by the generals.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The right wing of the Gauls attacked fiercely, and it would have been impossible to stop them, if the dictator had not happened to be there. Calling out to Sextus Tullius by name, he chid him and asked if this was the kind of fighting he had promised that the men should do.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Where were those shouts with which they had called for arms? Where were their threats that they would begin the battle without the general's orders? Here was their general himself, who with a loud voice summoned them to fight, and advanced, sword in hand, in the very van!
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of those who but now were ready to lead, was there none to follow? They might swagger in camp; in the field they were arrant cowards. What he said was the truth, and so stung them with shame that they rushed on the weapons of the enemy in utter forgetfulness of danger.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This well-nigh frenzied onset first threw their enemies into disarray, and before they could recover their confusion the cavalry charged and routed them. The dictator himself, as soon as he saw that a part of their line was wavering, turned the infantry attack against their left, where he descried a throng of the enemy gathering, and made the appointed signal to those on the mountain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And when they too raised a shout and were seen to <pb id="p.407"/>be moving obliquely down the mountain in the<note type="marg">B.C. 359-358</note> direction of the Gallic camp, the enemy, fearing to be shut out, ceased fighting and rushed pell-mell for their entrenchments.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There however they were met by Marcus Valerius, the master of the horse, who, having scattered the enemy's right wing, was then riding up to their works;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> whereupon they turned and fled towards the mountains and the woods, where very many of them were intercepted by the muleteers masquerading as cavalry; and those whose fright had carried them into the woods were pitilessly slaughtered, after the battle had died down.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Not since the time of Marcus Furius has anyone celebrated a Gallic triumph that was better deserved than that of Gaius Sulpicius. He also collected from the spoils a considerable weight of gold, which he walled up with hewn stone in the Capitol, and so dedicated.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In the same year the consuls, too, waged war with varying success. Gaius Plautius defeated the Hernici and reduced them to subjection; his colleague Fabius showed neither prudence nor skill in his battle with the Tarquinienses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And yet the disaster experienced on the field was overshadowed by the fact that the Tarquinienses slew three hundred and seven captured Roman soldiers as a sacrifice &mdash;an act of savage cruelty that greatly emphasized the humiliation of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In addition to this defeat, the Romans suffered the devastation of their fields in sudden incursions made by the Privernates, and afterwards by the Veliterni.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>In the same year two tribes were added;<note>Bringing up the total number at this time to twenty-seven.</note> the Pomptine and the Publilian; the votive games, <pb id="p.409"/>which Marcus Furius had vowed as dictator, were<note type="marg">B. C. 359-358</note> given; and a statute against bribery was then for the first time laid before the people by Gaius Poetelius, tribune of the plebs, with the approbation of the senate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By this measure they thought to have suppressed corrupt practices, particularly on the part of men risen from the people, who were wont to haunt the country fairs and gathering-places.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Less agreeable to the senate was a measure<note type="marg">B. C. 357</note> which came up in the following year, in the consulship of Gaius Marcius and Gnaeus Manlius. It fixed the rate of interest at one per cent., and was carried through by Marcus Duillius and Lucius Menenius, tribunes of the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The commons ratified it much more eagerly than they had done the other law.<note>Tacitus tells us (<hi rend="italics">Annals</hi> VI. xvi.) that the twelve Tables had forbidden a higher rate of interest. If so, the tribunes were merely reviving an obsolete enactment. The words <hi rend="italics">unciarium fenus</hi> clearly mean a rate of one twelfth but just how that rate was applied is very doubtful. It may be 1/12 of the whole principal or 1/12 of 1 per cent.; the period may be one month or one year; and, finally, the year may be 10 months or 12. The rate in modern terms may then be 1 per cent. (as translated here), 8 1/3 per cent. as assumed by Frank, <hi rend="italics">Economic Survey of Ancient Rome,</hi> I. 282), 10 per cent. (cf. Weissenborn <hi rend="italics">ad loc.</hi>) or 100 per cent. (so apparently Last, Camb, Anc. Hist. VII. 476).</note></p> 
			<p>Besides the new wars determined on in the previous year, the Faliscans also rose up as enemies. They were charged with two offences: their youth had fought on the side of the Tarquinienses; and they had refused the demand of the fetials that they should give up the Romans who had taken refuge in Falerii, after the defeat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This command was assigned to Gnaeus Manlius. Marcius led an army into the territory of Privernum, unravaged during a long period of peace, and loaded his troops with booty. This abundance he administered bountifully, and sequestering nothing to the public treasury, encouraged the men to augment their private fortunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Privernates having encamped in front of their town, within strong intrenchments, Marcius called his soldiers together and thus addressed them: <quote>I give you now for booty the camp and city of our enemies, if you promise me <pb id="p.411"/>that in the battle you will play the part of men,<note type="marg">B.C. 357</note> and be not more ready to plunder than to fight.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They clamoured loudly for the signal and entered the battle with spirit, emboldened by no uncertain expectations. There in the fore-front Sextus Tullius, who has been mentioned before, cried out, <quote>Look, general, and see how your army keeps the promises it gave you!</quote> Then, laying down his javelin, he drew his sword and charged the foe.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All of the front line followed Tullius, and putting the enemy to flight at the first shock, pursued them to the town, where the Romans were already bringing up their scaling ladders to the wall, when the place surrendered. A triumph was celebrated over the Privernates.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The other consul accomplished nothing worth recording, except that without precedent he got a law passed in his camp before Sutrium &mdash;the men voting by tribes &mdash;which levied a tax of one-twentieth on manumissions. The Fathers ratified this law, since it brought in no small revenue to the empty treasury; but the tribunes of the plebs, troubled less by the law than by the precedent established, had it made a capital offence for anyone thereafter to summon the people to the comitia away from Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If this should be permitted, there was nothing, they argued, however baneful to the people, which could not be carried through by the votes of soldiers sworn to obey their consul.<note>Within a distance of one mile from the walls a citizen might appeal from the decision of a consul, but beyond that point the consul's authority was absolute.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In the same year Gaius Licinius Stolo was prosecuted under his own statute by Marcus Popilius Laenas, and condemned to pay a fine of ten thousand <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi> on the charge that he held with his son a thousand <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> of land, and by emancipating his son<note>From his paternal authority.</note> had evaded the law.<note>By the Licinio-Sextian legislation of 367 it had been forbidden that anybody should hold more than 500 <hi rend="italics">iugera. cf.</hi> VI. xxxv. 5.</note></p> <pb id="p.413"/>
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>New consuls now came in, Marcus Fabius<note type="marg">B.C. 356-355</note> Ambustus and Marcus Popilius Laenas, each for the second time. They had two wars.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One of these was easy; it was waged by Laenas against the Tiburtes, and he shut up the enemy within their city and pillaged their fields. The other consul was routed by the Faliscans and Tarquinienses in his first engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The panic was chiefly due to this, that their priests, bearing serpents and blazing torches before them, came rushing on like Furies, and utterly dismayed the Roman soldiers with the extraordinary sight. At first they were like men frantic and distraught, and flung themselves in a disordered mob into their own works.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then when the consul, the lieutenants and the tribunes laughed at them and upbraided them for being scared like children at idle tricks, shame caused a sudden revulsion in their feelings, and they rushed, as if blinded, on the very objects from which they had fled.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this spirit they brushed aside the enemy's vain paraphernalia, and hurling themselves on his real fighting men, they routed the whole army, and even captured the camp that day. As they returned victorious with the rich plunder they had won, they jested in soldier-fashion and scoffed not only at the enemy's devices but at their own fright as well.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All who bore the Etruscan name then rose in arms, and led by the men of Tarquinii and Falerii, advanced as far as Salinae. To meet this fearful danger Gaius Marcius Rutulus was made dictator, the first that was ever appointed from the plebs, and he named a plebeian also, Gaius Plautius, to be master of the horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the patricians thought it shameful that even the dictatorship should now <pb id="p.415"/>be common; and they exerted all their influence<note type="marg">B. C. 356-355</note> to prevent anything being decreed or made ready for the dictator, to carry on that war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For which reason the people voted the more promptly everything that the dictator proposed. Marching out from the City and setting his army across the Tiber by means of rafts, wherever a rumour
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> of the enemy called him, he surprised many straggling pillagers as they roamed about the fields, on both sides of the river; he also captured their camp in a surprise attack, and with it eight thousand soldiers;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and having slain the rest, or driven them out of Roman territory, was granted a triumph by the people, but without the authorization of the senate.<note>Compare the story of Valerius and Horatius at III. lxiii. 11.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The patricians were not willing that a consular election should be held by a plebeian, whether dictator or consul, and the other consul being detained by the war, the state relapsed into an interregnum. The office of interrex was held successively by Quintus Servilius Ahala, Marcus Fabius,<note>Perhaps identical with the M. Fabius Ambustus of VI. xxii., xxxiv., xxxvi.; perhaps with the M. Fabius Dorsuo of VII. xxviii.</note> Gnaeus Manlius, Gaius Fabius, Gaius Sulpicius, Lucius Aemilius, Quintus Servilius, and Marcus Fabius Ambustus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In the second interregnum a controversy arose because two patricians were on the point of being named as consuls; and when the tribunes sought to veto the announcement, the interrex Fabius declared that the Twelve Tables enacted that whatsoever the people decreed last should have the binding force of law, and their votes were also a decree.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The tribunes gained nothing more by their intervention than a postponement of the comitia, and two patrician consuls were elected, namely Gaius Sulpicius Peticus (for the third time) and Marcus Valerius Publicola. They entered office that very day,<note type="marg">B. C. 354</note> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<pb id="p.417"/>in the four hundredth year from the founding of Rome<note type="marg">B. C. 354</note> and the thirty-fifth from its recovery from the Gauls, depriving the plebs of the consulship they had enjoyed for ten years.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Empulum was won that year from the Tiburtes without any memorable battle being fought; whether, as some writers state, the campaign was conducted there under the auspices of the two consuls; or whether the lands belonging to Tarquinii were ravaged by the consul Sulpicius at the same time that Valerius led his legions against the Tiburtes.</p> 
			<p>The consuls had a harder struggle at home, with the plebs and the tribunes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They held that honour as well as courage required of them that, even as two patricians had received the consulship, so they should hand it over to successors who were both patricians:
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> indeed they ought rather to withdraw from the consulship altogether, that it might at once become a plebeian magistracy, or else retain undivided that control which they had inherited entire from their fathers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the other side, the plebeians were asking angrily why they lived, why they were counted a part of the state, if they were unable by their collective efforts to maintain what the courage of two men, Lucius Sextius and Gaius Licinius, had won for them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It were better to put up with kings or decemvirs, or &mdash;if possible &mdash;a
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> more stern type of government than theirs, rather than see the consuls both patricians and have no turns at obeying and commanding, while a part of the people thought themselves established forever in authority and the commons born for no other end than servitude.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was no lack of tribunes to promote disturbances, but where all were so excited, to begin with, the leaders were hardly to <pb id="p.419"/>be discerned.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the people had several times<note type="marg">B. C. 354</note> gone down to the Campus Martius<note>Where the voting took place.</note> to no purpose, and many meeting days had been spent in rioting, the persistence of the consuls finally prevailed. The plebs, thereupon, in a burst of resentment, followed their tribunes, who cried out that liberty was lost and that they ought now to leave not only the voting-field but the City, too, which was taken captive and enslaved by the tyranny of the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consuls, being deserted by half the people, nevertheless, despite the paucity of voters, completed the election. The successful candidates were both patricians, Marcus Fabius Ambustus (for the third time) and Titus Quinctius. In certain annals I find Marcus Popilius given as consul instead of Titus Quinctius.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Two wars were successfully prosecuted this<note type="marg">B.C. 353</note> year, and the Tarquinienses and Tiburtes were forced to make submission. From the latter their city of Sassula was taken, and the rest of their towns would have met with the same fortune, had the whole nation not laid down their arms and cast themselves upon the mercy of the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A triumph was celebrated over them, but in all other respects the victory was used with clemency. The men of Tarquinii were shown no ruth; many were slain in the field of battle, and out of the vast number taken prisoners three hundred and fifty-eight were selected &mdash;the noblest of them all &mdash;to be sent to Rome, and the rest of the populace were put to the sword.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither were the People less stern towards those who had been sent to Rome, but scourged them all with rods in the middle of the Forum and struck off their heads. Such was the vengeance they exacted of their enemies for the Romans sacrificed <pb id="p.421"/>in the market-place of Tarquinii.<note>Chap. xv. &sect; 10.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their success in<note type="marg">B. C. 353</note> war induced the Samnites also to apply for their friendship. The senate made a courteous answer to their ambassadors, and granted them a treaty of alliance.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Roman commons were not so fortunate at home as in the field. For notwithstanding they had been relieved of usury by the adoption of a one per cent. rate, the very poor found even the principal sum a crushing burden, and were being bound over to their creditors. Hence it was that neither the incumbency of two patrician consuls, nor concern for the elections or affairs of state, could divert the thoughts of the plebeians from their personal distresses.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly both consulships continued in the hands of the patricians; Gaius Sulpicius Peticus was elected for the fourth time, and Marcus Valerius Publicola for the second.</p> 
			<p>While the citizens were occupied with thoughts of an Etruscan war &mdash;for it was rumoured that the people of Caere, out of compassion for their kinsmen of Tarquinii, had made common cause with them &mdash;came envoys from the Latins and turned their thoughts upon the Volsci, with a report that they had mustered and equipped an army, which was even then descending upon Latium, from whence it would invade and devastate the territory of the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate therefore resolved that neither threat must be neglected; and ordered that legions should be enrolled for both campaigns, and that the consuls should decide the commands by lot.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the Etruscan war afterwards came to be their chief concern, on the receipt of a dispatch from the consul Sulpicius, who had received the assignment <pb id="p.423"/>to Tarquinii, with the news that the countryside<note type="marg">B. C.353</note> lying near the Roman salt-works had been pillaged, and a part of the booty carried into the borders of the Caerites, whose soldiers had, without question, been amongst the depredators.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so the senate recalled Valerius the consul, who was opposing the Volsci and had his camp close to the Tusculan frontier, and ordered him to nominate a dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His choice fell upon Titus Manlius,<note>sc. Torquatus. See chap. v. &sect; 3 and chap. x. &sect; 13.</note> the son of Lucius, who appointed as master of the horse Aulus Cornelius Cossus. Asking for no more than the consular army, the dictator, by the senate's authority, and at the bidding of the people, proclaimed war on the Caerites.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was then that the Caerites realized for the first time the full danger of war, as if the words of their enemies conveyed a more emphatic hint of it than their own acts, though they had pillaged the Romans and harried them. Beginning then to perceive how inadequate was their strength to such a quarrel, they repented of their raid, and cursed the Tarquinienses, who had encouraged them to fall away.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nobody made ready his arms and prepared for war, but one and all bade dispatch ambassadors to Rome, to beg forgiveness for their error. The envoys, having approached the senate, were sent by them to be dealt with by the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Calling on the gods whose sacred emblems they had received and religiously protected in the Gallic war, they besought them to inspire the Romans in their prosperity with such compassion for the men of Caere as they themselves had formerly shown for Rome in her time of tribulation.<note>See v. xl. 7 and 1. 3.</note> Then, turning to the shrine of Vesta, they invoked the flamens and Vestals whom they had <pb id="p.425"/>entertained with a pure and scrupulous hospitality.<note type="marg">B. C. 353</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Could anyone, they asked, believe that those who had deserved so well of the Romans had suddenly turned enemies without reason?
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> or that if they had in fact committed an act of hostility, it had been deliberately planned, and had not rather been owing to a fit of madness? Would they undo their own kindness of old, especially kindness to such grateful friends, with new misdeeds; and choose to be enemies of the Roman People in their flourishing state and at the height of their success in war, when they had sought their friendship in the hour of their adversity? Let them not give the name of <quote>purpose</quote> to what should properly be called <quote>force</quote> and <quote>necessity.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Tarquinienses, marching in hostile array through their territories, had sought nothing of them save permission to pass, but had drawn certain rustics after them in their train, who had borne a part in the pillaging with which the people of Caere were now taxed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If it pleased the Romans that these men should be surrendered, they would surrender them; if they would have them punished, they should be made to suffer. But Caere, the sanctuary of the Roman People, the hostel of its priests and refuge of the Roman religion, let them preserve intact and unstained by the imputation of making war, for the sake of the hospitality it had shown their Vestals and the reverence it had paid their gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The people were moved, not so much by their present claims as by their ancient merits, and chose rather to forget an injury than a kindness. So peace was granted to the people of Caere, and it was resolved that a truce of a hundred years be made, and recorded on a table of bronze.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The <pb id="p.427"/>brunt of the war was turned against the Faliscans,<note type="marg">B. C. 353</note> who lay under the same accusation; but the enemy were nowhere encountered. Having ranged over their lands and laid them waste, the Romans refrained from attacking their cities, and led their legions home. The rest of the year was consumed in repairing the walls and towers, and a temple was dedicated to Apollo.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the latter part of the year the consular<note type="marg">B.C. 352</note> election was broken off by a quarrel between the patricians and the plebs: the tribunes refused to permit the assembly to be held unless it were held agreeably to the Licinian law, and the dictator was obstinately determined rather to remove the consulship root and branch out of the state than to throw it open to patricians and plebs without distinction.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The assembly was therefore repeatedly adjourned, until the dictator's term had expired, and the state reverted to an interregnum. The interreges found the commons hostile to the patricians, and the factional struggle continued until there had been eleven interreges.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes continually vaunted their backing of the Licinian law: the plebs were more concerned with the distress they suffered from the increasing weight of usury, and their private worries broke out into public quarrels.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Worn out with these, the senate ordered Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the interrex, for harmony's sake to observe the Licinian law at the consular election. Publius Valerius Publicola<note>Brother of the Marcus Valerius of chap. xxiii. &sect; 3.</note> was elected, with a plebeian colleague named Gaius Marcius Rutulus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Now that the minds of men were once inclined to concord, the new consuls set themselves to obtain relief in the matter of usury also, which appeared to be the sole <pb id="p.429"/>obstacle to harmony. They made the discharge of<note type="marg">B. C. 352</note> debts a concern of the state, appointing five commissioners, whom they called bankers, from their having the disposition of the money.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These men by their impartiality and diligence fairly earned the distinction which attaches, in all the histories, to the names of Gaius Duillius, Publius Decius Mus, Marcus Papirius, Quintus Publilius, and Titus Aemilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the discharge of a very difficult duty, involving always a hardship for one of the parties, and in most instances for both, they managed matters wisely in other respects, and, in particular, they expended without throwing away the public funds.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For with long-standing accounts, embarrassed more by the debtors' neglect than by their lack of means, they dealt in one of the following ways: either they paid them out of the treasury &mdash;taking security for the people first &mdash;at the banking tables they had set up in the Forum; or they settled them upon a valuation, at fair prices, of the debtor's effects. And so, not only without injustice, but even without complaint from either side, a vast amount of indebtedness was cleared off.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>A groundless fear of war with Etruria, on a report that the twelve nations had conspired, compelled the appointment of a dictator. The appointment was made in camp &mdash;for thither had the resolution of the senate been sent to the consuls &mdash;and Gaius Julius became dictator, with Lucius Aemilius for master of the horse. But abroad all was serene, 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				while at home an attempt, made through the<note type="marg">B. C. 351</note> dictator, to obtain the return of patricians to both consulships, brought the state to an interregnum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The two interreges who were put in, Gaius Sulpicius <pb id="p.431"/>and Marcus Fabius, brought to pass what the<note type="marg">B. C. 351</note> dictator had vainly striven for; and the plebs being now grown more tractable, thanks to the help lately granted them in the relief of debt, both men elected consuls were patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These were that very Gaius Sulpicius Peticus, who was the earlier of the two interreges, and Titus Quinctius Poenus. (Some give Caeso, others Gaius, as the praenomen of Quinctius.)
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Both marched out to fight, Quinctius against the Faliscans, Sulpicius against the Tarquinienses; but nowhere encountering their enemies in battle, they warred rather with the land, which they burnt and pillaged, than with men;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> until the obstinacy of both peoples was overcome, as by the wasting of a lingering illness, and they requested a truce, first of the consuls, and later, by their permission, of the senate. They were granted one for forty years.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The anxiety arising from two threatening wars being thus allayed, it was resolved that while there was some rest from arms they would take the census; for the settlement of debts had brought about the change of ownership in many properties.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But when notice had been given of an assembly for the election of censors, an announcement that he should be a candidate on the part of Gaius Marcius Rutulus, who had been the first plebeian dictator, played havoc with the harmony of the orders;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for he seemed to have taken this step at an untoward time, since both the consuls, as it fell out, were then patricians, who declared that they would receive no votes for him;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but Rutulus himself held firmly to his purpose, and the tribunes aided him with all their power, in the hope of <pb id="p.433"/>recovering what they had lost in the election of<note type="marg">B. C. 351</note> consuls; and not only was the man's own greatness equal to any honour, however lofty, but the plebs desired that they might be called to share the censorship by the same man who had opened up for them a path to the dictatorship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There was no dissenting opinion shown at the assembly, and Marcius was elected, along with Manlius Naevius.</p> 
			<p>There was a dictator in this year also, namely, Marcus Fabius, not because of any threatened war, but to prevent the observance of the Licinian law in the consular election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Quintus Servilius was assigned to the dictator as master of the horse. But the dictatorship made the unanimity of the patricians no more potent in the election of consuls than it had been in the election of censors.<note type="marg">B. C. 350</note> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				Marcus Popilius Laenas was chosen from the plebs, Lucius Cornelius Scipio from the patricians.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Fortune even made the plebeian consul the more illustrious, for the news that a huge army of Gauls had encamped in Latium found Scipio afflicted with a grave disorder, and the conduct of the war was entrusted by special arrangement to Popilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He levied troops with energy, and ordered all the young men to assemble under arms outside the Porta Capena, at the temple of Mars, commanding the quaestors to convey the standards thither, from the treasury. After filling up four legions, he turned over the supernumeraries to the praetor, Publius Valerius Publicola, urging the senators to enroll <pb id="p.435"/>a second army as a national reserve against the<note type="marg">B. C 350</note> uncertain emergencies of war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Having at length concluded all the necessary preparations, he himself marched against the enemy;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and that he might first learn their strength before putting it to the test of a decisive battle, he seized and began to fortify an eminence as close as he could find to the camp of the Gauls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These, being a fierce people and by nature eager for the combat, on beholding the Roman ensigns in the distance, at once drew out their line, as if for instant battle. But perceiving that the Romans did not descend into the plain, but sought to protect themselves not only by their position but even with a rampart, they supposed them to be panic-stricken and at the same time the more open to attack for being just then taken up with their task. They advanced, therefore, with hideous yells.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans without a pause in their work, on which the reserves were engaged, began the action with their troops of the first and second lines, who had been standing alert and armed in front of the working party.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Besides their valour, they had an advantage from the elevation, for their javelins and spears, instead of falling without effect, as they mostly do when thrown on a level field, were steadied by their own weight and all struck home.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Gauls were burdened with the missiles which had either transfixed their bodies, or, sticking in their shields, had made them very heavy; their dash had carried them almost up the slope, but first they halted, uncertain what to do, and then &mdash;for
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the mere delay had abated their ardour and increased that of their foes &mdash;they were thrown back, and falling one upon <pb id="p.437"/>another wrought greater carnage than even their<note type="marg">B.C. 350</note> enemies had done; for so headlong was the rout, that more were trodden under foot than slain with the sword.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the Romans were not yet sure of victory; on descending into the plain they found another fight awaiting them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the Gallic host, superior to any feeling for such losses, sprang up like a new army, and urged their fresh troops against the victorious foe.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans, slowing down, came to a halt, for they were confronted, weary as they were, with a second struggle, and the consul, rashly exposing himself in the van, had received a javelin in his left shoulder that had like to have gone clean through it, and had withdrawn for a brief space from the fight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And now the delay had almost lost them the victory, when the consul, whose wound had been dressed, rode up again to the front. <quote>Why are you standing there, my men?</quote> he exclaimed. <quote>You have no Latin or Sabine foe to deal with, whom you may overcome in fight and transform from an enemy into an ally; we have drawn the sword against wild beasts, and we must have their blood or yield them ours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> You have repulsed them from your camp, you have driven them headlong down a sloping valley, you stand on heaps of your slain enemies; cover the plain with the same carnage you have spread upon the mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Do not wait for the enemy to flee from you, while you stand still; you must move forward and attack them.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Roused once more to action by these exhortations, they drove back the foremost of the Gallic maniples, and then, forming in wedges, burst through into the midst of the main <pb id="p.439"/>array;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> whereat the barbarians were thrown into<note type="marg">B.C. 350</note> confusion, having no definite orders nor commanders, and, turning, charged upon their fellows; and so, dispersed about the fields, and even carried past their own camp in the rout, they made for the highest point in the range of hills that met their eyes, namely, the Alban Citadel.<note>Livy seems to have in mind the summit now called Monte Cavo, though it is strangely described as <hi rend="italics">editissimum inter aequales tumulos.</hi></note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul did not pursue them beyond their camp, for his wound was troubling him, and he was unwilling to send his troops against the hills which the enemy had occupied. Giving over to his soldiers the entire booty of the camp, he led back his army, flushed with victory and enriched with the Gallic spoils, to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul's triumph was delayed by reason of his wound, which also made the senate wish for a dictator, that there might be someone &mdash;in the illness of the consuls &mdash;who could hold the election.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lucius Furius Camillus was appointed to that office, and Publius Cornelius Scipio was made his master of the horse. Camillus restored to the patricians their ancient possession of the consulship, and in recognition of this service was himself, with their warm support, elected consul, and announced the election of Appius Claudius Crassus as his colleague.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the new consuls entered office,<note>Probably, at this time, on the 1st of July.</note> <note type="marg">B.C. 348</note> Popilius celebrated his triumph over the Gauls, with great enthusiasm on the part of the plebeians, who, muttering low, would often ask each other if anyone regretted the choice of a plebeian
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> consul. At the same time they railed against Camillus, who by declaring himself elected consul, when he was dictator, had got a reward, they said, for his contempt of the Licinian law more disgraceful for his personal cupidity than for the injury done the
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> commonwealth.</p> <pb id="p.441"/>
			<p>The year was signalized by many and various<note type="marg">B.C. 348</note> disturbances. The Gauls came down from the Alban hills, having been unable to endure the sharpness of the winter, and ranging over the plains and sea-coast, laid waste the
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> country. The sea was infested by fleets of Greeks, and so were the seaboard of Antium, the Laurentine district, and the mouth of the Tiber. It happened once that the sea-robbers encountered the land-raiders, and a hard-fought battle ensued, from which the Gauls withdrew to their camp and the Greeks to their ships, alike uncertain whether they had been defeated or
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> victorious. But by far the greatest of these alarms was occasioned by councils of the Latin tribes, assembled at the grove of Ferentina, and the unambiguous reply vouchsafed by them to a demand for
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> soldiers. Let the Romans, they said, have done with issuing commands to those whose assistance they required: the Latins would sooner bear arms in behalf of their own liberty than of an alien
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> domination. Involved in two foreign wars at once, and worried besides by the defection of their allies, the senate perceived that those whom loyalty had not restrained must be restrained by fear, and bade the consuls exert the full extent of their authority in levying troops: for they must depend on a soldiery of citizens, when their allies were leaving
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> them. They say that soldiers were enlisted everywhere, not in the City alone but in the country, and ten legions were embodied, each of four thousand two hundred foot and three hundred
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> horse. The raising of a new army of this size to-day, in case of any aggression from abroad, could not easily be compassed by the concentration on one object of the <pb id="p.443"/>existing resources of the Roman People, though<note type="marg">B. C. 348</note> the world hardly contains them; so strictly has our growth been limited to the only things for which we strive, &mdash;wealth and
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> luxury.</p> 
			<p>Among the untoward occurrences of this year was the death of one of the consuls, Appius Claudius, in the midst of the preparations for
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> war. The administration of the state passed to Camillus, over whom, as sole consul, &mdash;whether owing to his general high standing, which deserved not to be subordinated to the dictatorship, or to the happy omen, in a Gallic rising, of his surname,<note>His father, the great Camillus, had defeated the Gauls after their capture of Rome (v. xlix.).</note> &mdash;the Fathers concluded it not meet to set a
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> dictator. The consul appointed two legions to defend the City, and divided the other eight with Lucius Pinarius the praetor. Having a lively recollection of his father's prowess, he took upon himself, without drawing lots, the conduct of the Gallic war, and commanded the praetor to secure the seaboard and prevent the Greeks from
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> landing. Then, marching down into the Pomptine district, he chose a suitable site for a permanent camp; for he had no mind to meet the enemy in the field, unless compelled to do so, believing that he should effectually subdue them if he kept them from making raids, since they subsisted necessarily on plunder.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they were there quietly passing the time in guard-duty, a Gaul came out to them, remarkable for his great stature and his armour, and, smiting his spear against his shield and thereby obtaining silence, challenged the Romans, through an interpreter, to send a man to fight with him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was a young tribune of the soldiers, named Marcus Valerius, who, regarding himself as no less <pb id="p.445"/>worthy of that honour than Titus Manlius had been,<note type="marg">B.C. 348</note> first ascertained the consul's wishes, and then armed himself and advanced into the midst.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the human interest of the combat was eclipsed by the intervention of the gods; for the Roman was in the very act of engaging, when suddenly a raven alighted on his helmet, facing his adversary.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This the tribune first received with joy, as a heaven-sent augury, and then prayed that whosoever, be it god or goddess, had sent the auspicious bird might attend him with favour and protection.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marvellous to relate, the bird not only held to the place it had once chosen, but as often as the combatants closed, it rose on its wings and attacked the enemy's face and eyes with beak and talons, till he was terror-struck with the sight of such a portent, and bewildered at once in his vision and his mind, was dispatched by Valerius, &mdash;whereupon the raven flew off towards the east and was lost to sight.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hitherto the outguards on either side had stood quietly by; but when the tribune began to despoil the corpse of his fallen foe, the Gauls remained no longer at their station, and the Romans ran up even more swiftly to the victor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There a scuffle, arising over the body of the prostrate Gaul, led to a desperate fight that was not long confined to the maniples of the nearest outposts, for the legions, rushing out on both sides, carried on the battle. Camillus ordered his soldiers to fall on, elated as they were by the tribune's victory, elated too by the present assistance of the gods; and pointing to the tribune, decked out in his spoils, he cried, <quote>Here is your pattern, soldiers!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Bring down the Gauls in troops around their prostrate leader!</quote> <pb id="p.447"/>Both gods and men helped in that battle, and they<note type="marg">B.C. 348</note> fought it out with the Gauls to a conclusion that was never doubtful, so clearly had each side foreseen the result implicit in the outcome of the single combat.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Between those who began the fray, and by their conflict drew in the others, there was a bitter struggle; but the rest of the Gallic host turned tail ere they came within the cast of a javelin. At first they scattered among the Volsci and through the Falernian countryside; from there they made their way into Apulia or to the Tuscan Sea.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The consul assembled his soldiers, and having eulogized the tribune, bestowed on him ten oxen and a golden coronet; Camillus himself was commanded by the senate to take charge of the operations on the coast, and accordingly joined forces with the praetor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The campaign there seemed likely to be long drawn out, for the Greeks were poltroons and refused to risk an engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He therefore, on the authorization of the senate, appointed Titus Manlius Torquatus to be dictator, that an election might be held. The dictator, after naming Aulus Cornelius Cossus master of the horse, presided over a consular election, and announced, amid great popular rejoicings, that the choice had fallen &mdash;in his absence &mdash;upon a youth of twenty-three, the Marcus Valerius Corvus &mdash;for this was his surname from that time &mdash;who had rivalled Manlius's own glorious achievement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As colleague of Corvus they elected the plebeian Marcus Popilius Laenas to be for the fourth time consul. With the Greeks, Camillus fought no memorable action; they were no warriors on land, nor were the Romans on the sea.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> In the end, being kept off shore, and their <pb id="p.449"/>water giving out, as well as other necessaries, they<note type="marg">B. C. 348</note> abandoned Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> To what people or race their fleet belonged is uncertain. I am most inclined to think that they were Sicilian tyrants; for Greece proper was at that time exhausted with civil wars and trembled, even then, at the power of the Macedonians.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the armies had been disbanded,<note type="marg">B. C. 347-346</note> and there was peace with other nations, and &mdash;thanks to the goodwill betwixt the orders &mdash;quietness at home, that the happiness of the citizens might not pass all bounds, a pestilence attacked them and the senate was compelled to order the ten commissioners<note>For these commissioners see VI. xlii. 2.</note> to consult the Sibylline Books.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By their direction a lectisternium<note>See v. xiii. 6 and note there.</note> was held. In the same year a colony was sent out to Satricum by the Antiates, and that city, which had been destroyed by the Latins, was rebuilt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Further, a treaty was entered into at Rome with envoys of the Carthaginians, who had come seeking friendship and an alliance.<note>This is the first mention in Livy of a treaty with the Carthaginians, and Diodorus (XVI. lxix.) also speaks of it as the first, but Polybius (III. xxii.) tells of a treaty between Rome and Carthage made in the first year of the Republic (<date value="-509">509 B.C.</date>).</note></p> 
			<p>The same peaceful conditions continued at home and abroad during the consulship of Titus Manlius Torquatus and Gaius Plautius. But the rate of interest was reduced from one to one-half per cent.,<note><hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. xvi. &sect; 1 and note.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and debts were made payable, one-fourth down and the remainder in three annual instalments; even so some of the plebeians were distressed, but the public credit was of greater concern to the senate than were the hardships of single persons. What did the most to lighten the burden was the omission of the war-tax and the levy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the second year after the rebuilding of Satricum by the Volsci, Marcus Valerius Corvus became consul for the second time, with Gaius Poetelius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A report having come out of Latium that emissaries of the <pb id="p.451"/>Antiates were circulating amongst the Latin peoples<note type="marg">B. C. 347-346</note> with a view to stir up war, Valerius was ordered to deal with the Volsci before more enemies should arise, and marched to the attack of Satricum. There he was opposed by the Antiates and the other Volsci, with forces which they had levied in advance, in case any measures should be taken by the Romans; and both sides being actuated by inveterate hatred, the battle was joined without delay.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Volsci, a race more spirited in beginning than in prosecuting war, were defeated in the struggle and fled in disorder to the walls of Satricum. Indeed, they put no great reliance even in their walls, for when the city had been encircled with troops and was on the point of being escaladed, they surrendered, being in number about four thousand soldiers, besides the unarmed populace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The town was dismantled and burnt; only the temple of Mater Matuta<note>An Italian goddess associated with birth and the dawn, and widely worshipped; in Satricum apparently the chief deity. <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Warde Fowler, <hi rend="italics">Festivals,</hi> p. 155.</note> was saved from the flames. All the booty was given to the soldiers. The four thousand who had surrendered were not reckoned a part of the spoils; these the consul sent in chains before his chariot when he triumphed, and they were subsequently sold, and brought in a great sum to the treasury.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some think that this multitude of captives consisted of slaves, and this is more likely than that surrendered men were sold.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These consuls were succeeded by Marcus<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> Fabius Dorsuo and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus. War then broke out with the Aurunci, in consequence of a raid which they unexpectedly executed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was feared that this act of a single nation might be the joint design of all of the Latin name, and a dictator was appointed &mdash;as though to <pb id="p.453"/>oppose a Latium already up in arms &mdash;in the person<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> of Lucius Furius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After naming Gnaeus Manlius Capitolinus to be his master of the horse, he suspended the courts, and having levied troops without exemptions &mdash;as was customary in great emergencies &mdash;he led them with all possible speed against the Aurunci. These he discovered to possess the spirit of freebooters rather than of enemies, and so brought the war to a conclusion in the first engagement.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Howbeit the dictator, considering that they had been the aggressors in the war and were accepting battle without shrinking, saw fit to summon even the gods to help him, and in the heat of the encounter vowed a temple to Juno Moneta. This vow the result made binding, and the dictator having returned to Rome victorious, resigned his authority.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate ordered that two commissioners should be designated to erect the temple in a style becoming to the grandeur of the Roman People, and a site was appointed for it in the Citadel, where once had stood the house of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls, employing the dictator's army for the Volscian war, made a surprise attack upon the enemy and captured Sora.</p> 
			<p>The temple of Moneta was dedicated the next year after it was vowed, when Gaius Marcius Rutulus was consul for the third time and Titus Manlius Torquatus for the second.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The dedication was immediately followed by a prodigy like the one which had happened long before on the Alban Mount;<note>I. xxxi. 1.</note> for a shower of stones fell, and a curtain of night seemed to stretch across the sky; and when the Books<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Sibylline Books.</note> had been consulted and the City was filled with forebodings of divine displeasure, the <pb id="p.455"/>senate resolved on the appointment of a dictator, to<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> establish days of worship.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The choice fell on Publius Valerius Publicola, who was given Quintus Fabius Ambustus as master of the horse. They determined that not only the Roman tribes but the neighbouring peoples also should offer supplications; and they appointed an order for them, on what day each should make entreaty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is handed down that during this year the people rendered severe judgments against usurers, who had been brought to trial by the aediles.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The state &mdash;for no specially memorable reason &mdash;reverted to an interregnum, which was followed &mdash;so that this might appear to have been intended &mdash;by the election to both consulships of patricians, namely Marcus Valerius Corvus, for the third time, and Aulus Cornelius Cossus.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Wars of greater magnitude, in respect both of the forces of our enemies and of the remoteness of their countries and the long periods of time involved, now fall to be related.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For in that year the sword was drawn against the Samnites, a people powerful in arms and in resources; and hard upon the Samnite war, which was waged with varying success, came war with Pyrrhus, and after that with the Carthaginians. How vast a series of events! How many times the extremity of danger was incurred, in order that our empire might be exalted to its present greatness, hardly to be maintained!
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now the cause of the war between the Romans and the Samnites, who had been united in friendship and alliance, was of external origin and not owing to themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Samnites had unjustly attacked the Sidicini, because they happened to be more powerful than they, and the Sidicini, driven in their <pb id="p.457"/>need to fly for succour to a more wealthy nation,<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> had attached themselves to the Campanians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Campanians had brought reputation rather than real strength to the defence of their allies; enervated by luxury, they had encountered a people made hardy by the use of arms, and being defeated in the territory of the Sidicini, had then drawn down the full force of the war upon themselves.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the Samnites, disregarding the Sidicini and attacking the Campanians &mdash;the very stronghold of their neighbours, &mdash;from whom they would gain full as easy a victory and more plunder and renown, had seized and with a strong force occupied Tifata &mdash; a range of hills looking down on Capua &mdash;and thence had descended in battle-order into the plain that lies between.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There a second battle had been fought, and the Campanians, being worsted, had been shut up within their walls; and having, after the loss of their choicest troops, no prospect of relief at hand, had been driven to seek assistance of the Romans.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Their ambassadors, on being introduced into the senate, spoke substantially as follows: "The Campanian people has sent us to you as ambassadors, Conscript Fathers, to solicit your lasting friendship and present help.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Had we sought this amity when our affairs were prosperous, though it had been begun more quickly, yet had it been contracted with a weaker bond; for in that case, as those who remembered that they had joined with you in friendship on an equal footing, though perhaps as much your friends as now, we should have been less subject and beholden to you;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> as it is, attached to you by your compassion <pb id="p.459"/>and defended in our time of trouble by your aid,<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> we must lovingly remember the benefit also, lest we appear as ingrates and undeserving of any help, divine or human.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor do I think, in sober truth, that the circumstance of the Samnites having become your allies and friends before ourselves should make against our being received into your friendship, though it entitle them to an advantage over us in respect of priority and rank; and indeed there was no stipulation in your treaty with the Samnites that you should make no further treaties.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>"It has ever been with you a sufficiently just cause for friendship that he who sought you desired to be friends with you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We Campanians, though our present plight will not suffer us to boast, are inferior neither in the splendour of our city, nor yet in the fertility of our soil, to any people but yourselves; and in associating ourselves with you we bring, as I think, no small accession to your prosperity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As often as the Aequi and the Volsci &mdash;perpetual enemies of this city &mdash;shall stir abroad, we shall be upon their backs, and what you will have done first for our preservation, that we will ever do for your empire and your glory.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When once you have subdued these nations that lie between our boundaries and your own &mdash;a thing which your valour and good fortune guarantee will speedily come to pass &mdash;your rule will extend unbroken all the way to our frontier.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Grievous and pitiful is the confession that our misfortune obliges us to make: to that pass, Conscript Fathers, are we Campanians come that we must be the chattels either of our friends or of our enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Defend us, and we are yours; desert us, and the Samnites will possess us. Consider <pb id="p.461"/>therefore whether it be your preference that Capua and<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> all Campania augment Rome's power, or that of Samnium.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>"It is meet that your compassion, Romans, and your succour should be open to all mankind, but especially to those who in endeavouring beyond their strength to grant these blessings to the prayers of others, have come themselves to require them most of all.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And yet we fought but ostensibly for the Sidicini, in reality for ourselves, since we saw that a people on our borders was being cruelly despoiled by the brigand Samnites, and that, once that conflagration had consumed the Sidicini, it would spread to us.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Nor at this very moment are the Samnites come to attack us out of resentment for any injury received, but rejoicing rather that a pretext has been afforded them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Otherwise, if this were the satisfaction of revenge and not an opportunity to appease their greed, was it not enough that first in the territory of Sidicinum, and again in Campania itself, they made slaughter of our legions?
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> What wrath is this, that is so implacable that the blood two armies have poured out cannot appease it? Add to this the devastation of our lands and the booty they have driven off, both men and cattle; add the burning and destruction of our farm-houses and the general havoc fire and sword have wrought.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Could not all this placate their wrath? Nay, but their greed must be appeased. It is this that hurries them to the siege of Capua; they must needs either destroy the fairest of cities, or themselves become its masters.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But do you, Romans, sooner gain it by your generosity than suffer them to have it by their malice. I am not speaking before a people that <pb id="p.463"/>refuses righteous wars; still, if you make but a show<note type="marg">B. c. 345-343</note> of helping us, you will have, I think, no need of going to war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> As far as to ourselves does the scorn of the Samnites reach, it mounts not higher; accordingly the shadow of your help is able, Romans, to protect us, and whatever thereafter we shall have, whatever we ourselves shall be, we shall consider wholly yours.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> For you shall be ploughed the Campanian plain, for you shall the city of Capua be crowded; you shall be to us as founders, parents, and immortal gods; you shall have no colony that surpasses us in obedience and loyalty.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/><quote>Grant the favour of your countenance, Conscript Fathers, and of your unconquered might, to the Campanians, and bid them hope that Capua will be saved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> With what thronging crowds of every sort were we accompanied, think you, at our setting out? How did we leave on every hand prayers and tears!
				<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> In what suspense are now the senate and the people of Campania, our wives and our children! Well I know that all the people are standing at the gates, their eyes fixed on the northern road. What message, Conscript Fathers, do you hid us carry back to their perplexed and troubled spirits?
				<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> One answer would bring salvation, victory, light, and liberty; the other &mdash;I shrink from the ominous prediction! Do you therefore deliberate regarding us, as regarding those who shall either be your allies and friends, or else have no being anywhere.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The ambassadors were then made to withdraw while the senate considered their request. It was evident to many that the largest and wealthiest city of Italy, with a very fertile territory near the <pb id="p.465"/>sea, would in times of scarcity be a store-house for<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Yet this great advantage was of less moment with them than their honour, and the consul, being so instructed by the senate, returned the following answer to the ambassadors: <quote>Men of Campania, the senate holds you worthy of assistance; but on such terms only can we become your friends as shall not violate an older friendship and alliance. The Samnites and we are united by a covenant; we must therefore refuse to make war in your behalf upon the Samnites, for this would be to wrong first gods,<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the gods who were witnesses and guardians of the treaty.</note> and then men; we will, however, dispatch envoys, as is right and just, to entreat our allies and friends to do you no violence.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To this the leader of the delegation answered &mdash;in accordance with instructions they had brought with them: &mdash;<quote>Since you decline to use a righteous violence to protect from violence and injustice what belongs to us, you will at least defend your own;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> to your sovereignty, therefore, Conscript Fathers, and to the sovereignty of the Roman People, we surrender the people of Campania and the city of Capua, with our lands, the shrines of our gods, and all things else, whether sacred or profane; whatever we endure henceforth, we shall endure as your surrendered subjects.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When these words had been pronounced, they all stretched forth their hands in supplication to the consul, and weeping bitterly, threw themselves face downwards on the floor of the entrance to the Curia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Fathers were profoundly moved by the vicissitudes of human fortune, considering how that great and opulent people, famed for its luxury and pride, of whom a little while before its neighbours <pb id="p.467"/>had sought assistance, was become so broken in<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> spirit as to yield itself up with all its possessions to the dominion of another.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They now held it to be a point of honour not to betray those who were become their subjects; neither did they think that the Samnite people would deal justly, if they attacked a country and a city, which, by surrendering, had become the property of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate accordingly voted to dispatch ambassadors to the Samnites, without loss of time. Their instructions were to inform the Samnites what the Campanians had asked, how the senate, mindful of the friendship of the Samnites, had replied to them, and lastly how they had surrendered;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> they were then to request that the Samnites, out of regard for the friendship and alliance of the Romans, would spare their subjects, and make no hostile incursion into a territory which belonged now to the Roman People;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> if soft words proved ineffectual, they were to warn the Samnites, in the name of the Roman People and the senate, not to meddle with the city of Capua or the Campanian domain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But the Samnites, when these things were represented to them in their council<note>The Samnites were a loose federation comprising the following tribes: the Hirpini, the Caudini, the Pentri, the Caraceni, and perhaps the Frentani (Weissenborn).</note> by the envoys, behaved so insolently as not only to declare that they meant to carry on the war, but their magistrates stepping out of the senate-house &mdash;while the envoys stood by &mdash;summoned
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the commanders of their cohorts, and with a loud voice gave them orders to proceed at once to make a raid upon Campania.</p>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the news of this embassy reached Rome, the Fathers, putting aside all other business, sent fetials to demand redress, and failing to obtain it, declared war after the customary fashion.<note>For the fetials and their procedure in declaring war, see I. xxiv. 4 and xxxii. 5, with notes.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They <pb id="p.469"/>then voted that the people be asked to ratify this<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> action at the earliest possible moment; and being commanded so to do, both consuls took the field; and Valerius marching into Campallia and Cornelius into Samnium, the one encamped at the foot of Mount Gaurus, the other near Saticula. It was Valerius whom the Samnite levies encountered first &mdash;for that was the direction which they expected the invasion to take.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Campanians moreover had incurred their sharp resentment, having been so ready now to render aid against them, now to invoke it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when they beheld the Roman camp, they began, every man for himself, to call loudly on their leaders for the battle-signal, affirming that the Romans would have no better fortune in helping the Campanians than these had experienced in helping the Sidicini.</p> 
			<p>Valerius, having delayed not many days for the purpose of testing the enemy in small skirmishes, hung out the signal for a battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But first he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, bidding them have no fear of a strange war and a strange enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With every advance of their arms from Rome, he said, they came to nations that were more and more unwarlike.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They must not judge of the courage of the Samnites by the defeats they had administered to the Sidicini and Campanians. Whatever their respective qualities, it was inevitable that when they fought together, one side should be vanquished. As for the Campanians, there was no question they had been beaten rather by the enervation resulting from excessive luxury and by their own effeminacy, than by the strength of their enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Furthermore, what were the Samnites' two successful wars in so many ages, as <pb id="p.471"/>against the many glorious achievements of the<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> Roman People, who could count almost more triumphs than the years since their City had been founded;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> who had subjugated by their arms all the nations round about them, the Sabines, Etruria, the Latins, the Hernici, the Aequi, the Volsci, and the Aurunci; who after beating the Gauls time after time in battle, had ended by compelling them to flee to the sea-board and their ships?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He said that they ought, as they went into action, not only to rely every man on his own courage and martial glory, but also to consider under whose command and auspices they would have to fight;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> whether he were one who only merited a hearing as a brilliant orator, warlike only in his words, and ignorant of military operations, or one who knew himself how to handle weapons, to advance before the standards, and to play his part in the press and turmoil of a battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>Soldiers,</quote> he cried, <quote>it is my deeds and not my words I would have you follow, and look to me not only for instruction but for example. Not with factions, nor with the intrigues common amongst the nobles, but with this right hand, have I won for myself three consulships and the highest praise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Time was when it might have been said: Ah, but you were a patrician and sprung from the liberators of your country, and your family held the consulship in the very year that saw the institution of that office.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But now the consulship lies open on equal terms to us, the nobles, and to you plebeians, nor is it any longer a reward of birth, but of merit. Have regard, therefore, soldiers, in every instance, to great honours.

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was never a commander who more endeared himself to his men by cheerfully sharing all their duties with the meanest of the soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the military sports, too, in which those of a like age contend with one another in strength and swiftness, he was easy-going and good-natured; he would win or lose without changing countenance, nor did he scorn to match himself with anyone who challenged him;
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> in his acts his kindness was suited to the circumstances, in his speech he had regard to the liberty of others no less than to his own dignity; finally &mdash;and nothing can be more popular than this &mdash;he
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> was the same in office that he had been while a candidate.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was therefore with incredible eagerness that the whole army, after listening to the general's speech, marched out of camp.</p> 
			<p>The battle began, if ever battle did, with like hopes on both sides and equal strength, and a self-confidence which yet was not mixed with contempt for the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Samnites were' emboldened by their recent exploits and by their double victory of a few days before, the Romans on their part by the glories of four centuries and a victorious career that dated from the founding of <pb id="p.475"/>the City;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> each side nevertheless experienced some<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> anxiety at meeting an untried foe. The engagement testified how resolute they were, for they so fought that for some time neither battle-line gave ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the consul, thinking that he must inspire his enemies with fear, since he could not drive them back by force, attempted by sending in the cavalry to 'throw their front ranks into disorder.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But when he saw that nothing came of the confused fighting of the squadrons, as they tried to man&oelig;uvre in a narrow space, and that they could not break the enemy's line, he rode back: to the front ranks of his legions, and, dismounting from his horse, exclaimed, <quote>Soldiers, it is for us, the infantry, to accomplish yonder task!
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Come, as you shall see me making a path for myself with my sword wherever I advance against the enemy's line, so do you every man strike down whom you encounter; all that array where now uplifted spears are glancing you shall see laid open with great carnage.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> No sooner had he said these words, than the horsemen, by the consul's order, drew off towards the wings and left the legions room to attack the centre.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consul was the very foremost in the charge, and slew the man he chanced to meet with. Kindled by this sight, the Romans on the right and on the left pushed forward, every man of them, and fought a memorable combat; the Samnites stood manfully at bay, but they took more strokes than they delivered.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The battle had now lasted a considerable time; there was dreadful slaughter about the standards of the Samnites, but as yet no retreating anywhere, so determined were they to be overcome by naught but death.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And so the Romans, who saw that their <pb id="p.477"/>strength was fast ebbing away in weariness and<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> that little daylight yet remained, were filled with rage, and hurled themselves against the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then for the first time were there signs of giving way and the beginning of a rout; then were the Samnites captured or slain; nor would many have survived, if night had not ended what was now a victory rather than a battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Romans admitted that never had they fought with a more stubborn adversary;
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and the Samnites, on being asked what it was that first had turned them, resolute as they were, to flight, replied that it was the eyes of the Romans, which had seemed to blaze, and their frenzied expression and infuriated looks; this it was more than anything else that had caused their panic. And this panic stood confessed not alone in the outcome of the fight but in the night-retreat that followed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> On the morrow the Romans took possession of the deserted camp, and thither the whole population of Capua streamed out to congratulate them.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But this rejoicing came near to being marred by a great reverse in Samnium. For the consul Cornelius, marching from Saticula, had unwarily led his army into a forest which was penetrated by a deep defile, and was there beset on either hand by the enemy;
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> nor, until it was too late to withdraw with safety, did he perceive that they were posted on the heights above him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While the Samnites were only holding back till he should send down the whole column into the bottom of the valley, Publius Decius, a tribune of the soldiers, espied a solitary hill, which rising above the pass, commanded the enemy's camp, and though arduous <pb id="p.479"/>of access to an army encumbered with baggage, was<note type="marg">B. C. 385-343</note> not difficult for men in light marching order.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He accordingly said to the consul, who was much perturbed: <quote>Do you see, Aulus Cornelius, that summit that rises above the enemy?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is the fortress of our hope and safety, if we are prompt to seize it, since the Samnites have been so blind as to neglect it. Give me no more than the first and second lines of a single legion;<note>The legion was drawn up in three lines; in the first were the <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> in the second the <hi rend="italics">principes,</hi> and behind these the <hi rend="italics">triarii.</hi></note> when with these I have mounted to the top, do you go forward fearlessly and save yourself and the army; for the enemy, exposed to all our missiles, will not be able to stir without bringing destruction on themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As for us, thereafter the fortune of the Roman People or our own manhood will extricate us.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Being commended by the consul and receiving his detachment, he advanced under cover through the wood, nor did the enemy perceive him till he had nearly reached the place which he wished to gain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were then all overcome with astonishment and dread, and while they turned, every man of them, and gazed at him, the consul was given time to withdraw his army to more favourable ground, and Decius himself took his post on the top of the hill.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Samnites, turning their standards now this way and now that, threw away both opportunities; they could not pursue the consul, except through the same defile where a little before they -had held him at the mercy of their javelins, nor could they charge up the hill which Decius had captured over their heads.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But not only did their resentment urge them rather against those who had snatched victory from their grasp, but so also did the nearness of the place and the fewness of its <pb id="p.481"/>defenders;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and first they would be for surrounding<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> the hill with troops, so as to cut Decius off from the consul, and next for leaving his road open, so that they might attack him when he was got down into the valley.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Before they had made up their minds, night overtook them.</p> 
			<p>Decius at first had hopes of fighting from the higher ground, as they mounted the hill; then he marvelled that they neither began to attack, nor, if they were deterred from that design by the difficulty of the ground, attempted to shut him in with trench and rampart.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then, calling the centurions to him, he said: <quote>What want of military skill, what slothfulness can that be? How did those people conquer the Sidicini and Campanians? You see their standards moving now this way, now that, first closing in together, then deploying, while no man falls to work, though we might ere this have been fenced in with a palisade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then in truth should we be no better than they, were we to tarry here longer than suits our interest. Come on then and follow me, so that while there is yet a little light we may find out where they post their guards, and where the way out from this place lies open.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Wrapped in a common soldier's cloak and accompanied by his centurions, who were also dressed like privates, lest the enemy should notice that the general was on his rounds, he investigated all these matters.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next, having disposed the sentries, he commanded that the word be passed to everybody, that on hearing the trumpet sound for the second watch they should silently arm and present themselves before him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they had assembled there <pb id="p.483"/>without a word, as he had ordered, he thus began:<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> <quote>You must preserve this silence, soldiers, as you listen to me, omitting all soldier-like acclaim. When I have finished explaining my plan, then those of you who find it good will quietly pass over to the right; on whichever side the majority shall be, we will abide by their decision.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hear now what I have in mind. The enemy has not invested you here as men who ran away or were left behind through laziness: it was by valour that you took the place, and by valour you must escape from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By coming hither you saved a splendid army for the Roman People; save yourselves by breaking out. You are worthy to have carried help, though few, to greater numbers, and to have needed no man's help yourselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> You have an enemy to deal with who neglected yesterday through indolence an opportunity of destroying our whole army; who failed to see the importance of this hill by which he is commanded, until we had taken it; who, though we were so few and his own thousands so many, neither kept us from gaining the ascent, nor, when the place was ours and much daylight still remained, surrounded us with entrenchments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> An enemy whom you thus eluded while he was wide awake and watching, you ought to baffle when he is overcome with sleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Indeed it is necessary that you do so, for our situation is such that I am rather pointing out your necessity to you than advocating a plan.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor truly can it be a debatable question whether you should stay or go away from here, since Fortune has left you nothing but your arms and the spirit to employ them, and we must die of hunger and thirst, if we dread the <pb id="p.485"/>sword's point more than it is fitting men and Romans<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> should.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Our one way of safety, then, is to break through and get away. We must do this either in the day-time or at night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But this, look you, is a question that is even less in doubt, for if we should wait for dawn, what hope is there that the enemy would not hem us in with a continuous trench and rampart, who has now, as you see, encompassed the hill on every hand with the bodies of his men lying below us. And yet, if night is favourable for our sally, as it is, this is surely the fittest hour of the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> You have come together on the signal of the second watch, when sleep lies heaviest on mortals;: you will make your way among drowsy forms, either eluding them unsuspected in your silence, or ready, if they should perceive you, to affright them with a sudden shout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Do but follow me, whom you have followed hitherto; I will follow that same Fortune that has led us hither. Now then let those who approve my plan step over-to the right.</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They all crossed over. Decius then made his way through the spaces left unguarded, and they followed him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had already got half way through the camp, when a soldier in stepping over the bodies of some sleeping sentries struck his shield and made a sound. A sentry was awakened by this, and having shaken his neighbour, they stood up and began to rouse the rest, not knowing whether they had to do with friends or foes, whether the party on the hill were escaping, or the consul had captured the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Decius, seeing that they were discovered, gave the order to his men, and they set up such a shout that the Samnites, <pb id="p.487"/>who had been stupefied with sleep, were now in<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> addition
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> breathless with terror, which prevented them from either arming promptly or making a stand against the Romans or pursuing them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the fright and confusion amongst the Samnites, the Romans cut down such guards as they came across, and proceeded towards the consul's camp.</p> 
			<p>It wanted yet some time till daylight, and they now appeared to be in safety, when Decius said, <quote>All honour to your courage, Roman soldiers!
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Your expedition and return shall be renowned through all the ages. But the light of day is needed to set off such gallantry, nor do you merit that your glorious return to camp should be accomplished in silence and under cover of night. Let us wait here quietly until the dawn.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They did as he sail. With the first rays of light they sent forward a courier to the consul, and the camp was woke with loud rejoicings. When word was sent round that those were returning safe and sound, who in behalf of the general safety, had exposed their bodies to no uncertain peril, they all poured out to meet them, and, each for himself, praised and congratulated them, calling them their saviours, one and all. To the gods they offered praise and thanks, and Decius they extolled to the skies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now followed a triumph for Decius in the camp, as he marched through the midst with his battalion under arms. All eyes were directed towards him, and paid the tribune equal homage with the consul.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they reached headquarters, the consul bade the trumpet sound an assembly, and fell to lauding Decius, as he deserved. But Decius, interrupting him, induced him to defer his speech; <pb id="p.489"/>then, urging that all other considerations should<note type="marg">B.C. 345-343</note> be postponed whilst they had such an opportunity at hand, he persuaded him to attack the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were now, he said, bewildered by the night alarm and dispersed about the: hill in separate detachments, and he doubted not that a party would have been sent out after him and would be wandering through the forest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The troops were commanded to arm, and marching out of camp, were led by a more open route &mdash;for, thanks to their scouts, the forest was now better known to them &mdash;in the direction of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> These they caught quite off their guard by a surprise attack, for the Samnite soldiers were scattered far and wide, and most of them were without their weapons, Unable either to assemble or to arm or to regain their works, they were first driven headlong into their camp, and then the outposts were routed and the camp itself was taken. The shouting was heard all round the hill and sent the detachments flying from their several stations.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thus a great part of the Samnites fled without coming into contact with the enemy. Those whom panic had driven within the? enclosure &mdash;to the number of some thirty thousand &mdash;were all put to the sword, and the camp was spoiled.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The battle having sped thus, the consul called an assembly, and pronounced a panegyric upon Decius, in which he rehearsed, in addition to his former services, the fresh glories which his bravery had achieved. Besides other military gifts, he bestowed on him a golden chaplet and a hundred oxen, and one choice white one, fat, and with gilded horns.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The soldiers who had been on the <pb id="p.491"/>hill with him were rewarded with a double: ration<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> in perpetuity, and for the present an ox apiece and two tunics. Following the consul's award, the legions, accompanying the gift with their cheers, placed on Decius's head a wreath of grass,<note>This decoration was next in importance to the <hi rend="italics">corona aurea</hi> or <hi rend="italics">triumphalis.</hi> It was made of green grass plucked from the place which had been beleaguered.</note> to signify his rescuing them from a siege; and his own detachment crowned him with a second wreath, indicative of the same honour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Adorned with these insignia, he sacrificed the choice ox to Mars, and presented the hundred others to the soldiers who had served with him on the expedition. To these same soldiers the legions contributed a pound of spelt and a pint of wine for each man. All these awards were carried out amid the greatest cheerfulness, the shouts of the soldiers testifying to the general approval.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A third engagement was fought at Suessula, for the Samnites, after the rout inflicted on them by Marcus Valerius, had called out all the men they had of military age, determined to try their fortune in a final encounter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From Suessula the alarming news was carried to Capua, whence gallopers were dispatched to Valerius the consul, to implore assistance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The troops were immediately set in motion, and leaving behind the baggage and a strong garrison for the camp, made a rapid march, and being got within a short distance of the enemy, encamped in a very small compass, for they had only their horses with them and neither beasts of burden nor a crowd of camp-followers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Samnites, assuming that the battle would not be delayed, formed up in line; then, as no one came out to meet them, they advanced against the enemy's camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they saw the soldiers on the rampart, and when the scouts whom they had <pb id="p.493"/>dispatched to spy out the camp on every hand<note type="marg">B. C.345-343</note> reported how straitened its dimensions were, inferring thence the paucity of their foes, the whole army began to murmur that they ought to fill up the trenches, breach the rampart, and burst into the enclosure;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and their rashness would have brought the war to a conclusion, had not the commanders restrained the ardour of their men.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But since their numbers were a burden on the commissariat, and since, owing first to their sitting down before Suessula and afterwards to the delay in fighting, they were almost reduced to want for everything, they decided that while the enemy were cowering within their works, they would send their soldiers over the country-side to forage:
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> meantime the Romans, remaining inactive, would be reduced to destitution, for they had come in light marching order, with only so much corn as they could carry, along with their armour, on their shoulders.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Seeing the Samnites dispersed about the fields, and their stations thinly manned, the consul addressed a few words of encouragement to his soldiers and led them to the assault of the enemy's camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Having taken it at the first shout and rush, and slain more men in their tents than at the gates and on the breastworks, he ordered the captured standards to be collected in one spot.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then, leaving two legions to guard them and defend the place, &mdash; with strict injunctions to refrain from spoiling until he himself returned, &mdash;he marched out in serried column, and sending the cavalry on before to surround the scattered Samnites, as with a cordon of hunters, and so drive them in, he made a prodigious slaughter of them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For in their terror they were <pb id="p.495"/>unable to agree either under what standard they<note type="marg">B. C. 345-343</note> should rally, or whether they should make for their camp or direct their flight towards some more remote place;
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> and so great was their discomfiture and panic, that the Romans brought in to the consul no less than forty thousand shields &mdash;though not near so many men were slain &mdash;and of military standards, including those which had been captured in the camp, no fewer than a hundred and seventy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The victors then returned to the enemy's camp and there the plunder was all given to the soldiers.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The fortunate outcome of this war not<note type="marg">B. C. 342</note> only impelled the Faliscans, with whom there was a truce, to ask the senate for a treaty, but caused the Latins, whose armies were ready to take the field, to transfer their attack from Rome to the Paeligni.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor was the fame of this success confined to Italy; even the Carthaginians sent their envoys to Rome, with congratulations and the gift of a golden crown, weighing five and twenty pounds, to be placed in the shrine of Jupiter on the Capitol.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both consuls triumphed over the Samnites, and after them came Decius, conspicuous in his decorations and so renowned, that the soldiers in their rude jests named the tribune no less often than the consuls.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The deputations of the Campanians and the Suessulani were then heard, and a favourable reply was made to their petition that a garrison should be dispatched, to remain through the winter with them and protect them against inroads by the Samnites.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Capua was even then a far from wholesome place for military discipline, and with its means for <pb id="p.497"/>gratifying every pleasure proved so fascinating to the<note type="marg">B.C. 342</note> soldiers that they forgot their native land, and formed a project, while in winter quarters, for taking the city away from the Campanians by the same wicked practice by which the Campanians had taken it from its ancient inhabitants.<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the Etruscans, see IV. xxxvii. 2.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There would be a certain justice, they argued, in turning their own example against them. Besides, why should the most fertile land in Italy, and a city worthy of the land, belong to the Campanians, who were incapable of defending either themselves or their possessions? Why, rather, should it not belong to the conquering army, which had toiled and bled to drive the Samnites out of it?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Was it fair that their surrendered subjects should enjoy that fertile and agreeable tract, while they, exhausted with campaigning, wrestled with the arid and noxious soil in the neighbourhood of Rome, or endured the ruinous usury that had fastened on the City and was increasing from one day to the next?</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>These schemes, discussed in secret cabals and not yet communicated to all the troops, were discovered by the new consul, Gaius Marcius Rutulus, to whom the lot had assigned Campania for his province, leaving Quintus Servilius, his colleague, in charge at Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so having found out through his tribunes exactly what had taken place, Rutulus, who was of ripe years and experience, &mdash;for the present consulship was his fourth and he had been both dictator and censor &mdash;thought that his best course would be to frustrate the men's impetuosity, by encouraging the hope that they would be able at any time they chose to carry out their plan.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He accordingly set on foot a rumour that the garrisons <pb id="p.499"/>would winter in the same towns in the following<note type="marg">B.C. 342</note> year also, &mdash;for they had been distributed among the cities of Campania and from Capua their designs had spread to the entire army, &mdash;and the conspirators being thus afforded time for breathing, the sedition subsided for the present.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul having led out his troops to the summer encampment, and finding the Samnites quiet, resolved to purge the army of its troublemakers by discharging them.: Of some of them he said that they had served out their time; of others, that they were now too old or deficient in sturdiness.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To some he granted furlough, singling out individuals at first, but later dismissing certain cohorts, on the ground that they had passed the winter far from their homes and their affairs. Many, too, were sent off on some pretext of military employment, some one way, some another.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All these the other consul and the praetor detained at Rome, alleging a variety of reasons. And at first, not suspecting a trick, they were far from sorry to visit their homes again.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Later on, when they saw that the first to go failed to rejoin the colours, and that practically none were dismissed but those who had wintered in Campania, and particularly such of these as had encouraged the conspiracy, they marvelled at first, and presently began to entertain very definite fears that their designs had come to light:
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> soon there would be investigations, soon informations would be lodged, they would soon be punished in secret, one by one, and would be made to feel the unrestrained and cruel despotism with which the consuls and the senate governed them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Such were the fears that were secretly put about by the soldiers <pb id="p.501"/>in the camp, for they saw that the sinews of their<note type="marg">B.C. 342</note> plot had been plucked out by the consul's artifice.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>One cohort which was stationed not far from Anxur<note>Later called Tarracina.</note> went into camp near Lautulae, in the narrow pass between the sea and the mountains, where they could intercept those whom the consul continued to dismiss, on one pretext or another, as has been said before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were soon a very numerous body, and lacked no essential element of an army except a general. And so, without order, and pillaging as they went, they proceeded as far as the Alban country, and under the ridge of Alba Longa encamped and threw up a rampart.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having finished the work, they employed the remainder of the day in wrangling over the choice of a general, for they had no great confidence in anyone there present.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But whom could they summon from Rome? What patrician or plebeian was there who would wittingly expose himself to so great a danger, or to whom the cause of the army, maddened by its wrongs,<note>As Livy has mentioned no particular grievance, it is supposed that lie refers to the oppressive usury.</note> could fitly be committed?
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the following day, while-they were debating the same question, certain of their roving foragers reported having learned that Titus Quinctius was living on a farm near Tusculum, with no thoughts of the City or its honours.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This man, who belonged to a noble family, had won great distinction in the wars, but a lameness in one of his feet, resulting from a wound, had put an end to his campaigning, and had determined him to take up his residence in the country, far from the Forum and from politics.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On hearing his name they remembered the man at once, and bade send for him, invoking a blessing on this step. But there being little prospect that <pb id="p.503"/>he would voluntarily assist them, they resolved on<note type="marg">B.C. 342</note> employing threats and violence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Coming therefore to his farm-house in the silence of the night, those who had been dispatched upon this errand caught Quinctius sound asleep, and offering him no choice but authority and rank, or death, &mdash;with which, when he held back, they threatened him, unless he would go along with them &mdash;they carried him off to the camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Once there they immediately hailed him General, and dazed as he was by the astounding suddenness of it all, conferred on him the insignia of that office and bade him lead them to the City.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Then, more on their own impulse than by the counsel of their general, they pulled up their standards and marched in warlike array as far as the eighth milestone, on what is now the Appian Way;
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> whence they would at once have gone on to the City, had they not learned that an army was coming to oppose them, under Marcus Valerius Corvus, who had been created dictator for that purpose, with Lucius Aemilius Mamercus as master of the horse.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as they came within sight of one another and recognized one another's arms and ensigns, all were at once reminded of their fatherland, and their anger cooled.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Men were not yet so hardy in shedding the blood of countrymen; they knew no wars but those with outside nations, and thought that frenzy could go no further than secession from their people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And so on either side both the leaders and their men began to seek for ways to meet and confer together. For Quinctius was sated with war, even war in behalf of his country, to say nothing of fighting against it; <pb id="p.505"/>and the affection of Corvinus embraced all his<note type="marg">B. C. 342</note> fellow-citizens, particularly the soldiers, and above all others, his own army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He now came forward to parley, and being recognized, was instantly accorded a silent attention, in which his opponents showed as great respect for him as did his followers.</p> 
			<p><quote>Soldiers,</quote> he began, <quote>as I was setting forth from the City, I adored your gods and mine, and humbly besought them of their goodness to vouchsafe to me the glory of reconciling, not of conquering you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There have been wars in plenty, and will be others, where men may win renown: in this crisis we must seek for peace.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The petition which I made to the immortal gods, as I offered up my prayer, you are able of yourselves to grant me, if you are willing to reflect that your camp is pitched not in Samnium nor among the Volsci, but on Roman soil; that those hills which you see are in your native land; that this army is made up of your fellow-citizens; that I am your consul, under whose command and auspices you twice last year defeated the Samnite legions, and twice stormed their camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I am Marcus Valerius Corvus, soldiers, whose patrician blood has declared itself in kindnesses done you, not in injuries; I have urged no insolent law against you, no cruel senatorial resolution; in every position of authority I have been sterner to myself than to you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And in truth if any man's family, if any man's own worth, if any man's dignities and honours have been able to inspire pride in him, my birth was such, I had given such proof of my capacity, and had achieved so young the highest magistracy, that I might easily, on becoming consul at the age of three and twenty, <pb id="p.507"/>have been overbearing even towards the nobles, not<note type="marg">B.C. 342</note> merely towards the plebs.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But what have you heard that I said or did, when consul, more tyrannical than my words and deeds as tribune? In that same spirit I administered two subsequent consulships; in that same spirit shall this dictatorship with its dread power be administered; so that I shall be no gentler to these my soldiers and the soldiers of my country, than to you &mdash;I shudder to say the word, &mdash;our enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> You shall therefore sooner draw sword on me than I on you. It is on your side that the trumpets will sound, on your side that the battle-cry will be raised and the attack begin, if fight we must.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Steel your hearts to do that which neither your fathers nor yet your grandfathers could resolve upon &mdash;neither those who seceded to the Sacred Mount, nor those who later encamped upon the Aventine.<note>See II. xxxii and II. 1.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Wait until to each of you &mdash;as once to Coriolanus<note>See II. xl.</note> &mdash;your mothers and wives come forth from the City with dishevelled hair. On that day the legions of the Volsci ceased fighting, because they had a Roman leader: will you, an army of Romans, not relinquish this impious war?
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Titus Quinctius, whatever be your position over there &mdash;whether you have taken it voluntarily or against your will, &mdash;if we must do battle, do you retire to the rear; you will even flee with less discredit, turning your back upon your fellow-citizens, than you will incur in fighting against your country.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Now, however, to make peace you will stand with honour and credit amongst the foremost, and will be a salutary mediator at this conference. Let your men ask what is reasonable, and receive it; yet must we rather put up with what is not, than join together in impious strife.</quote></p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><pb id="p.509"/>
			<p>Titus Quinctius turned with streaming eyes and<note type="marg">B. C. 342</note> addressed his people: <quote>I, too, soldiers, if I am of any use to you, can better lead you to peace than into war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For it was no Volscian or Samnite that just spoke those words, but a Roman. It was your consul, your general, soldiers. You have proved his auspices in your own behalf; seek not to prove their worth against you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The senate had other leaders who would have made more ruthless war on you; but they have chosen him who would deal most mercifully with you, his men; one in whom, as in your general, you might place the most utter confidence.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Peace is the goal desired even by those who are able to conquer: what then ought our desire to be?
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Nay, let us abandon wrath and hope &mdash;deceitful counsellors &mdash;and commit ourselves and all our cause to a man of known fidelity!</quote></p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A shout of approval burst from every throat, and Titus Quinctius, advancing in front of the standards, announced that the soldiers would submit to the dictator's authority. He begged him to undertake the cause of his wretched fellow-citizens, and having done so to forward it with the same fidelity with which he had been used to deal with the interests of the state.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For himself privately, he said, he demanded no assurance, he had no wish to found a hope on aught but innocence. But the soldiers must be assured, as in their fathers' day the plebs had been, and, on a second occasion, the legions, that they should not be punished for secession.<note>Livy said nothing of such a stipulation at the time of the first reconciliation; for the circumstances attending the second, see II. liv.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After praising Quinctius and bidding the rest be of good cheer, the dictator galloped back to the City, and having secured the authority of the <pb id="p.511"/>Fathers, got the people to enact a law, in the<note type="marg">B.C. 342</note> Peteline Wood,<note><hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> vI. xx. 11 and note there.</note> that none of the soldiers should be held to answer for the secession.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He begged them also, as citizens, to grant him the favour that none would make the incident a matter of reproach to any, either in jest or in earnest. There was also passed a military law, under penalty of devotion,<note>Whoever broke a <hi rend="italics">lex sacrata</hi> was <hi rend="italics">ipso facto</hi> consecrated to the lower gods, and became an outlaw.</note> to the effect that the name of no one enrolled as a soldier might be struck off the list, except with his own consent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To this a provision was added that no one might later command a century in the legion where he had been a military tribune.<note>The law protected insolvent debtors, whose goods might not be seized so long as they were in the service, and also assured the soldier of his rightful share of such emoluments as the campaign might produce. With regard to the addition, the commentators are doubtful what its object was; perhaps it was felt as unfair to the rest that one who had enjoyed the (elective) tribuneship should next year be appointed to the but slightly less desirable post of first centurion.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This clause was demanded by the conspirators on account of Publius Salonius, who in almost regular alternation was tribune of the soldiers one year, and chief centurion &mdash;whom they now call <quote>centurion of the first javelin</quote> &mdash;the next. The men were incensed at Salonius because lie had always opposed their mutinous schemes, and had fled from Lautulae that he might not share in them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so, when this one provision would have failed of enactment by the senate, out of consideration for Salonius, he himself besought the Fathers not to think more highly of his distinction than of harmony in the state, and induced them to pass this also.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> An equally shameless demand was made that the pay of the cavalry should be reduced &mdash;they served at that time for treble pay &mdash;on the ground that they had opposed the conspiracy.</p> 
			<p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In addition to these transactions, I find in certain writers that Lucius Genucius, a tribune of the plebs, proposed to the plebs that it should be <pb id="p.513"/>unlawful to lend at interest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Also that it was<note type="marg">B. C.342</note> provided in other plebiscites that no one might hold the same office twice within ten years, nor two offices in one year; and that it should be legal for both consuls to be chosen from the plebs. If all these concessions were made to the commons, it is evident that the revolt possessed no little strength.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Other annalists have recorded that Valerius was not made dictator, but that the whole affair was managed through the consuls, and that it was not before they came to Rome, but in Rome, that this great company of conspirators was dismayed into arming;
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> further, that the night attack was made, not on the farm of Titus Quinctius, but on the town house of Gaius Manlius, and that it was he whom the conspirators seized and made their leader. Thence they proceeded &mdash;according to this account &mdash;to the fourth milestone, where they entrenched a camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor was it the leaders who suggested a reconciliation, but suddenly, when the two armies had marched out in
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> battle array, salutations were exchanged, and the soldiers, mingling together, began tearfully to clasp hands and embrace each other, so that the consuls, seeing the men to be in no mood for fighting, had been compelled to lay proposals before the senate for the re-establishment of harmony.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus in no single instance do the ancient authorities agree, except that there was a sedition, and that it was composed.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The report of this sedition, in conjunction with the dangerous war entered upon with the Samnites, caused several nations to forsake their alliance with the Romans, and not only were the Latins unfaithful to the treaty &mdash;as they had been for some time &mdash;but the Privernates even, in a sudden raid, laid waste the neighbouring Roman colonies of Norba and Setia.</p></div1> <pb id="p.515"/>
		<div1 type="book" n="7s"><head>Summary of Book VII</head>
			<p>Two new magistracies were added, the praetorship and
				the curule aedileship. The citizens were afflicted with a
				pestilence, and this the death of Furius Camillus rendered
				memorable. While a remedy for stopping it was being
				sought in new religious observances, scenic exhibitions were
				given for the first time. Lucius Manlius having been cited
				by Marcus Pomponius, tribune of the plebs, to answer for
				his ruthless conduct of the levy and for having relegated
				his son to the country without making any charge against
				him, the young man himself whose relegation was being
				used against his father entered the bed-room of the
				tribune, and drawing his sword, compelled him to swear,
				after a form which he dictated to him, that he would
				not go on with the prosecution. At this time all sorts of
				precious things were cast into a chasm which had opened
				to a great depth in Rome. Into it leaped Curtius, fully
				armed and bestriding his horse; and so it was closed
				over. Titus Manlius, the youth who had saved his father
				from the persecution of the tribune, went down to confront
				a Gaul who had challenged any Roman soldier to single
				combat; and, having slain him, took from him a golden
				necklace, which he afterwards wore himself and from it
				was given the name of Torquatus. Two tribes were
				added, the Pomptina and the Publilia. Licinius Stolo
				was condemned, under a statute that had been enacted,
				because he possessed more than five hundred <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> of land.
				Marcus Valerius, a tribune of the soldiers, killed a Gaul
				by whom he had been challenged, while a raven perched
				on the Roman's crest and with beak and talons attacked
				his enemy; from this circumstance he received the name
				of Corvus, and the next year was, for his bravery, elected
				<pb id="p.517"/>
				consul, at the age of twenty-three. Friendship was made
				with the Carthaginians. The Campanians, when hard
				pressed in war by the Samnites, asked aid against them from
				the senate, and, failing to obtain it, surrendered their city
				and territory to the Roman People. In view of this action,
				the Roman People voted to go to war with the Samnites, to
				defend these their possessions. The army was led by
				Aulus Cornelius, the consul, into a difficult position, and
				was in great danger, but was saved by the act of Publius
				Decius Mus, a tribune of the soldiers, who by occupying a
				hill which commanded the ridge on which the Samnites had
				encamped, afforded the consul an opportunity of withdrawing to more favourable ground; after which, though
				encircled by the enemy, Decius himself broke through.
				The Roman soldiers who had been left in garrison at Capua
				conspired to seize the city, and fearful of punishment, on
				the detection of their crime, revolted from the Roman
				People, but were restored to their country through the
				influence of the dictator, Marcus Valerius Corvus, who
				by his counsel had recalled them from their madness.
				The book also comprises victorious campaigns against
				the Hernici, Gauls, Tiburtes, Privernates, Tarquinienses,
				Samnites, and Volsci.</p></div1>
