				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's preface</head>
					<p>Little need be added to the Translator's Preface
						of the preceding volume. My resources, problems,
						aims and methods of work are essentially those
						there described, and no significant additions to the
						literature have come to my attention. I content
						myself, therefore, with reference to the appropriate
						sections of the Preface of Volume IX.</p>
					<p>Two points, however, may be mentioned. In two
						important particulars the Periocha differs from the
						continuous text. Livy (XXXV. xiv. 5-12) quotes
						the famous conversation between Africanus and
						Hannibal, with some apparent doubts as to its
						authenticity; the author of the Periocha is not so
						troubled. The difference in the account of the
						dedication of the temple of the Magna Mater is
						more serious. Livy (XXXVI. xxxvi. 4) says that it
						was dedicated by Brutus; the author of the Periocha
						assigns that distinction to Scipio Nasica. These
						variations raise the puzzling question of the relation
						of the Periochae to the continuous text, but I have
						not found space to discuss it at length.</p>
					<p>The ever-troublesome problem of chronology becomes more serious in these Books. Livy seems
						happily unaware of it, but the translator with the
						most modest ambitions is painfully conscious of it
						while he recognizes his inability to solve it. It is
						<pb n="viii"/>
						fortunate for him as for the Romans that intercalation was resorted to before matters grew worse.
						I have devoted to this problem the minimum of
						attention.</p>
					<p>Maps 1 and 2, identical with the corresponding
						maps in Volume IX, are the work of Mr. Foster.</p>
					<p>I express my gratitude to him, as to my colleagues, Professor Adalaide J. Wegner and Dr. Nancy
						Margaret Miller, for assistance at various points,
						and to my son, Robert L. Sage, of the Oriental
						Institute, University of Chicago, for aid, particularly
						with the place-names of Asia Minor.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Introductory Note</head>
					<p>In the Introductory Note to Volume IX I tried to
						picture with the maximum of simplicity the semianarchy prevailing in the eastern Mediterranean
						when Roman armies first showed themselves seriously
						in Greece. The Books contained in that volume
						give us the record of Rome's first large-scale contacts with the east, her defeat of Philip, the liberation of Greece, and her effort&mdash;which seems to me
						entirely genuine&mdash;to retire from Greece with clean
						hands.</p>
					<p>There is no pause in Livy's narrative at the end
						of Book XXXIV, and no Roman of that time had
						the opportunity which I enjoy to recapitulate and
						to reflect on the course he was following. Nevertheless, it seems worth while to review the results
						of the defeat of Philip. The independent Asiatic
						states of Pergamum and Rhodes had co-operated
						with Rome but without compensation. Ptolemy
						had been friendly to Rome though he had not been
						called upon to demonstrate his loyalty in the field.
						Antiochus had shown unmistakable signs of his intentions by his attacks on the possessions of Ptolemy
						in Asia Minor and on the Greek cities of that region
						and by his territorial ambitions in Europe. Philip
						had been defeated but had suffered no territorial
						losses except in Greece. These were the major
						components of the empire of Alexander.</p>
					<pb n="x"/>
					<p>Within Greece there was no longer a pro-Macedonian party in any effective sense. The liberation
						of the Greek cities did not prevent attempts to
						coerce them into joining the Aetolian and Achaean
						Leagues which practically dominated Greece.
						Athens at this period relapsed into relative obscurity,
						emerging occasionally as a futile peace-maker. The
						half-hearted attempt of the Romans to destroy
						Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, made him the more ready
						to rise to the bait of the Aetolians.</p>
					<p>While the Achaeans remained faithful to their
						Roman alliance, the Aetolians assumed the leadership
						in the effort to unite all the anti-Roman elements.
						Dissatisfied with their own meagre gains after
						Cynoscephalae and repeatedly offended by Flamininus, who had no disposition to be criticized, their
						discontent was generally known, and it was clear
						that their best policy was to seek the aid of Antiochus.
						The organization of Greece carried out under the
						direction of Flamininus had been aristocratic in
						character, and the Aetolians had much reason to
						count on the economic inequalities which were thus
						accentuated and on the violent party-spirit of the
						Greeks. They then undertook to fuse into one
						organic mass all the diversified elements which for
						conflicting reasons wished to end Roman influence
						in Greece and the east generally. Nabis and
						Antiochus were easily won over; Philip, surprisingly,
						would not join them; the Achaean League remained
						loyal to Rome, and if there were undercurrents of
						party strife within the Greek cities Livy is generally
						unconscious of them, and the pro-Roman parties,
						with the help of the Romans, were successful in
						suppressing their opponents.</p>
					<pb n="xi"/>
					<p>A war between the Romans and Antiochus was
						probably inevitable even if the Aetolians had not
						taken the initiative. Antiochus had been allied
						with Philip against Ptolemy; he menaced Rome's
						friends in Rhodes and Pergamum; Rhodes was the
						potential champion of the Greek cities of Ionia;
						Hannibal was numbered among his counsellors.
						The most naive reader cannot be surprised that
						Antiochus is the protagonist of the drama of this
						volume.</p>
					<p>Whether Rome was willing to accept the part
						thrust upon her is an academic question. I cannot
						believe that she realized the possible consequences
						of her intervention in the larger eastern world,
						and the complexities of personal ambitions and
						internal politics made the realization impossible.
						Perhaps a disinterested and unambitious conqueror
						has at all times been an anachronism.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the year in which these<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> events occurred, Sextus Digitius, praetor in Hither Spain,<note>For the assignment of Digitius to Hither Spain, see XXXIV. xliii. 7.</note> fought battles, numerous rather than memorable, with the tribes which had, in great numbers, revolted after the departure of Marcus Cato,<note>For Cato's campaign in Spain, see XXXIV. xi-xxi; for his return and triumph, XXXIV. xlvi. 2.</note> and most of these engagements were so unfortunate
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> in result that he turned over to his successor barely half as many soldiers as he had received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor is there any doubt that all Spain would have taken courage to rebel had not the other praetor, Publius Cornelius Scipio, the son of Gnaeus,<note>Scipio's appointment to Farther Spain was reported at XXXIV. xliii. 7; the term <quote>propraetor</quote> below is used to describe his status, probably informal, during the period between the expiration of his term and the arrival of his successor, since no prorogation of his command is recorded.</note> fought many successful battles beyond the Ebro and so intimidated the natives that not less than fifty towns surrendered to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These were Scipio's achievements as praetor;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> when he was propraetor he fell upon the Lusitani as they were returning home after plundering the farther province, laden with much spoil, while they were still on the march, and from the third hour of the day to the eighth maintained an indecisive action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was unequal in number of <pb id="p.5"/>troops, superior in all else; for with his troops in a<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> compact body he had clashed with a column long drawn out and hindered by the great
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> number of its pack-animals, and he fought with fresh troops against an enemy worn out by a long march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For they had set out during the third watch; three daylight hours had been added to their night march, and the battle had followed at once upon the labour of the journey, with no time given for repose. Accordingly, only at the outset of the fight did they retain some energy of mind and body, and at first they had thrown the Romans into confusion; later the battle became gradually more even.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At this crisis the propraetor vowed games to Jupiter<note>The performance of this vow is recorded at XXXVI. xxxvi. 1-2 (<date value="-191">191 B.C.</date>).</note> if he should rout and slaughter the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At length the Romans pressed on with greater vigour and the Lusitani gave way and finally fled; and while the victors pursued the fleeing foe, about twelve thousand of the enemy were killed, five
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> hundred forty were taken prisoners, almost all cavalry, and one hundred thirty-four standards were captured. From the Roman army seventy-three were lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The battle was fought not far from the city of Ilipa;<note>This city is probably identical with that called <foreign lang="greek">)/Illipa mega/lh</foreign> by Ptolemy (
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>iv. 13; cf. Plin. <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 11), on the river Baetis. It is now Alcala del Rio.</note> thither Publius Cornelius led the army flushed with victory and enriched with spoils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> All the booty was exposed to view before the city, and the opportunity was afforded the owners of identifying their property; the rest was turned over to the quaestor to sell and the proceeds were divided among the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>II. Gaius Flaminius<note>Flaminius had been assigned to Hither Spain (XXXIV. lv. 6).</note> had not yet left Rome when this happened in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Therefore defeat rather than victory was the constant burden of the talk of <pb id="p.7"/>him and his friends, and, since a great war had<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> flared up in the province and he was to take over from Sextus Digitius the scanty remnants of his army, and even these filled with panic and terror, he had tried to induce them to decree to him one of the city-legions,<note>The <hi rend="italics">urbanae legiones</hi> were reserve troops, to be employed where need arose: cf. XXXIV. lvi. 4.</note> and when he had added to this the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> force which he had enlisted in accordance with the decree of the senate, that he should choose from the whole number six thousand two hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry: with this legion &mdash;for little confidence could be placed in the army of Sextus Digitius &mdash;he would carry on the campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The elders declared that no decree of the senate should be passed on the basis of rumours causelessly invented by private individuals to gratify magistrates;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> unless either the praetors should send reports from the provinces or their legates bring word, nothing should be considered settled; if an emergency existed in Spain, it was their will that the praetor should enlist emergency troops outside of Italy. It was the senate's intention that these emergency troops should be raised in Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Valerius Antias writes that Gaius Flaminius sailed also to Sicily to conduct his levy and that on his way from Sicily to Spain he was driven by a storm to Africa and administered the oath to stragglers from the army of Publius Africanus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that to the contingents from these two provinces he added a third in Spain.<note>The conduct of Flaminius with respect to the levies in Sicily and Africa appears to have been irregular, but there is no indication that the senate took cognizance of it, perhaps because of the vagueness of their own phrase <hi rend="italics">extra Italiam.</hi> Scipio's soldiers had been in Africa since <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date></note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nor was the war with the Ligures in Italy any slower to begin. Pisa was already besieged by about forty thousand men, large numbers daily pouring in by reason of the report of the war and in <pb id="p.9"/>the hope of booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul Minucius arrived at<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> Arretium on the day on which he had ordered the troops to assemble.<note>Cf. XXXIV. lvi. 4.</note> Thence he led the force in a hollow-square formation toward Pisa, and since the enemy had moved their camp across the river,<note>This is apparently the Auser river (Plin. <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 50), now the Serchio, which once emptied into the Arno near by.</note> no more than a mile from the town, the consul marched into the city that had without doubt been saved by his arrival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The next day he too crossed the river and encamped about five hundred paces from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From this base he defended the allies' country from ravage by fighting petty battles; he did not dare to march out in battle-line with raw troops, collected from many tribes and not yet well enough known to one another to feel confidence in their comrades.<note>This statement is difficult to accept, in view of the fact that the major component of his force was the two <hi rend="italics">urbanae legiones</hi> of the year before: cf. the note to ii. 3 above. The Romans, like modern commanders, stressed the necessity of homogeneity and mutual confidence in combatant troops.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Ligures both marched out to battle, trusting in their numbers and prepared to risk a decisive engagement, and, since they had abundance of men, sent out many parties to plunder in all directions on the borders of the territory,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> and when a large number of animals and much booty had been collected, guards were available to conduct them to their forts and villages.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Ligurian war was at a standstill around Pisa, the other consul, Lucius Cornelius Merula, led his army through the farthest lands of the Ligures into the country of the Boii, where the war was conducted in a fashion far different from that in the war with the Ligures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul marched out to offer battle, the enemy declined to engage; the Romans scattered to plunder when no one confronted them, and the Boii preferred the <pb id="p.11"/>devastation of their lands without interference on their<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> part to the risk of a decisive battle while protecting them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When everything had been sufficiently wasted with sword and fire, the consul retired from the enemy's country and marched toward Mutina, his column taking no precautions as if it was traversing a pacified country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the Boii saw that the enemy had withdrawn from their territory, they followed stealthily, seeking a place for an ambush. At night they passed the Roman camp and seized a defile through which the Romans had to march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Since their precautions for secrecy were insufficient, the consul, who had been accustomed to break camp late in the night, waited for daylight, that darkness might not increase the terror from a sudden attack, and, although he was moving by day, he nevertheless sent out a troop of cavalry to reconnoitre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When word came back how strong the enemy was and where he was stationed, he ordered the baggage of the whole column brought into the midst and the <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi><note>The soldiers in the third line of the legionary battleformation.</note> to construct a rampart around it, and with the remainder of the army in battle-array marched towards the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Gauls did the same when they realized that their stratagem was discovered and that they would have to fight in regular and fair combat where constant courage would conquer.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the second hour the battle began. The left squadron<note>Cf. XXXI. xxi. 7; the <hi rend="italics">dextra ala</hi> in this case was apparently with the Roman legions: see sect. 6 below.</note> of the allies and the irregular troops<note>These troops were not an organic part of the legion: cf. XXXIV. xlvii. 4 and the note.</note> were fighting in the front line; their commanders were two lieutenants of consular rank, Marcus Marcellus<note>Probably the consul of <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxv. 4).</note> and Tiberius Sempronius,<note>Cf. XXXIV. xlii. 3.</note> consul of the preceding year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The new consul was now with the leading standards, now holding back the legions <pb id="p.13"/>in reserve, lest in their ardour for the fight they<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> should rush forward before the signal was given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He ordered two military tribunes, Quintus and Publius Minucius, to lead the cavalry of these legions beyond the flanks of the battle-line into open ground, whence, when the signal was given, they were to attack from the open.<note>The phrase <hi rend="italics">ex aperto</hi> does not repeat the idea of <hi rend="italics">in locum patentem</hi> above, but indicates that no ambuscade or masked attack was planned for the cavalry.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As he was thus engaged, a runner from Tiberius Sempronius Longus came to him, saying that the irregulars were not holding the Gallic attack
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> and that many of them had been killed and that those who were left, partly as a result of their exertions, partly from fear, had lost their zest for fighting. He should send in, if he saw fit, one of the two legions before a disgraceful defeat was sustained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The second legion was sent forward and the irregular troops relieved.<note>The man&oelig;uvre is that known as <quote>passing through</quote> friendly troops, each unit moving through the intervals separating the maniples of the corresponding element.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then the battle was restored, since fresh troops, a legion with full ranks, had entered the fight; and the left squadron was withdrawn from the battle and the right took its place in the battle-line. The sun with its fierce rays scorched the bodies of the Gauls, which were little capable of enduring heat; nevertheless, in dense ranks, resting now on one another, now on their shields, they withstood the attacks of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the consul saw this, he ordered Gaius Livius Salinator,<note>Cf. xxiv. 6 below.</note> who commanded the auxiliary cavalry, to charge at the utmost speed, the legionary cavalry to be in support.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This storm of horsemen at first threw the battle-line of the Gauls into confusion and disorder, then scattered it, but without causing a rout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The captains prevented this, striking with their staffs the backs of the terror-stricken and forcing them back into the line, but the auxiliary cavalry, riding among them, would not allow this.<note>That is, would not permit the enemy to reorganize their line.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The <pb id="p.15"/>consul urged the troops to make a little more effort;<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> victory, he said, was in their grasp; they should press on while they saw the enemy disordered and in terror; if they permitted the ranks to be reformed they would fight again a new and doubtful battle. He ordered the standard-bearers to advance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> All joined in the effort and at last turned the enemy to flight. As they were fleeing and scattering this way and that in rout, at that moment the legionary cavalry was let loose to pursue them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Fourteen thousand of the Boii perished on that day; one thousand and ninety-two were captured alive, seven hundred and twenty-one cavalrymen, with three of their commanders, two hundred and twelve standards and sixty-three carts were taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But for the Romans the victory was not bloodless; more than five thousand of the soldiers, Romans and allies, fell, twenty-three centurions, four commanders of allies, and Marcus Genucius and Quintus and Marcus Marcius, military tribunes of the second legion.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the same time letters from the two consuls arrived at Rome, one from Lucius Cornelius reporting the battle with the Boii near Mutina, the other from Quintus Minucius from Pisa:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the latter said that it had fallen to his lot to preside at the consular elections,<note>If both consuls were ordered away from Rome, it was necessary for them to decide by lot which should return to preside at the elections.</note> but so unsettled were conditions generally among the Ligures that he could not leave there without loss to the allies and danger to the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If it pleased the Fathers, they should write to his colleague, who had finished his campaign, to return to Rome for the elections;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> if he protested against doing this, because the task had not fallen to him by lot, he would himself do the senate's bidding; only let the senate consider again <pb id="p.17"/>and again whether an interregnum<note>This device had rarely been resorted to in recent years. Members of the senate were chosen in order to serve for five days each, and the <hi rend="italics">interrex</hi> (the name survived from the period of the monarchy) either held the election or nominated another <hi rend="italics">interrex.</hi> Minucius' proposal probably had some political motive, but the facts are unknown.</note> would not be<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> more advantageous to the state than his absence from his province at such a time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate entrusted to Gaius Scribonius the task of sending two commissioners from the senatorial order to Lucius Cornelius the consul, to deliver to him the letter forwarded by his colleague to the senate, and to inform him that if he did not
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> come to Rome to elect the magistrates the senate, rather than take Quintus Minucius away from an unfinished war, would suffer an interregnum to begin. The commissioners who were sent brought back the reply that Lucius Cornelius would come to Rome to choose the magistrates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Regarding the despatches of Lucius Cornelius, which he had written after he had fought the battle with the Boii, a controversy broke out in
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the senate because his lieutenant, Marcus Claudius,<note>The M. Marcellus of v. 1 above. Marcellus as consul had fought the Gauls with indifferent success, although he had been granted a triumph over the Insubres and Comenses (XXXIII. xxxvii. 10). We have no means of verifying either the account which Livy gives of the battle (which is on the whole sympathetic towards Cornelius) or Marcellus' less favourable interpretation, which may have been inspired partly by jealousy, partly by political rivalry. This, however, did not prevent Cornelius from leaving him in command, although there was a hostile explanation of this action: cf. viii. 1-5 and the note below.</note> had written privately to many senators that gratitude was due to the good fortune of the Roman people and the valour of the soldiers because the issue had been successful;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but that by the action of the consul, both heavy losses of men had occurred and the army of the enemy had escaped, though there had been the opportunity to destroy it; the loss of men had been heavier since troops to replace the exhausted had come up too slowly from the reserve;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the enemy had slipped from their hands both because the legionary cavalry had received their orders too ate and because they had not been permitted to pursue the fleeing enemy.</p> <pb id="p.19"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Regarding this matter, it was decreed that<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> no unconsidered action should be taken; the decision was postponed for a fuller meeting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was due to the fact that another anxiety was weighing upon them &mdash;that the public was burdened by interest-payments,<note>Creditors had found a device for collecting rates of interest higher than those allowed by law (cf. VII. xvi. 1, etc.), by transferring the ownership of accounts to subjects of allied states, who thus became the real or fictitious lenders. The procedure was to make suitable entries on the creditors' ledgers. The legislation now adopted made such transactions between citizens and allies matters of public record (and, presumably, enforceable only when so recorded). Litigation arising therefrom favoured the debtor, and the plebiscite of Sempronius made the Roman code obligatory.</note> and that, although greed was held in check by numerous laws governing usury, a way of evasion was opened because accounts were transferred to allies, who were not under the operation of these laws;<note>The laws referred to formed parts of the <hi rend="italics">ius civile,</hi> which applied only to <hi rend="italics">cives</hi> and was enforced by the <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus.</hi> Cases to which allies were parties were tried before the <hi rend="italics">praetor peregrinus,</hi> and the provisions of the <hi rend="italics">ius civile</hi> were not binding.</note> thus debtors were overwhelmed with unrestricted charges.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When a method of curbing this practice was sought, it was determined that a day should be fixed, namely, the last occurrence of the festival of the Feralia,<note>This festival was held on February 21.</note> that whatever allies had, after that date, loaned money to Roman citizens, should make a public statement to that effect, and that proceedings regarding money so loaned after that date should be
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> governed by the laws of whichever state the debtor should elect.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then, after the greatness of the debt contracted by this evasion was revealed by these public declarations, Marcus Sempronius, tribune of the people, with the authorization of the senate proposed to the assembly, and the assembly voted, that the allies of the Latin confederacy should have the same law regarding the loan of money that applied to Roman citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Such were the events, civil and military, which took place in Italy.</p> 
				<p>In Spain the war was by no means so serious as the exaggerated report of it had been.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Gaius Flaminius in Hither Spain captured the town of Inlucia in the land of the Oretani and then <pb id="p.21"/>conducted the troops to their winter stations, and during<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> the winter fought several battles, unworthy of record, against raiding parties of brigands rather than soldiers, with varying results but not without the loss of men. Greater things were done by Marcus Fulvius.<note>His appointment to Farther Spain was recorded at XXXIV. lv. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Near the town of Toletum he engaged the Vaccaei, the Vettones and the Celtiberi in pitched battle, routed and put to flight the armies of these tribes, and captured alive their king Hilernus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on in Spain, the day of the elections was drawing near. And so Lucius Cornelius the consul left Marcus Claudius with the army and returned to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he had discoursed in the senate about his achievements and the condition in which his province was, he voiced a complaint
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to the Fathers because, after so great a war had been so successfully finished by a single victory, no honour had been paid to the immortal gods. He then demanded that they decree a thanksgiving and a triumph at the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Before, however, the formal motion was put, Quintus Metellus, who had been consul and dictator,<note>Metellus was consul in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date> (XXVIII. x. 2) and dictator in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXIX. x. 2).</note> said that letters had arrived at the same time, addressed both to the senate by Lucius Cornelius and to a great part of the senators by Marcus Marcellus, that these reports contradicted one another, and that a decision had been postponed for the reason that the debate might be held in the presence of the writers of these letters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had accordingly assumed that the consul, who knew that something unfavourable to himself had been written by his subordinate, since he had himself to come to Rome, would bring his lieutenant with him to the City, especially as it would have been more correct to entrust
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the army <pb id="p.23"/>to Tiberius Sempronius, who had the <hi rend="italics">imperium,</hi><note>Sempronius had been consul the preceding year and no prorogation of his <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> is recorded; his successor had arrived, and nothing is known to indicate that Metellus' statement is accurate.

See also the note on vi. 9 above.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> than to a
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> lieutenant: as matters stood, it seemed that he had wilfully kept away a man who, if he made in person the statement which he had made in writing, might both bring his charges openly and, supposing he asserted what was untrue, be himself charged, until the truth was clearly revealed. It was his proposal, therefore, that nothing which the consul demanded should be decreed for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> present. When he pressed his claims with undiminished vigour, that the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> thanksgiving be voted and that he be allowed to ride into the City in triumph, Marcus and Gaius Titinius, tribunes of the people, declared that they would veto it if any decree of the senate were passed regarding the question.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Censors had been elected the previous year, Sextus Aelius Paetus and Gaius Cornelius Cethegus.<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The number of citizens rated was one hundred forty-three thousand seven hundred four.<note>While the MSS. give the number thus, some editors follow Pighius in prefixing an additional <hi rend="italics">C</hi> to the numeral.

The fluctuation is so great that the emendation is probably correct. I have, however, kept the reading of the MSS. despite the fact that numerals are notoriously liable to corruption.</note> There were great floods that year, and the Tiber overflowed the flat parts of the City; around the Porta Flumentana certain buildings even collapsed and fell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Also, the Porta Caelimontana was smitten by a thunderbolt and the wall in several places round about was struck by <pb id="p.25"/>lightning;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and at Aricia, at Lanuvium and on the Aventine<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> there were showers of stones; it was also reported from Capua that a great swarm of wasps had flown into the forum and settled in the temple of Mars; the wasps, it was said, were carefully collected and consumed by fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By reason of these prodigies the decemvirs were directed to consult the Books,<note>The Sibylline Books, as often: cf. XXXI. xii. 9 and the note.</note> and a nine-day sacrifice was performed, a supplication proclaimed, and the City purified.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the same time a shrine to Victoria Virgo near the temple of Victory was dedicated by Marcus Porcius Cato, two years after he had vowed it.<note>Two temples to Victoria are known, one on the Capitoline, one on the Palatine.

The allotments of land could have been thirty <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> per infantryman and sixty per cavalryman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the suggestion of Apustius one-third of the land was reserved, whereby they were enabled later to enroll new colonists if they saw fit. Twenty <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> were given to each infantryman, forty to each cavalryman.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now the end of the year, and canvassing at the consular election was more spirited than ever before.<note>Probably for this reason we have an unusually detailed account of the campaign and we get a clear impression of the arguments employed.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The candidates were many and <pb id="p.27"/>influential, patricians and plebeians,<note>The Licinian-Sextian legislation of <date value="-367">367 B.C.</date> provided that one consul must be a plebeian and both might be. It was customary to elect one from each order.</note> Publius Cornelius<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> Scipio, the son of Gnaeus, who had recently returned from Spain after performing great deeds,<note>Cf. i. 3 ff. above.</note> and Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, who had commanded the fleet in Greece,<note>Cf. XXXII. xvi. 9, etc.</note> and Gnaeus Manlius Volso;<note>He had been praetor in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xlii. 7).</note> these were the patricians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the plebeians now were Gaius Laelius,<note>Laelius was the most intimate friend of Scipio Africanus. He had entered politics late and had been praetor in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxiv. 2).</note> Gnaeus Domitius,<note>He was praetor in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date> (XXXIV. xlii. 4).</note> Gaius Livius Salinator,<note>Probably, but not certainly, the man mentioned in v. 8 above.</note> and Manius Acilius.<note>He had been plebeian aedile in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxv. 2). The circumstantial quality of Livy's details increases our confidence in his accuracy in the account of the campaign.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the eyes of all men were turned upon Quinctius and Cornelius; for both were patricians, contending for one place, and recently-won military glory lent favour to each. But before all else, the brothers of the candidates<note>Africanus and Nasica were actually cousins, but Roman nomenclature is sometimes slightly vague on such points. The Flaminini were real brothers, as the antithesis in sect. 8 (<hi rend="italics">fratre germano non patrueli</hi>) shows.</note> increased their rivalry, since they were the two most celebrated commanders of their age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The greater fame was Scipio's, and the greater it was, the more it was exposed to jealousy; that of Quinctius was fresher, inasmuch as he had triumphed that very year.<note>Cf. XXXIV. lii. 4 ff.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was also the fact that the other had been for about ten years constantly in the public eye, a fact which renders prominent men less venerated from sheer surfeit of seeing them: he had been consul for the second time after the defeat of Hannibal and censor;<note>His second consulship was in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date>, his censorship in <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date></note> in the case of Quinctius, everything was new and fresh for winning favour;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he had neither asked anything from the people since his triumph nor obtained anything. He said that he was campaigning for a real brother, not a cousin, <pb id="p.29"/>for his lieutenant and a sharer in the conduct of the<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> war;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he on land, his brother on the sea, had conducted the operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> By such arguments he brought it to pass that his brother was preferred to the candidate whom his brother, Africanus, favoured, whom the Cornelian gens supported, while a consul Cornelius presided at the election, and who was honoured with so powerful a preliminary recommendation from the senate, which chose him as the best man of the state to receive the Idaean Mother when she came from Pessinus to Rome.<note>Cf. XXIX. xiv. 8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Lucius Quinctius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus were chosen consuls: so little weight did Africanus have even in the selection of the plebeian consul, although he was working for Gaius Laelius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day the praetors were chosen, Lucius Scribonius Libo, Marcus Fulvius Centumalus, Aulus Atilius Serranus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, Lucius Valerius Tappo, Quintus Salonius Sarra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The aedileship of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Lucius Aemilius Paulus was notable that year; they condemned many grazers;<note>I.e., for trespassing on public lands which they had not leased: cf. e.g., XXXIII. xlii. 10.</note> out of the fines they set up gilded shields on the roof of the temple of Jupiter, constructed one portico outside the Porta Trigemina, adding a wharf on the Tiber, and another portico from the Porta Fontinalis to the altar of Mars, where the way led into the Campus Martius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For a long time nothing worth recording occurred among the Ligures; but at the end of this year on two occasions situations of grave peril arose, for in
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the first place the consul's camp was assailed and with difficulty defended, and a little later, when the Roman column was being led through a narrow glade, the very exit was blocked by an army of <pb id="p.31"/>the Ligures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since the way there was not open,<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> the consul began to move to the rear and retrace his steps. In the rear too the exit of the pass was closed by part of the enemy, and visions of the Caudine disaster<note>A Roman army had been entrapped in the pass of Caudium in <date value="-321">321 B.C.</date> and had been captured and sent under the yoke.</note> not only flitted through their minds but also appeared before their eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had about eight hundred Numidian cavalry among the auxiliaries. Their commander promised the consul that he and his men would break through wherever he wished, if only the consul would inform him on which side the towns were more numerous;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he would attack them and give his first attention to setting fire to the buildings, that the alarm might compel the Ligures to withdraw from the pass which they were holding and scatter to aid their friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul praised him and loaded him with hopes of reward. The Numidians mounted their horses and began to ride up to the outposts of the enemy, attacking no one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first nothing was more contemptible than their appearance: horses and men were tiny and gaunt; the riders unequipped and unarmed, except that they carried javelins with them; the horses without bridles, their very motion being the ugly gait of animals running with stiff necks and outstretched heads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Purposely making themselves more contemptible, they would fall from their horses and make themselves a spectacle to be jeered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So those who had been in the outposts, eager and ready if they should be attacked, now for the most part sat unarmed and watching the show.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Numidians kept riding up to them, then retiring, but coming gradually closer to the pass, like men incapable of controlling their horses and carried by them against their will.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At last they applied their <pb id="p.33"/>spurs and burst through the midst of the enemy's<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> outposts, and riding out into the more open country set fire to all the buildings along the road; then they hurled their torches upon the nearest village; with sword and fire they ravaged everything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> First the smoke was seen, then the shouts of frightened villagers were heard, and finally the fleeing elders and children caused panic in the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And so without design, without orders, each for himself hurried to defend his own, and in a moment the camp was abandoned and the consul, freed from siege, arrived at his intended destination.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But neither the Boii nor the Spaniards, with whom war was carried on that year, were so hostile and so dangerous to the Romans as the people of the Aetolians.<note>Livy here turns to the Roman campaigns in the east, and for his annalistic sources he substitutes Polybius. A settlement in Greece had been effected by Flamininus after the defeat of Philip in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date>, but the Aetolians had been from the first dissatisfied with the arrangements (cf. XXXIV. xxiii. 5 ff., etc.), and grasped every opportunity to unsettle the minds of their neighbours. Their activity and its consequences are described in the following chapters.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the evacuation of Greece by the armies they had at first been in hopes that Antiochus would come to occupy masterless Europe<note>Livy here employs a legal phrase (<hi rend="italics">in vacuam possessionem intrare),</hi> used to express the act of taking possession of property which had no real or apparent owner (<hi rend="italics">dominus</hi>). Greece had been <quote>liberated</quote> by the Romans.</note> and that neither Philip<note>Philip was represented by the Aetolians as resentful at his defeat.</note> nor Nabis<note>Nabis was tyrant or king, according to the point of view, of Sparta.</note> would remain quiet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they saw that no movement was being made, thinking that some agitation and confusion should be caused, lest their scheming should become feeble from lack of exercise, they called a council at Naupactus.<note>This council was held late in the fall of <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date> or during the following winter, and Livy is gathering up and summarizing earlier events, preparatory to continuing the narrative.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There Thoas, their chief magistrate, complained of the injuries inflicted by the Romans and of the condition of Aetolia, because of all the states and cities of Greece they were the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> least honoured, after that victory for which they <pb id="p.35"/>themselves had been the chief cause, and proposed that<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> ambassadors should be sent around to the kings, who should not only sound out their sentiments but should rouse each, by proper inducements, to a Roman war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Damocritus was dispatched to Nabis, Nicander<note>Polybius (XXI. xxxi) gives his name as Mnestas.</note> to Philip, Dicaearchus, the praetor's brother, to Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To the Spartan tyrant Damocritus pointed out the weakening of the tyranny from the loss of the coast towns;<note>In XXXIV. xxxv, Livy gives the terms of peace between Rome and Nabis in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> There the loss of the coast towns is implied rather than expressly stated.</note> thence he had drawn soldiers, thence ships and naval allies; shut up, almost, within his own walls, he saw the Achaeans lording it in the Peloponnesus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he would never have a chance to recover his own if he let pass the one which then existed; there was, moreover, no Roman army in Greece; Gytheum and the other Spartan towns on the coast would not be considered by the Romans an adequate reason why they should again transport their legions to Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This was said to rouse the zeal of the tyrant, that, when Antiochus had crossed to Greece, the consciousness that the Roman friendship had been violated by the injuries done their allies might unite him with Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As to Philip, Nicander tried to provoke him by a somewhat similar argument; there was also more material for his persuasiveness, in proportion to the greater height from which the king had fallen, in comparison with the tyrant, and in proportion to the heavier losses he had suffered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In addition, he spoke of the ancient renown of the kings of Macedonia and the victorious progress of that race throughout the earth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He said, moreover, that the advice which he offered was safe, whether in the beginning or at the end: for he would not counsel Philip to move before Antiochus with his <pb id="p.37"/>army should cross to Greece, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> when he, who<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> without Antiochus had so long sustained the war against the Romans and the Aetolians, was joined by Antiochus and had as allies the Aetolians, who had been at that time more dangerous foes than the Romans, with what strength, pray, could the Romans withstand him?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He spoke further of the general Hannibal, born an enemy to the Romans, who had destroyed both their commanders and their soldiers in greater numbers than now remained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such was Nicander's message to Philip; Dicaearchus approached Antiochus in another fashion, and first of all he said that the booty from Philip had become the Romans', the victory was the Aetolians'; none other than the Aetolians had given the Romans ingress to Greece and furnished them with the strength to conquer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Finally, he told Antiochus how great forces, infantry and cavalry, they would furnish him for the war, what stations for his land forces, what harbours for his navies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Then he employed a gratuitous lie regarding Philip and Nabis: each was ready to rebel and would seize the earliest opportunity to regain what he had lost in war. Thus throughout the whole world at once the Aetolians were arousing war against the Romans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And the kings, nevertheless, either were unmoved or were moved too slowly; Nabis at once sent agents around all the maritime towns to stir up seditions in them, and some of the leading men he won over to his side by gifts, others, who stubbornly adhered to the Roman alliance, lie put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Achaeans had been entrusted with the responsibility for all maritime affairs in Sparta by Titus Quinctius,<note>This statement is not confirmed by explicit testimony. Technically, these cities, like the rest of Greece, were <hi rend="italics">socii</hi> of the Romans.</note> So immediately they sent <pb id="p.39"/>ambassadors to the tyrant to remind him of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> treaty and to warn him not to disturb the peace which he had so earnestly sought, and sent reinforcements to Gytheum, which was now being besieged by the tyrant, and ambassadors to Rome to report these doings.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>King Antiochus,<note>Livy makes no effort to report on the recent activities of Antiochus, the last mention of whom, save for the reference in the preceding chapter, was in XXXIV. lix. 8.</note> having given his daughter in marriage to King Ptolemy of Egypt at Raphia in Phoenicia during that winter,<note>This was apparently the winter of 194-<date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> Raphia lay to the south-west of Gaza, on the coast between Cilicia and Egypt, but not, strictly speaking, in Phoenicia.</note> when he had retired to Antioch, came by way of Cilicia, crossing the Taurus mountains well on towards the end of the winter, to Ephesus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> thence at the beginning of spring, sending his son Antiochus into Syria to guard the remotest parts of his kingdom, lest any disturbance behind him should occur in his absence, he himself set out with all his land forces to attack the Pisidae who dwell around Sida.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At that time the Roman commissioners, Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who had been sent to Antiochus, as has already been stated,<note>In XXXIV. lix. 8 the embassy consisted of Sulpicius, Villius and P. Aelius; the last is not mentioned in this Book. Sulpicius and Villius had commanded against Philip and were frequently employed on missions in the east.</note> having been ordered to visit Eumenes<note>Eumenes had succeeded Attalus as king of Pergamum in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxi; xxxiv. 10). Elaea was the port of his capital of Pergamum, which lay inland on higher ground (hence <hi rend="italics">escenderunt</hi>).</note> first, came to Elaea; thence they climbed up to Pergamum, where Eumenes' capital was located.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Eumenes was anxious for war against Antiochus, believing that a king so much more powerful than himself was a dangerous neighbour, if there was peace, and also that, if war should be provoked, he was no more likely to be a match for the Romans than Philip had been, and that either he would be utterly destroyed or, if peace were granted him
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> after he had been defeated, much that was <pb id="p.41"/>taken from Antiochus would fall to his own lot, so<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> that thenceforth he could easily defend himself against Antiochus without any Roman aid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Even if some misfortune should befall, it was better, he thought, to endure whatever fate with the Romans as allies than by himself either to submit to the sovereignty of Antiochus or, if he refused, to be compelled to do so by force of arms;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for these reasons with all his prestige and all his diplomatic skill he urged the Romans to war.<note>Frontiers were always vaguely defined in antiquity, as was inevitable when precise geographical information was scanty and maps practically unknown. The hopes of Eumenes for territorial gains after the defeat of Antiochus were realized in <date value="-188">188 B.C.</date> (XXXVIII. xxxviii-xxxix).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Sulpicius was ill and remained at Pergamum; but Villius, when he learned that the king was involved in the war in Pisidia, set out for Ephesus, and while he tarried there for a
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> few days he saw to it that he had frequent meetings with Hannibal,<note>The flight of Hannibal from Carthage to Syria was reported in XXXIV. lx ff.</note> who
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> happened to be there, that he might explore his sentiments and, if it was in any way possible, dispel his fear that any danger threatened him from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By these conversations nothing else was accomplished, yet it followed automatically, as if it had been consciously sought, that Hannibal, by reason of them, was less highly valued by the king and was more an object of suspicion in all respects.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Claudius, following the Greek history of Acilius,<note>The meaning of this phrase has been much debated, as has also the identification of this Claudius with Claudius Quadrigarius, who was one of the annalists used by Livy. I see no objection to taking the phrase literally, that Acilius (<hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> <date value="-150">150 B.C.</date>), who wrote a Roman history in Greek, was the source of Claudius, whether he be Claudius Quadrigarius, Claudius (Clodius) Licinus, or someone else. Nevertheless, the appearance of the same story in Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 10) suggests that the actual source of both Livy and Appian is Polybius, though the incident is not found in the extant portions of Polybius. There is an additional difficulty in the fact that Scipio was not, according to XXXIV. lix. 8, a member of this embassy, but Livy has omitted much of the narrative (cf. the note to xiii. 4 above), and there may have been other embassies: cf. the note to sect. 12 below.</note> reports that Publius Africanus was a member of that embassy and that at Ephesus he conferred with Hannibal, and he even relates one conversation:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.43"/>when Africanus asked who, in Hannibal's opinion,<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> was the greatest general, Hannibal named Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, because with a small
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> force he had routed armies innumerable and because he had traversed the most distant regions, even to see which transcended human hopes.<note>This seems to refer to Alexander's expeditions to Arabia and India.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To the next request, as to whom he would rank second, Hannibal selected Pyrrhus;<note>Pyrrhus' campaign in Italy was used to show the necessity for the invasion of Greece in the Second Macedonian War: cf. XXXI. vii. 8, etc.</note> saying that he had been the first to teach the art of castrametation;<note>Neither Plutarch nor Appian confirms this; rather, Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Pyrr.</hi> xvi. 5) says that Pyrrhus admired the skill of the Romans in laying out camps: cf. the similar remark of Philip, quoted by Livy at XXXI. xxxiv. 8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> besides, no one had chosen his ground or placed his troops more discriminatingly; he possessed also the art of winning men over to him, so that the Italian peoples preferred the lordship of a foreign king to that of the Roman people, so long the master in that land. When he continued, asking whom Hannibal considered third, he named himself without hesitation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then Scipio broke into a laugh and said, <quote>What would you say if you had defeated me?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <quote>Then, beyond doubt,</quote> he replied, <quote>I should place myself both before Alexander and before Pyrrhus and before all other generals.</quote><note>The story thus far is found, with slight changes, in Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 10) and Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Flamin.</hi> xxi), although the latter writer has another version (<hi rend="italics">Pyrr.</hi> ix) in which he names Pyrrhus, Scipio and Hannibal as the foremost commanders. An important item, omitted by Livy and Plutarch but included by Appian, gives the reasons of Hannibal for listing himself in third place. While the story is generally regarded to-day as apocryphal, the ranking as given by Livy may be genuine and represent Hannibal's considered judgment.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Both this response, with the unexpected turn given it by Punic cleverness,<note>Scipio's final question gives Hannibal an opening which he is quick to seize, for paying an indirect compliment to his conqueror. Appian also speaks of his <quote>delicate flattery</quote> of Scipio. Cf. also xlii. 8 below for another tribute to Hannibal's wit. An anecdote of him preserved by Cicero (<hi rend="italics">de or.</hi> II. 75), on the other hand, represents him as distinctly lacking in tact in his remarks about a rhetorician.</note> and this unlooked-for kind <pb id="p.45"/>of flattery, he says, stirred Scipio deeply, because<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> Hannibal had segregated him from all other commanders as one beyond estimation.<note>The value of this story for characterizing purposes is evident, and it would be pleasant if we could believe it. Cf. also the final sentence of the note to XXXVII. xlv. 16 below.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Villius proceeded from Ephesus to Apamea and there Antiochus came when he learned of the arrival of the Roman commissioners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At Apamea there was almost the same debate that had taken place in Rome between Quinctius and the king's ambassadors.<note>Cf. XXXIV. lvii-lix.</note> The announcement of the death of Antiochus, the king's son, who, as I had said just previously,<note>Cf. xiii. 5 above.</note> had been sent to Syria, broke off the conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was great grief at the court and great regret at the loss of the young man, for he had already shown such revelations of himself that it was clear that if longer life had been his fate the character of a great and just king would have been his.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The dearer and more pleasing he was to all, the more did his death cause a suspicion that his father, believing that such a successor, following close upon his own old age, would bring discredit upon him, had, through the agency of certain eunuchs, who, by their services in such crimes, commend themselves to kings, removed him by poison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They even furnished a cause for this secret crime, that he had given Lysimachia to his son Seleucus, but had not had a similar capital to bestow upon Antiochus, that he might banish him far from his presence even while conferring a mark of honour upon him.<note>The apparent meaning is that the king wished to get rid of his son, but could do so only by giving him a post of responsibility and dignity, at such a distance that accepting it amounted to going into exile.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless, a show of deep mourning filled the palace for some days, and the Roman ambassador, not to be an inconvenient visitor at an inopportune time, withdrew to Pergamum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king gave up the war that he had undertaken and returned to Ephesus. There, while the palace was closed during the <pb id="p.47"/>mourning, the king continued secretly plotting with<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> one Minnio, who was the chief of his friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Minnio, who was totally unacquainted with foreign affairs, and who judged the king's strength from events occurring in Syria or Asia, believed that Antiochus not only had a better cause, since the Roman demands were in no wise fair, but would conquer in war as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the king shunned a meeting with the commissioners, whether he had already found this debate unprofitable or because he was confused in mind by his recent grief, Minnio convinced him that he would say whatever was appropriate to the situation and that the commissioners should be summoned from Pergamum.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Sulpicius had now recovered, and so both came to Ephesus. Minnio apologized for the king's inability to be present, and in his absence the discussion began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then Minnio opened the debate with a prepared speech. <quote>I see, Romans,</quote> he said, <quote>that you employ the plausible pretext of liberating Greek states, but your actions are inconsistent with your words, and you lay down one rule of conduct for Antiochus but yourselves follow another.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For how are the people of Zmyrna and Lampsacus more Greek than the men of Naples or Rhegium or Tarentum, from whom you exact tribute, from whom you exact ships in accordance with treaty-stipulations?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Why do Syracuse and other Greek cities of Sicily receive every year a praetor with the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> and the rods and axes? Assuredly you make no other assertion than that you have imposed these conditions upon cities that have been conquered in battle.<note>The argument of the Macedonian ambassadors in XXXI. xxix should be compared.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Learn from Antiochus that the case is the same with Zmyrna and Lampsacus <pb id="p.49"/>and the cities which are in Ionia or Aeolis.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Conquered<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> in war by his forefathers<note>See the note to sect. 13 below.</note> and made tributaries and vassals, he restores them to their ancient status; therefore I wish that he be answered on these points, if this is a discussion based on equity and not a search for a pretext for war.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To this Sulpicius replied: <quote>Antiochus has acted modestly, who, if there is nothing else to be said on his behalf, has preferred that anyone else should say this rather than himself.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What likeness is there in the status of the states which you have mentioned? From the people of Rhegium and Naples and Tarentum we demand what they owe in accordance with the treaty from the time they came under our sovereignty, with one unbroken continuity of right, always recognized, never interrupted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Pray, can you say that as those peoples have changed the treaty neither through themselves nor through anyone else, so the Asian cities, when once they came into the possession of Antiochus' forefathers, have remained in the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> continuous possession of your empire, and that some have not passed under the power of Philip, some into the hands of Ptolemy, and some have enjoyed liberty with none to challenge them?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For if the fact that they have once been slaves, constrained by the injustice of the times, is to confer the right of reasserting control and forcing them into slavery after so many generations, how does this differ from saying that our labours have been fruitless, in that we have freed Greece from Philip and that his descendants may again demand Corinth, Chalcis, Demetrias, and the whole state of the Thessalians?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But why do I plead the cause of <pb id="p.51"/>these cities, which it is fairer
						<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> that both we and the<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> king should learn from their own pleadings?</quote><note>While there is a manifest fallacy in the argument, from our standpoint, it is sound from the Roman view-point. Roman law recognized <hi rend="italics">possessio,</hi> the unchallenged occupancy of property for a certain definite period (cf. the note to xii. 2 above), as a means of acquiring a good title to it. The Greek cities of Italy and Sicily, once conquered, had never effectively established their independence or transferred their allegiance to another state, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> had never challenged Roman <hi rend="italics">possessio.</hi> Zmyrna, Lampsacus, Miletus, Ephesus, and other cities on the coast had at various times effectively asserted their independence or transferred their allegiance after their conquest by Seleucus about <date value="-281">281 B.C.</date>: cf. XXXIII. xxxviii-xl. They had therefore challenged the <hi rend="italics">possessio</hi> of Antiochus, and this partially accidental circumstance constitutes the basis for the distinction. A non-Roman might not accept the premise. Sulpicius is clear-headed enough to see that the acceptance of the position adopted by Antiochus would jeopardize the liberation of Greece, for if Rome granted to the successors of Seleucus the right of reconquest she would be compelled to grant it also to the successors of Philip, and this would undo her work in Greece and threaten her ascendancy.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He then ordered the embassies of the cities to be summoned, which had previously been made ready and coached by Eumenes, who considered that in whatsoever degree the strength of Antiochus was diminished, by so much his own power would be increased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These embassies, being admitted in great numbers, while each one brought in now its own complaints, now its demands, and all mingled the just with the unjust, converted the meeting from an orderly debate into a wrangle. And so, with nothing conceded or gained, just as they had come, the ambassadors, uncertain of everything, returned to Rome.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When they had been dismissed the king held a council regarding the Roman war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There each tried to outdo the other in violence, since each thought that he would win greater favour in proportion to the severity of his attitude towards the Romans, while others assailed the insolence of their demands, seeing that they were imposing terms upon Antiochus the supreme monarch of Asia, just as upon the conquered Nabis;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and yet to Nabis had been left the control in his own homeland and in the country of Lacedaemon;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> while in the ease of Antiochus it seemed monstrous should Zmyrna and Lampsacus do his bidding;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> others argued that these <pb id="p.53"/>states were of small importance and scarcely worthy of<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> mention as causes of war for so great a king; but always the beginnings of tyrannical rule were small, unless one believed that the Persians, when they demanded water and earth from the Spartans,<note>These were the conventional symbols of submission, demanded by the Persians, to whom the Seleucid kings regarded themselves as successors.</note> actually needed a clod of soil or a sip of water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A like experiment the Romans were attempting in the case of the two cities; but other states, once they saw these two throwing off the yoke, would revolt to the people that would set them free.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If liberty was not preferable to slavery,<note><hi rend="italics">Servitus</hi> here, as elsewhere, does not necessarily imply personal slavery, but only the political subordination of one community to another. The speaker here suggests that campaigns for <quote>liberty</quote> might be nothing but attempts at revolution for the sake of revolution and without reference to the status from which escape is sought.</note> nevertheless, no existing situation was so attractive to anyone as the hope of a change of circumstances.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Alexander the Acarnanian was present at this council;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he had once been the friend of Philip, but lately had left him and attached himself to the more flourishing court of Antiochus and, as a man well acquainted with Greece and not without knowledge of the Romans, had advanced so far in the friendship of the king that he was accepted as a member even of secret councils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He, as if the question were not whether there should be war or no, but where and in what fashion the war should be conducted, asserted that he foresaw in his mind a certain victory if the king should have crossed to Europe and fixed the seat of hostilities in some part of Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even now, at the beginning, he would find the Aetolians, who dwelt in the navel of Greece, in arms, advanced troops ready for the utmost hardships;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> on the two wings of Greece, so to speak, Nabis from the <pb id="p.55"/>Peloponnesus would cause universal confusion, trying to<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> recover the city of the Argives, trying to recover the coast towns from which the Romans had ousted him when they shut him up within the walls of Lacedaemon;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> from Macedonia Philip, the moment he heard the trumpet sound, would take up arms; he was acquainted with his high spirits and with his temper; he knew that like wild beasts which were confined in cages or by chains he had long been turning over in his mind wild passions;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he himself, moreover, recalled how often in the war Philip had been wont to pray to the gods that they would grant him Antiochus as an ally; if now he should attain the fulfilment of his prayer, he would delay not one instant in rebelling.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Only let there be no delay or hesitation, for victory turned upon the question whether suitable ground and allies were secured in advance. Hannibal too should be sent to Africa without delay in order to distract the Romans.<note>Alexander may have forgotten that Hannibal had been banished from Carthage; he may also have meant that his presence would rouse the people to recall him, or that he would overawe his enemies with troops furnished by Antiochus.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal had not been invited to this council, being an object of suspicion to the king on account of his conferences with Villius, and being held in no honour after that.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At first he endured this humiliation in silence; then, thinking that it was better both to inquire the reason for this sudden change of attitude and to clear himself, he chose a suitable time and frankly asked the reason for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> king's anger, and having heard it, he said, <quote>My father Hamilcar, Antiochus, led me, still a little boy, to the altar when he was sacrificing and bound me by an oath never to be a friend to the Roman people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Under this oath I fought for six and thirty years<note>The same computation is found in XXX. xxxvii. 9.</note> ; this oath drove me from my fatherland in time of peace; it brought me, an exile from my home, to <pb id="p.57"/>your court; with it as my guiding principle, if you<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> disappoint my hopes, wherever I know that strength and arms are found, searching throughout the whole earth, I shall find some enemies of the Romans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so, whoever of your courtiers have a fancy to win favour with you by insinuations against me, let them choose another means of winning it at my expense.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I hate and am hateful to the Romans. That I speak the truth my father Hamilcar and the gods are witnesses. So long as you plan concerning a war on Rome, consider Hannibal among your first friends; if anything inclines you towards peace, seek for that advice some other man with whom to consult.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech not only convinced the king but reconciled him to Hannibal. The council broke up with the decision that war should be begun.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome,<note>The scene now changes to Rome, and the annalists are more consistently employed as sources.</note> in talk at least, they had no<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> thoughts except for Antiochus as their enemy, but as yet there were no preparations for war except in their minds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To both consuls<note>These are the consuls whose election was reported at x. 10 above.</note> Italy was decreed as a province, with the qualification that they should arrange between themselves or decide by lot which should preside at the elections that year;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the one to whom that responsibility did not fall should be prepared to lead the legions outside of Italy if any need should arise anywhere.<note>This action was due to the anticipation that war with Antiochus would soon come.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This consul was authorized to recruit two new legions and, from the allies of the Latin confederacy, twenty thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> to the other consul were assigned the two legions which Lucius Cornelius, consul of the preceding year, had commanded and, of the allies of the Latin confederacy from the same army, fifteen thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the case of Quintus <pb id="p.59"/>Minucius, along with the army which he had in<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> Liguria, his <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> was prolonged; it was added that as reinforcements four thousand Roman infantry should be enlisted and one hundred and fifty cavalry, and the allies were ordered to furnish the same general with five thousand infantry and two hundred and fifty cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Gnaeus Domitius received from the lot a province outside Italy, wherever the senate should decree; to Lucius Quinctius fell Gaul and the holding of the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The praetors then drew for their provinces, and Marcus Fulvius Centumalus received the urban jurisdiction, Lucius Scribonius Libo that between citizens and aliens, Lucius Valerius Tappo Sicily, Quintus Salonius Sarra Sardinia, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus Hither Spain, Aulus Atilius Serranus Farther Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the provinces of these two were changed first by the senate and then by vote of the people also:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> to Atilius the fleet and Macedonia were assigned, to Baebius the Brutti.<note>The procedure is not clear. Perhaps the senate induced the tribunes to introduce the corrective measure.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Flaminius and Fulvius in the Spanish provinces was prolonged. To Atilius<note>The names of Baebius and Atilius have been interchanged.</note> for service among the Brutti were assigned the two legions which had been in reserve the year before, and it was ordered that the allies should furnish him with fifteen thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Baebius Tamphilus was directed to build thirty quinqueremes and to launch from the dockyards whatever old ships were seaworthy, and to enlist naval allies; the consuls were also directed to turn over to him two thousand allies of the Latin confederacy and one thousand Roman infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These two praetors and two armies, on land and sea, were prepared, it was said, to operate against Nabis, who was now openly attacking the allies of the Roman <pb id="p.61"/>people<note>Cf. xiii. 1 above.</note> ; but the ambassadors sent to Antiochus<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> were awaited, and in
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> the expectation of their return the senate had forbidden the consul Gnaeus Domitius to leave the City.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetors Fulvius and Scribonius, to whom had been allotted the province of administering justice in Rome, were instructed to make ready, in addition to the fleet which Baebius was to command, one hundred quinqueremes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Before the consul and praetors set out for their provinces, a supplication was held by reason of prodigies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A she-goat was reported from Picenum to have given birth to six kids at one time, and at Arretium a boy with one hand was born, at Amiternum
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> there was a shower of earth, at Formiae the wall and gate were struck by lightning, and, a thing which caused the greatest terror, at Rome a cow belonging to the consul Gnaeus Domitius spoke, saying, <quote>Rome, for thyself beware.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The period of prayer was held on account of the other portents; the <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> ordered that the cow be carefully kept and fed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Tiber, attacking the city with a more violent rush than the year before, swept away the two bridges<note>These were the <hi rend="italics">pons Fabricius,</hi> from the left bank to the island, and the <hi rend="italics">pons Cestius,</hi> from the island to the right bank.</note> and many buildings, especially around the Porta Flumentana. A huge stone, dislodged either by the rains or by an earthquake too slight to be felt otherwise, fell into the <hi rend="italics">vicus lugarius</hi><note>This street led southwards from the Forum at the base of the Capitoline.</note> from the Capitoline and killed many people. In the flooded lands round about many cattle were washed away and damage was done to the farmhouses.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Before the consul Lucius Quinctius arrived in his province, Quintus Minucius, in the neighbourhood <pb id="p.63"/>of Pisa, met the Ligures in a pitched battle;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he killed<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> nine thousand of the enemy, routed and put to flight the rest and drove them into their camp. This was vigorously attacked and defended until nightfall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> By night the Ligures secretly withdrew and at daybreak the Romans entered the abandoned camp; less booty was found there because the spoils from the country were from time to time sent home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Minucius then gave the enemy no rest; from Pisan territory he marched into the land of the Ligures and completely laid waste their citadels and towns with fire and sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There the booty of Etruria, which had been sent on by the raiders, sated the Roman soldiers.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time the commissioners returned from the kings<note>These kings were Eumenes and Antiochus; the commissioners seem to have had no instructions to visit Nabis, but they had picked up incidental information about him.</note> to Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when they had no report to make which furnished a sufficiently pressing cause for war, except against the Lacedaemonian tyrant, whom the Achaean ambassadors also reported to be attacking the Spartan coast in contravention of the treaty, the praetor Atilius was ordered to Greece with the fleet to defend the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both the consuls were directed to depart for their provinces, since no action was imminent from Antiochus. Domitius by way of Ariminum, where the way was most direct, Quinctius through Liguria, came into the Boian territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The columns of the two consuls in different directions ravaged the land of the enemy far and wide. At first a few of their cavalry with their commanders, and then the senate as a body, and finally all who possessed anything of fortune or rank, to the number of fifteen hundred, took refuge with the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In both the Spanish provinces as well things went prosperously this year, for <pb id="p.65"/>Gaius Flaminius captured by storm the rich fortified<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> town of Licabrum and took alive the noble chieftain

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to him. Then he marched against the Oretani, and after capturing two towns, Noliba and Cusibis, advanced to the river Tagus. There lay Toletum, a small town but on a naturally
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> strong site. While he was besieging this city, a large force of the Vettones came to the aid of the Toletani. With them he fought successfully in a pitched battle, and after routing the Vettones he took Toletum by siege.<note>Cf. vii. 8 above for what may be the same incident as reported by another annalist.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But at that time the wars which were going on caused less concern to the Fathers than the anticipation of the war with Antiochus which had not yet begun.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For although everything was repeatedly investigated by commissioners, yet rumours, anonymous and groundlessly circulated, mingled much falsehood with the truth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Among them was the story that Antiochus, on his arrival in Aetolia, would immediately send a fleet to Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Therefore the senate, although it had sent the praetor Atilius with a fleet to Greece, still, because there was need not only
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> of military forces to influence the temper of the allies, but also of prestige, sent Titus Quinctius and Gnaeus Octavius and Gnaeus Servilius and Publius Villius as ambassadors to Greece, and decreed that Marcus Baebius should march his legions from <pb id="p.67"/>Bruttian territory to Tarentum and Brundisium,<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> thence, if the situation should demand it, should cross to Macedonia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that Marcus Fulvius the praetor should send a fleet of twenty vessels to defend the coast of Sicily;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that he who commanded the fleet should have the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> (the commander was Lucius Oppius Salinator, who had been plebeian aedile the previous year); that the same praetor should write to his colleague Lucius Valerius that there was danger that the fleet of King Antiochus would
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> cross to Sicily from Aetolia, and that consequently the senate had resolved that in addition to the army which he had he should enlist an emergency force of about twelve thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry with which to defend the sea-coast of the province on the side which faced Greece.<note>The senate here seems to violate its own rule (see ii. 6 above) about acting on anonymous information. The emergency, however, was now greater and the rumours were consistent with the reports of the ambassadors.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This levy the praetor raised not only from Sicily proper but from the surrounding islands also, and all the towns on the coast which looked toward Greece he strengthened with garrisons. Further food was given to the rumours by the coming of Attalus, the brother of Eumenes, who brought the news
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> that King Antiochus had crossed the Hellespont with his army and that the Aetolians were making such preparations that they would be in arms at his arrival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Both Eumenes who was absent and Attalus who was present were thanked, and a free lodging was given Attalus, a place of entertainment and gifts were presented to him &mdash;two horses, two suits of equestrian armour, silver vases of one hundred pounds weight and golden vases of twenty pounds.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When one messenger after another kept reporting that the war was close at hand, it seemed important under the circumstances that the consuls <pb id="p.69"/>should be chosen at the first possible opportunity.<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore a decree of the senate was passed to the effect that Marcus Fulvius the praetor should at once send despatches to the consul, in which he should be informed of the senate's desire that he should turn over his province and army
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to his lieutenants and return to Rome, and send ahead while on the road the edict in which he announced the election for the choice of consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul obeyed the message, and sending his edict ahead he came to Rome. In this year also there was a hotly-contested campaign, since three patricians were contending for one place &mdash;Publius
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Cornelius Scipio, the son of Gnaeus, who had suffered defeat the year before, and Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Gnaeus Manlius Volso. Publius Scipio, that it might seem in the case of so great a man that the honour was postponed but not refused, received one consulship; he was given as colleague from the plebeians Manius Acilius Glabrio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The next day the praetors were chosen &mdash; Lucius Aemilius Paulus, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Marcus Junius Brutus, Aulus Cornelius Mammula, Gaius Livius and Lucius Oppius, both of whom had the surname Salinator; it was Oppius who had led the fleet of twenty ships to Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Meanwhile, until the new magistrates should cast lots for the provinces, Marcus Baebius was directed to cross with all his forces from Brundisium to Epirus and to hold his troops around Apollonia, and Marcus Fulvius
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the urban praetor was entrusted with the task of building fifty new quinqueremes.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And the Roman people, for its part, was thus making itself ready for any undertaking of Antiochus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nabis by now was not putting off the <pb id="p.71"/>war but was besieging Gytheum with all his might,<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> and in his wrath at the Achaeans, because
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> they had sent aid to the besieged, was devastating their fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Achaeans did not venture to begin hostilities until their deputies had returned from Rome, that they might know what was the will of the senate, but after the return of the ambassadors they both called a council at Sicyon and sent agents to Titus Quinctius to ask advice from him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the council the votes of all were for an immediate beginning of the war; the letter of Titus Quinctius caused some hesitation, since in it he suggested that the praetor and the Roman fleet should be awaited.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When some of the chiefs thought that they should abide by their decision, while others argued that the advice of him whom they themselves had consulted should be followed, the multitude waited for the opinion of Philopoemen.<note>Philopoemen was one of Livy's heroes. He was now <hi rend="italics">strategus</hi> for the fourth time (Plut. <hi rend="italics">Philop.</hi> xiv).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was then chief magistrate and surpassed everyone at that time in wisdom and influence. Beginning his speech by saying that it was a good practice among the Aetolians that the praetor, when he had put the question of war before them, should not himself state his opinion, he bade them to take as soon as possible what action they wished:
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> as praetor he would carry out their orders faithfully and diligently and would strive, so far as this depended on human wisdom, that they should not regret either peace or war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This speech had more weight in urging them to war than if he had, by openly counselling it, revealed a desire to command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so with complete agreement the war was decreed, and the time and method of prosecuting it left to the discretion of the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philopoemen himself, in addition to the fact that Quinctius wished it, also <pb id="p.73"/>believed that he should wait for the Roman fleet<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> which could defend Gytheum by sea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> but fearing that the situation would not permit delay and that both Gytheum and the garrison sent to defend the city would be lost, he launched the ships of the Achaeans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The tyrant also had prepared a fleet of modest size to keep away any garrisons that might be sent by sea to aid the beleaguered; three decked ships and some smaller vessels and cutters, since his old fleet had been surrendered to the Romans under the treaty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That he might try the speed of these new ships and that at the same time everything might be made ready for battle, he daily sailed out into the open water and drilled the oarsmen and marines in mock naval engagements, thinking that the hope for the siege depended on his ability to cut off reinforcements coming by sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While the praetor of the Achaeans excelled, in his knowledge of fighting on land, anyone you will of famous commanders, either in experience or in aptitude, yet he was without
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> experience in naval warfare, being an Arcadian, a man from an inland country, unacquainted with the practices of other countries, except that in Crete he had served as a commander of auxiliaries.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Prompted by its reputation &mdash;for it had been in its time a famous craft in the royal fleet &mdash;he ordered it to be launched at Aegium although it was now quite rotten and was falling to pieces from age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At this time, with this flagship leading the fleet, with Tiso of Patrae sailing in it as admiral of the fleet, the <pb id="p.75"/>Spartan ships from Gytheum met them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and at the<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> first shock with a new and stout vessel, the old ship, which even before had been taking in water through every seam, broke up and everyone who sailed in it was made prisoner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The rest of the fleet, when their flagship was lost, fled as fast as the oars could drive them. Philopoemen himself escaped in a light scouting vessel and did not stop his flight until he reached Patrae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In no wise did this mishap affect the courage of this man, a soldier born and tried by many vicissitudes; on the contrary, rather, if he had failed in a naval battle, in which he was inexperienced, he conceived the greater hope in respect to that in the experience of which he excelled, and he asserted that he would render the tyrant's joy of short duration.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nabis, both gladdened by the victory and filled also with the unquestioning hope that there would no longer be any danger from the sea, wanted to close the land approaches too by suitably-placed guards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Withdrawing one-third of his troops from the siege of Gytheum, he encamped near Pleiae; this place threatens both Leuci and Acriae, where it was evident that the enemy would bring up their army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had placed his base there and only a few had tents, but the rest of the throng had huts woven out of reeds and thatched with leaves, which offered nothing but shade, Philopoemen, before he came
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> in sight of the enemy, determined to attack him unexpectedly with a new kind of warfare.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He collected small boats in a secret haven in Argive territory; into them he loaded lightly-equipped soldiers, mostly <hi rend="italics">caetrati,</hi><note>Cf. XXXI, xxxvi. 1 and the note.</note> with slings and darts and other kinds of light ordnance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then, skirting the <pb id="p.77"/>shore, when he came to a headland near the camp<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> of the enemy, he landed and travelling over familiar trails by night came to Pleiae and, the sentinels being asleep, like men in no immediate peril, hurled firebrands upon the huts on every side of the camp. Many were consumed by the flames before they knew of the enemy's approach, and those who did know of it were able to bring them no aid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With sword and fire everything was destroyed; a very few escaped from this two-fold destruction to Gytheum and the larger camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Having thus inflicted a defeat upon the enemy, Philopoemen marched straight to ravage Tripolis in Spartan territory, this being nearest the borders of the Megalopolitae, and having
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> carried off thence a large number of animals and men departed before the tyrant from Gytheum could send guards over the land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thence, having mustered the army at Tegea and calling a council at the same place,<note>This was probably an irregular meeting, before which Philopoemen reported on his use of the discretion given him as commander (xxv. 10).</note> of both Achaeans and allies, at which the leading
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> men of the Epirotes and Acarnanians were also present, he determined, since on the one hand the courage of his own men was
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> restored after the shame of the defeat on the sea, and on the other the enemy was terrified, to lead the army against Lacedaemon, thinking that in that way alone the enemy could be drawn away from the siege of Gytheum. He first pitched camp at Caryae in the enemy's country. On that very day Gytheum was captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Philopoemen, in ignorance of this fact, moved his camp forward to Barnosthenes &mdash;this is a mountain ten miles from Lacedaemon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And Nabis, having regained Gytheum, left there with his army in light marching order, and having speedily passed Lacedaemon, occupied what they call the camp of Pyrrhus,<note>This place lies to the north of Lacedaemon; another site of the same name was mentioned in XXXII. xiii. 2.</note> <pb id="p.79"/>a place that he did not doubt would be attacked by<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> the Achaeans. There he met the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> They were now spread out over a stretch of about five miles, their column being elongated on account of the narrowness of the road; the rearguard was composed of the cavalry and the mass of the auxiliaries, because Philopoemen thought that the tyrant would attack him from the rear with his mercenary troops, in whom he placed most confidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Two unexpected situations at one time filled him with dismay: first, the fact that the place which he sought had already been occupied; second, that he saw the enemy confronting his van, where, since the way led through rough country, he did not see how the standards could be advanced without a screen of light troops.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philopoemen, however, was a man of unusual astuteness and experience in leading troops and choosing positions, and not only in war-times but in peace as well he had trained his mind particularly in these arts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he was travelling anywhere and had reached a pass difficult to get through, viewing the character of the ground from every angle, when he was travelling alone, he would consider with himself, when he had companions, he would ask them, if the enemy had shown himself at that point, what plan should be adopted if he attacked from the front, what if on this or that flank, what if from the rear;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it was possible to meet him while drawn up in regular array, it was possible to do so in a less orderly formation suited only to the march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What ground he himself would occupy he would try to determine, by reflecting or by asking questions, or how many troops or what kind of <pb id="p.81"/>weapons &mdash;for this was of the greatest importance &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> he would use;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> where he would put the trains, where the baggage, where the unarmed mass, with how strong guards, and of what sort, he would protect them, and whether it would be better to continue by the way he had intended to go or to return the way he had come;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> what place too he would choose for his camp, how much space he would enclose in the fortifications, where there was a suitable water-supply and where were supplies of forage and wood; where, when he moved his camp the next day, would be his safest route, and what would be his order of march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With such concerns and thoughts he had from boyhood filled his mind, so that now no new subject of consideration faced him at such a crisis.<note>It would be interesting to know where Livy found this account of Philopoemen's self-administered course in minor tactics. Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Philop.</hi> iv-v) tells practically the same story, and adds that Evangelus and the histories of Alexander's campaigns were his favourite reading, but that he preferred terrain exercises to map problems (to use the current technical terminology) and literary descriptions of battles.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And at this time he first of all formed his column, then he sent the Cretan auxiliaries and the cavalry whom they call the Tarentini,<note>Whatever the origin of the name, these troops did not come from Tarentum in Italy.</note> each leading two horses with him, to the van, and ordering the cavalry to follow he seized a cliff above a stream whence they could get water;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> then he threw an armed guard around all the baggage and the assembled throng of camp followers and fortified the camp as the nature of the ground required; it was difficult to pitch tents on the rough and uneven ground. The enemy was about five hundred paces away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Both sides, using light-armed guards, drew water from the same stream, but before a regular battle had begun, which is the usual occurrence when camps are close together, the night fell. It was clear that on the next day they must fight at the stream in defence of the watering-parties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At night, in a valley out of sight of the <pb id="p.83"/>enemy, he placed as large a force of <hi rend="italics">caetrati</hi> as the<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> place could conceal.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When day broke the light-armed Cretans and the Tarentine cavalry began the battle on the banks of the river; Telemnastus the Cretan commanded his countrymen, Lycortas of Megalopolis the cavalry; the enemy also employed Cretan auxiliaries and cavalry of the same kind, that is, Tarentini, to protect their water-carriers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For a time the battle was doubtful, since the troops on both sides were of the same character and fought with similar equipment;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> as the fight went on the tyrant's auxiliaries gained the upper hand, both because they were superior in numbers and because Philopoemen had given his commanders specific instructions that after offering a fairly stiff resistance they should begin to retire and draw the enemy towards the place of the ambuscade. Following the retreating enemy headlong through the defile, many were wounded and slain before they spied the hidden foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The <hi rend="italics">caetrati</hi> had been resting in formation, so far as the width of the valley permitted, so that they easily permitted the fugitives to pass through the intervals in their ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then they themselves arose, unwounded, fresh, in regular array; against an enemy in disorder, scattered, wearied alike by exertions and wounds, they made their charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor was the issue in doubt, and at a rate no little faster than that of their pursuit the soldiers of the tyrant immediately fled and in their rout were driven into their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Many were killed and captured in this flight; and there would have been panic in the camp too had not Philopoemen ordered the recall sounded, in fear of the rough <pb id="p.85"/>and uneven ground where he had heedlessly advanced<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> rather than of the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Then, drawing inferences both from the outcome of the battle and from the character of the commander what his present fright must be, he sent to him one of the auxiliaries in the guise of a deserter, who reported it as an assured fact that the Achaeans would next
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> day advance to the Eurotas river, which flowed almost beneath the very walls,<note>The walls of Nabis' city of Sparta.</note> to block the road, that the tyrant might neither have a way to retreat into the city when he wished nor to transport supplies from the city to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> camp, and that the Achaeans might make an effort to find out whether anyone could be influenced towards an inclination to desert the tyrant. The deserter did not so much produce confidence in his words as offer to a man stricken with terror a plausible excuse for abandoning his camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day Nabis ordered Pythagoras with the auxiliaries and the cavalry to stand guard before the rampart;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> he himself, setting out with the main body of the army, as if to the battlefield, ordered the standards to proceed at quickened pace towards the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Philopoemen saw that the rapidly moving column was being hurriedly led over a narrow and steep road, he sent out all the cavalry and the Cretan auxiliaries against the guard of the enemy which was in front of the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they saw the enemy approaching and themselves abandoned by their friends, they first tried to withdraw within the camp, then, when the whole battle-line of the Achaeans
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> was moving forward, fearing that they would be captured camp and all, they decided to follow the column of their troops which was some <pb id="p.87"/>distance ahead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Straightway the Achaean <hi rend="italics">caetrati</hi><note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> assailed the camp and plundered it; the rest proceeded to pursue the enemy. The road was such that it could with difficulty be traversed by a column even if free from fear of an enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but when the battle began in the rear and a dreadful shout from panic-stricken men behind reached those in the van, each for himself threw away his weapons and plunged into the forests which lined the road, and in an instant the way was blocked by piles of arms, especially spears, many of which, falling with their points toward the enemy,<note>The context and the regular meaning of <hi rend="italics">adversus</hi> require this interpretation, but it is not easy to see how a spear, dropped by a man in flight, would naturally fall with its point facing the rear and its butt fixed in the ground. In XXXII. xvii. 14 Livy compares the spear-points of the Macedonian phalanx to a rampart. We may select as an explanation excessive credulity, misunderstanding of the source, corruption in the text, or a miracle. Plutarch does not mention the incident.</note> closed the road as if with a palisade placed in the way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philopoemen ordered the auxiliaries to press on and follow wherever they could and &mdash;since the flight would not be easy, especially for the cavalry &mdash;himself conducted the heavier troops by a more open road toward the Eurotas river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There he pitched camp at sunset and waited for the lighter troops which he had left to pursue the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they arrived during the first watch, reporting that the tyrant with a few men had made their way into the city and the rest of the army was wandering without weapons hither and thither through all the woods, he ordered them to care for their bodies;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> he himself, out of the other body of troops who, because they had arrived in camp at an earlier hour, had been refreshed both by the food they had taken and by a brief rest, chose some, taking nothing with them but their swords, led them out at once and posted them at the roads from two gates which they call Pharae and Barnosthenes, where he thought the enemy would <pb id="p.89"/>return from the flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor did his expectation<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> deceive him, for the Lacedaemonians, as long as any light remained, kept to the paths invisible in the interior of the forest; when evening came and they saw the lights in the enemy's camp, they kept themselves to paths hidden from their direction; when they had passed the camp, thinking it was now safe, they went down into the open roads. There they were picked up by the enemy waiting all around, and so many were killed or captured that barely a fourth of the whole army escaped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philopoemen, having shut up the tyrant in the city, spent about the ensuing thirty days in laying waste the fields of the Laconians, and having weakened and well-nigh broken the tyrant's power, returned home, the Achaeans equalizing him in the glory of- his achievements with the Roman commander and, so far as the Spartan war was concerned, even placing him ahead.<note>Flamininus'
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> campaign against Nabis (XXXIV. xxviii ff.) had been inconclusive, and the favourable comparison of Philopoemen to him was based on these campaigns, not on the war with Philip.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Justin (
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>iii. 4) tells the same story.</note></p> 
				<p>XXXI. While the war between the Achaeans and the tyrant was in progress, the Roman commissioners were going around the cities of the allies, being afraid that the Aetolians had turned the thoughts of some of the allies toward Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They spent the least effort in approaching the Achaeans, who, since they were hostile to Nabis, were, they felt certain, faithful enough in other relations as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To Athens first, then to Chalcis, then to Thessaly they took their course, and after addressing the Thessalians in a full council they turned aside to Demetrias.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There a council of the Magnetes had been called. It was necessary to employ more carefully-chosen language at this council because some of the chiefs were alienated
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> from the Romans and wholly devoted <pb id="p.91"/>to Antiochus and the Aetolians because, when it<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> was reported that Philip's son, who was a hostage, was being returned to him and the tribute which had been imposed remitted,<note>Livy does not mention any embassy to Philip at this time and says nothing of any proposal to return his son until <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date> (XXXVI. xxxv. 13), when Demetrius was restored to his father. Diodorus (XXVIII. xvi), however, speaks of an embassy which promised both these things to Philip. The Magnetes, then, may have had some grounds for their suspicions, as even Livy's language (note especially <hi rend="italics">spes incisa</hi> in sect. 7 below) indicates.</note> among
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> other falsehoods it was said that Demetrias also would be given back to him by the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To prevent this from happening, Eurylochus, the chief of the Magnetes, and some members of his party preferred that everything be thrown into confusion by the coming of Antiochus and the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Against them such arguments had to be used that in taking from them their groundless fear the destruction of his hope might not alienate Philip, who was more important in every way than the Magnetes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The main facts were merely mentioned, that not only all Greece was indebted to the Romans for the blessing of liberty, but this state especially; for not only had there been a Macedonian garrison there, but a royal palace had been built, that their master in person might always be held before their eyes;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but their liberation would prove to have been in vain if the Aetolians should install Antiochus in the palace of Philip and if they should have a new and unknown king in place of one who was old and tried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They call their chief magistrate the Magnetarch: Eurylochus then held the office, and relying on that authority he said that he and the Magnetes should not dissemble regarding the rumour that was in circulation that Demetrias was to be given back to Philip;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> to prevent that, the Magnetes would both try and venture anything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And, carried too far away in the passion of speaking, he threw out the remark that even then Demetrias was free in appearance, while in reality everything was done at the Romans' nod. At these <pb id="p.93"/>words there arose a shout from the crowd, some expressing<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> agreement, some indignation that he should have dared to say this; Quinetius, indeed, was so inflamed with wrath that raising his hands to heaven he implored the gods to witness the ungrateful and treacherous spirit of the Magnetes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> All were terrified by these words, and Zeno, one of the leading citizens, and possessed of great influence both because he pursued a seemly mode of life and because he had always indisputably belonged to the Roman party, with tears begged Quinctius and the other commissioners not to charge the insanity of one man against the community:
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> each one was mad at his own peril; the Magnetes, he admitted, owed not merely their freedom but everything which man holds sacred and dear to Titus Quinctius and the Roman people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> no man could pray to the immortal gods for anything which the Magnetes did not have from the Romans, and they would rather rage in madness against their own persons than violate the Roman friendship.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>His speech was followed by the prayers of the multitude; Eurylochus left the council by secret paths leading to the gate and thence fled straight into Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For now and more clearly every day the Aetolians were revealing their desertion, and at that very time it chanced that Thoas,<note>Cf. xii. 4 above. His embassy to Antiochus has not been mentioned.</note> a leading man of the nation, whom they had sent to Antiochus, had returned from
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> him and had brought with him Menippus as an ambassador from the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They, before an audience was granted them, had filled the ears of all with talk about the land and naval forces:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> a huge contingent of infantry and cavalry was coming, elephants had been <pb id="p.95"/>requisitioned from India, and before all &mdash;and by this they<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> believed that the mind of the crowd was especially influenced &mdash;so much gold was being brought that he could buy the Romans themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was evident what commotion such talk would cause in the council; for both the fact that they had come and what business brought them was all reported to the Roman commissioners;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and although hope was not entirely cut off, nevertheless it seemed to Quinctius not to be disadvantageous that some representatives of the allies should attend the council, to remind the Aetolians of the Roman alliance and to dare to speak out freely against the ambassador of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Athenians seemed especially suitable for the purpose, on account of the dignity of their state and in addition their ancient alliance with the Aetolians.<note>There seems to be no record of an actual alliance between the Athenians and the Aetolians, but the two states were traditionally friendly: cf. XXXI. xxx. 11.</note> Quinctius begged them to send delegates to the Panaetolian council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thoas was the first to speak at that meeting, reporting on his mission.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Menippus was given audience after him and said that it would have been best for all who lived in Greece and Asia if Antiochus could have intervened while Philip's condition was unimpaired:
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> each one<note>This phrase seems to mean Philip and the individual Greek states.</note> would have his own and everything would not have become subject to the nod and control of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>Even now,</quote> he said, <quote>if only you steadfastly carry out to the end the plans which you have formed, by the grace of the gods and with the Aetolians as allies, Antiochus will be able to restore the affairs of Greece, however injured, to their former position.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But this rests on liberty, which exists by its own might and does not depend on another's will.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Athenians, to whom next after the king's ambassador had been granted the opportunity of saying what they wished, <pb id="p.97"/>omitting all mention of the king, reminded the<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> Aetolians of the Roman alliance<note>In 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xiii. 11 Flamininus speaks of the alliance as broken. It had not, so far as we can judge from Livy's narrative, been formally renewed, but it is convenient for the Romans to regard it as even informally and tacitly in force with the resumption of peaceful relations after the liberation of Greece.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and of the services rendered to all Greece by Titus Quinctius: they should not heedlessly, by too great haste in deciding, spoil all this; hot-headed and bold decisions were fair at first sight, hard to follow through, disastrous in result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman commissioners, and among them Titus Quinctius, were not far away; before decisive action was taken, let them settle by words those matters which were in dispute rather than arm Asia and Europe for a fatal war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>XXXIII. The multitude was eager for a change and was all in favour of Antiochus, and they voted that the Romans should not even be admitted to the council; among the chiefs it was especially the elder men who by their influence secured them audience before the council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the Athenians reported this vote, it seemed best to Quinctius that he should go to Aetolia: he would either cause them some uncertainty or all men would be witnesses that the responsibility for the war would rest with the Aetolians and that the Romans would take up arms with justice and almost from necessity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After his arrival there Quinctius in the council began with the origin of the alliance of the Aetolians with the Romans and how often the faith imposed by the treaty had been broken by them, and spoke briefly of the status of the cities about which there was debate:
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> if, nevertheless, they considered that they had any just claim, how much better would it be to send ambassadors to Rome,<note>Recalling the experience of the Aetolian embassy in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xlix. 8), one cannot blame the Aetolians for not being impressed by this argument.</note> whether they preferred to arbitrate or to appeal to <pb id="p.99"/>the senate, than for the Roman people to go to war<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> with Antiochus, the Aetolians being the matchmakers,<note>My translation suggests part but not all of the Latin metaphor. The <hi rend="italics">lanistae</hi> were the trainers of the gladiators, who acted also in the capacity of the managers of modern prizefighters. Flamininus means that the Romans and Antiochus are to be the gladiators and do the fighting; the Aetolians, as the <hi rend="italics">lanistae</hi> of both, will get the profits without undergoing personal risk. To call them <quote>umpires</quote> or <quote>marshals of the lists</quote> would inject other and even more erroneous ideas, since both imply disinterestedness and impartiality. For a somewhat similar use of the word see Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> XIII. xl.</note> not without great disturbance to mankind and the ruin of Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor would any experience the calamity of this war sooner than those who had caused it. This prophecy, as one might call it, of the Roman was in vain. Thoas then and others of the same party were heard with universal applause and succeeded in carrying a motion, without even adjourning the council or awaiting the departure of the Romans, and by this decree Antiochus was invited to liberate Greece and to arbitrate between the Aetolians and the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To this so insolent vote a personal insult was added by their praetor Damocritus: for when Quinctius asked for the actual decree, he, showing no respect for the high position of the man, replied that there was now a matter which was more pressing which he had to attend to;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the decree and the answer he would presently deliver in Italy when his camp was pitched on the banks of the Tiber:<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxiv. 12.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was evident to all that in the cities the leading men and all the aristocracy<note>The institutions of Flamininus (see particularly XXXIV. li. 6) had an aristocratic character, and the Aetolian interpretation of Greek sentiment is in all probability correct.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Prompted by the letters of Eurylochus, his relatives and friends and those who belonged to the same party summoned his children and wife, dressed in mourning garb and carrying the badges of suppliants, into a crowded assembly, beseeching one and all not to permit a man, innocent and unjudged, to grow old in exile. And simpleminded men were moved by pity and wicked and seditious men by the hope of causing confusion by <pb id="p.103"/>means of an Aetolian uprising.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus each man for<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> himself favoured a vote of recall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After these preliminaries Diodes with all the cavalry &mdash;and he was then the commander of the cavalry &mdash;setting out on the pretext of conducting home his exiled friend, completing a long march by day and night, when he was six miles from the city, at daybreak led the way with three picked troops, ordering the rest of the cavalry to follow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he was near the gate he ordered them all to dismount and to lead their horses by the reins, breaking ranks just as if on a journey, that they might appear to be the commander's escort rather than an organized guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then, leaving one troop at the gate, that the cavalry in the rear might not be shut out, he conducted Eurylochus through the centre of the city and through the market-place, clasping him by the hand, while many men came up and congratulated him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Presently the city was full of troopers and the strategic points were occupied; then soldiers were sent to the houses to kill the leaders of the opposing party. Thus Demetrias fell into the possession of the Aetolians.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Lacedaemon the city was not to be treated with violence but the tyrant taken by craft;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he had been stripped of the coast towns by the Romans and shut up within the walls of Lacedaemon itself by the Achaeans, and whoever took the initiative in killing him would win the complete gratitude of the Lacedaemonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As a pretext for sending men to him they had the fact that he was wearying them with petitions that reinforcements be sent to him, since it was at their instance that he had rebelled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A thousand infantry were given <pb id="p.105"/>Alexamenus and thirty troopers picked from the<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> youth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These<note>That is, the thirty troopers.</note> were given instructions by the praetor Damocritus in the secret council of the people which was mentioned above,<note>In xxxiv. 2 above.</note> that they should not believe themselves sent for the Achaean war or for any other purpose that anyone could arrive at by his own conjecture; whatever sudden plan circumstances should prompt Alexamenus to form, they should be prepared to follow obediently, no matter how unexpected, rash and bold it might be, and they should receive it as if they knew that they had been sent from home to do that one thing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With them, thus prepared, Alexamenus came to the tyrant and by his coming immediately filled him with hope: Antiochus, he said, had already crossed into Europe, would soon be in Greece, and would fill the lands and seas with arms and soldiers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the Romans would realize that they were not dealing with Philip; the number of infantry and cavalry and ships could not be calculated; the line of elephants by their very appearance would end the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Aetolians with their entire army were ready, he said, to come to Sparta when the situation required, but that they had wished to display their full strength to the king when he arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nabis himself should also take such steps as not to permit what troops he had to grow soft in idleness under roofs, but should lead them out, force them to march under arms and at the same time stimulate their courage and train their bodies; as a result of drill labour would be lighter, and through the courtesy and consideration of their commander could even become not unpleasant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From that time on Nabis began to lead the troops out frequently into <pb id="p.107"/>the plain before the city along the Eurotas river<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> The bodyguard of the tyrant was generally posted in the centre of the line;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the tyrant, with at most three cavalrymen, of whom Alexamenus was usually one, would ride in front of the standards, inspecting the flanks to the end;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the Aetolians were on the right of the line, both those who had formerly been with the tyrant and the thousand who had come with Alexamenus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Alexamenus had established the habit for himself now of riding around with the tyrant with only a few attendants and of advising him what seemed to be advantageous, now of riding off to
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> the right flank to his own men and then returning to the tyrant as if he had given some order which the situation demanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But on the day which he had chosen for the perpetration of the crime, when, after riding for a while with the tyrant, he had returned to his own men, he then addressed the thirty troopers who had been sent from home with him:
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <quote>We must, young men, do and dare the deed which you were ordered to perform strenuously under my command; prepare your minds and hands that no one may fail in what he sees me do;
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> whoever shall hesitate and substitute his own plan for mine shall know that he has no return to his own home.</quote> Horror seized them all, and they remembered with what orders they had left home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The tyrant was coming from the left wing; Alexamenus ordered the cavalry to put their spears in rest and to watch him; he himself also collected his thoughts, disordered by his pondering over so great a deed. When Nabis approached, he charged and piercing his horse overthrew the tyrant; the troopers ran him through as he lay on the ground;
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> after many blows <pb id="p.109"/>had fallen vainly upon his armour the wounds at<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> last reached his unprotected body, and before aid could reach him from the centre of the line the tyrant was dead.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Alexamenus with all the Aetolians went off at full speed to take possession of the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The bodyguard, since the deed had been done before their eyes, was at first terror-stricken;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> then, after they saw the Aetolian column depart, they assembled around the abandoned body of the tyrant, and a crowd of spectators was formed out of the guardians of his life and the avengers of his death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor would anyone have stirred if the multitude had at once been summoned to lay aside their arms and attend an assembly and a speech been delivered suitable to the occasion, and thenceforth numerous Aetolians been kept under arms, without doing injury to anyone; but, as was fitting in plans undertaken with treachery, everything worked together to hasten the destruction of those who had committed the crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their leader shut himself up in the palace and spent a day and a night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> in going through the tyrant's treasures; the Aetolians, as if they had captured the city which they wished to seem to have set free, turned to plunder. Their shameless conduct and the contempt in which they were held combined to turn the thoughts of the Lacedaemonians towards unity of action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some said that the Aetolians should be driven out and the liberty, lost at the moment when it seemed restored, should be regained; others, that there might be some head to the movement, thought that someone of the royal house should be brought forward as a symbol.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was a mere boy of the royal stock, <pb id="p.111"/>Laconicus,<note>The proper name <hi rend="italics">Laconicus</hi> is not found elsewhere, and Livy may have understood the adjective <foreign lang="greek">Lakwniko/s</foreign> as a noun; it is also possible that the text is corrupt.</note> brought up with the sons of the tyrant;<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> him they set upon a horse, and seizing their weapons they slaughtered the Aetolians as they straggled through the city. Next they attacked the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Alexamenus with a few companions resisted them there but was slain. The Aetolians gathered around the Chalcioecus<note>The temple is said, to have been so named (literally, <quote>bronze house</quote>) because the inner walls were decorated with bronze reliefs: cf. Pausanias III. xvii. 3.</note> &mdash;this was a bronze temple to Minerva &mdash;were killed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> a few threw away their arms and fled, some to Tegea, some to Megalopolis; there they were arrested by the magistrates and sold at auction.<note>These communities were Achaean and treated the Aetolians as prisoners of war.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Euthymidas from Athens &mdash;he <pb id="p.113"/>had chosen this place for his home &mdash;went first<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> Thebes and then to Salganeus, and Herodorus to Thronium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Not far from there, in the Malian gulf, Thoas had two thousand infantry, two hundred cavalry, and about thirty light cargo-vessels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Herodorus was instructed to take these ships with six hundred infantry to the island of Atalante, so that from there, when he saw the infantry now approaching Aulis and Euripus, he might cross to Chalcis;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thoas himself led the rest of the troops, generally marching by night and with all possible speed, to Chalcis.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Micythio and Xenoclides, in whose hands rested supreme power<note>Their official status is unknown.</note> after Euthymidas had been expelled from Chalcis, whether they formed their own suspicions or the plot was betrayed, at first were alarmed and placed no trust in anything but flight; then, when their terror subsided and they realized that they would be deserting and abandoning not only their country but also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Roman alliance, they increased their courage by the following scheme.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It happened that at this time there was an annual festival at Eretria in honour of Diana Amarynthis, which crowds both of the natives and of the Carystii attend.<note>The festival may still have existed in Livy's time, but it is also possible that the present tense of the verb is preserved from the source.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They sent there men to beg the people of Eretria and Carystus, born on the same island, to pity their plight and respect the Roman alliance; let them not permit Chalcis to become the property of the Aetolians; they would control Euboea if once they controlled Chalcis;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the Macedonians had been hard to endure as masters; the Aetolians would be far less easy to bear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Regard for the Romans had especial influence with the states, which had recently had experience of both their valour in war and their justice and kindness in <pb id="p.115"/>victory. Therefore whatever strength in young men<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> each state had it armed and sent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the townspeople had turned over to them the defence of the walls of Chalcis, they themselves with all their forces crossed the Euripus and pitched camp near Salganeus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence first a herald and then ambassadors were sent to the Aetolians to inquire what word or action on their part had brought allies and friends to attack them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thoas, the Aetolian chieftain, replied that they were coming, not to besiege them, but to set them free from the Romans; now a more glittering chain, but a far heavier one, bound them than when they had a Macedonian garrison in their citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Chalcidenses, however, denied that they were slaves to any man or that they needed the protection of anyone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So, leaving the conference, the ambassadors returned to their people; Thoas and the Aetolians, inasmuch as they had placed all their hopes on the chance of catching them off guard, since they were by no
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> means equal to a regular war and the siege of a city well fortified by sea and land, returned home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After Euthymidas learned that the camp of his countrymen had been pitched at Salganea and that the Aetolians had gone, he himself also returned from Thebes to Athens, and Herodorus,
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> after waiting several days in vain, anxiously watching from Atalante for a signal, sending out a scouting vessel to ascertain what was causing the delay, when he learned that the attempt had been abandoned by his allies, returned to Thronium whence he had come.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius also, hearing of this, came from Corinth by ship and in the Chalcidian Euripus met King Eumenes.<note>Livy has not mentioned before the presence of Eumenes in Greece.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was decided that five hundred <pb id="p.117"/>men should be left at Chalcis as a guard by King<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> Eumenes and that the king himself should go to Athens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius hurried to Demetrias, for which he had set out, in the belief that the liberation of Chalcis would have some effect upon the Magnetes in favour of renewing
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the Roman alliance and, that there might be some protection for the men of his party, he wrote to Eunomus, the praetor of the Thessalians, that he should arm his young men, and he sent Villius ahead to Demetrias, to test their sentiments, without any intention of attempting any action unless some portion of them was disposed to have regard for the former alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Villius, in a ship of five banks of oars, sailed up to the mouth of the harbour. When all the people of the Magnetes had rushed there, Villius asked whether they would prefer that he had come to friends or to enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Eurylochus the Magnetarch replied that he came to friends; but he should keep out of the harbour and permit the Magnetes to live in harmony and liberty and should not, under the pretence of a conference, stir up the populace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then there was a violent argument, not a conversation, the Roman reproaching the Magnetes for ingratitude and foretelling impending disaster, the crowd raising an uproar while accusing now the senate and now Quinctius. So without accomplishing anything Villius rejoined Quinctius.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I have been driven out of my course, so to say, by blending events in Greece with those in Rome, not because they were worth the effort of recording <pb id="p.119"/>them, but because they were the origins of the war<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> with Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consuls were elected &mdash;for this was the point at which I turned aside &mdash; Lucius Quinctius and Gnaeus Domitius departed to their provinces, Quinctius to the Ligures, Domitius against the Boii.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other consul devastated the Ligurian country far and wide and captured some forts from which they not only secured plunder of all kinds, along with prisoners, but also recovered some citizens and allies who had been in the hands of the enemy.<note>This narrative is somewhat inconsistent with that previously given, and probably came from another source. In x. 10 the election of Quinctius and Domitius was reported; the assignment of provinces was postponed to xx. 2-7, to make room for the account of developments in the east. Their achievements in the provinces were summarily recorded in xxii. 3-4, with only slight variations from the later version, and at xxiv. 3 Quinctius returned to hold the elections at which Scipio and Glabrio were chosen consuls for <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date> In this passage, however, Livy seems to keep both consuls in Rome until after the elections, forgetting that Domitius was already in Gaul, according to the earlier account. He seems too to forget that the proconsul Minucius had been assigned to the Ligures (xx. 6). A further difference will be seen in the following sections: the source of chap. xxii went on to record events in Spain, and a possible duplication was pointed out in the note to xxii. 8; the source which Livy followed in chap. xl. continued with happenings at Rome.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the same year a colony was established at Vibo in accordance with a decree of the senate and an enactment of the assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Three thousand seven hundred infantry went there and three hundred cavalrymen; the commission which established it consisted of Quintus Naevius, Marcus Minucius and Marcus Furius Crassipes; fifteen <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> of land were given to each infantryman and twice that to each cavalryman. The land had recently belonged to the Brutti; they in turn had taken it from the Greeks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At Rome in the same period there were two very serious alarms, one of longer duration but slower in its effect, for the earth trembled through thirty-eight days; for so many days there was a holiday spent in <pb id="p.121"/>apprehension and fear; by reason of this occurrence a<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> three-day period of prayer was held;

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year was now almost at an end and the talk about the war with Antiochus and the concern of the Fathers were growing greater and greater from day to day;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in order, therefore, that all might be more attentive to duty, the question of provinces for the magistrates-elect began to be considered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They decreed that for the consuls Italy and wherever the senate ordered &mdash;that this province would be the war against King Antiochus was known to everyone &mdash;should be the provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The one to whom the latter lot fell was authorized to enlist four thousand Roman citizens for the infantry and three hundred cavalry and six thousand allies of the Latin confederacy with four hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The enrolment of these troops Lucius Quinctius the consul<note>The continued presence of Quinctius in Rome is more consistent with the account in xxiv. 2 than with that in xl. 2.</note> was ordered to undertake, that nothing might delay the new consul from going at once to whatever place the senate should have ordered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Moreover, regarding the provinces of the praetors, it was decided that the first lot should cover the two jurisdictions, that between citizens and that between citizens and aliens, the second the Brutti, the third the fleet, to sail wherever the senate should have directed, the fourth Sicily, the fifth Sardinia, the sixth Farther Spain.<note>The other provinces would be governed by proconsuls or propraetors, who are not here designated.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Romans were concentrating on the preparations for the new war, there was no idleness on the part of Antiochus either.

The question of Hannibal also detained him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And at first the open ships which he had planned to send with him to Africa were delayed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> then the question whether he should be sent at all was raised, particularly by Thoas the Aetolian, who, after everything <pb id="p.125"/>in Greece had been thrown into confusion, brought<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> word that Demetrias was in his power, and with lies like those about the king, with which, multiplying his forces in his harangues, he had roused the passions of many in Greece, he excited the hopes of the king also:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the prayers of all were calling him, there would be a rush to the shore from which they could catch glimpses of the royal fleet. This same man dared to try to change the king's decision about Hannibal, now almost fully determined.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For he said that part of the ships should by no means be detached from the royal fleet, nor, if ships should be sent, was any man less fit than Hannibal to be placed in command:
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he was an exile and a Carthaginian, to whom either his own luck or his wit could suggest
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> a thousand new schemes a day,<note>The rhetoric of Thoas gives him some neat balances, <hi rend="italics">exulem: fortuna; Poenum: ingenium,</hi> and furnishes Livy with another chance to play upon his favourite theme, <hi rend="italics">Punica fides.</hi></note> and Hannibal's military fame endowed him with a distinction which was out of place in a mere officer of a king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king, he said, ought to be the centre of interest, ought to be regarded as the single leader, the single general. If Hannibal should lose a fleet or an army, the loss would be the same as if they were lost by any other leader;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> if any success were attained, to Hannibal, not to Antiochus, would the credit accrue; but if in the whole war the fortune of conquering the Romans should be vouchsafed
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> them, what hope was there that Hannibal would live under a king, subject to an individual, when he had practically failed to endure the rule of his own country?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had not conducted himself from youth up, cherishing in his hopes and thoughts the sovereignty of the world, in such a way that in his old age he would be ready, as it seemed, to suffer a master. The king, he concluded, had no need of Hannibal as a commander; as a companion <pb id="p.127"/>and as an adviser he could use such a man for the<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A moderate employment of such talents would be neither dangerous nor unprofitable;

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No dispositions are so prone to envy as those of men whose abilities do not correspond to their birth and fortune, because they hate excellence and good qualities in another. Immediately the plan of sending Hannibal, which was the only good thing thought of at the beginning of the war, was laid aside.<note>Nepos (Hannibal viii. 1) asserts that Hannibal was actually sent to Africa, but without a fleet. Speculation as to the facts and as to the consequences if Hannibal had been able to draw Carthage into the war is interesting but fruitless.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king, especially rejoiced at the revolt of Demetrias from the Romans to the Aetolians, decided not to postpone longer his departure for Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Before he set sail he went up from the coast to Ilium to offer sacrifice to Minerva. Thence he returned and departed with forty decked and sixty open vessels, while two hundred cargo-ships, with all kinds of supplies and equipment for war, followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He first steered for the island of Imbros; thence crossed to Sciathos; there he first collected the ships that had been scattered in the open sea and arrived at Pteleum, the first point on the mainland.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There Eurylochus the Magnetarch and the chiefs of the Magnetes from Demetrias met him, and rejoicing at their number on the next day he sailed into the harbour of the city with his fleet; his troops he landed not far away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There were ten thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry and six elephants, a force scarcely sufficient to take possession of Greece if it were undefended, not to mention the necessity of resistance to the Romans.<note>After the extravagances of the earlier reports, the small size of the expeditionary force which actually landed must have seemed an anticlimax to others than Antiochus (xliv. 4) and Flamininus (xlix. 9), and it is strange that Livy makes no further mention of the subject.</note></p>

				<p>The Aetolians, after it was reported that Antiochus<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> had arrived at Demetrias, called a council and confirmed the decree by which they had invited him. The king had already left Demetrias, knowing that they would vote thus, and had come to Phalara on the Malian gulf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence, after receiving the decree, he came to Lamia and was welcomed with great enthusiasm

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they came to the council, silence being with difficulty obtained, the king was introduced by Phaeneas the praetor and the other chiefs and began to speak.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The opening of his speech was an apology because he had come with forces so much smaller than everyone had hoped and expected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This, he said, should be the best proof of the goodwill which he felt for them, because, although not fully prepared in any respect and at a premature time<note>The phrase indicates that Antiochus crossed the Aegean in the fall (of <date value="-192">192 B.C.</date>), after the storms had begun, instead of waiting for the next spring.</note> for sailing, at the summons of their ambassadors he had obeyed without objection and had believed that when the Aetolians saw him they would consider that all their hope of safety depended on himself alone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the hopes, even of those whose expectations seemed disappointed for the moment, he would realize to the full:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for as soon as the early season of the year made the sea navigable he would fill all Greece with arms, men, horses, the whole seacoast with ships, and would spare no expense nor toil
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> nor danger until, with the Roman yoke removed from their necks, he had made Greece free in truth and the Aetolians the foremost people in the land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With the armies, supplies of every kind also would come <pb id="p.131"/>from Asia; in the meantime the responsibility should<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> rest upon the Aetolians of supplying him with abundance of grain for his men and with other things at a fair price.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having spoken thus amid loud applause from all, the king left the meeting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the withdrawal of the king an argument arose between two chiefs of the Aetolians, Phaeneas and Thoas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Phaeneas thought that they should use Antiochus as a restorer of peace and as an arbitrator in those matters which were in dispute with the Roman people rather than as a leader in war:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> his arrival and his majesty would be more effectual than arms in causing the Romans to observe moderation; men, to avoid the necessity of fighting, would make many voluntary concessions which they could not be compelled to make by war and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thoas asserted that Phaeneas was not interested in peace but was trying to delay preparations for war, that through weariness the energy of the king might relax and also that the Romans might have time for preparation:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> it was well established by sending so many embassies to Rome and holding so many conferences with Quinctius himself, that no justice could be obtained from the Romans, nor would they have asked aid from Antiochus if all hope had not been lost.<note>With unusual politeness, Thoas refrains from calling Phaeneas a pro-Roman.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since this aid had arrived sooner than anyone expected, there should be, he said, no diminution of effort, but rather the king should be asked, since he had come in person as the avenger of Greece, which was the all-important thing, to summon also his military and naval forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The king in arms would obtain something; unarmed, he would not have the slightest influence with the Romans, either for the <pb id="p.133"/>Aetolians or even for himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This opinion prevailed,<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> and they voted that the king should be named commander-in-chief and chose thirty of the leaders with whom, if he wished, he could consult.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The council being thus adjourned, the people all scattered to their own cities; the king next day consulted the <hi rend="italics">apocletes</hi> as to where the war should begin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It seemed best first to attack Chalcis, on which an attempt had recently been made in vain by the Aetolians; and it was agreed that speed was more necessary for this purpose than great strength or preparation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king therefore with a thousand infantry who had come with him from Demetrias set out through Phocis and by another road the chiefs of the Aetolians, calling out a few of their young men, hastened to Chaeronia and followed in ten decked ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king himself encamped at Salganeus and crossed the Euripus by boat with the Aetolian chiefs and, since he had disembarked not far from the harbour, the magistrates of the Chalcidenses also and the foremost citizens came out before the gate. A few from each side met for a conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Aetolians urged them strongly while retaining the Roman friendship to take the king also as an ally and friend:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for he had not come to Europe to make war but to free Greece, and to free it in reality, not in words and pretence, as the Romans had done;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> nothing, moreover, was more useful to the Greek cities than to embrace both friendships, for thus they would always be guarded by the protection and good faith of the one from the injustice of the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For if they did not receive the king, they would see at once what they would have to endure, when Roman aid was far away and Antiochus, an enemy whom they <pb id="p.135"/>could not withstand by their own might, was at their<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At this Micythio, one of the chiefs, said that he wondered for whose liberation Antiochus had left his own kingdom and crossed to Europe: for he knew no state in Greece which had a garrison or paid tribute to the Romans or
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> suffered, under the compulsion of an unfair treaty, laws which it did not wish<note>Micythio claims for Chalcis all the normal characteristics of a free state; the final sentence of the chapter is not inconsistent, since Chalcis was at liberty to make any alliance it chose, but would voluntarily submit to Rome's judgment on such matters.</note> ; therefore the people of Chalcis needed neither any champion of their liberty, since they were free, nor any protection, since by the kindness of the same Roman people they enjoyed peace along with liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They did not reject, he said, the friendship of the king nor that of the Aetolians themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In their capacity as friends their first act would be to retire from the island and go away:
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> for they were determined not only not to admit them within the walls, but not to conclude any alliance even except in accordance with the authorization of the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this answer had been conveyed to the king at the ships where he had stayed, for the present &mdash;for he had not come with such strength that he could undertake any forcible measures &mdash;it was decided to return to Demetrias.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, since their first venture had proved fruitless, the king consulted with the Aetolians what should be done next. It was agreed to try the Boeotians, the Achaeans, and Amynander, king of the Athamanes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They believed that the Boeotians had been unfriendly to the Romans ever since the death of Brachyllas and the events
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> which followed<note>Cf. XXXIII. xxviii. 1 ff.</note> ; they thought that the Achaean magistrate Philopoemen, since he had become a rival in fame as a result of the war in Lacedaemon, was hostile to and hated by <pb id="p.137"/>Quinctius.<note>Cf. xxx. 12-13 above. Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Philop.</hi> xv) traces their jealousy to this same cause, but his chronology is confused.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Amynander<note>Amynander had been an ally of the Romans against Philip (XXXI. xxviii. 1), but may have felt slighted in the re-arrangements following the peace (XXXIII. xxxiv. 11).</note> had as wife Apama,<note>Apama was the wife of Seleucus I, but the name is not known as characteristically a family-name among the descendants of Philip of Macedon.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> daughter of one Alexander of Megalopolis, who, boasting descent from Alexander the Great, had given to his two sons the names of Philip and Alexander and to his daughter that of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Apama; when she was joined in royal wedlock her elder brother Philip followed her to
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Athamania. Since he happened to be vain in character, the Aetolians and Antiochus had induced him to hope for the throne of Macedonia, being, as they told him, truly of the stock of kings, if he allied Amynander and the Athamanes with
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Antiochus. And this vain promise availed not only with Philip but also with Amynander.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Achaea a hearing before the council was granted the representatives of Antiochus and the Aetolians
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> in the presence of Titus Quinctius at Aegium. The ambassador of Antiochus was heard before the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He, a boaster like most who are maintained by a king's power, filled seas and lands with an empty sound of words: an uncountable number of cavalry was crossing the Hellespont into Europe, partly equipped with breastplates &mdash;these they call the <hi rend="italics">cataphracti</hi> &mdash;partly those who use arrows from horseback, and as a result of which there is no protection against them, since they aimed quite accurately backwards while fleeing on their horses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although by these forces of cavalry the armies even of all Europe, collected in one body, could be overwhelmed, he added army after army of infantry, and he
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> caused terror when they heard names of tribes besides, scarcely known by name, talking of Dahae,<note>The Dahae were Scythians: cf. Plin. <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> VI. 50.</note> Medes, Elymaeans and Cadusians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As to the naval <pb id="p.139"/>forces, moreover, which no harbours in Greece could<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> shelter, the right wing was held by men of Sidon and Tyre, the left by Aradii and Sidetes from Pamphylia, which races none had ever equalled either in skill or in courage in naval combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At this time to speak of money, at this time to speak of other equipment for war, he said was useless: they themselves were aware that the kingdoms of Asia had always been rich in gold. Therefore the Romans would not have to do with Philip or Hannibal, the one the chief of a single state, the other confined only within the bounds of the Macedonian kingdom, but with the mighty lord of all Asia and part of Europe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless, although he came from the farthest parts of the east to liberate Greece, he demanded nothing of the Achaeans by which their loyalty to the Romans, who had priority as allies and friends, would be diminished: for he did not ask that they should take up arms on his side against the Romans, but that they should ally themselves with neither side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Let them wish for peace for both parties, as was befitting the friends of both; let them take no part in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> About the same request was made by the Aetolian ambassador Archidamus, that they maintain peace, which was the easiest and safest course, and as onlookers at the war let them await the outcome of others' destinies without any risk to their own cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then he was carried away by the vehemence of his language to the point of insulting now the Romans generally, now Quinctius himself specifically, calling them ingrates and taunting him with the remark
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> that not only the victory over Philip but Quinctius' own safety had been gained by the valour of the Aetolians, and when, he demanded, had Quinctius ever performed the functions of a commander?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <pb id="p.141"/>Taking auspices and sacrificing and performing vows<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> like a poor sacrificing priest &mdash;thus had he seen Quinctius in the battle, while he himself was exposing his person in behalf of Quinctius to the weapons of the enemy.<note>Livy does not mention this in his description of Cynoscephalae, but Polybius (XVIII. xxi. 5) gives Archidamus credit for conspicuous courage there, omitting the slurs on Flamininus.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Quinctius replied that Archidamus had considered in whose presence he was speaking rather than whom he was addressing:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for the Achaeans knew well that all the fierceness of the Aetolians consisted in words and not in actions, and was seen in councils and assemblies more than in battle: therefore Archidamus took small account of the opinion of the Achaeans, to whom he realized that the Aetolians were known;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it was for the benefit of the king's ambassadors and through them of the king that he had boasted thus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But if anyone had been ignorant before what cause had brought Antiochus and the Aetolians together, it could now be clear from the speeches of their delegates that by an exchange of lies and of boasts of strength which they did not possess they filled one another's minds, and in turn were filled, with groundless hopes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>While they are saying that by them Philip was defeated and by their valour the Romans were preserved, and, as you just heard, that you and the other cities and peoples will follow in their path, the king on the other hand is boasting of his clouds of infantry and cavalry and is hiding the sea beneath his fleet.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the whole affair is very like a dinner given by a friend of mine in Chalcis, both an excellent man and a witty table-companion, and when we were entertained at his house at the time of the solstice,<note>This was the summer solstice, when game was out of season.</note> and were wondering where at that time of the year he found so much game and of so many kinds,
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> this man, not boasting in the manner <pb id="p.143"/>of our opponents, said with a smile that by seasoning<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> these varied forms of wild game had been made out of tame swine.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This, he said, could be well applied to the forces of the king, about which there had been so much bragging a little while ago; the different kinds of weapons, the many names of unheard-of peoples, Dahae and Medes and Cadusians and Elymaeans &mdash;these were all Syrians, far better fitted to be slaves, on account of their servile dispositions, than to be a race of warriors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>And would that I could, Achaeans, set before your eyes the frantic rush of the great king from Demetrias, now to Lamia for the council of the Aetolians, now to Chalcis; you would scarcely find the like of two poor legions of reduced strength in the camp of the king;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> you would see the king now almost begging food from the Aetolians to be distributed to his troops, now seeking the loan of
						<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> funds on interest for their pay, now standing before the gates of Chalcis and presently, shut out from there, having done nothing more than look at Aulis and the Euripus, going back to Aetolia. Foolishly have they trusted, both Antiochus in the Aetolians and the Aetolians in the vainglory of the king: the less should you be deceived, but you should place your trust rather in the tried and known protection of the Romans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For as to what they say is best, that you should not take any
						<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> part in the war, nothing, on the contrary, is so inconsistent with your interests; yes, disregarded and discredited you will be the prize of the conqueror.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not without point did he appear to have answered both parties, and it was easy for his speech to be received with favouring ears by men who were on his side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For there was no debate or doubt that <pb id="p.145"/>they would pronounce judgment that the people of<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> the Achaeans would hold as enemies and friends the same whom the Roman people held as such, and that they would order war declared on Antiochus and the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Auxiliaries also, as Quinctius advised, five hundred soldiers to Chalcis and five hundred to Piraeus, were at once sent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For there was at Athens a situation not much different from a rebellion, since some people, from the hope of bribes, were trying to win by money the venal multitude over to the side of Antiochus, until Quinctius was summoned by those who were of the Roman faction, and on the accusation of a certain Leon, Apollodorus, the author of the sedition, was convicted and driven into exile.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And the Achaeans indeed gave the ambassadors an unsympathetic answer to take back to the king; the Boeotians made no positive response: when Antiochus should have come to Boeotia, then, they said, they would consider what course of action they should adopt.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When Antiochus heard that garrisons had been sent to Chalcis by both the Achaeans and King Eumenes, he thought that his men should make haste to anticipate
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> them and if possible meet them on their arrival, and he sent Menippus with about three thousand soldiers and Polyxenidas with the entire fleet, and a few days later he too led six thousand of his own troops and some few of the Aetolians from such forces as could be mustered on short notice at Lamia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The five hundred Achaeans and a small force sent by King Eumenes, with Xenoclides of Chalcis as their leader, the roads being not yet closed, crossed the Euripus in safety and arrived in Chalcis;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Roman soldiers,<note>Livy has said nothing about this Roman detachment, and does not explain whether they came from the fleet or from the army of Baebius (cf. xxiv. 7 above); the latter is more probable, considering the direction of their march.</note> these too about five <pb id="p.147"/>hundred in number, arrived when Menippus already<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> had his camp before Salganeus near the Hermaeum, where there is a crossing from Boeotia to the island of Euboea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Micythio was with them, sent from Chalcis to Quinctius to request that very garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When he saw that the pass was held by the enemy, he abandoned the march to Aulis and turned toward Delium, planning to cross from there to Euboea.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Delium is a temple of Apollo, overlooking the sea; it is five miles away from Tanagra; the crossing by sea from there to the nearest parts of Euboea is less than four miles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not only were they in a shrine and sacred grove, of so religious a character, and under the law of sanctuary which protects those temples which the Greeks call <quote>asylums,</quote> but also the war had as yet been neither declared<note>Rome had not formally declared war, although the Achaeans had done so (comparing 1, 2 and 5 above). Whether the presence of these soldiers here on this errand constituted a tacit recognition that a state of war existed is debatable.</note> nor brought to such an issue that they had seen swords drawn or blood shed anywhere, while the soldiers
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> were wandering around completely at ease, some going to see the temple and the grove, some strolling along the shore unarmed, and a great part scattering through the country in quest of wood and forage;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> suddenly Menippus fell upon them as they straggled here and there and slew them,<note>A numeral has dropped out of the text. Some editors supply <hi rend="italics">trecentos,</hi> to leave some survivors (in addition to the fifty prisoners and the <quote>very few</quote> mentioned in the next clause) to garrison the fort mentioned in sect. 7 below.</note> and captured about fifty alive; a very few got away, among them Micythio, who was picked up by a small trading-vessel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Just as the loss of the soldiers was annoying to Quinctius and the Romans, so too the affair seemed to have given some further justification for <pb id="p.149"/>declaring war on Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Antiochus moved his<note type="margin">B.C. 192</note> army up to Aulis, and when he had again sent ambassadors to Chalcis, some of his own people and some Aetolians, who urged in more threatening language the same course they had recently advised, although Micythio and Xenoclides vainly strove against it, he easily gained his point that the gates should be opened to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those of the Roman party left the city at the approach of the king. The soldiers of the Achaeans and Eumenes held Salganeus, and on the Euripus a few Roman soldiers built a fort to guard the place. Menippus attacked Salganeus, the king himself began to attack the fort on the Euripus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Achaeans and the soldiers of Eumenes were the first to bargain that they be allowed to depart under safeguard and left their post; with greater stubbornness the Romans tried to hold the Euripus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nevertheless, even they, when they were besieged by land and sea and saw the engines and artillery being moved forward, did not withstand the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Since the king held this, which was the chief city of Euboea, the other cities of the island did not disobey his orders, and he seemed to himself to have made an important start to the war in the fact that so great an island and so many well-situated cities had come under his sway.</p>

				<p>Publius Scipio Africanus, sent on an embassy to
					Antiochus, at Ephesus conversed with Hannibal, who had
					associated himself with Antiochus, in order that, if it
					were possible, he should take from him the fear which he
					felt of the Roman people. Among other things, when
					he asked whom Hannibal considered the greatest general,
					he named Alexander, king of the Macedonians, because
					with a small force he had defeated armies uncountable
					and because he had traversed the farthest countries, to
					see which was beyond human hopes. When Scipio asked
					whom he ranked second, he said that Pyrrhus had been
					the first to teach the art of castrametation, and besides
					no one had chosen his ground or placed his troops more
					skilfully. Continuing as to whom he would place third,
					he named himself there. Scipio then asked with a smile,
					<quote>What would you say if you had defeated me?</quote> <quote>Then,
						in truth,</quote> he replied, <quote>I should have ranked myself

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Cornelius Scipio, the son of Gnaeus,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> and Manius Acilius Glabrio<note>For their election cf. XXXV. xxiv. 5.</note> were inaugurated consuls, and were directed by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Fathers, before they took up the question of provinces, to perform sacrifices with full-grown victims at all the shrines at which the <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> was a festival at which the images of the gods were exposed on couches (hence <hi rend="italics">lecti-</hi>) on the streets and were served with food.</note> was customarily celebrated throughout the greater part of the year, and to offer prayer that what the senate had in mind regarding the new war might turn out well and successfully for the senate and the Roman people.<note>For the formula cf. XXI. v. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All these sacrifices were favourable and good omens were obtained from the first victims,<note>The entrails of the victims were inspected; if the first animal sacrificed did not yield a favourable result the ceremony was repeated until good omens were secured.</note> and the interpretation of the <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> was this, that in this war the boundaries of the Roman people were being enlarged and that victory and a triumph were foreshadowed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When this had been reported, the Fathers, their minds freed of religious scruples, directed that the question be proposed to the assembly, whether they wished and ordered<note>For the formula cf. XXXI. vi. 1.</note> war to be entered upon with King Antiochus and those who had followed his path;<note>Cf. XXXV. xlix. 5; the alliterative phrase has a half-proverbial sound.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> if this motion should be adopted, then, if the consuls saw fit, they should lay the whole question before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius Cornelius carried the motion; the senate then decreed that the consuls should cast lots for the <pb id="p.157"/>provinces of Italy and Greece<note>In XXXV. xli. 3 one province was left undetermined; the conduct of the war against Antiochus is now specifically named as that province, though the designation <quote>Greece</quote> is somewhat vague. (Livy's method separates events which probably were close together in time. In XXXV. xxiv. the imminence of the war demanded an early election; in XXXV. xli. the question of the provinces was under consideration, but the decision is reported only here.)</note> ; the one to whom<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Greece should be allotted was instructed, in addition to that number of troops which the consul Lucius Quinctius had enlisted or levied for service in that province in accordance with the action of the senate,<note>Cf. XXXV. xli. 5.</note> to take over the army which Marcus Baebius<note>Cf. XXXV. xxiv. 7.</note> the praetor had the year before transported to Macedonia with the authorization of the senate;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he was permitted also, if the situation required it, to accept from the allies outside of Italy for auxiliaries not to exceed five thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was the senate's pleasure that Lucius Quinctius, the consul of the preceding year, should be taken to this war as a lieutenant.<note>Nothing more is heard of this proposal, and in xvii. 1 two other <hi rend="italics">legati</hi> are mentioned. It has been reported (in XXXV. xxiii. 5) that Titus Quinctius was one of five <hi rend="italics">legati</hi> sent to Greece to exercise <hi rend="italics">auctoritas,</hi> and Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Flamininus</hi> xvii) speaks of him as legatus to Acilius. It is therefore probable that the sources confused the two Quinctii and that thus the tradition came into existence that one of them had been <hi rend="italics">legatus</hi> to Acilius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The other consul, to whom Italy should have fallen as a province, was ordered to carry on war with the Boii, using whichever he preferred of the two armies which the preceding consuls had had, and to send the other. to Rome, and that these, as reserve legions,<note>The <hi rend="italics">urbanae legiones</hi> were normally new troops.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These decrees having been enacted in the senate, and it being up to this time uncertain which province would be assigned to which consul; it was then at length decided that the consuls should cast lots.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To Acilius fell Greece, to Cornelius Italy. The drawing being concluded, a decree of the senate was then passed that, since the Roman people had <pb id="p.159"/>at that time ordered that there be war<note>The archaic form <hi rend="italics">duellum</hi> is especially appropriate to such formulae.</note> with King<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Antiochus and those who were under his authority, the consuls should proclaim a period of prayer for the success of this undertaking, and that the consul Manius Acilius should vow the great games<note>Cf. IV. xxvii. 1.</note> to Jupiter and gifts at all the banquet-tables of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This vow, at the dictation of Publius Licinius the high priest, the consul made-in the following form:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>If the war which the people has ordered to be undertaken with King Antiochus shall have been finished to the satisfaction of the senate and the Roman people, then in your honour, Jupiter, the Roman people will perform the Great
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Games for ten consecutive days and gifts will be offered at all the banquet-tables, of whatever value the senate shall determine. Whatever magistrate shall celebrate these games, at whatever time and place, let these games be regarded as duly celebrated and the gifts as duly offered.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the period of prayer was proclaimed by both consuls, to continue for two days.</p> 
				<p>The consuls having drawn for their provinces, the praetors too at once cast lots. Marcus Junius Brutus received the two jurisdictions, Aulus Cornelius Mammula the Brutti, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Sicily, Lucius Oppius Salinator Sardinia, Gaius Livius Salinator the fleet, Lucius Aemilius Paulus Farther Spain.<note>The selection of these praetorian provinces was reported at XXXV. xli. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Troops were assigned to them thus: to Aulus Cornelius were given the new troops raised the year before by Lucius Quinctius the consul under the decree of the senate,<note>Cf. XXXV. xli. 7.</note> and he was ordered to defend the whole coast in the vicinity of Tarentum and Brundisium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To Lucius Aemilius Paulus, for service in Farther Spain, authority was given to raise, in addition to the army which he was to take <pb id="p.161"/>over from Marcus Fulvius the proconsul, three<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> thousand new infantry and three hundred cavalry, on this basis, that two-thirds should be
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> allies of the Latin confederacy and one-third Roman citizens. The same reinforcement was sent to Gaius Flaminius,<note>Cf. XXXV. ii.</note> whose <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> was prolonged, for Nearer Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was directed to take over both province and army from Lucius Valerius, whom he was to succeed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> if he desired, he should keep Lucius Valerius in the province as propraetor and should divide the province in such a way that one part should extend from Agrigentum to Pachynum, the other from Pachynum to Tyndareus;<note>This arrangement provides for the defence of the vulnerable southern and eastern coasts. Less concern is felt regarding the interior.</note> this coast Lucius Valerius was to guard with twenty warships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The same praetor was instructed to requisition two tithes<note>Sicily and Sardinia paid their tributes on the tithe system, probably on the basis of the pre-Roman legislation of Hiero. Rome in such cases probably paid for the second tithe.</note> of grain; he was to see to its collection on the coast and its transportation to Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The same order was given to Lucius Oppius regarding collecting a second tithe in Sardinia; this grain, however, they wished transported not to Greece but to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Gaius Livius the praetor, to whom the fleet had been allotted, was instructed to prepare thirty ships and cross to Greece at the earliest opportunity and to take over the fleet from Atilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The refitting and equipping of the old ships which were in the yards was assigned to Marcus Junius the praetor, and the enrolment of freedmen as naval allies.<note>Service on the sea was less honourable than service on land: cf. XXXII. xxiii. 9. Roman citizens were usually exempt.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Commissioners were sent to Africa, three each to the Carthaginians and to Numidia, to solicit <pb id="p.163"/>grain to be shipped to Greece, for which the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> people would pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so absorbed was the state in the preparation and provision for this war that Publius Cornelius the consul issued an edict to the effect that, of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> those who were senators and those who had the right to vote in the senate<note>Persons who had held the offices which conferred eligibility to sit in the senate but had not yet been formally admitted by the censors were granted in the interim the <hi rend="italics">ius sententiam dicendi.</hi></note> and those who held the lesser offices, no one should be so far distant from the city of Rome that he could not return the same day, and that five senators should not be away from Rome at one time. In his zealous collection of a fleet Gaius Livius was delayed for a while by a dispute which arose with the colonists on the coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For when they were drafted for naval service they appealed to the tribunes of the people; by them they were referred to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> With such unanimity that all the members to a man agreed, the senate voted that no exemptions from naval service should be granted to these colonists.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Ostia, Fregenae, Castrum Novum, Pyrgi, Antium, Terracina, Minturnae and Sinuessa were the colonies which disputed with the praetor over exemptions. Then the consul Manius Acilius, with the authorization of the senate, laid the question before the college of fetials whether the declaration of war should be delivered to King Antiochus himself directly or whether it sufficed that it be proclaimed at some of his military stations;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and also whether they ordered the war to be formally announced to the Aetolians independently, and whether the alliance and friendship with them should be formally broken off before the declaration of war.<note>Here, as in XXXV. xxxiii. 4, it is assumed that the alliance with the Aetolians was in effect, even though there is no mention of any formal renewal after the war with Philip. There is also no record of any declaration of war upon the Aetolians, except as they were included among the partisans of Antiochus (i. 5 above).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fetials replied that they had already <pb id="p.165"/>earlier decided, when they were consulted regarding<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Philip,<note>Cf. XXXI. viii. 3.</note> that it made no difference whether the declaration was delivered to him in person or at a military post;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the friendship seemed to be already broken off since they had voted that restitution had not been made after ambassadors had so often demanded it nor fair satisfaction given;<note>The etiquette of declarations of war was a special function of the fetials, and the importance of proper ceremonial was very great, not only because of the Roman fondness for punctiliousness but because of their desire to have justice and the gods on their side. The traditional form of the fetial ritual
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> &mdash; probably little changed in later times &mdash;is described by Livy in I. xxxii; it put especial stress on the demand for restitution (<hi rend="italics">res repetere</hi>) of stolen property, as would be natural in early times. The same phraseology is used here: the immediate cause for complaint on Rome's part was Antiochus' attempt to recover the Greek cities on the Asian coast (XXXV. xvi. 3). The <quote>restitution</quote> demanded of him was the abandonment of the attempt to take away their liberties. The Aetolians were involved with him in this offence.</note> the Aetolians had taken the initiative in declaring war upon them when they had seized Demetrias,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> a city belonging to the allies, by violence, had proceeded to invest Chalcis by land and sea, and had invited King Antiochus to Europe to make war upon the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Roman people.<note>These actions on the part of the Aetolians were good enough causes for war, even though they were not, literally, the specific offences contemplated by the fetial institution. Possibly these overt acts justified the Romans in omitting a formal declaration of war upon them.</note> All arrangements having been satisfactorily made, the consul Manius Acilius issued an edict to the soldiers whom Lucius Quinctius
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> had enlisted and those whom he had requisitioned from the allies of the Latin confederacy, whom he was to take with him to his province, and to the military tribunes<note>The military tribunes were elected by the assembly (XXVII. xxxvi. 14).</note> of the first and the third legions, that they should all assemble at Brundisium on the Ides of May. He himself left the City in uniform on the fifth day before the Nones
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> of May. About the same time the praetors too set out for their provinces.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time ambassadors arrived in Rome from two kings, Philip and Ptolemy,<note>Ptolemy was the son-in-law of Antiochus (XXXV. xiii. 4).</note> King of Egypt; Philip promised aid and money and grain <pb id="p.167"/>for the war; from Ptolemy also was brought the<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> sum of a thousand pounds of gold and twenty thousand pounds of silver.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> None of these gifts was accepted; thanks were expressed to the kings, and when each of them promised to come with all his forces to Aetolia and participate in the war, Ptolemy was excused from this;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> to the ambassadors of Philip the answer was given that it would be acceptable to the senate and
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the Roman people if he did not fail the consul Manius Acilius. Ambassadors also came from the Carthaginians and King Masinissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Carthaginians promised five hundred<note>The quantity is doubtful (see the critical note). I have followed what seems to be the most trustworthy authority.</note> thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi> of wheat and five hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi> of barley, and offered to transport half of it to Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they begged the Romans to accept it as a gift from them and they said that they would prepare a fleet at their own expense and would pay at once in a lump sum the tribute which they owed in successive instalments over a term of years.<note>The treaty of peace with Carthage provided for annual payments of tribute for fifty years (XXX. xxxvii.. 5; Polybius XV. xviii). The Carthaginians were prepared to pay at once the entire balance. The financial reforms introduced by Hannibal (XXXIII. xlvii. 1-2) had apparently been effective.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The ambassadors of Masinissa promised that the king would send five hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi> of wheat and three hundred thousand of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> barley to Greece for the army, three hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi> of wheat and two hundred fifty thousand of barley to Rome, and five hundred cavalry and twenty elephants to Manius Acilius the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Regarding the grain, the answer was given both that the Roman people would use the grain if they would accept pay for it; the Carthaginians were released from their promise about the fleet, except with respect to the ships which -they owed under <pb id="p.169"/>the treaty;<note>The sources quoted in the preceding note say nothing of any obligation to furnish ships to Rome, aside from the surrender of vessels on hand at the close of the war. However, we see from xliv. 5 below that there were Carthaginian ships in the fleet of Livius in the east.</note> as to the money also, the reply was<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> that they would accept none before it was due.<note>Editors are disagreed as to the interpretation of this somewhat ungracious reply. Some say that Rome feared to lose her hold on Carthage; it is pleasanter to believe with others that Rome wanted to give the impression to Carthage as to Philip, both of whom seem exceedingly generous, that she was able with her own resources to meet even an emergency of this magnitude. It would be interesting to know whether these recent enemies were simply politic or were really as well-disposed as their offers of help indicates.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on at Rome, Antiochus at Chalcis, not to waste the winter in idleness,<note>Livy now resumes the narrative of events in the east, interrupted at the end of Book XXXV. The winter referred to is that of 192-<date value="-191">191 B.C.</date></note> sometimes was himself stirring up the minds of the states by sending embassies, sometimes was receiving delegations voluntarily sent to him, as, for instance, the Epirotes, who came with the unanimous approval of the people, and the men of Elis from the Peloponnesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Elei were asking aid against the Achaeans, who, they thought, would attack their city first after declaring a war on Antiochus of which the Elei disapproved.<note>To judge by other casual references, such as Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Cato</hi> xii) and the hints in XXXV. 1, Greece was in a state of great unrest at this time, although Livy minimizes the trouble.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A thousand infantry were sent to them under command of Euphanes the Cretan. The embassy of the Epirotes showed no outspoken and plain inclination to either side; they were trying to curry favour with the king, meanwhile avoiding giving any offence to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For they asked that he should not heedlessly involve them in the affair,<note>Polybius (XX. iii.) is more explicit, defining <hi rend="italics">causa</hi> as the war itself.</note> being placed face to face with Italy, in the forefront of Greece and fated to receive the first attacks of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But if he himself could stand guard over Epirus with his armies and fleets, all the Epirotes would eagerly receive him in cities and harbours alike; if he could not, they <pb id="p.171"/>begged that he should not make them, naked and<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> unarmed, bear the brunt of the Roman war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was clear that the object of the embassy was that either, if, as they rather believed, he kept away from Epirus, they might not be committed to anything in the eyes of the Roman armies, though they had well established their position with the king, since they had been ready to receive him if he
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> came, or, if he did come, that thus there would be the hope of pardon from the Romans because, not expecting from them aid which was so far away, they had yielded to the might of the king who was so close at hand.<note>One can hardly blame the Epirotes for trying to guard themselves against any contingency. Apollonia, the usual port of debarkation of the Romans, lay just to the north, and Roman armies would soon be passing through their country (we know little of the whereabouts of the army brought over by Baebius). On the other hand, if the strength of Antiochus in any degree equalled the large forces promised by him, he would probably not hesitate to cut loose from his bases and try to locate the theatre of operations on the west coast.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Since there was no sufficiently obvious reply to such an equivocal proposal, he said that he would send ambassadors to them to confer with them concerning the questions which pertained to them and himself alike.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He himself proceeded to Boeotia, which had as apparent causes for anger at the Romans those occurrences which I mentioned before,<note>Cf. XXXV. xlvii. 3 and the note.</note> the murder of Brachyllas and the campaign carried on by Quinctius at Coronea by reason of the slaughtering of the Roman soldiers, while in fact
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the discipline<note>Livy probably has in mind the period of Theban greatness under Pelopidas and Epaminondas.</note> in which that people was once eminent, in public and private, had for many years now been degenerating, and the condition of many was such that it could not last without a change of circumstances.<note>Polybius (XX. iv. ff.) gives a more depressing picture of conditions in Boeotia. As the Aetolians had seen (XXXV. xxxiv. 3), economic distress prepared many for any sort of political change: cf. XLII. xxx. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With the chiefs of Boeotia coming out in crowds to meet him, he arrived in Thebes. There in the council of the people, although he had, both by the attack made on the Roman garrison at Delium<note>Cf. XXXV. li.</note> and by the <pb id="p.173"/>capture of Chalcis, acts which were neither<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> unimportant nor uncertain, engaged in war, he nevertheless began the same speech that he had used in the first conference at
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> Chalcis<note>Cf. XXXV. xxxvi. 5 ff.</note> and that he had delivered through his delegates<note>Cf. XXXV. xlviii. 8-9.</note> in the council of the Achaeans, to wit, that he asked that they make a treaty of friendship with him, not that they declare war on the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No one was deceived as to what was going on; nevertheless, a decree was passed, under a cloak of mild verbiage, in favour of the king and against the Romans.<note>The precise terms of the decree are uncertain: perhaps it declared Boeotia neutral but lent encouragement to Antiochus.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Having won over this people also, he returned to Chalcis, sending in advance letters to summon to Demetrias the chiefs of the Aetolians, with whom he could take counsel regarding the general policy, and himself arrived there by boat on the day appointed for the conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Amynander also, summoned from Athamania to take part in the deliberations, and Hannibal the Carthaginian, who for a long time past had not been called in,<note>In XXXV. xix. 7 the reconciliation of Hannibal and Antiochus was described; later the arguments of Thoas (XXXV. xlii. 6-14) were more effective.</note> attended the council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The question for consideration had to de with the Thessalian people, whose intentions, as all who were present agreed, should be ascertained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the matter of procedure there were different opinions, some favouring immediate action, others thinking that they should postpone doing anything from the winter, which was now half gone, to the beginning of spring, while some thought that ambassadors only should be sent and others that he should go with his entire force
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> and terrorize them if they hesitated.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Since the whole debate centred practically on this one question, Hannibal, appealed to by name for his opinion, turned the king and all who <pb id="p.175"/>were present to the consideration of the war as a<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> whole, by a speech of the following character:<note>The speech of Hannibal is also reported by Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 14), and both versions are probably derived from Polybius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>If I had been invited to the council from the time we crossed to Greece, when the question concerned Euboea or the Achaeans or Boeotia, I should have expressed the same opinion as to-day when we are discussing the Thessalians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Before anything else, I vote that Philip and the Macedonians be drawn, in any possible way, into a military alliance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For as to Euboea and the Boeotians and the Thessalians, who doubts that they, possessing no strength of their own, are ever fawning upon those who are close at hand, and will use the same fearfulness which they display in the council as a means of winning pardon, and that,
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> as soon as they see the Roman army in Greece, they will turn back to their accustomed masters and that they will suffer no harm because, when the Romans were far away, they were unwilling to test, face to face, the strength of you and your army?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> How much greater priority and preference should we give to allying ourselves with Philip rather than with them? He, if once he joins our cause, will have no choice left,<note>A <hi rend="italics">causa integra</hi> was one which left the person concerned free to choose his course of action. An alliance between Philip and Antiochus would at once commit Philip to war with Rome, and so leave <hi rend="italics">nihil integri</hi> to him.</note> and he can contribute that strength which will be not merely an additional resource for the Roman war, but one which by itself alone was able recently to withstand the Romans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With this reinforcement &mdash;may I say so without offence<note>The term <hi rend="italics">invidia</hi> always suggests <quote>casting the evil eye upon</quote> the person or act involved. Here proud words were held to provoke the jealousy of the powers above, and Hannibal is deprecating this <hi rend="italics">invidia.</hi></note> &mdash;how can I doubt the result when I see that those very men with whose <pb id="p.177"/>assistance the Romans prevailed over Philip will<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> now be overwhelming the Romans themselves?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Aetolians who, as all agree, defeated Philip, will fight with Philip against the Romans; Amynander and the nation of the Athamanes, whose services in
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> that war were the greatest after those of the Aetolians, will stand with us; Philip then, when you were inactive, bore the whole burden of the war;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> now you, the two mightiest kings of Asia and Europe, will wage war against one people which, not to speak of my own twofold experience, in the time of our fathers at least could not contend even against one king of Epirus &mdash;and how could he be compared with you? What cause, then, convinces me that Philip can be allied with us?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> First, the common profit, which is the firmest bond in an alliance; second, the assurances of you Aetolians. For your representative, Thoas here, among other reasons which he was wont to use to attract Antiochus to
						<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> Greece, continually made this assertion before all else, that Philip was enraged and that he found it hard to bear the laws of slavery imposed upon him under the guise of peace. Indeed in his speech he likened the king in his wrath to a wild beast chained or shut up and trying to break his bonds.<note>In XXXV. xviii. 6 this figure is attributed to Alexander the Acarnanian.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If such is his temper, let us break his chains and tear away his bars, that he may let loose his long-restrained passion upon the common enemy. But if our embassy to him does not move him, let us at least, since we cannot unite him with ourselves, see to it that he does not make common cause with our foes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Your son Seleucus is at Lysimachia; if with that army which he has with him he shall begin to move through Thrace and devastate the adjacent portions of Macedonia, he <pb id="p.179"/>will easily turn Philip from sending aid to the Romans<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> to the more important task of defending his own possessions.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> As to Philip you have my views; even from the first you have not been ignorant of my opinion as to the strategy of the war as a whole.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> If I had been listened to then, the Romans would not now be hearing that Chalcis in Euboea was captured and a fort on the Euripus, but that Etruria and the coasts of Liguria and Cisalpine Gaul were aflame with war and &mdash;this is what they dread beyond everything else &mdash;that Hannibal is in Italy. Now too I vote that you summon all your forces on land and sea; &mdash; let cargo-boats follow-with supplies, for, as we are few here for the tasks of war, so we are too many in proportion to our shortage of supplies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> When you have assembled all your strength, you will divide your fleet, keeping part on guard near Corcyra, that free and safe passage may not be open
						<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> to the Romans, and sending part across to the coast of Italy which faces Sardinia and Africa;
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> you yourself will go ahead with all your armies to the territory of Bullis;<note>Bullis (Byllis) was a town on the Illyrian coast not far from Apollonia.</note> thence you will stand guard over Greece and offer to the Romans the appearance of being about to cross, and, if the situation shall demand it, will actually cross.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> This is the advice I give, I who, though I am not well versed in every kind of war, with the Romans at least have learned to fight from my own successes and failures. For this same programme which I have advised I promise aid neither faithless nor reluctant.
						<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> May the gods approve that proposal which shall have seemed to you the best.</quote></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This was in purport the speech of Hannibal; those who were present applauded it for the moment <pb id="p.181"/>rather than adopted it in actual decisions; for<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> nothing of these things was done, save that he sent Polyxenidas to summon the fleet and troops from Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ambassadors were sent to Larisa to the council of the Thessalians, and a day was fixed for the Aetolians and Amynander to hold the muster of the army at Pherae; the king also with his troops came with speed to the same place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While he was waiting there for Amynander and the Aetolians, he sent Philip of Megalopolis with two thousand men to collect the bones of the Macedonians around Cynoscephalae, where the decisive battle with Philip was fought, whether he was prompted by Philip
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> of Megalopolis,<note>For this Philip and his aspirations to the Macedonian throne, see XXXV. xlvii. 5-8.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A burial mound was erected by gathering together the bones which were scattered everywhere, but among the Macedonians it caused no gratitude and in King Philip an immense resentment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so he, who up to that time had decided to take fortune as the guide to his policy,<note>Philip had decided to await developments before adopting any course of action; his resentment at Antiochus now leads him to join forces with the Romans.</note> at once wrote to Marcus Baebius the propraetor to say that Antiochus had invaded Thessaly; if it seemed wise to Baebius he should move from winter quarters; he himself would come to meet him to consult what should be done.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Antiochus was in camp at Pherae, where the Aetolians and Amynander had joined him, ambassadors from Larisa came asking for what deed or word of the Thessalians he was assailing them with war, and likewise asking
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> that he should <pb id="p.183"/>withdraw his army and discuss with them through<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> ambassadors whatever seemed to him worth considering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the same time they sent five hundred armed men under command of Hippolochus as a garrison for Pherae; they were prevented from entering, all the roads being now blocked by the king's forces, and retired to Scotusa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king responded mildly to the ambassadors of the Larisaeans, that he had entered Thessaly not to make war but to defend and assure the liberty of the Thessalians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A delegate was sent to conduct similar negotiations with the people of Pherae; giving him no answer, the Pheraeans themselves sent to the king Pausanias, their chief magistrate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he had with a good deal of vigour presented certain arguments not unlike those which, in a similar situation, had been used on behalf of the Chalcidians in the conference at the strait of Euripus,<note>Probably the conference reported at XXXV. xxxviii. 8 ff.</note> the king, bidding
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> them again and again to ponder and not to adopt any plan of which, while being too cautious and thoughtful for the future, they would at once repent, dismissed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When this mission was reported at Pherae, they did not even for a brief period doubt that they should, for the sake of their loyalty to the Romans, endure whatever the fortune of war might bring.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so both the Pheraeans were preparing with all their might to defend their city and the king was attempting to assault the town from every side at once, and, since he clearly understood &mdash;for there was no question about it &mdash;that
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> it depended on the fate of this city which he attacked first, whether he should thenceforth be either scorned or feared by the whole nation of the Thessalians, he brought every form of terror to bear from all sides <pb id="p.185"/>upon the besieged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The first brunt of the attack<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> they bore with sufficient resolution; then, when many of the defenders had fallen or were wounded, their courage began to fail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Recalled then by the reproofs of their captains to persevere in their purpose, leaving the outer line of wall as their strength was now diminishing, they retired into the inner quarter of the city, which was surrounded by a rampart less long than the other; finally, overcome by their misfortunes and feeling that no quarter would be given by the conqueror if they were taken fighting, they surrendered. Then the king without delay, while the terror was still new, sent four thousand troops to Scotusa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There was no delay there in surrendering when they considered the recent case of the Pheraeans, who had finally, conquered by their ills, done what they had at first tenaciously refused to do; with the city itself Hippolochus and the garrison of Larisaeans were surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> All were released without injury by the king, because this act, in the king's opinion, would have
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> great weight in winning the sympathies of the Larisaeans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All this was accomplished within ten days after his arrival at Pherae, and going to Crannon with his entire army he captured it as soon as he reached it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he took Cierium and Metropolis<note>It is uncertain which of two towns of this name is meant: one was near Cierium, the other near Atrax.</note> and the forts around them; and everything in that region except Atrax and Gyrto was in his power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then he decided to attack Larisa, thinking that either from the fear inspired by the capture of the other towns or by their gratitude at the release of their garrison or from the example of so many other states that had submitted they would not continue long in their stubborn <pb id="p.187"/>resistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Ordering the elephants to be driven<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> before the standards to inspire fear, he marched up to the town in a hollow square, so that the thoughts of a great part of the Larisaeans wavered doubtfully between immediate fear of the enemy and respect for their distant allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> About the same time Amynander with all the youth of the Athamanes took possession of Pellinacium, and Menippus with three thousand Aetolian infantry and two hundred cavalry marched into Perrhaebia, took Malloea and Cyretiae by storm and laid waste the fields of Tripolis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having done all this with speed, they returned to the king at Larisa; they arrived there while he was considering what he should do about Larisa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There opinions turned different ways, some urging that they ought to employ force and not to delay assaulting with siege-works and artillery from all sides at once, upon the walls of a town lying in a plain open and level to approach from any direction, others reminding him now that the strength of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> this city was by no means to be compared with that of Pherae, now that it was winter and a time unsuited to all military operations and particularly to the siege and storming of cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> While the king was wavering between hope and fear, ambassadors from Pharsalus, who by chance had come-to surrender their city, gave him new courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the meantime Marcus Baebius had met Philip in the country of the Dassaretii, and as a result of the agreement of the two he sent Appius Claudius to the defence of Larisa, and he came by forced marching through Macedonia to the ridge of mountains<note>These are the foothills of Mount Olympus. The town of Gonni commanded the western approaches to Tempe.</note> which lies above Gonni.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The town of Gonni is twenty miles from Larisa, situated at the very entrance to the defile which <pb id="p.189"/>they call Tempe. When he had laid out a camp<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> there too large in proportion to the size of his force and built more fires than were necessary for practical purposes, he created in the enemy the impression he had desired, that the whole Roman army with King Philip was there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> So the king, using as a pretext to his men the approach of winter, delayed only one day and retired from Larisa and withdrew to Demetrias, and the Aetolians and Athamanes returned to their own countries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Although Appius saw that the siege had been raised, which had been the purpose of his coming, he yet went down to Larisa to reassure the minds of the allies for the future; and there was double joy, both because the enemy had left their country and
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> because they saw a Roman garrison within the walls.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Demetrias the king went on to Chalcis, having fallen in love with a young woman of Chalcis, the daughter of Cleoptolemus,<note>Polybius (XX. viii.) adds other details, that Antiochus was now fifty years old, that Cleoptolemus was a man of rank, and that his daughter, whom Antiochus named Euboea, was of extraordinary beauty, and that she escaped to Ephesus after the defeat at Thermopylae. On the other hand, he says nothing of the reluctance of her father to permit the match, and he makes less of the unsuitability of Antiochus' conduct.</note> and when he had worn her father out first
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> by sending messengers, then by personal requests delivered verbally, the father being reluctant to entangle himself in a match which promised too great difficulties, at length he gained his point, and as if in the midst of peace he celebrated his nuptials and for the rest of the winter, forgetful of the magnitude of the two tasks he had undertaken, the Roman war and the liberation of Greece, laying aside the responsibility for everything he engaged in banquets and the delights which follow wine and then, from weariness rather than satiety of these pleasures, he gave himself over to sleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This same habit of easy living seized all the king's prefects who were <pb id="p.191"/>in command of the winter camps everywhere,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> especially in Boeotia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the soldiers too fell into the same way of life, nor did one of them put on his armour or walk his post or perform sentinel-duty or do anything else which pertained to the tasks and duties of a soldier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so at the beginning of spring,<note>In iii. 14 above the narrative of events in Rome was brought up to May. The account of events in Greece is now abreast of it.</note> when he had come by way of Phocis to Chaeronea, where he had ordered the whole army to assemble from all its stations, he readily perceived that the soldiers had spent the winter under no sterner discipline than their commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then he ordered Alexander the Acarnanian and Menippus the Macedonian to conduct their troops to Stratus in Aetolia; he himself offered sacrifice to Apollo at Delphi and proceeded to Naupactus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having held a conference with the Aetolian chiefs, on the road which leads past Calydon and Lysimachia to Stratus, he met his own men who were marching by way of the Malian gulf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There Mnasilochus, a leading Acarnanian, purchased by many gifts, did not merely by his own efforts win over the people to the king's side, but even brought Clytus the praetor, who at that time held the chief magistracy, over to his own opinion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he saw that the people of Leucas, this being the principal city of Acarnania, could not easily be induced to rebel, because of their fear of the Roman fleet which was with Atilius and which was off Cephallania, he attacked them-by guile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For when he had said in the council that the interior portions of Acarnania should be defended and that all who could bear arms should repair to Medio and Thyrreum, that these towns might not be captured by Antiochus or the Aetolians, there were some who argued that it was unnecessary that all should be called out as for a <pb id="p.193"/>major emergency, but that a garrison of five hundred<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> men was adequate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Obtaining this number of young men and placing three hundred at Medio and two hundred at Thyrreum as garrisons, he so conducted matters that these might fall into the hands of the king to serve as hostages.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time the ambassadors of the king reached Medio; when they had been heard and the general assembly was debating the question of what
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> answer should be given the king, and some urged that they should abide by the Roman alliance and others that the friendship of the king should not be disdained, the opinion of Clytus seemed
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> to take the middle course and was therefore adopted, that they should send ambassadors to the king and ask him to permit the people of Medio to deliberate on so important a matter in the council of the Acarnanians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mnasilochus and those who belonged to his faction were deliberately thrust into this embassy, and sending secret messages to the king to urge him to move his army forward, they themselves wasted time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, when the ambassadors had barely set out, Antiochus was already at the frontier and soon before the gates, and while those who were without knowledge of the treachery were in panic and were excitedly calling the youth to arms, he was admitted into the city by Clytus and Mnasilochus; and as some flocked to him voluntarily, those who disagreed also, under the compulsion of fear, joined the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he had pacified the terror-stricken by a kindly speech, several states of Acarnania went over to him, attracted by the hope of his well-known clemency.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He proceeded to Thyrreum from Medio, sending ahead the same Mnasilochus <pb id="p.195"/>and the ambassadors. But the treachery disclosed<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> at Medio made the people of Thyrreum more cautious, not more fearful;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> giving an answer quite free from ambiguity, to the effect that they would enter upon no new alliance except with the authorization of the Roman commanders, they closed. the gates and disposed guards along the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And, very fortunately for the reassurance of the minds of the Acarnanians, Gnaeus Octavius, sent by Quinctius, when he had received an escort and a few ships from Aulus Postumius, who had been placed in command at Cephallania by Atilius the lieutenant,<note>Atilius would normally be called <hi rend="italics">propraetor,</hi> as is Baebius in viii. 6 above, since both were waiting for their successors.</note> came to Leucas
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> and filled the allies with the hope that the consul Manius Acilius with the legions had already crossed the sea and that there was a Roman camp in Thessaly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Since this rumour was rendered plausible by the fact that the season of the year was now suitable for navigation, the king left garrisons at Medio and certain other towns in Acarnania, went away from Thyrreum and returned by way of the cities in Aetolia and Phocis to Chalcis.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Marcus Baebius and King Philip, who had already previously met in the country of the Dassaretii, when they had sent Appius Claudius into Thessaly to raise the siege of Larisa, and, because the time
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> seemed too early for active campaigning, had returned to their winter quarters, at the beginning of spring joined their forces and marched down into Thessaly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Antiochus was then in Acarnania. When they arrived, Philip attacked Malloea in Perrhaebia, and Baebius Phacium; when this fell at the first assault Baebius took Phaestum With the same speed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had turned back from there to Atrax, he next occupied Cyretiae <pb id="p.197"/>and Eritium, and establishing garrisons in the towns<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> he had recovered he rejoined Philip, who was still engaged in the siege of Malloea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When at the coming of the Roman army the people of Malloea had surrendered, whether through fear of Roman might or in the hope of pardon, Baebius and Philip moved in one column to retake the towns which the Athamanes had occupied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These were the following: Aeginium, Ericinium, Gomphi, Silana, Tricca, Meliboea, Phaloria.<note>These towns, so far as they can be located, were on the western borders of Thessaly. Cf. x. 5 above.</note> Then Pellinaeum, where Philip of Megalopolis with
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> five hundred infantry and forty cavalry was in the garrison, was surrounded, and before they stormed it they sent to Philip to advise him not to wish to try resistance to the last.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this he replied with sufficient vehemence that he would entrust himself either to the Romans or to the Thessalians but would not put himself in the power of Philip.<note>That is, King Philip, who naturally resented his namesake's aspirations.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When it was evident that force must be employed, because it seemed that Limnaeum could be stormed at the same time, it was decided that the king should go to Limnaeum while Baebius remained to attack Pellinaeum.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During this time, as it happened, Manius Acilius the consul crossed the sea with twenty thousand infantry, two thousand cavalry, and fifteen elephants,<note>Cf. iii. 13 above. It is not easy to account for these troops. In XXXV. xli. 4 the senate authorized 10,000 infantry and 700 cavalry for this campaign, in addition to the two legions commanded by Baebius, but these legions were still at Pellinaeum. The 5,000 allies from Greece were probably not included. The elephants may be part of the twenty promised by Masinissa (iv. 8 above). The loss of this portion of the text of Polybius increases the difficulty, but he is probably the source of this passage, since Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 17) agrees generally with Livy. Acilius probably disembarked at Apollonia and marched down the western coast of Epirus.</note> and ordered the military tribunes to lead the infantry to Larisa; he himself with the cavalry went to Philip at Limnaeum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The arrival of the <pb id="p.199"/>consul caused surrender to be offered without delay,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> and the royal garrison was handed over and along with them the Athamanes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From Limnaeum the consul went to Pellinaeum. There the Athamanes first gave themselves up, then Philip of Megalopolis;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> when by chance King Philip encountered him as he was leaving the garrison, he ordered him hailed as king in mockery, and meeting him face to face, he greeted him as <quote>brother,</quote> a jest by no means befitting his dignity.<note>The same propensity was criticized at XXXII. xxxiv. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Conducted then before the consul, he was ordered to be placed under guard, and a little later was sent to Rome in chains. The rest of the people of the Athamanes or of the soldiers of King Antiochus who had been in the garrisons of the towns surrendered at this period were delivered to King Philip: they numbered now about four thousand men. The consul proceeded to Larisa, there to hold a council regarding the general conduct of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the way ambassadors came from Cierium and Metropolis surrendering their cities. Philip treated with especial kindness the prisoners of the Athamanes, that through them he might win over the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> tribe, and entertaining the hope of gaining possession of Athamania, he led his army thither, sending the captives ahead to their cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And they had great influence with their fellow-citizens, recalling the kindness and generosity of the king towards them, and Amynander, who, had he been present, might by his majesty have kept some to their allegiance, fearing that
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> he would be delivered to Philip, long his enemy, or to the Romans, at that time justly angered because of his desertion, left the kingdom with his wife and children and took refuge in Ambracia; thus all. Athamania came under the <pb id="p.201"/>sovereignty and power of Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul, to<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> rest the pack-animals which had been exhausted both by the voyage and by the later marching, delayed a few days at Larisa, and with an army renewed, so to speak, by a brief rest, proceeded to Crannon. On his journey Pharsalus and Scotusa and Pherae and the garrisons of Antiochus which were in them were surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Questioning them as to who were willing to stay with him, he handed over to Philip a thousand volunteers and sent the rest unarmed back to Demetrias. Next he took Proerna and the forts surrounding it. Then he began to lead the army straight towards the Malian gulf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As he drew near the pass above which Thaumaci<note>Cf. XXXII. iv. 1-4.</note> is situated, the young men left the town, armed themselves and attacked the Roman column from the higher ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At first the consul sent men to try, by talking to them at close quarters, to deter them from so insane a course; when he saw that they persisted in their purpose, he sent a tribune with the soldiers of two maniples by a roundabout way, closed the road to the city against the soldiers, and captured the undefended town. Then when they heard the shouts from the captured city behind them there was a slaughter by the troops in ambush, as the enemy fled in all directions from the forests.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From Thaumaci on the second day the consul came to the Spercheus river and then laid waste the
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> lands of the Hypataeans.<note>The Romans have now recovered practically all the towns taken by Antiochus, as a comparison of place-names shows.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on Antiochus was at Chalcis, now at last perceiving that he had gained nothing from Greece except a pleasant winter at Chalcis and a shameful marriage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he began to blame the false promises of the Aetolians and <pb id="p.203"/>to censure Thoas, but Hannibal he admired as not<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> only a wise man but as little less than a prophet of all that was happening.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Yet, not to risk still more his rash enterprise by his own inactivity, he sent messages to Aetolia that they should assemble all their youth and meet at Lamia; and he too led there about ten thousand infantry, including replacements from those who had later arrived from Asia, and five hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When a somewhat smaller number than ever before had-assembled there, only the chiefs, in fact, with a few clients,<note>Livy here transfers to Greece a Roman institution of which there is no other trace in Greece. The precise status of these dependents is then uncertain.</note> and these explained that they had worked with all diligence to call out the largest possible numbers from- their cities, but had prevailed by neither
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> influence nor persuasion nor right of command against the shirkers of military service, then, abandoned on all sides, both by his own subjects, who were tarrying in Asia, and by his allies, who were not fulfilling the promises by the hope of which they had invited him, he retired within the pass of Thermopylae.<note>At this distance of time and space, the war with Antiochus so far seems to have the character of comic opera: the extravagant promises of Antiochus and the Aetolians; the insignificant forces; the childish hesitation and frequent changes of plan; the feeble discipline; the burlesque scene of the marriage; the futile conquest of Thessaly; the inglorious retirement to the site of one of the most splendid events in ancient history. Rome must almost have repented of her elaborate preparations.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This ridge, just as Italy is cut in two by the backbone of the Apennines, divides Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In front of the pass of Thermopylae, facing the north, are Epirus and Perrhaebia and Magnesia and Thessaly and Phthiotic Achaea and the Malian gulf;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> within the pass towards the south lie the larger part of Aetolia and Acarnania and Phocis with Locris and Boeotia with the island of Euboea adjoining it and, on a sort of promontory running out into the sea, the <pb id="p.205"/>Attic land, and lying behind it the Peloponnesus.<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This range, taking its course from Leucas and the sea on the west and continuing through Aetolia to the other sea on the east, has such thickets and scattered cliffs that not even individuals travelling light, not to mention armies, can easily find paths by which to cross.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The mountains on the extreme east they call Oeta, the highest of which is named Callidromum, in the valley of which, where it slopes down to the Malian gulf, there is a road not wider than sixty paces. This is the one military road where an army can pass if there is no resistance.<note>Livy conceives of the pass as the terminus of a mountain barrier crossing Greece in a west-east direction. With reference to that barrier he places the principal geographical subdivisions. His comparison with the Apennines is graphic but misleading, since the geographical importance of the two ranges is quite unlike; the historical importance of Thermopylae is no doubt responsible. The pass begins here to figure in Roman history and this geographical excursus is therefore pertinent, though not in Livy's ordinary manner.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For that reason the place is called Pylae and by others, because there are warm springs within the pass itself,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> Thermopylae,<note><quote>Pylae</quote> means literally <quote>Gates,</quote> <quote>Thermopylae</quote> <quote>Hot Gates.</quote></note> and it is renowned for the death of the Lacedaemonians as they opposed the Persians, more memorable than the battle.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With a spirit wholly unlike theirs at that time, Antiochus pitched his camp within the <quote>Gates</quote> to the place and besides blocked the pass with fortifications, and when he had strengthened everything with
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> a double wall and ditch and, where the situation demanded, with a rampart constructed out of the great
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> quantity of stones which were scattered all about, confident that the Roman army would never force a passage, of the four thousand Aetolians &mdash;for so many had assembled &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> sent part to hold Heraclea with a garrison, part to Hypata,<note>Heraclea lay west-south-west of the pass, Hypata west-north-west.</note> being both certain that the consul would attack <pb id="p.207"/>Heraclea and informed by many messengers that all<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> the country around Hypata was being devastated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul, having first ravaged the fields of Hypata and then of Heraclea, the aid of the Aetolians being useless to both, encamped within the pass itself near the springs of hot water facing the king. Both contingents of Aetolians shut themselves up in Heraclea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Antiochus, to whom, before he saw the enemy, everything seemed well fortified and guarded by posts, was terror-stricken lest the Roman should find trails somewhere over the overhanging cliffs to permit their passage;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for the story was that so the Lacedaemonians were once surrounded by the Persians, and recently Philip<note>At the Aous river (XXXII. xii. 4).</note> by the Romans themselves;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> so he sent a runner to the Aetolians in Heraclea that they should render at least so much service to him in this war as to seize and hold the mountain-tops round about, that the Romans might find no way to cross.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On hearing this message a disagreement arose among the Aetolians. Part thought that they should obey the king's order and go, part that they should wait at Heraclea
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> for either turn of fortune, that, if the king were defeated by the consul, they might have fresh troops in readiness to bring aid to their cities, but if he conquered, that they might pursue the Romans when scattered in flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Each party not only adhered to its own opinion but acted on its own decision: two thousand remained at Heraclea; two thousand, separating into three detachments, occupied Callidromum and Rhoduntia and Tichius &mdash;these are names of peaks.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul saw that the higher ground was held by the Aetolians, he sent Marcus <pb id="p.209"/>Porcius Cato<note>The rank of Cato is uncertain. Cicero (<hi rend="italics">Cato major</hi> 32) calls him a <hi rend="italics">tribunus militaris,</hi> but the term <hi rend="italics">consularis legatus</hi> is frequent in Livy (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XXXV. v. 1) and is more appropriate here.</note> and Lucius Valerius Flaccus,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> lieutenants of consular rank, with two thousand picked men each, against the strong points of the Aetolians, Flaccus to Rhoduntia and Tichius, Cato to Callidromum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He himself, before he moved his troops forward against the enemy, called the soldiers to an assembly and harangued them briefly: <quote>I see that most among you, soldiers, are men of all ranks, who fought in this same province under the leadership and auspices of Titus Quinctius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the Macedonian war the pass of Aous was more difficult to traverse than this;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for surely this is a gate and the one natural aisle, so to speak, between the two seas, all other ways being closed;<note>The speaker seems to mean that Thermopylae was the only north-south gateway which could be found between the Aegean sea to the east and the Ionian sea to the west. For rhetorical reasons he regards the pass as a gateway that can be forced open rather than as a barrier that can be kept closed.</note> the fortifications were then both more suitably situated and more strongly constructed; that hostile army was both larger in numbers and composed of a somewhat better grade of soldiers;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> there, as you know, there were Macedonians and Thracians land Illyrians, all most warlike nations, here Syrians and Asiatic Greeks, the most worthless peoples among mankind and born for slavery;
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that king was most devoted to war and trained from youth up in wars with the neighbouring Thracians and Illyrians and all the inhabitants round about; here, to pass over in silence all the rest of his career, is one who, after crossing from Asia to
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> Europe to make war upon the Roman people, did nothing more worthy of note during the whole season of the winter than for love's sake to marry a woman <pb id="p.211"/>from a private home, of a family obscure and even<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> common, and the new bridegroom, stuffed, let me say, with wedding feasts, went forth to battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The substance of his strength and hope is in the Aetolians, a most boastful and ungrateful race, as you have learned before this and as Antiochus is now learning.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For neither did they come in great numbers nor could they be kept in camp, and they are even at odds with one another, and although they had demanded the guardianship of Hypata and Heraclea, they defended neither, but some fled to the mountain-tops and some shut themselves up in Heraclea.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The king himself, confessing that he not only does not dare to trust himself to battle on level ground anywhere but does not even venture to encamp in the open, abandoning all that country in front of him<note>I.e., Thessaly; in xv. 7 above Livy speaks of Thessaly as lying <quote>in front of</quote> (<hi rend="italics">ante</hi>) Thermopylae.</note> which he boasted he had taken from us and from Philip, has shut himself up within the cliffs, not even placing his camp in front of the entrance to the pass, as they say the Spartans once did, but withdrawing it deep inside;
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and how does this differ, as an exhibition of fear, from shutting himself up to be besieged within the walls of some city?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But neither the narrow defile will protect Antiochus nor the heights which they have seized the Aetolians. Sufficient care and precaution have been taken on every side to prevent your facing any peril except the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> You should hold this thought before your minds, that you are fighting not merely for the liberty of Greece, although this is a noble cause to defend, but to set free a people, formerly freed from Philip, now from the Aetolians and Antiochus, nor will your reward consist only of those things which are in the king's camp, but all that equipment too
						<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> which is daily <pb id="p.213"/>expected from Ephesus will be booty, and<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> thereafter Asia and Syria and the treasure-laden realms right up to the sunrise will be opened to Roman rule.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> What then will be lacking, that we shall not bound our empire by the ocean from Gades to the Red Sea, that ocean which holds the earth in its embrace, and that the whole human race will not reverence the Roman name next after the gods?
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Make your minds ready to deserve such great rewards, that to-morrow with the good aid of the gods we may fight it out in battle-line.</quote><note>Appian and Plutarch report no such speech, and it was probably not found in Polybius.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this assembly the soldiers were dismissed, and before they saw to their bodily needs they made ready their armour and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At daybreak the battle-signal was displayed and the consul deployed his forces on a narrow front, according to the nature and limits of the position. When the king saw the standards of the enemy he too led out his troops. Part of his light-armed troops he placed before the rampart in the front line, then he drew up the main body of the Macedonians,<note>The successors of Alexander all used the phalanx formation, which in this case was presumably made up of Syrians: cf.</note> whom they call <hi rend="italics">sarisophori,</hi><note>Literally, <quote>lancers,</quote> armed with the heavy Macedonian <hi rend="italics">sarisa.</hi></note> as a bulwark around the fortification itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Next to them on the left flank he placed a detachment of dart-throwers and archers and slingers at the very base of the mountain, to harass the exposed flank of the enemy from the higher ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the right, next to the Macedonians, at the very end of the fortification, where the ground, impassable as far as the sea, closed it in with swampy mud and quicksands, he stationed the elephants with their usual guard and behind them the cavalry; then, a short distance to the rear, the rest of his troops in <pb id="p.215"/>the second line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Macedonians standing in front<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> of the rampart at first easily held off the Romans, who were trying the approaches from every direction, with much assistance from those who from the higher ground were hurling a veritable cloud of missiles from their slings as well as darts and arrows at the same time;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> then, as a greater and more irresistible pressure was placed upon them by the enemy, driven from their places they gradually withdrew their ranks and fell back inside the fortifications; thence from the rampart they almost made another rampart of the spears held out in front of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And the height of the rampart was so moderate that it both offered its defenders higher ground from which to fight and held the enemy within thrusting-distance below them on account of the length of the spears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many who rashly drew near the rampart were run through; and either they would have withdrawn with their task unaccomplished or more would have perished had not Marcus Porcius, having dislodged the Aetolians from the heights of Callidromum and killed a large part of them &mdash;for he had caught them off their guard and many of them asleep &mdash;shown himself on the hill which overlooked the camp.<note>Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Cato</hi> xiii. ff.) gives a much more picturesque account of this episode, with greater emphasis upon Cato.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Macedonians and the others who were in the king's camp at first, while there was nothing visible in the distance except a crowd and a column, believed that the Aetolians had seen the battle from afar and were coming to their assistance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but as soon as the standards and arms, recognized close at hand, revealed their mistake, such <pb id="p.217"/>terror all at once seized them that they threw away<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> their arms and fled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Both the walls and the narrowness of the valley through which they had to pass hindered the pursuers, and most of all the fact that the elephants brought up the rear, and these the infantry could pass only with difficulty and the cavalry not at all, since the horses were frightened and caused greater disturbance in their own ranks than in the battle;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> some time was also consumed in the plundering of the camp; nevertheless, they pursued the enemy that day as far as Scarphea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They not only killed and captured many, men and horses, on the way, but also killed the elephants which they could not take, and returned to camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> this had been attacked during the time the battle was going on by the Aetolians who were holding Heraclea with their garrison, but without any results commensurate with the considerable boldness of the undertaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> During the third watch of the next night the consul sent on the cavalry to pursue the enemy and at daybreak advanced the legionary standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king had gone a considerable distance ahead, inasmuch as he had not ceased his headlong flight until he reached Elatia; there, as soon as he collected the scanty leavings of the battle and the flight, with a little band of half-armed men he withdrew to Chalcis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Roman cavalry did not overtake the king himself at Elatia; but a great part of the column, stopping either from weariness or because they had lost their way, as was natural for men fleeing without guides over strange roads, was dispersed and destroyed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> nor did anyone out of the whole army escape with the exception of five hundred who were with the king, a small number even out of the ten thousand <pb id="p.219"/>soldiers who, as I have written<note>Cf. XXXV. xliii. 6. Livy does not take into account the replacements who came over later (xv. 3 above.)</note> on the authority of<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Polybius, the king had brought with him to Greece;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> what if we were to believe Valerius Antias, who writes that there were sixty thousand men in the king's army, that forty thousand of them were killed and more than five thousand captured along with two hundred thirty military standards. One hundred fifty Romans perished in the actual shock of the battle, and from those who defended themselves against the attack of the Aetolians not more than fifty were killed.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the consul led the army through Phocis and Boeotia, the citizens, conscious of their rebellion, were standing before the gates holding badges of supplication, in fear that they would be plundered like enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But during all these days the column marched just as if they were passing through a peaceful country, doing no injury to anyone, until they came to the territory of Coronea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There a statue of King Antiochus, set up in the temple of Athena Itonia, enkindled the consul's wrath, and the soldiers were permitted to devastate the land around the temple; then the thought came to his mind that since the statue had been set up by a general decree of the Boeotians it was improper to vent his wrath on the territory of Coronea alone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The soldiers were at once recalled and an end put to the pillaging; the Boeotians received only a verbal reproof for their ingratitude to the Romans after such notable and recent acts of kindness.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Just at the time of the battle ten of the king's ships with the prefect Isidorus were moored at Thronium in the Malian gulf. Alexander the Acarnanian, arriving there sorely wounded, with news of <pb id="p.221"/>the defeat, the ships at once made for Cenaeum in<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Euboea, panic-stricken with fear. There Alexander died and was buried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Three ships which had set out from Asia and put in to the same harbour, learning of the slaughter of the army, returned to Ephesus. Isidorus from Cenaeum crossed to Demetrias, on the chance that the flight had taken the king that way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> About this time Aulus Atilius, the commander of the Roman fleet, fell in with a great quantity of stores belonging to the king which had now crossed the strait<note>By this Livy probably means the narrow stretch of water between Andros and Euboea.</note> which lies near the island of Andros; some ships he sank, others he captured; those which were in the rear turned their course towards Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Atilius with his convoy of captured ships returned to Piraeus whence he had sailed, and distributed a great quantity of grain among both the Athenians and the other allies in the same vicinity.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Antiochus, at the approach of the consul,<note>In the light of the narrative that has just preceded the leisurely progress of the consul after the battle is hard to explain or defend. A more relentless pursuit by the cavalry, reinforced with light infantry, and liaison with the fleet of Atilius, which was operating off the eastern coast, might easily have resulted in the capture of the king and the final termination of the war. Instead of following the coast route after the battle, Glabrio marched well inland, with no apparent motive, and the time he thus consumed (note especially <hi rend="italics">per omnes dies</hi> in xx. 1 above) gave the king the opportunity to reach Chalcis, reorganize the remnant of his forces, and make good his escape. We should remember that communications were slow and uncertain for both sides and information scanty and unreliable. It should also be pointed out that Livy shows no sign that he considers Acilius delinquent in any way, and there is no mention of any criticism on this ground a year later, when he was sharply criticized for other things (XXXVII. lvii. 10-15).</note> left Chalcis and first proceeded to Tenos, then crossed to Ephesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consul arrived at Chalcis the gates stood open, since at his approach Aristoteles, the king's prefect, had left the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And the other cities of Euboea were given up without a struggle; and a few days later everything was quiet and the army was led back to Thermopylae doing no injury to any city, their moderate conduct after the victory being far more worthy of praise <pb id="p.223"/>than the actual victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the consul sent<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Marcus Cato to Rome, that from him, a thoroughly trustworthy source, the senate and the Roman people might learn what had happened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From Creusa &mdash;this is the trading-port of the Thespians, lying deep in the Corinthian gulf &mdash;he made for Patrae in Achaea; from Patrae he skirted the shores of Aetolia and Acarnania right up to Corcyra and thence crossed to Hydruntum in Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the fifth day from there in hurried progress by land he arrived in Rome. Entering the City before daybreak he went from the gate straight to the praetor Marcus Junius.<note>These details might almost have been taken from some eulogistic biography (or autobiography?) of Cato: cf. the note to XXXIV. xxi. 8. The account in Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Cato</hi> xiv) differs in several respects. According to it Cato was sent immediately after the battle, that he might be the first to report his own achievements; the route was different but the five-day land journey is the same; there is no mention of Scipio.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Junius at daybreak summoned the senate; Lucius Cornelius Scipio,<note>Scipio had been defeated in the consular election for this year (XXXV. xxiv. 4) but was elected for the following year (xlv. 9 below). There is no other reference to his presence in Greece, and Livy may have confused his visit to Rome with one of Publius Scipio to announce a victory in Gaul (xxxix. 4 below).</note> who had been sent on some days before by the consul, learning on his arrival that Cato had reached there first and was in the senate, came in while he was recounting what had happened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the two legates by order of the senate were taken before the assembly and there told the same story as in the senate about the events in Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A period of thanksgiving for three days was proclaimed and the praetor was ordered to sacrifice forty full-grown victims to whatever gods he saw fit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> About the same time too Marcus Fulvius Nobilior,<note>For his appointment to Spain see XXXIV. Iv. 6; cf. also xxxix. 1 below.</note> who two years before had as praetor set out for Spain, entered the City in ovation; he carried in his procession one hundred and thirty thousand silver coins stamped with the two-horse chariot, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> in addition to the minted money twelve <pb id="p.225"/>thousand pounds of silver and one hundred and<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> twenty-seven pounds of gold.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul Acilius dispatched agents from Thermopylae to the Aetolians at Heraclea that then at least, having made trial of the king's unreliability, they might regain their senses, surrender Heraclea, and take counsel about asking pardon from the senate for their madness or, if they preferred, their mistake.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Other states of Greece too in that war, he said, had revolted from the Romans who deserved so well of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> them, but because, after the flight of the king, from confidence in whom they had thrown off their allegiance, they had not added stubbornness to their fault, they had been received into alliance; the Aetolians also, though they had not followed the king but had summoned him, and had been the leaders in the war and not allies, if they could repent, could likewise be saved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they gave no pacific reply to this, and it was evident that he must have recourse to arms, and that after the defeat of the king the Aetolian war remained as before, he moved camp from Thermopylae to Heraclea, and on the same day, to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> reconnoitre the site of the city, he rode on horseback around the walls on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Heraclea is situated at the foot of Mount Oeta, and the town proper was in a plain, with a citadel that overhung it, in a position lofty and steep on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the direction of the Asopus river, where there is also a gymnasium, he put Lucius Valerius in charge of the works and the assault; the quarters outside the walls, which were almost more densely populated than the city itself, he gave to Tiberius Sempronius Longus to attack;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> on the side towards the Malian gulf, which had a <pb id="p.227"/>rather difficult approach, he placed Marcus Baebius,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> and at another little stream, which they call Melas, facing the temple of Artemis, he stationed Appius Claudius.<note>These zones are, respectively, on the east, south-east (?), north-east and west sides of the city.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With great rivalry on their part, within a few days towers and battering-rams and all the other engines for attacking cities were prepared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And while the lands of Heraclea, all marshy and abounding in tall trees, made generous provision of materials for every kind of device, then too,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> because the Aetolians had taken refuge within the walls, the deserted houses in the entrance to the city offered them, for their various needs, not only beams and planks but brick and cement and stones of different sizes.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And the Romans for their part conducted the siege with engines rather than by personal combat; the Aetolians, on the contrary, defended themselves by arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For when the battering-rams shook the walls they did not, in the usual fashion, try to ward off the blows by catching the rams in nooses,<note>A recognized device for defence against battering-rams was to slip nooses over their heads and so dismount the rams or at least divert their blows.</note> but made frequent armed sallies, and some carried firebrands also, to throw against the works.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were also arches in the walls suitable for sally-ports, and they themselves, as they built new walls to replace those that were destroyed, left more numerous openings to permit sallies against the enemy in more directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the early days, while they were fresh in strength, they did this both frequently and stoutly; day by day then their attacks grew fewer and more half-hearted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For although many difficulties beset them, nothing wore <pb id="p.229"/>them down so much as loss of sleep; the Romans,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> with their wealth of men, sent relief after relief to the posts, while the Aetolians, on account of their small number, were tortured by constant toil falling to the same men day and night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For four-and-twenty days, so that no time was free from fighting, against an enemy attacking from four sides at once, nightly toil was joined to daily labour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the consul saw that the Aetolians were now weary, judging both by the lapse of time and by the testimony of deserters, he formed the following plan.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At midnight he gave the signal for the recall, and withdrawing all his men from the works, until the third hour of the day he kept them quiet in camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> then the siege was begun and continued again until midnight and then interrupted until the third hour of the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Aetolians thought that the cause of interrupting operations was weariness, which had troubled them too, and when the recall was sounded for the Romans, as if they too were summoned, each for himself left his post, nor did they show themselves in arms on the walls until the third hour of the day.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul had stopped the siege at midnight, during the fourth watch he again launched a furious attack from three sides,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> ordering Tiberius Sempronius on one side to hold his men alert and await orders, thinking that without doubt, in a night alarm, the enemy would rush to the point from which the noise was heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Part of the Aetolians who had been sleeping were rousing themselves, exhausted by toil and loss of sleep, part, who were still awake, rushed in the dark towards the shouts of the fighters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some of the enemy were trying to <pb id="p.231"/>climb over the fallen ruins of the wall, some<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> attempting to get up by means of ladders, and against them the Aetolians rushed from all sides to bring aid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The one side, on which there were buildings outside the city, was neither defended nor attacked; but men to attack it were waiting, eager for the signal; there was no one to defend it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was now growing light when the consul gave the signal; and without any opposition some climbed over the half-fallen walls, others with ladders surmounted the uninjured sections. At the same moment the shout which testifies that a city has been taken was heard; the Aetolians from all sides left their posts and fled to the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The victors, with the permission of the consul, plundered the city, not so much from any wrath or hatred as that the soldiers, restrained in the case of so many cities recovered from the enemy, might in some place at last see the fruits of victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The soldiers were then recalled at about midday, and when he had divided them into two parts he ordered one to be led around at the foot of the mountain to a cliff which, being about its equal in height, was cut off from the citadel by, as it were, a valley lying between them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but the summits of the two heights were so close together that from the other crest weapons could be hurled into the citadel; with the other half of the troops the consul intended to climb the citadel from the town and was waiting for the signal from those who were to come out on the cliff from the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Aetolians who were in the citadel did not endure first the shout of the party which had taken the cliff, then the attack of the Romans from the town, being now both broken in spirit and unprepared with anything necessary to <pb id="p.233"/>resist any longer an attack there, especially since<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> the women and children and the other noncombatants had collected in the citadel, which could scarce hold the defenders and still less protect so great a crowd.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so at the first assault they threw down their arms and surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Among those thus given up was Damocritus, the chief of the Aetolians, who, at the beginning of hostilities, when Titus Quinctius had asked for the decree of the Aetolians by which they had voted to invite Antiochus, had replied that he would give it to him in Italy when they had encamped there.<note>Cf. XXXV. xxxiii. 9-10, and for his death, XXXVII. xlvi. 5.</note> By reason of this violent disposition his surrender was a greater pleasure to the victors.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time that the Romans were attacking Heraclea, Philip by agreement was besieging Lamia, having met the consul near Thermopylae when he returned from Boeotia, to congratulate him and the Roman people upon his victory and to apologize because as a result
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of illness he had not been present at the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then they separated to attack the two cities at the same time. They are about seven miles apart, and because Lamia both lies on a hill and commands a view especially over the region of Oeta, the distance seems exceedingly<note>Both <hi rend="italics">oppido</hi> and <hi rend="italics">quam</hi> are colloquial intensives, and the combination of the two seems not to occur before Livy.</note> short and everything is in sight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While the Romans and the Macedonians, as if competing for a prize, were strenuously engaged day and night either on the siege-works or in fighting, the task of the Macedonians was the more difficult because the Romans were fighting with a terrace and mantlets and all their works above ground, the Macedonians <pb id="p.235"/>with tunnels underground, and in the rough spots<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> flint, almost unworkable with iron, met them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And since they were making little progress, the king, through conferences with their chiefs, tried to induce the townspeople to surrender the city, not doubting that
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> if Heraclea were captured first they would submit to the Romans in preference to him and that the consul would take the credit to himself in raising the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor was he deceived in this opinion; for immediately after the taking of Heraclea the message came that he should abandon the siege: it was fairer that the Roman soldiers, who had fought in the battle-line with the Aetolians, should enjoy the rewards of victory.<note>Philip showed no signs of resentment at this treatment until <date value="-185">185 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. xxiii. 9), when it was one of his grievances.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So he retired from Lamia and, after the misfortune of a neighbouring city, the people escaped suffering a similar fate.<note>The natural inference from the consul's message would be that the Roman army would at once take up the siege, but this was not done and Lamia was not taken until the next year (XXXVII. v. 3).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days before Heraclea was taken the Aetolians held a council at Hypata and sent ambassadors to Antiochus, among whom was again the same Thoas who had been sent there before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their instructions were that they should ask the king, first, that he should again collect all his forces on land and sea and cross to Greece;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> secondly, if anything detained him, that he should send money and reinforcements; that his allies be not deserted concerned not only his dignity and loyalty but the safety of his kingdom; that he should not permit the Romans, free from all worry after they had destroyed the Aetolian people, to cross with all their forces to Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What they said was true; and <pb id="p.237"/>for that reason it impressed the king more.<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore for the moment he gave the ambassadors the money which was needed for the expenses of the war; he assured them that he would send military and naval assistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thoas, one of the ambassadors, he kept with him; he remained there not at all against his will, that someone might be at hand to demand the fulfilment of the promises.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the capture of Heraclea finally broke the spirit
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of the Aetolians, and a few days after they had sent ambassadors to Asia to renew the war and summon the king, they laid aside their warlike designs and sent delegates to the consul to beg for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul broke in when they had begun to speak, saying that he had more important matters to attend to, and ordered them to return to Hypata, granting them a truce of ten days and sending Lucius Valerius Flaccus with them, telling them to state to him the matters they had planned to discuss with himself and anything else they desired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they reached Hypata the chiefs of the Aetolians held a meeting with Flaccus, considering in what manner they should plead with the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were preparing to begin with their ancient treaty relations and their services to the Roman people, when Flaccus bade them cease to mention what they had themselves violated and broken;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> a confession of wrongdoing would avail them more and a speech devoted entirely to prayers; for not on their own cause but on the clemency of the Roman people did their hopes of safety depend;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he too would support them if they should plead like suppliants both before the consul and with the senate at Rome; for there too ambassadors should be sent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This <pb id="p.239"/>seemed to all of them the only way to safety, that<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> they should entrust themselves to the good faith of the Romans; for that by so doing they would at once render the Romans ashamed to do violence to suppliants and themselves no less be absolutely free should fortune offer them anything better.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they came before the consul, Phaeneas, the leader of the embassy, spoke at length and with manifold devices with which to soften the heart of the conqueror and concluded by saying that the Aetolians entrusted themselves and all their possessions to the good faith of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the consul heard this he replied, <quote>Consider again and again, Aetolians, whether you are submitting on these conditions.</quote> Then Phaeneas displayed the decree in which this was explicitly stated in writing.<note>There was then a mental reservation in the submission of the Aetolians which was consistent enough with Greek institutions: it bound the Romans to show them the consideration due to suppliants, but left the Aetolians free to break off the relations when an opportunity presented itself. One wonders how much of this Flaccus understood and accepted as part of the proposal. On the other hand, as Polybius (XX. ix) shows, the Aetolians did not understand that to the Romans <hi rend="italics">in fidem se permittere</hi> meant complete and unconditional surrender. In consequence the two parties are at cross purposes in the following debate until the national definitions are made clear.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>Since, then,</quote> the consul said, <quote>you are submitting on these terms, I demand that Dicaearchus your fellow-citizen and Menestas of Epirus</quote> &mdash;he had entered Naupactus with a garrison and compelled it to revolt &mdash;<quote>and Amynander with the chiefs of the Athamanes, by whose advice you revolted from us,<note>From XXXV. xlvii. 5-8 it appears that Acilius is misinformed about the conduct of the Athamanes. In any case Amynander himself was beyond the reach of the Aetolians (xiv. 9 above).</note> be delivered to me without delay.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He interrupted while the Roman was still speaking: <quote>We have not delivered ourselves into slavery but have entrusted ourselves to your good faith,<note>This is the Aetolian interpretation of the phrase, which put the Romans on their honour to treat them as suppliants, but bound the Aetolians by no obligation.</note> and I <pb id="p.241"/>feel sure that you err from ignorance in giving us<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> orders which are inconsistent with the customs of the Greeks.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To this the consul replied: <quote>Nor, by Hercules, do I care very much what the Aetolians regard as properly consistent with the customs of the Greeks, since I, in the Roman way, am delivering an order to men who a moment ago surrendered<note>This is the Roman interpretation of the same phrase.</note> by their own decree and had previously been conquered by armed force; therefore, unless my order is immediately executed I shall at once order you to be put in chains.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He directed the chains to be brought and the lictors to stand by. Then the haughty spirit of Phaeneas was broken and that of the other Aetolians, and they finally perceived in what condition they were, and Phaeneas said that he and those of the Aetolians
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> who were present knew that they would have to do what was commanded, but that to confirm the decree a council of the Aetolians was necessary; for that purpose he requested that a truce for ten days be granted them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When Flaccus supported the request on behalf of the Aetolians the truce was granted and they returned to Hypata. There, when in the select council which they call the <hi rend="italics">apocletes</hi> Phaeneas explained both what they were ordered to do and what they had almost experienced, the chiefs indeed groaned at their situation, yet recognized that
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> they must obey their conqueror and that the Aetolians from all the towns must be summoned to a council.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But after the assembled multitude had heard the same narrative, anger at the order and a sense of unjust treatment so inflamed their minds that, if they had been at peace, they would by that onset of passion have been provoked to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.243"/>Added to their wrath was also the difficulty of the<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> orders (for how, in any case, could they possibly hand over King Amynander?)
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and the hope which by chance offered itself because just at that time Nicander, coming from King Antiochus, filled the multitude with the idle expectation that a great war was preparing on land and sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the twelfth day after he had embarked he returned to Aetolia after completing his mission and put in at Phalara on the Malian gulf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he had brought the money from there to Lamia and he with his companions travelling light was passing at nightfall across the fields between the Macedonian and Roman camps, seeking Hypata over familiar paths, he encountered a picket of Macedonians and was conducted to the king, whose dinner-party had not yet broken up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When this was announced Philip, behaving as if a guest, not an enemy, had arrived, bade him recline and dine and then, dismissing the others and keeping him
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> alone, forbade his guest to have any fear of himself, and blamed the Aetolians for the evil counsels which had brought first the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Romans and then Antiochus to Greece, counsels ever fated to recoil upon their own heads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But forgetting the past, which could be criticized more easily than corrected, he would not act in such a way as to trample upon them in their misfortunes; the Aetolians too should at length end their quarrel with him, and Nicander personally should remember the day on which his life had been spared by him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So he provided him with an escort to conduct him to a place of safety, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> Nicander proceeded to Hypata and found them deliberating about the Roman peace.</p> <pb id="p.245"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Manius Acilius, having sold or given to<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> the soldiers the booty around Heraclea, when he heard that no pacific counsels were being taken at Hypata but that the Aetolians had assembled at Naupactus, that from there they might endure the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> whole violence of the war, sent Appius Claudius in advance with four thousand men to hold the ridges where the crossing of the mountains was difficult
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> and himself climbed Oeta and offered sacrifice to Hercules at the place which they call Pyra,<note>Literally, <quote>funeral pile.</quote></note> since there the mortal body of the god had been burned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then setting out with the entire army he finished the rest of the journey with fairly easy marching; when he came to Corax &mdash;this is a very high mountain between Callipolis and Naupactus &mdash;there both many animals from the train plunged to the bottom of the gorge, loads and all, and the men were in difficulties;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and it was easily seen with how careless an enemy they had to deal, who had not held so difficult a pass with any kind of guard to prevent their crossing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then too, though his army had suffered, he marched down to Naupactus, and establishing one fort over against the citadel he, dividing his forces as the situation of the walls required, surrounded the other sections of the city. Nor did this siege involve any less toil and labour than that of Heraclea.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time too Messene in the Peloponnesus began to be besieged by the Achaeans because it refused to join their league.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Two cities, Messene and Elis, were outside the Achaean council; their sympathies were with the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Eleans, however, after Antiochus was driven from Greece,<note>For their embassy to Antiochus and their anticipations of trouble with the Achaeans, see v. 1-2 above.</note> responded more moderately to the <pb id="p.247"/>ambassadors of the Achaeans:<note>The Achaeans were trying to induce these two cities voluntarily to join them or, if necessary, to coerce them.</note> if the royal garrison<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> were withdrawn they would consider what they should do;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the Messenians,<note>Livy does not mention it, but a short time before Philopoemen had released Messene from the domination of Nabis (Pausanias IV. xxix. 4); it had probably favoured Antiochus. Cities within Achaean territory but not members of the League were of course constant menaces to the League.</note> on the other hand, had dismissed the ambassadors unanswered and had begun war, but fearful for their cause
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> when their crops were being burned everywhere by a wide-ranging army and they saw the camp established near the city, they sent ambassadors to Chalcis to Titus Quinctius, the source of their liberty, to say that the Messenians were ready to open their gates and surrender their city to the Romans, not the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having listened to the ambassadors Quinctius, setting out at once from Megalopolis, sent a messenger to Diophanes, praetor of the Achaeans,<note>Diophanes had succeeded Philopoemen as Achaean <hi rend="italics">strategus</hi> in the fall of <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date></note> to order him to withdraw his army at once from Messene and to report to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Diophanes obeyed the summons, and raising the siege and himself travelling light, preceded the column and near Andania, a little town located between Megalopolis and Messene, met Quinctius; and when he had explained the reason for the siege, Quinctius reproached him gently because he had undertaken so important a matter
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> without his authorization,<note>Quinctius had no authority from any source, Roman or Greek, to issue orders to the Greeks. He based his actions on his prestige and his peculiar position as the liberator of Greece, and they were rarely challenged by the Greek states.</note> and ordered him to disband his army and not to disturb the peace secured to the advantage of everyone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He instructed the Messenians to recall their exiles and join the council of the Achaeans; if they had any matters about which they wished to raise objections or to take precautions for themselves against future contingencies, they should come to him at Corinth; Diophanes he directed to give him an immediate opportunity to meet the Achaean <pb id="p.249"/>council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There he complained about the island of<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Zacynthos,<note>Now that Rome was permanently involved in the east, Zacynthos had a certain strategic value, since it was important to have all possible naval bases closed to foreign powers. Rome had occupied it in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date> (XXVI. xxiv. 15), but in some manner it had passed into Philip's possession. Livy relates its subsequent history in the following sections. For some reason Quinctius makes no mention of Rome's earlier interest.</note> which had been wrongfully occupied, and demanded that it be restored to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Zacynthos had formerly belonged to Philip, king of the Macedonians; he had ceded it to Amynander as a bribe to induce him to permit Philip to lead his army through Athamania into the upper part of Aetolia, on the expedition<note>In <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> (XXVIII. vii. 14) or <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xii. 1).</note> by which he had broken the spirits of the Aetolians and forced them to seek peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Amynander had appointed Philip of Megalopolis governor of the island; later, during the war in which he joined Antiochus against the Romans, he had recalled Philip for military duties and sent Hierocles of Agrigentum to succeed him.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He, after the flight of Antiochus from Thermopylae and the expulsion of Amynander from Athamania by Philip, had at his own instance sent ambassadors to Diophanes, praetor of the Achaeans, had made a bargain for money, and transferred the island to the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That it should be their prize of war seemed fair to the Romans: for, they said, Manius Acilius the consul and the Roman legions had not fought for Diophanes and the Achaeans at Thermopylae.<note>Quinctius may have spoken more frankly than he realized or intended on this occasion, but the Greeks themselves were rapidly making the Roman position as disinterested liberators untenable.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Diophanes in reply sometimes defended himself and the state, sometimes argued the legal aspects of the case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some of the Achaeans both bore witness that from the beginning they had objected to the proceeding and at this time taunted the praetor for his persistence; <pb id="p.251"/>and on their motion it was voted that the question<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> be referred to Titus Quinctius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although Quinctius was harsh in the face of opposition, yet, if you gave in to him, he was also easy to please. Banishing all signs of passion from voice and expression, he said, <quote>If I believed that the possession of the island was useful to you, Achaeans, I should urge upon the senate and the Roman people that they permit you to keep it;
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but like a tortoise,<note>Practically the same story, though with a different context, is told by Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Flamininus</hi> xvii).</note> which I see to be secure against all attacks when it has all its parts drawn up inside its shell, but when it sticks any part out it has that member which is exposed weak and open to injury, in no different fashion you, Achaeans, shut in
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> on all sides by the sea, can both easily unite to yourselves anything within the boundaries of the Peloponnesus, and, when thus united, easily defend it, but as soon
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> as in your desire for larger acquisitions you overstep those limits, I see that all the parts which lie outside are unprotected and vulnerable to every blow.</quote><note>Flamininus was fond of homely and graphic similes: cf. XXXV. xlix. 6-7, which is also related by Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The whole council assenting and Diophanes not daring to struggle longer, Zacynthos was ceded to the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time King Philip, as the consul was leaving for Naupactus, asked him whether he wished meanwhile to recover the cities that had abandoned the Roman alliance, and with
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> his consent moved his troops towards Demetrias, well knowing what confusion reigned there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For, abandoned by all hope, when they saw themselves deserted by Antiochus, with no prospect of help from the Aetolians, by day and night they looked for the arrival either of Philip, an enemy, or of the Romans, even more hostile in proportion to their <pb id="p.253"/>juster cause for anger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was in the city an<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> undisciplined mob of the king's soldiers, a few of whom had at first been left on guard, but afterwards more came, most of them unarmed, brought there in their flight after the defeat, nor did they have enough of either strength or courage to resist a siege;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and so when agents were sent ahead by Philip, who showed them that the hope of pardon was attainable, they replied that the gates were open to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At his first entrance some of the leading men left the city; Eurylochus<note>Cf. XXXV. xxxi. 6 ff.</note> committed suicide. The soldiers of Antiochus &mdash;for such was the agreement &mdash;were conducted by a Macedonian escort, that no one might injure them, through Macedonia and Thrace to Lysimachia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were also a few ships at Demetrias under the command of Isidorus;<note>Cf. xx. 5 above.</note> they too with the prefect were sent home. After that he recovered Dolopia and Aperantia and certain cities of Perrhaebia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Philip was thus engaged, Titus Quinctius, after recovering Zacynthos from the Achaean council, crossed to Naupactus, which for two months now &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> it was near destruction by this time &mdash;had been undergoing the siege, and if it were captured by force the whole name<note><hi rend="italics">Nomen</hi> is not infrequently used in the sense of <quote>people</quote>: cf., e.g., III. viii. 10 and the similar usage in the phrase <hi rend="italics">nomen</hi> <hi rend="italics">Latinum.</hi></note> of the Aetolians there seemed destined to come to annihilation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But though he was justly angry at the Aetolians because he remembered that they alone had cavilled at his glory when he was liberating Greece, and that they
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> had not been moved by his influence when he warned them in advance that that would happen which did actually occur, and tried to deter them from their <pb id="p.255"/>mad
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> purpose, yet, believing it to be his task to see<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> that no people of the Greece which had received its freedom from him should be utterly destroyed, he began to walk around the walls, so that he was easily seen by the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Immediately he was recognized by the advanced sentinels and the word went through all the ranks that Quinctius was there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So there was a general rush from all quarters to the walls, each stretching out his hands to him and with uniform cries calling upon Quinctius by name to come to their rescue and save them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And for the moment, at least, although he was affected by these words, he showed by a gesture that there was no power in him to help them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but when he came to the consul<note>This incident raises the question of the relation between Quinctius and Acilius (see also the note to i. 8 above). The actions of Quinctius at this time are hardly normal activities of a military subordinate, although they might
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> be covered by the powers granted him by the senate (
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxiii. 5). One infers that Livy, and probably the Romans generally, did not understand the situation. Acilius had just witnessed a dramatic demonstration of the influence of Quinctius with the Greeks, and there is nothing strange about his compliance with his suggestion, even though Quinctius had no authority over the consul.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he said, <quote>Has it perhaps escaped you, Manius Acilius, what you are doing, or, since you see it clearly, do you not think that it has a great deal to do with our ultimate policy?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had worked the consul up to a high pitch of wonder, and he asked, <quote>Why not explain what you mean?</quote> Then Quinctius replied: <quote>Do you not see that you, after defeating Antiochus, are wasting time by besieging two cities, although now the year of your command is almost ended, but that Philip, who had not set eyes on the battle-line or the standards of the enemy, has already joined to himself, not cities alone, but so many nations &mdash;Athamania,
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Perrhaebia, Aperantia, Dolopia &mdash;and that as rewards for your victory you possess as yet not even two cities, while Philip has so many peoples of Greece? Yet it is not <pb id="p.257"/>so much to our interest that the power and strength<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> of the Aetolians should be diminished as that Philip should not grow beyond measure.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>XXXV. The consul agreed with this, but shame, if he should withdraw before finishing what he had begun, came over him. The whole decision was then referred to Quinctius. He went back again to the section of the walls where the Aetolians had harangued him a little while before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When with greater fervour they begged him to have compassion on the Aetolian people, he ordered some of them to come out to him. Phaeneas himself and other chiefs at once came out. As they threw themselves at his feet, he said, <quote>Your plight makes me restrain both my wrath and my language.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those things have happened which I told you in the beginning would happen, and not even this is left to you, that they may seem to have happened to the undeserving; yet I, appointed by some destiny for the cherishing of Greece, shall not cease to do good even to ungrateful men. Send ambassadors to the consul to ask for a truce for such a space of time that you may send delegates to Rome through whom you may put your case before the senate; I shall be with the consul to support and defend your cause.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So they did as Quinctius had suggested, nor did the consul reject the embassy; granting them a truce for a definite period, in which the embassy could report back from Rome, he raised the siege and sent the army back to Phocis.</p> 
				<p>The consul with Titus Quinctius crossed to Aegium to the Achaean council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There the debate concerned the Eleans and the restoration of the Spartan exiles; neither question was settled, because the Achaeans wished the case of the exiles left as a means <pb id="p.259"/>of gaining favour for themselves; while the Eleans<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> preferred that they be united with the Achaean League on their own initiative rather than under pressure from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ambassadors from the Epirotes came to the consul; it was clear that they had not observed the treaty of alliance with true fidelity; yet they had sent no troops to Antiochus; they were accused of having aided him with money; they did not even themselves deny that they had sent ambassadors to him.<note>Cf. v. 3-8 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When they asked that they be permitted to remain in their old status of friendship, the consul replied that he did not yet know whether to reckon them among enemies or among defeated foes; the senate would be the judge of that; he was referring the whole question of their status to Rome; for that purpose he granted them a truce for ninety days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Epirotes sent to Rome and appealed to the senate. When they enumerated hostile acts which they had not performed rather than cleared themselves of the charges made against them, a reply was given them from which they could seem to have obtained forgiveness, not to have established their case. Ambassadors from King Philip also were at this time presented to the senate with congratulations on the victory. Their request that they be allowed to sacrifice on the Capitoline and to deposit a gift of gold in the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was granted by the senate.<note>This was a mark of special honour, since foreigners had no share in Roman ritual.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A golden crown of one hundred pounds' weight was placed there. Not only was a gracious response given to the ambassadors of the king, but also Demetrius, the son of Philip, who was a hostage at Rome,<note>Cf. XXXIII. xxx. 10; XXXV. xxxi. 5 and the note.</note> was handed over to the ambassadors to be restored to his father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The war which was waged <pb id="p.261"/>with King Antiochus in Greece by Manius Acilius<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> the consul came thus to an end.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The other consul, Publius Cornelius Scipio, who had been allotted the province of Gaul, before he departed to the war which was to be waged
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> with the Boii, demanded of the senate that money be voted to him for the games which as praetor in Spain he had vowed at a critical moment in the battle.<note>Cf. XXXV. i. 8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His request seemed unprecedented and unreasonable; they voted, therefore, that whatever games he had vowed on his own sole initiative, with no authorization from
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the senate, he should celebrate either out of the spoils, if he had reserved any for that purpose, or out of his own pocket.<note>No
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> commander could foresee an emergency of this magnitude in time to secure the senate's authority, and the senate seems unreasonable.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was no good way of checking up on
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> commanders to see whether they had turned in all the booty (cf., however, 
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>lvii. 12-14), and it was probably customary for generals to hold out parts of it. Scipio seems to have been careless enough or honest enough not to reserve any booty for this purpose. This episode, together with the following, reveals, however, friction between the senate and the Scipios.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The games were celebrated through ten days by Publius Cornelius. About the same time a temple was dedicated to the Great Idaean Mother, a goddess whom this same Publius Cornelius, when she came from Asia in the consulship of Publius Cornelius Scipio, who later received the surname of Africanus, and Publius Licinius, had escorted to the Palatine from the harbour.<note>Cf. XXIX. xiv. 1. There are numerous references to the selection of Scipio Nasica as the <hi rend="italics">vir optimus</hi> to receive the goddess (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XXXV. x. 9). The choice of Brutus rather than Nasica as the dedicator of the temple may be an additional rebuke to him. See, however, the <hi rend="italics">Periocha.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The contract for the construction of the temple, under a decree of the senate, was let by the censors Marcus Livius and Gaius Claudius in the consulship of Marcus Cornelius and Publius Sempronius;<note>The chronology is incorrect. Africanus and Licinius were consuls in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXVIII. xxxviii. 12) and Cethegus and Tuditanus in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xi. 10), when the divinity was brought to Rome. Livius and Claudius were censors in this year (XXIX. xxxvii. 1). See also sect. 6 below.</note> thirteen years after the contract was let, <pb id="p.263"/>Marcus Junius Brutus dedicated the temple, and games<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> were given by reason of the dedication, which Valerius Antias says were the first to be held with dramatic performances, and called the <hi rend="italics">Megalesia.</hi><note>It is futile to try to determine just what Antias meant. Cf. XXXIV. liv. 3 for a similar statement.</note> Also a temple of Juventas in the Circus Maximus was dedicated by Gaius Licinius Lucullus the duumvir. It had been vowed sixteen years before by Marcus Livius the consul in the battle in which he destroyed Hasdrubal and his army; as censor he also let the contract for its construction in the consulship of Marcus Cornelius and Publius Sempronius.<note>The temple was vowed at the battle of the Metaurus in <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date>, but Livy has not mentioned before either the vow or the contract.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By reason of this dedication also games were held, and with more intense religious feeling because the new war with Antiochus was imminent.<note>These events then belong to the early spring of <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date></note></p> 
				<p>XXXVII. In the beginning of the year in which these things happened, Manius Acilius having already set out to the war and Publius Cornelius the consul being still in Rome, it is recorded that two domesticated cattle in the Carinae climbed up a stairway to the roof of a house. The <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> ordered that they be burned alive and the ashes thrown into the Tiber.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At Terracina and Amiternum it was reported that there were several showers of stones, at Minturnae the temple of Jupiter and the shops around the forum were struck by lightning, at Volturnum in the mouth of the river two ships were struck by lightning and burned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On account of these portents the decemvirs were directed by a decree of the senate to consult the Sibylline Books, and they reported that a fast in honour of Ceres should be held and this repeated every fifth year; also that a nine-day festival should be celebrated and a period of prayer for one day; that those who offered the <pb id="p.265"/>prayers should wear garlands;<note>This was in accordance with Greek ritual.</note> and that the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Publius Cornelius, in honour of whatever gods and with whatever victims the decemvirs should announce, should offer sacrifice. The gods were appeased now by the due performance of vows, now by the rites of atonement for the prodigies, and the consul departed to his province, ordering the proconsul Gnaeus Domitius to send his army back to Rome and leave the province;<note>This interpretation is somewhat unnatural but is necessary to secure consistency with i. 9 above.</note> he himself led the legions into the country of the Boii.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time the Ligures, mustering an army under a formula of devotion,<note>Violation of a <hi rend="italics">lex sacrata</hi> was punished by devotion of the offender to the gods of the lower world. In such a case as this it would bind the troops by a vow of victory or death.</note> by night suddenly attacked the camp of Quintus Minucius the proconsul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Minucius kept his troops in formation within the rampart right up to daybreak, being anxious to prevent any crossing of the fortifications by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At daybreak he made a sally through two gates at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the first attack did not, as he had hoped, drive away the Ligures; for two hours longer they made the issue uncertain; finally, when column after column came forth and fresh men were relieving the exhausted in the battle, the Ligures at length, worn out by loss of sleep along with everything else, turned to flight. More than four thousand of the enemy were killed; of the Romans and allies less than three hundred were lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> About two months later Publius Cornelius the consul fought in pitched battle with the army of the Boii with notable results.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Valerius Antias writes that thirty-eight thousand of the enemy were slain, three thousand four hundred captured, <pb id="p.267"/>with one hundred twenty-four military standards,<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> one thousand two hundred thirty horses, two hundred forty-seven carts; of the victors the losses were one thousand four hundred eighty-four.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although even in this case little confidence can be placed in this writer in a question of numbers, because no other is more unrestrained than he in exaggeration, yet it is clear that it was a great victory, first, because the camp was captured, second, because the Boii surrendered immediately after the battle,<note>Their submission was then not the usual formal surrender as an admission of defeat in one battle.</note> third, because a thanksgiving was proclaimed and full-grown victims slain.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Marcus Fulvius Nobilior from Farther Spain entered the City in ovation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He brought with him twelve thousand pounds of silver, one hundred and thirty thousand silver coins stamped with the two-horse chariot, one hundred and twenty-seven pounds of gold.<note>This ovation was also reported in xxi. 10-11 above.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Publius Cornelius the consul accepted hostages from the nation of the Boii and deprived them of about one-half their land, to which, if it chose, the Roman people could send colonies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, departing to Rome to the certain expectation of a triumph, he disbanded his army and ordered them to be in Rome on the day of the triumph;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> on the day after his arrival he himself convened the senate in the temple of Bellona, and when he had discoursed about his achievements he demanded that he be permitted to ride into the City in triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius Sempronius Blaesus, tribune of the people, declared that the honour of a triumph should not be refused to Scipio, but should be postponed: Ligurian wars were always connected with Gallic; these neighbouring tribes exchanged assistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If Publius <pb id="p.269"/>Scipio, after defeating the Boii in battle, had either<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> crossed himself with his victorious army into the country of the Ligures<note>A magistrate who left his province, even for such a purpose, would expose himself to severe criticism, if nothing more: cf. XXXVII. xlvii. 6. The argument of Blaesus is then somewhat captious.</note> or sent part of his troops to Quintus Minucius, who was for the third year now detained by a war of uncertain prospects, the war with the Ligures could have been finished;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> now the soldiers had been withdrawn to crowd the triumph, who could have rendered conspicuous service to the state, and who could do so even now if the senate wished, by deferring the triumph, to restore the condition which had been lost in the anxiety for a triumph. Let them order the consul with his legions to return to his province, to direct his attention to the subjugation of the Ligures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Unless they were brought under the sovereignty and supremacy of the Roman people, not even the Boii would remain quiet; they must have either peace or war with both.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After conquering the Ligures, a few months later, Publius Cornelius the proconsul would triumph, after the example of many who had not triumphed while still in office.<note>Scipio had taken a good deal for granted when he sent his army back to Rome and left his province before he was relieved. This, however, is not the ground of the tribune's objections.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this the consul replied that the Ligures had not been allotted to him as his province, that he had not waged war with the Ligures, that he was not asking for a triumph over them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he felt sure that in a short time Quintus Minucius, having conquered them, would ask and receive a well-earned triumph;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> he was asking for a triumph over the Gallic Boii, whom he had defeated in battle, whom he had stripped of their camp, whose entire population he had, two days after the battle, received in surrender, from whom he had taken hostages as a guarantee of future peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But this, as a matter of fact, was of far greater importance &mdash;that he had <pb id="p.271"/>slain a greater number of thousands of Gauls in battle<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> than any commander before him had ever fought with, at least so far as the Boii were concerned.<note>If the text is sound, it means that more Gauls had fallen in this battle than the Boi had ever been able to put in the field in previous engagements.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> More than half of their fifty thousand men were killed,<note>Cf. xxxviii. 6 above.</note> many thousands captured; old men and boys only were now left to the Boii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Could anyone then wonder why a victorious army, since it left no enemy in the province, should come to Rome to celebrate the triumph of the consul?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If the senate wished to use the assistance of these soldiers in another province also, in which way, pray, would it believe them to be more ready to meet another danger and new toil, if without any objection the reward had been paid them for their previous danger and toil, or if they sent them away with hope in place of reality, when they had once been deceived as to their original expectation?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So far as he personally was concerned, he had won sufficient glory for his whole life on that day when the senate had judged him the best man and sent him to receive the Idaean Mother.<note>Cf. xxxvi. 3 above and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From that one inscription, even if no consulship or triumph were added, the <hi rend="italics">imago</hi><note>A Roman house had a special room set aside for the <hi rend="italics">imagines</hi> or masks of distinguished ancestors.

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The entire senate of its own accord not only agreed to vote the triumph but by its influence compelled the tribune to withdraw his veto. Publius Cornelius while consul triumphed over the Boii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In that triumph he transported in Gallic carts arms and standards and spoils of every description and Gallic vases of bronze, and <pb id="p.273"/>along with prisoners of high rank a herd of captured<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> horses. He carried also golden necklaces to the number of one thousand four hundred and seventy-one, and besides he had two hundred and forty-seven pounds of gold, of
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> silver, unwrought and wrought in Gallic vases, not unskilfully, in their manner, two thousand three hundred and forty pounds, of coins stamped with the two-horse chariot, two hundred and thirty-four thousand.<note>This is said to be the first Gallic triumph in which no copper coins were displayed: cf. XXXIII. xxxvii. 11.</note> To the soldiers who followed his car he gave one hundred and twenty-five <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> to each infantryman, twice that sum to each centurion and thrice to each cavalryman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The next day he called an assembly, and when he had spoken of his achievements and of the injury done by
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> the tribune who tried to entangle him in another's war, in order to cheat him of the fruits of his victory, he absolved his soldiers of their oaths and discharged them.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on in Italy, Antiochus<note>The narrative continues from xxi. 1 above. Antiochus seems to have paid little attention to the Aetolian appeal in chap. xxvi; perhaps he had heard of their subsequent fortunes.</note> at Ephesus was quite free from concern as to the Roman war, on the ground that the Romans would not cross to Asia; and this sense of security was given to him by most of his friends either through error or in flattery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hannibal alone, whose influence with the king was at that time perhaps at its greatest, said that he was more surprised that the Romans were not already in Asia than doubtful that they would come;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it was a shorter crossing from Greece to Asia than from Italy to Greece, and Antiochus was a far more powerful motive than the Aetolians; nor were Roman arms less powerful on sea than land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For a long time their fleet had been around Malea; he had recently heard that a new fleet and a <pb id="p.275"/>new commander to carry on the war had come from<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Italy;<note>This must be Livius (xlii. 1 below), whose appointment to the fleet was noted at ii. 6 above.</note> Antiochus, then, should cease to seek peace for himself &mdash;a vain hope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In Asia and for Asia itself there would soon be war on land and sea between him and the Romans, and either the Romans, seeking dominion over the world, would lose it or he himself would lose his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He alone seemed both to foresee the truth and to declare it loyally. So the king himself, with the ships that were ready and equipped, set out for the Chersonesus to strengthen those regions with garrisons if perchance the Romans should come by land;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the rest of the fleet he ordered Polyxenidas to refit and launch; scouting cruisers he sent among the islands to reconnoitre everywhere.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gaius Livius, commander of the Roman fleet, sailed with fifty decked vessels from Rome to Naples, where he had ordered the allies along the coast to assemble the undecked ships which they owed under
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the treaty, then headed for Sicily and, passing Messina through the strait, picked up six Carthaginian ships sent to aid him, received from the people of Rhegium and Locri and the other allies of the same status the ships which he had demanded of them, and having purified<note>By a sacrifice to propitiate hostile powers.</note> the fleet at Lacinium struck out into the deep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had arrived at Corcyra, the first city in Greece which he reached, he inquired as to the military situation &mdash;for everything was not yet quiet in Greece &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> as to where the Roman fleet was, and when he heard that the consul and the king were watching one another near the pass of Thermopylae and that the fleet was at Piraeus, he thought that he should make haste for every reason, and straightway proceeded to sail around the Peloponnesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Same<note>The island also called Cephallania; also a city of the same name on that island.</note> <pb id="p.277"/>and Zacynthos,<note>This happened before the negotiations reported in chap. xxxi above.</note> because they preferred to join the<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> Aetolian party, he at once plundered and then made for Malea, and enjoying a successful voyage after a few days he joined the old fleet at Piraeus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At Scyllaeum King Eumenes with three ships met him, after having long waited at Aegina, uncertain what to do, whether to go home to defend his own kingdom &mdash;for he kept hearing that Antiochus was at Ephesus equipping his fleets and armies &mdash;or never to separate from the Romans, on whom his own fortunes depended.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Piraeus Aulus Atilius turned over to his successor twenty-five decked ships and returned to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Livius with eighty-one decked ships and many smaller craft in addition, which were either open ships with beaks or scouting-vessels without beaks, crossed to Delos.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about this time the consul Acilius was besieging Naupactus. Livius was detained at Delos for several days by adverse winds, and indeed the region around the Cyclades, which are separated from one another, some by wider straits, some by narrower, is exceedingly windy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Polyxenidas, being informed by the vessels which had been sent to reconnoitre that the Roman fleet was delayed at Delos, sent messengers to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He, dropping everything he was doing at the Hellespont, returned with his beaked ships with all possible speed to Ephesus and at once held a council as to whether they should make trial of a naval battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Polyxenidas maintained that they should not delay, but should fight before the fleet of Eumenes and the Rhodian ships should join the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> thus they would be <pb id="p.279"/>practically equal in numbers, superior in everything<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> else, both in the speed of the ships and in the varied character of their auxiliaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the Roman ships were not only unskilfully constructed and hard to move, but were also laden down with supplies, since they were coming to a hostile country; but their own ships, since they were leaving everything around them peaceful, would carry nothing except soldiers and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their acquaintance with the sea, the lands and the winds would also help greatly, and all these would make trouble for an enemy unfamiliar with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The author of this advice, who would also put the plan into effect, had weight with all. Delaying two days in preparation, they set sail on the third day with a hundred ships, all of smaller size, seventy being decked, the rest open, and came to Phocaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he had heard that a Roman fleet was approaching, the king, since he did not intend to be present at the naval battle, returned from there to Magnesia, which is near Sipylus, to assemble his land forces;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the fleet made haste to Cissus, the harbour of the Erythraei, as if it were more convenient to meet the enemy there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As soon as the north winds subsided &mdash;they had been blowing for several days &mdash;the Romans stood out from Delos toward Phanae, a harbour of the Chians facing the Aegean sea; there they brought the fleet around to the city and after taking on provisions crossed to Phocaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Eumenes went to his fleet at Elaea and a few days later returned to Phocaea with twenty-four decked ships and a somewhat larger number of open vessels, finding the Romans making themselves ready and fit for a naval battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Thence they set out with one <pb id="p.281"/>hundred and five decked ships and about fifty open<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> vessels, and when at first they were driven towards the shore by north winds blowing across their course, the ships were compelled to proceed in a thin column, almost in single file; then when the violence of the wind moderated a little they tried to cross to the harbour of Corycus, which is above Cissus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Polyxenidas, when the news was brought that the enemy was coming, rejoicing at the opportunity of fighting, himself drew the left wing out into the open sea, ordered the ship-captains to extend the right flank towards the land, and advanced to the fight in a regular line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the Roman saw this he took in sail, lowered his masts and at the same time stowing his tackle he awaited the oncoming ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were now about thirty of his ships in front, and in order to bring his left wing into line with them, hoisting his top-sails he tried to get out into deep water, ordering the following ships, opposing the enemy's right wing, to steer towards the shore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Eumenes was in the rear, but as soon as he saw the confusion caused by clearing for action he too urged his ships forward at their utmost speed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Now they were in sight of all. Two Carthaginian ships were ahead of the Roman fleet, and three ships of the king encountered them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and, their numbers being unequal, two of the king's ships attacked one, and first they sheared off the oars on both sides, then armed men boarded it, and throwing overboard and killing the defenders, took the ship;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the one which was fighting in equal combat, when it saw that the other ship was taken, fled to the fleet before it should be surrounded by three. Livius, inflamed with passion, made for <pb id="p.283"/>the enemy with the flagship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the two which<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> had just surrounded the Carthaginian ship came up, hoping to repeat their tactics, he ordered the rowers on both sides to trail their oars in the water to steady the ship and the men to throw iron grappling-hooks upon the approaching hostile ships, and when they had made the engagement like one on land, he bade them remember Roman valour and not to consider the king's slaves as men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With greater ease than the two had captured one before, the one ship at this time defeated and captured two. And now the fleets had clashed everywhere and with the ships intermingled the battle was raging on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Eumenes, who had arrived late, when the battle had already begun, seeing that the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> left wing of the enemy had been thrown into confusion by Livius, himself attacked their right, where the battle was evenly matched.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And not long after the flight began on the left flank. For when Polyxenidas saw that without question he was inferior in the courage of his soldiers, raising his top-sails he began a hurried flight; presently even those who had joined battle with Eumenes near the shore did the same.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans and Eumenes, so long as the rowers could hold out and there was any hope of harassing the rear, pursued with stubbornness enough.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when, after vain efforts, they saw that the enemy's ships, which were sailing light, were by their swiftness escaping their own, which were laden with supplies, they at length ceased, having captured thirteen ships along with their marines and rowers, and sunk ten.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Of the Roman fleet, the one Carthaginian ship which, at the beginning of the battle, had been surrounded by two, was lost. <pb id="p.285"/>Polyxenidas did not stop his flight until he reached<note type="margin">B.C. 191</note> the harbour of Ephesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans on that day remained at the place from which the king's fleet had come; the next day they set out to pursue the enemy. About half-way on the journey twenty-five decked Rhodian ships under Pausistratus, commander of the fleet, met them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thus reinforced, they followed the enemy to Ephesus and stood drawn up in line of battle before the entrance to the harbour. Now that they had wrung a confession of inferiority from the defeated, the Rhodians and Eumenes were sent home;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the Romans on their way to Chios first sailed past Phoenicus, the port of the Erythraean land, and at nightfall dropped anchor; the next day they crossed to the island and to the city itself. There they delayed a few days resting their rowers, and then crossed to Phocaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Leaving four quinqueremes there as a garrison for the city, the fleet came to Canae; and since winter was now at hand, the ships were beached and surrounded with a wall and ditch.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>At the end of the year the elections were held in Rome, at which Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Gaius Laelius &mdash;all looking towards Africanus<note>Lucius Scipio was the brother and Laelius the closest friend of Scipio Africanus.</note> &mdash;were chosen consuls to end the war with Antiochus. The next day the praetors were elected, Marcus Tuccius, Lucius Aurunculeius, Gnaeus Fulvius, Lucius Aemilius, Publius Junius, Gaius Atinius Labeo.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Gaius Laelius<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> entered upon the consulship, and after the religious observances were carried out, no question in the senate had priority over that concerning the Aetolians. And their ambassadors were urging a decision, since only a brief time of truce was allowed them, and they were seconded by Titus Quinctius, who had now returned to Rome from Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Aetolians, like men who reposed more hope in the mercy of the senate than in their own case, pleaded like suppliants, balancing former services against recent misdeeds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But not only while still present were they pursued by senatorial questionings from all sides, forcing from them confessions of guilt rather than replies, but when they were ordered to leave the senate-house they gave occasion to a violent conflict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Anger had greater weight in their case than the spirit of mercy, since the senators were incensed at them not as enemies but as an untamable and anti-social people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the contest had continued for many days, it was finally decided that peace should be neither granted nor refused; two choices were placed before them; either they should entrust themselves to the free discretion of the senate, or they should pay one thousand talents and consider the same peoples as friends and enemies.<note>The latter would technically make them <hi rend="italics">socii,</hi> though in a relation of dependency; this was one of the conditions imposed in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVIII. viii. 10).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When they tried to elicit a definite statement as to <pb id="p.293"/>the extent to which the senate would exercise its<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> discretion<note>In XXXVI. xxii. 8 ff. the Aetolians discovered that Roman and Greek interpretations of diplomatic phraseology differed, and wanted to know what <hi rend="italics">liberum arbitrium</hi> could mean. The acceptance of the first proposal in its extreme form might amount to a complete surrender.</note> over them, no positive reply was given. So without any settlement they were ordered to leave the City that same day and Italy within fifteen days.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Then the question of the consular provinces began to be discussed. Both consuls wanted Greece.<note>This put Africanus in a difficult position, with his brother and his friend rivals for the same appointment.</note> Laelius was very influential in the senate. Laelius, when the senate had directed the consuls either to cast lots or to determine the matter of the provinces between themselves, said that they would act more fittingly if they entrusted this decision to the wisdom of the Fathers instead of to the lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio, having replied to this that he would consider what he ought to do, conferred with his brother alone, and being instructed by him to leave the matter to the senate with confidence, answered his colleague that he would do as he suggested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When this proposal, either novel or revived on the basis of ancient precedents long escaped from memory, had excited the senate with the expectation of a sharp contest, Publius Scipio Africanus said that if they should decree Greece as a province to his brother Lucius Scipio, he would go as his lieutenant.<note>Africanus probably thought that he could serve with better grace as <hi rend="italics">legatus</hi> under his brother than under the friend who had been his own <hi rend="italics">legatus</hi> in Africa. Other versions are found in Cicero (<hi rend="italics">Philippic</hi> XI. 17; <hi rend="italics">Murena</hi> 32) and elsewhere.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> These words, listened to with full approbation, ended the contest; they wanted to ascertain whether King Antiochus would find more powerful assistance in the defeated Hannibal or the Roman consul and legions in his conqueror Africanus: and almost unanimously they decreed Greece to Scipio, Italy to Laelius.</p> <pb id="p.295"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetors then drew for their provinces;<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> Lucius Aurunculeius receiving the civil jurisdiction, Gnaeus Fulvius that between citizens and aliens, Lucius Aemilius Regillus the fleet, Publius Junius Brutus the Etruscans, Marcus Tuccius Apulia and the Brutti, Gaius Atinius Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then for the consul to whom the province of Greece had been decreed, in addition to the army which he would take over from Manius Acilius &mdash;this now consisted of two legions<note>This statement is inconsistent with that in XXXVI. xiv. 1.</note> &mdash;there
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> were authorized as reinforcements three thousand infantry of Roman citizens and one hundred cavalry, and of the allies of the Latin confederacy five thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry; it was also appended to this that when he arrived in the province, if the public interest seemed to demand it, he should lead the army over into Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To the other consul an entirely new army was assigned, two Roman legions and of the allies of the Latin confederacy fifteen thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Quintus Minucius was directed to transfer his army from the Ligures &mdash; for he had now written that the province had been completely reduced and that all the people of the Ligures had surrendered &mdash;to the territory of the Boii and hand it over to Publius Scipio the proconsul, who was removing the Boii from the land of which he had deprived them after their defeat in the war.<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxxix. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The two reserve legions<note>This statement is inconsistent with that in XXXVI. i. 9; like that in sect. 2 above, it is probably derived from a different annalistic source.</note> which had been enlisted the year before were assigned to Marcus Tuccius, along with fifteen thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry of the allies of the Latin confederacy, to <pb id="p.297"/>hold Apulia and the Brutti.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Aulus Cornelius,<note>1 Cf. XXXVI. ii. 2.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> praetor of the preceding year, who had held the Brutti with an army, was ordered to transport the legions to Aetolia, if such was the pleasure of the consul, and turn them over to Manius Acilius, if he wished to remain there; if Acilius preferred to return to Rome, Aulus Cornelius with this army should remain in
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Aetolia. Gaius Atinius Labeo, it was decided, should receive the province of Sicily and the army from Marcus Aemilius<note>Livy says nothing about Valerius (XXXVI. ii. 11), who had shared the responsibility for Sicily.</note> the praetor and as reinforcements should enrol from the province itself two thousand infantry and one hundred
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> cavalry. Publius Junius Brutus was instructed to enlist a new army to serve against the Etruscans, one Roman legion and ten thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry of the allies of the Latin
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> confederacy; Lucius Aemilius, to whom the maritime province had been allotted, was ordered to receive twenty warships and the naval allies from Marcus Junius, praetor of the previous year, to enrol himself a thousand naval allies and two thousand marines, to proceed with these ships and troops to Asia and to take over the fleet from Gaius
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Livius. For the governors of the two Spains and Sardinia the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> was prolonged for a year and the same armies
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> assigned. Two tithes of grain, just as in the preceding year,<note>Cf. XXXVI. ii. 12-13.</note> were levied upon Sicily and Sardinia; they ordered all the Sicilian grain to be transported to Aetolia, part of the Sardinian to Rome and part to Aetolia, the same destination as the Sicilian.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the consuls set out to their provinces it was decreed that expiation should be made for the prodigies by direction of the pontiffs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At Rome <pb id="p.299"/>the temple of Juno Lucina was struck by lightning<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> so that the roof and the doors were damaged; at Puteoli the wall and gates in several places were struck by lightning and two men were killed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> at Nursia it was well established that a storm-cloud came in sight on a clear day; there also two free men were killed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the people of Tusculum reported that in their neighbourhood there was a shower of earth, and the Reatini that in their country a mule had foaled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When expiation for all this had been made, the Latin festival,<note>Cf. XXXII. i. 9 and the note for a similar occurrence.</note> too, because the share of the meat which is<note>The present is used probably because the right still existed in Livy's time.</note> due to be given to the Laurentes was not given them, was repeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was also a period of prayer by reason of these phenomena to whatever gods the decemvirs, in accordance with the Books, had ordered supplication to be made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ten noble youths and ten maidens, all children of living fathers and mothers, were employed for this sacrifice, and the decemvirs by night sacrificed animals not yet weaned. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, before he left the City, constructed an arch on the Capitoline, facing the street by which one climbs the Capitoline, with seven statues of bronze and two equestrian figures and two marble basins before the arch.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>About the same time forty-three chiefs of the Aetolians, among whom were Damocritus and his brother, were brought to Rome under guard of two cohorts sent by Manius Acilius and were thrown into the <hi rend="italics">Lautumiae.</hi><note>Cf. XXXII. xxvi. 17.</note> The cohorts were then directed by Lucius Cornelius the consul to rejoin the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Ambassadors from Ptolemy and Cleopatra,<note>The sister of the king, here Cleopatra, by Egyptian custom and law, shared in the administration: hence <hi rend="italics">reges.</hi></note> rulers of Egypt, came with congratulations because Manius Acilius the consul had driven King Antiochus out of Greece, and with recommendations that they <pb id="p.301"/>should transport the army into Asia:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> everything was<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> in a confusion of terror, they said, not only in Asia but even in Syria; the rulers of Egypt were prepared for whatever the senate might order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thanks were extended to the rulers; each of the ambassadors received, in accordance with orders issued, a present of four thousand <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Cornelius the consul, having finished what had to be done in Rome, issued his edict before the assembly that the soldiers whom he personally had enlisted as reinforcements and those who were among the Brutti with Aulus Cornelius the propraetor should all assemble on the Ides of July<note>Livy uses the old name of the month, <hi rend="italics">Quinctilis,</hi> which was in his time called <hi rend="italics">Iulius</hi> in honour of Caesar.</note> at Brundisium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He named also three lieutenants, Sextus Digitius, Lucius Apustius and Gaius Fabricius Luscinus, who were to collect ships at Brundisium from all along the sea-coast; and having now made everything ready set out from the City in uniform. About five thousand volunteers, Romans and allies, who had earned their discharges under the command of Publius Africanus, attended the consul as he was setting out and gave in their names for service with him.<note>Their status was that of <hi rend="italics">evocati,</hi> reservists called to active duty, which gave them certain special privileges.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About the time the consul departed to the war, during the <hi rend="italics">ludi Apollinares,</hi><note>These games, celebrated in honour of Apollo, were held annually in July.</note> on the fifth day before the Ides of July, in a clear sky during the day, the light was dimmed since the moon passed before the circle of the 
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>sun.<note>
						<p>This eclipse, according to modern calculations, occurred March 14, <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date> The Roman calendar was then out of adjustment to the extent indicated by these dates (March 14 &mdash;July 11). The usual remedy was to insert an extra (intercalary) month between February and March, of such length as to bring the solstitial
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and equinoctial periods to the proper calendar dates. The effects of such dislocations upon Livy's treatment of chronology have been frequently pointed out in the notes: cf. xxxvii. 6 below.</p> 
						<p>This particular date is rejected by Beloch (Klio XV, 1918, 391 ff.; XXII, 1929, 464 ff.) on various grounds, among them the fact that it places the battle of Magnesia at a time inconsistent with the narrative of Polybius.</p></note> Lucius Aemilius
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.303"/>Regillus, to whom the naval appointment had fallen,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> also departed at the same time. Lucius Aurunculeius was entrusted by the senate with the task of building thirty quinqueremes and twenty triremes, since the rumour was that Antiochus after the naval battle was fitting out a very much larger fleet.<note>Cf. XXXVI. xliii &mdash;xlv.</note></p> 
				<p>The Aetolians, after their ambassadors
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> had brought back the word from Rome that there was no hope for peace, although their whole coast which faces the Peloponnesus had been ravaged by the Achaeans, thinking more of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> danger than of their losses, in order to bar the road against the Romans, seized Mount Corax;<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxx. 4.</note> for they had no doubt that they would return at the beginning of spring to besiege Naupactus.<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxx; xxxv.</note> Acilius, because he knew that this was their expectation, thought it better to try
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> something unforeseen and to attack Lamia;<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxv. 8.</note> for the people had both been brought nigh to destruction by Philip and, just because at that time they feared nothing of the kind, he thought that they could be more easily taken by
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> surprise. Setting out from Elatia he first encamped in hostile territory near the Spercheus river; thence he moved his standards by night and at daybreak attacked the walls from a girdle of entrenchments.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was great panic and excitement, as is natural when something unexpected occurs. Nevertheless, with greater resolution than one would think they would display in such a sudden peril, while the men fought before the walls and the women were carrying weapons of all kinds and stones to the walls, though scaling ladders were now being brought up on all sides, they defended the city on that day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Acilius sounded the recall and led his troops back into <pb id="p.305"/>camp about noon; and then, when they had restored<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> their bodies with food and rest, before he dismissed the council<note>I.e., his council of war.</note> he issued orders that they should be armed and ready before daybreak; unless they took the city he would not lead them back into camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the same time as the day before he attacked from several directions, and since the townspeople were by now lacking in strength, in weapons, and before all in courage, within a few hours he took the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There, selling part of the plunder and dividing part among the troops, he held a council to determine what they should do next. No one urged that they move on Naupactus, the pass over Corax being held by the Aetolians. Nevertheless, that the summer might not be spent in inactivity, and that the Aetolians might not, through his delay, none the less enjoy a peace which the senate had not granted, Acilius decided to attack Amphissa. From Heraclea the army was led over Oeta.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he had made camp before the walls he did not begin to attack the city by encirclement, as at Lamia, but by siege-engines. The battering-rams were moved up in several places at once, and when the walls were shaken the townspeople did not try to prepare or devise anything against engines of this kind;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> all their hopes were in arms and daring; with frequent sallies they threw into confusion not only the outguards of the enemy but the men who were around the earth-works and the engines.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Yet in many places the wall had been overthrown when the word was brought that the new consul had disembarked at Apollonia and was marching through Epirus and Thessaly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul had with him thirteen thousand infantry and five hundred <pb id="p.307"/>cavalry. He had already arrived at the Malian gulf;<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> and sending messengers ahead to Hypata to order the city to surrender, when they replied that they would do nothing except in accord with the general decision of the Aetolians, that the siege of Hypata might not detain him while Amphissa was as yet uncaptured, he sent his brother Africanus in advance and led the army to Amphissa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At their coming the citizens abandoned the town &mdash;for it was in large part stripped of its defences &mdash;and retired, armed and unarmed together, to the citadel, which they held impossible to capture.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The consul pitched camp about six miles away from there. Thither came Athenian envoys, first to Publius Scipio, who had preceded the main body, as has been said before, then to the consul, interceding for the Aetolians.<note>Polybius (XXI. iv. ff.) says nothing of a visit to the consul but only of their call on Africanus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They received a fairly amicable response from Africanus, who was looking for an occasion for an honourable withdrawal from the Aetolian campaign, with his eyes on Asia and King Antiochus, and had ordered the Athenians to urge not only the Romans to prefer peace to war, but also the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quickly, on the advice of the Athenians, a large delegation of Aetolians came from Hypata, and the words of Africanus, to whom they first addressed themselves, increased their hopes of peace, as he reminded them of the many tribes and peoples, first in Spain, later in Africa, who had put themselves under his protection; in all these he had left more conspicuous monuments of his kindness and generosity than of his military renown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The matter seemed settled, when the consul, on being addressed, quoted the response by which they had been rebuffed by the senate.<note>Cf. i. 5 above.</note> When the Aetolians <pb id="p.309"/>were dealt this unexpected blow &mdash;for they saw that<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> nothing had been accomplished either by the embassy of the Athenians or by the generous reply of Africanus &mdash;they said that they wished to consult their people.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They returned thence to Hypata; nor was a decision easy to reach; for there was no source from which a thousand talents could be paid, and they were afraid that if <quote>full discretion</quote> were granted they would suffer personal violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They therefore directed the same ambassadors to return to the consul and Africanus and to ask that if they wished to grant peace in reality, not merely to dangle it before them, deluding the hopes of the unfortunate, they would either diminish the amount of the indemnity or would order that an exception regarding their persons be made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nothing was obtained in the way of a change on the consul's part; and this embassy also was dismissed without result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Athenians followed; and Echedemus, the leader of their embassy, brought back hope to the Aetolians, wearied by so many repulses and bewailing with useless lamentations the ill-fate of their race, by suggesting that they ask an armistice for six months that envoys might be sent to Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the delay would add nothing to their present misfortunes, since these were extreme; many things might happen in the intervening time to relieve their immediate calamity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the proposal of Echedemus the same men were sent; they first met Publius Scipio,<note>The part played by Africanus is somewhat hard to understand. He had his own reputation to maintain (cf. vi. 6 above), as had Flamininus, but he was apparently less able to control his brother than he had perhaps expected. Scipio's greater concern for the Asiatic war was no doubt due to ambition for new renown for himself and his family, and probably to the political situation in Rome. Flamininus had defeated him badly two years before (XXXV. x), and this probably still rankled, despite his more recent successes. A decisive victory in Asia would strengthen greatly the position of the Scipionic party in Rome. The result was that Scipio and Flamininus were agreed as to the policy to be adopted towards the Aetolians, but for different reasons: Africanus to clear the way for the invasion of Asia, Flamininus to maintain his own peculiar position.</note> through whose <pb id="p.311"/>intervention they obtained from the consul an armistice<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> for the period which they asked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And the siege of Amphissa being raised, Manius Acilius turned his army over to the consul and left the province,<note>Cf. ii. 7-8 above. Acilius had not been relieved while the new consul was still six miles away (vi. 4 above).</note> and from Amphissa the consul went back into Thessaly, in order to conduct the army through Macedonia and Thrace into Asia.<note>Scipio now had the army of Acilius plus the troops which he had brought from Italy. Cornelius, the propraetor of ii. 7-8 above, was in Greece to watch the Aetolians, but the six months of truce would cover the campaigning season.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Then Africanus addressed his brother: <quote>The route which you propose to follow, Lucius Scipio, I likewise approve;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but it all hangs on the good-will of Philip, if he is loyal to our empire and will furnish us a safe passage and supplies and everything which feeds and aids an army on a long march; if he fails us, there will be no real security in going through Thrace; therefore my first counsel is to test the attitude of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It will be most successfully tested if the man who is sent finds him doing nothing in anticipation of such a visit.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus,<note>He later married the daughter of Africanus (XXXVIII. lvii. 6-7).</note> by far the most energetic of the young men of the time, was chosen for this errand and, using relays of horses, with almost unbelievable speed, from Amphissa &mdash;for he was sent from there &mdash;on the third day reached Pella.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The king was at a banquet and had gone far with his drinking; this very cheerfulness of mind relieved all anxiety that Philip planned to make any new trouble.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And at that time the guest was graciously welcomed, and the next day he saw supplies in abundance prepared for the army, bridges built over the rivers, roads constructed where travel was difficult. Taking back this information, with the same speed as on his journey hither, he met the consul at Thaumaci.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <pb id="p.313"/>From there the army, rejoicing to find its hopes<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> surer and greater, reached Macedonia, where everything was in readiness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> As they drew near the king welcomed them and escorted them in royal state. There were seen in him many signs both of efficiency and of courtesy, which served to recommend him to Africanus, a man who, eminent as he was in every way, was not averse to courtesy, provided that it was without luxury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Thence not only through Macedonia but also through Thrace, with Philip escorting them and making everything easy for them, the journey to the Hellespont was accomplished.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Antiochus, after the naval battle off Corycus, when he had spent all the free winter period in preparations on land and sea, had devoted most energy to refitting his fleet, that he might not lose entirely his control of the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It came to his mind that he had been defeated when the fleet of the Rhodians was absent; but if this &mdash;and the Rhodians would not let it happen again that they should be behind-hand &mdash;should also be present at a battle, he would need a great number of ships to equal the fleet of the enemy in strength and size.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So he had both despatched Hannibal to Syria to summon ships of the Phoenicians and ordered Polyxenidas, as he had been none too successful before, so to make the greater efforts in equipping the ships that remained and in assembling new ones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He himself wintered in Phrygia, summoning allies from all sides. He had sent even to Galatia; the inhabitants at that time were of a warlike disposition, still retaining their Gallic tempers, the native strain having not yet disappeared.<note>Livy seems to say that some of the original Gallic invaders were still alive; since they had come into Asia about <date value="-278">278 B.C.</date>, he probably means that the current generation had not yet been enervated by the easier life of Asia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had left his son Seleucus in Aeolis to hold in check the cities on the coast which on one <pb id="p.315"/>side Eumenes from Pergamum and on the other the<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> Romans from Phocaea and Erythrae were trying to rouse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman fleet, as has been said above, was wintering at Canae; there, about the middle of the winter, King Eumenes came with two thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he said that a great quantity of booty could be secured from the country of the enemy around Thyatira, he urged and finally persuaded Livius to send five thousand men with him. They were sent and within a few days carried off a huge amount of plunder.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile an uprising began at Phocaea when certain persons tried to draw away the sympathies of the crowd to Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The quartering of the ships was a burden, the tribute was a burden, since five hundred outer-garments with five hundred under-garments had been demanded of them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the shortage of grain was another burden, on account of which the fleet too and the Roman garrison departed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then indeed the faction which was trying to win the people over to Antiochus in their public meetings was freed from fear; the senate and the nobility thought that they should persist in the Roman alliance; the party which urged revolt was stronger with the mass of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Rhodians, the greater their delay the preceding summer, the earlier now, namely, at the spring equinox, placed the same Pausistratus in charge of the fleet and despatched him with thirty-six ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Already Livius from Canae, with his own thirty ships and seven quadriremes which King Eumenes had brought with him, was on his way to the Hellespont, that he might make everything ready for the crossing of the army, which, he thought, would come by land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He first <pb id="p.317"/>brought the ships into what they call the harbour of<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> the Achaeans,<note>The Greeks were supposed to have anchored there during the Trojan war.</note> thence he went up to Ilium, and after sacrificing to Minerva gave a gracious audience to embassies from Elaeus and Dardanus and Rhoeteum offering to entrust their cities to his good faith.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence he sailed to the entrance to the Hellespont, and leaving ten ships on guard off Abydus crossed with the rest of the fleet to lay siege to Sestus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the soldiers were already approaching the walls, some fanatical <hi rend="italics">Galli</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">Galli</hi> were priests of the Magna Mater whose temple in Rome had been dedicated the year before (XXXVI. xxxvi. 3), and may have been chosen as intercessors because of that connection. They are described as <hi rend="italics">fanatics</hi> because of the nature of their cult. Polybius (XXXI. vi.) says that there were only two priests in the party. The <hi rend="italics">Galli</hi> were eunuchs.</note> with their ritual dress first met them before the gate; they said that by the order of the Mother of the Gods they, the servants of the goddess, were coming to implore the Romans to spare the walls and the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> None of them was injured. Presently the whole senate with the magistrates came to surrender the city. Then the fleet crossed to Abydus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After trying their disposition in conferences and receiving no pacific reply, they prepared for a siege.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on in the Hellespont, Polyxenidas the king's prefect &mdash;he was an exile from Rhodes &mdash;hearing
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that the fleet of his countrymen had left home and that their commander Pausistratus, while haranguing the assembly, had spoken haughtily and contemptuously about him, feeling a peculiar jealousy towards him, thought of nothing by day or night except how he might employ deeds to refute these high-sounding words.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He sent to him a man, who was also well-known to him, to say that he could be of great service to Pausistratus and the country if he were permitted, and could be <pb id="p.319"/>restored by Pausistratus to his home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> Pausistratus in wonder asked how this could be done, the man asked and received a pledge to co-operate in the business or to bury it in silence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the go-between said this: Polyxenidas would surrender to him the royal fleet, either the whole or the greater part of it; as reward for so great a service he stipulated nothing else than restoration to his fatherland. The importance of the matter caused Pausistratus neither to believe nor to scorn the message.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He sailed to Panhormus in the land of Samos and waited there to investigate the offer that had been made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Messengers travelled back and forth, nor was Pausistratus convinced until in the presence of his agent Polyxenidas with his own hand wrote that he would do what he had promised, and sealing the tablets with his own device sent them to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By this pledge he thought that the traitor was bound to him: for a man who lived under a king would not have permitted himself to give proofs, attested by his own hand, to be used against himself. The plan of carrying out the pretended treachery was then settled..
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Polyxenidas said that he would give over the preparation of everything; he would not have rowers or naval allies in sufficient numbers with the fleet; he would draw up on shore certain ships under pretence of repairing them and would send others away to neighbouring ports;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> a few he would keep before the harbour of Ephesus in the open sea, and these, if conditions demanded it, he would expose to battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The same carelessness which he heard that Polyxenidas would adopt in his own fleet, Pausistratus at once himself put into practice, sending part of the fleet to collect stores at Halicarnassus and part to the <pb id="p.321"/>city of Samos, and he himself remained at Panhormus,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> to be ready when he received from the traitor the signal to attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Polyxenidas by trickery added to his confusion of mind; he beached some ships and fitted up dock-yards as if he were on the point of drawing up others; the rowers he did not summon from winter quarters to Ephesus but collected secretly at Magnesia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was a certain soldier of Antiochus who had come to Samos on private business, and was arrested as a spy and taken to Panhormus to the prefect.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the prefect asked what was going on at Ephesus &mdash;it is uncertain whether it was because of fear or from disloyalty to his own people &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> revealed everything: the fleet, arrayed and equipped, was in the harbour; all the rowers had been sent to Magnesia; a few ships had been beached and the docks dismantled; never had greater energy been devoted to naval matters. That this story was not accepted as the truth was due to a mind preoccupied with falsehood and delusive hope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Polyxenidas, having now completed his arrangements and summoned the rowers by night from Magnesia, hastily launched the ships which had been drawn up on the shore, and when he had spent a day not so much in preparation as because he did not want the departing
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> fleet to be seen, he set out after sunset, the wind being favourable, with seventy decked ships and before daylight reached the harbour of Pygela. He rested there by day for the same reason and during the next night crossed to the Samian country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then he directed Nicander, a certain pirate chief, to proceed to Palinurus with five decked ships and then to lead the marines by the shortest road through the <pb id="p.323"/>fields to Panhormus to take the enemy in the rear,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> and he himself in the meantime, dividing the fleet that he might hold the entrance to the harbour on both sides, set out for Panhormus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Pausistratus at first, as one in an unexpected situation, was terrified for a while, then, being a veteran soldier, he quickly collected his thoughts and decided that it was better to resist
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the enemy on land than on sea, and led the troops in two columns to the promontories which, like horns projecting into the sea, form the harbour, expecting to repel the enemy easily with weapons falling upon them from both sides. When the sight of Nicander, coming by land, had upset this plan, he suddenly changed his intention and ordered them all to go aboard the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then there was great confusion among the marines and sailors, and a sort of flight to the ships began, when they saw themselves surrounded by land and sea at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Pausistratus thought that there was one way of safety, if he could force a way through the entrance of the harbour and escape into the open sea, and when he saw that all had embarked he ordered the rest to follow him, and at the head of the columns urging his ship forward with the oars, he made for the entrance of the harbour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As the ship was passing the entrance Polyxenidas with three quinqueremes surrounded it. The ship was struck by the beaks and sunk; the defenders were overwhelmed with missiles, and among them Pausistratus too, fighting bravely, was killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some of the remaining ships were taken outside the harbour and others inside, and some were captured by Nicander as they were pushing off from the beach;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> only five Rhodian and two Coan ships escaped, making a way for <pb id="p.325"/>themselves among the crowded vessels by means of<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> the fear of darting flames; for each, with two poles projecting from their prows, carried ahead of it a great quantity of fire in iron drums.<note>Polybius (XXI. vi) describes these contrivances in greater detail. The drums or scoops were swung from the poles and could be tripped by suitable chains from the deck to spill fire on ships that approached.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When the triremes of Erythrae had met, not far from Samos, the fleeing Rhodian ships which they were coming to assist, they turned their course toward the Hellespont and the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> About the same time Seleucus recovered Phocaea, which was betrayed when one gate was opened by the sentinels; and Cyme and other towns of the same region revolted to him from fear.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these events were happening in Aeolis and Abydus had for some days withstood the siege, a royal garrison defending the walls, and all were now
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> wearied, with the consent of even Philotas, prefect of the garrison, their magistrates treated with Livius as to the terms for surrendering the city. The question that delayed a settlement was that there was no agreement as to whether they should be released armed or unarmed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As they were discussing this the arrival of the announcement of the disaster to the Rhodians caused the matter to pass out of their hands;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for Livius, fearing that Polyxenidas, elated by his success in so great an enterprise, would attack the fleet which was at Canae, immediately abandoned the siege of Abydus and the guarding of the Hellespont and launched the ships which had been drawn up on the beach at Canae; Eumenes too came to Elaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Livius with the entire fleet, to which were added two triremes from Mitylene, sailed for Phocaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he heard that this was held by a strong royal garrison and that the camp of Seleucus was not far away, he ravaged <pb id="p.327"/>the sea-coast and, quickly loading the booty,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> especially the men, into the ships, waiting only until Eumenes with his fleet should overtake him, he set sail for Samos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To the Rhodians the news of the disaster brought at first mingled terror and grief; for besides the destruction of ships and marines, they had lost all the beauty and strength of their youth, many nobles having been attracted, among other things, by the prestige of Pausistratus, which had justly been very great among his people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> then the fact that they had been entrapped by guile, and, more than that, by their own fellow-citizen, turned their grief into anger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They straightway sent ten ships and a few days later ten more, all under the prefect Eudamus, who, they believed, would be a leader in no respect equal to Pausistratus in other military qualities, but the more cautious as he was less high-spirited. The Romans and King Eumenes sailed first to Erythraea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, after a wait of one night, on the following day they gained the promontory of Corycus. Wishing to cross from there to the nearest parts of the land of Samos, without
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> waiting for sunrise, so that from it the pilots might be able to judge the state of the heavens, they started out into uncertain weather.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Half-way across, the north-east wind veering to the north, the ships began to be tossed by seas roughened by the wind.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Polyxenidas thought that the Roman fleet would make for Samos to join the Rhodian ships, and starting from Ephesus first stood off Myonnesus, then crossed to the island which they call Macris, that he might fall upon any individual ship of the passing fleet as it got out of formation or attack the <pb id="p.329"/>rear of the column at a suitable opportunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> he saw that the fleet was scattered by the storm, he first thought that he had a chance to attack, but a little later, the wind freshening and rolling up even greater waves, since
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> he realized that he could not get to them, he crossed to the island of Aethalia, that thence on the following day he might fall upon the ships which were trying to reach Samos from the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A small part of the Romans reached at dusk a deserted harbour in Samian territory, the rest of the fleet, tossed all night in the open sea, ran to the same port.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There they learned from peasants that the enemy's fleet was standing off Aethalia, and a council was held whether they should fight at once or wait for the Rhodian fleet. Action being postponed &mdash;for such was the decision &mdash;they crossed to Corycus whence they had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Polyxenidas also, after waiting in vain, returned to Ephesus. Then the Roman fleet, the sea being empty of the enemy, crossed to Samos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Rhodian fleet also arrived at the same place a few days later, and thus, to make it clear that this was what they were awaiting, a start was immediately made for Ephesus, that they might either fight a naval battle or, if the enemy declined the engagement, which was a matter of great import for its effect on the dispositions of the cities, they might wrest from him an admission of cowardice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They took their position facing the entrance to the harbour with the fleet drawn up in order of battle. When no one came out to meet them, the fleet divided, and part remained at anchor in the open sea opposite the entrance, part landed the marines on the coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And when they were bringing in a vast amount of booty, having devastated the country <pb id="p.331"/>far and wide, Andronicus the Macedonian, who was<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> in the garrison at Ephesus, made a sally as they approached the walls, and stripping them of a large part of their plunder drove them to the sea and the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the next day, placing an ambuscade at about the half-way point, the Romans marched in column towards the city to draw out the Macedonian; then, since the very suspicion that this would be done prevented anyone from coming out, they returned to the ships; and, the enemy avoiding battle on land and sea, the fleet returned to Samos, whence it had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then the praetor sent two triremes of the allies from Italy and two from Rhodes, with Epicrates the Rhodian in command, to defend the strait of Cephallania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Spartan Hybristas with the young men of the Cephallanians was making this dangerous with his piracy, and the sea was already closed to supplies from Italy.<note>One would expect that the task of keeping this part of the sea open would fall upon the fleet in Italian waters.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Piraeus Epicrates met Lucius Aemilius Regillus, who was taking over the command on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> sea<note>Cf. iv. 5 above; from ii. 10 above it would be assumed that Aemilius would have a more powerful fleet.</note> ; and on hearing of the defeat of the Rhodians, since he himself had only two quinqueremes, he took Epicrates with his four ships back to Asia with him; open Athenian vessels also accompanied him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the Aegean sea they crossed to Chios. There Timasicrates the Rhodian came on a stormy night with two quadriremes from Samos, and when brought in to Aemilius he said that he had been sent as an escort because this coast of the sea was made dangerous to cargo-boats because of the frequent raids of the king's ships from the Hellespont and Abydus. As Aemilius was crossing from Chios to Samos, he was joined by two <pb id="p.333"/>Rhodian quadriremes sent by Livius to meet him, and<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> by King Eumenes with two quinqueremes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they reached Samos Aemilius took over the fleet from Livius and after duly performing the sacrifice in the usual way called a council. There Gaius Livius &mdash;for he was the first to be asked his opinion &mdash;said that no one could give more loyal advice than the man who, if he were in the same situation, would have done what he advised the other to do:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he had it in mind to proceed to Ephesus with the entire fleet, taking along numerous cargo-boats heavily loaded with sand, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> to sink them at the mouth of the harbour;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the closing of the harbour would involve the less difficulty because the mouth of the harbour was like a river, long, narrow, and full of shoals. Thus they would have taken away from the enemy the use of the sea and immobilized his fleet.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This suggestion was approved by no one. King Eumenes asked what came next? When they had sunk the ships and closed the gate to the sea, would they then, with the whole fleet released, go away from there to give aid to the allies and cause terror to the enemy or would they none the less block the harbour with the whole fleet?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For if they go away, who doubts that the enemy will raise the sunken hulls and open up the harbour with less trouble than was taken to close it? But if they are to stay none the less, what good does it do to close it?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the contrary, the enemy, enjoying a very safe harbour and a very prosperous city, with Asia supplying their every want, will spend a quiet summer;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but the Romans, exposed on the open sea to waves and storms, needing everything, will be continually on guard, themselves hampered and prevented from <pb id="p.335"/>being able to do anything they want to do except<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> keeping the enemy blockaded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Eudamus, the commander of the Rhodian fleet, showed that he disliked the proposal rather than announced any plan of his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Epicrates the Rhodian thought that they should leave Ephesus for the present and send part of the fleet to Lycia and win Patara, the chief city of the country, to their alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This would be useful in two important respects: first, that the Rhodians, with the lands opposite their island tranquil, could devote all their energies to the one war that was being waged against Antiochus; second, that the fleet which was being assembled in Cilicia could be prevented from joining Polyxenidas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This suggestion carried the greatest weight;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> nevertheless, it was decided that Regillus should move with the whole fleet to the harbour of Ephesus in order to strike terror into the enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gaius Livius with two Roman quinqueremes and four Rhodian quadriremes and two undecked ships from Zmyrna was sent to Lycia, with orders to visit Rhodes first and inform them of the whole plan. The cities which he passed, Miletus, Myndus, Halicarnassus, Cnidus, Cos, willingly executed his orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he came to Rhodes, at the same time he both explained for what purpose he was sent and asked their advice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> With the approval of all and the addition of three quadriremes to the fleet which he had, he sailed to Patara.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first a favourable breeze bore them towards the city itself, and they hoped that they would accomplish something by causing a sudden panic; after the wind changed and the sea began to be tossed about with waves rolling this way and that, they did indeed win to the land by the use of <pb id="p.337"/>their oars despite the wind;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but they could neither<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> find safe anchorage near the city nor stand off shore before the entrance to the harbour in deep water since the sea was rough and night was coming on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Passing the walls they made for the port of Phoenicus, less than two miles distant from there, which was sheltered for the ships from the violence of the sea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but high cliffs towering above it threatened it, and these the citizens, joining the troops of the king whom they had as a garrison, quickly seized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Against them Livius, although the country was uneven and difficult to traverse, sent the auxiliaries from Issa and the light-armed young men from Zmyrna.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These, as long as there was a harassing attack with missiles, at the beginning, with small raids against parties of a few men rather than a regular engagement, sustained the contest;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> when larger numbers were rushing out of the city and now the whole population was pouring forth, fear struck Livius lest the auxiliaries should be surrounded and even the ships endangered from the shore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So he led out to the fight not only the marines but also the naval allies and even the throng of rowers, using whatever weapons each could find.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then also there was a battle of uncertain issue, and not only were some soldiers lost, but Lucius Apustius fell in this desultory fighting; finally, however, the Lycians were routed and put to flight and driven into the city, and the Romans, having won a victory not without bloodshed, returned to their ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then he set out for the gulf of Telmessus, which touches Caria on one side and Lycia on the <pb id="p.339"/>other, and giving up any design of further action<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> against Patara, the Rhodians were sent home and Livius, skirting Asia, crossed to Greece, in order that after conferring
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> with the Scipios, who were then around Thessaly, he might cross to Italy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Aemilius learned that the campaign in Lycia had been abandoned and that Livius had departed for Italy,<note>Livius should have reported to Aemilius before he left, but chose to disregard military etiquette. The nature of his business with the consul is not disclosed. The last sentence of the preceding chapter shows that Livy thought of these events as contemporaneous with those related in chaps. vi.-vii. above, but he is probably wrong in his estimate of the time consumed.</note> since he himself had been driven back from Ephesus by a storm and had returned to Samos without accomplishing
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> anything, thinking that it was disgraceful that Patara had been fruitlessly attacked, he determined to proceed thither with his entire fleet and attack the city with all his resources.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Sailing past Miletus and the rest of the coast held by the allies, in the gulf of Bargyliae they marched up inland to Iasus. A garrison belonging to the king held the city; the Romans, in the manner of enemies, devastated the surrounding fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then he sent agents to test the sentiments of the magistrates and important citizens by conferences, and when they replied that it was not at all in their power to decide, he led his troops to attack the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were exiles from Iasus among the Romans; and they in great numbers began to appeal to the Rhodians not to allow an innocent city, both neighbouring and related to them, to be destroyed; their own sole cause for exile was their fidelity to the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the same might of the royal garrison, by which they themselves had been driven out, constrained those who remained in the city; there was <pb id="p.341"/>one single purpose among all the Iasenses, to escape<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> from their enslavement to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Rhodians, moved by their prayers, and receiving also the support of King Eumenes, both by speaking of their own relationship and at the same time by lamenting the hard plight of a city dominated by a royal garrison, prevailed upon the praetor to abandon the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Leaving there, with everything else pacified, as they skirted the coast of Asia they came to Loryma &mdash;this is a harbour opposite Rhodes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There some secret talk first began among the military tribunes in their quarters and finally reached the ears of Aemilius himself &mdash;that the fleet was drawn away from Ephesus and from their own war that the enemy, left free in the rear, might with complete impunity make any venture against so many near-by cities of the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This gossip worried Aemilius; when he summoned the Rhodians and asked them whether the whole fleet could be sheltered in the harbour at Patara and they had replied in the negative, he found this pretext for abandoning the expedition and took the ships back to Samos.<note>The Roman naval operations of this period seem peculiarly aimless, and to lack even the virtue of being good training exercises. The case of Livius shows that they had some intelligence regarding the movements of the consul, yet Aemilius shows no disposition to co-operate in any really effective fashion.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Seleucus, the son of Antiochus,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> after holding the army in Aeolis for the whole period of the winter, partly assisting his allies, partly plundering those whom he could not win over to his alliance, decided to invade the territory of Eumenes while he was far from home, engaged with the Romans and Rhodians in the naval operations off Lycia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He first approached Elaea with his army formed for battle; then, abandoning the attack on the city, he devastated the fields in hostile fashion, <pb id="p.343"/>and marched off to lay siege to Pergamum, the chief<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> city and citadel of the kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Attalus<note>Attalus was the brother of Eumenes (XXXV. xxiii. 10).</note> at first, stationing outposts before the city and organizing raids of the cavalry and light infantry, harassed rather than resisted the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> finally, when, after learning from such skirmishing that he was equal in no aspect of his strength, he had retired within the walls, the siege of the city began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> About the same time Antiochus also set out from Apamea and established a base first at Sardis, then at the mouth of the Caicus river, with a great army composed of men of various nationalities. The greatest source of terror consisted of four thousand Gauls who served for pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These troops, with a few others intermixed,<note>Something has dropped out of the text. Various suggestions have been made as to what should be read, among them <hi rend="italics">Dahis.</hi> I have been more non-committal.</note> he sent to lay waste the territory of Pergamum in every direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the news of this reached Samos, Eumenes, called away by the war at home, first went to Elaea with his fleet; then, since cavalry and light infantry were at hand, protected by their guard, before the enemy discovered it or made any move, he hastened to Pergamum. Then again small battles began to take place, growing out of raids, Eumenes without doubt avoiding a decisive engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A few days later the Roman and Rhodian fleets came to Elaea from Samos to assist the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When it was reported to Antiochus that they had landed their troops at Elaea and that so many fleets had assembled in one harbour, and when about the same time he had learned that the consul with his army was already in Macedonia and <pb id="p.345"/>was making ready what was necessary for the passage<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> of the Hellespont, he decided that the time had come, before he should be beset on land and sea at once, to treat for peace, and he occupied with his camp a hill facing Elaea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> there, leaving all his infantry forces in camp, with the cavalry, numbering six thousand, he
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> went down into the open country under the very walls of Elaea and sent a herald to Aemilius to say that he wished to discuss the question of peace.<note>1 Polybius (XXI. x.) gives a more detailed account.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Aemilius summoned Eumenes from Pergamum and the Rhodians and held a council. The Rhodians did not disdain peace; Eumenes maintained that it was neither honourable to discuss the question of peace at that time nor possible to reach a conclusion to the discussion: <quote>For how,</quote> he said, <quote>shall we honourably, shut up and besieged within our walls, accept what may be called terms of peace?
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Again, in whose eyes will this be a valid peace, which we shall conclude without a consul, with no authority of the senate, without the order of the Roman people?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now I ask, if peace is made by <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> will you return immediately to Rome and withdraw your fleet and army, or wait to see what the consul's pleasure is regarding it, what the senate decrees, or what the people orders?<note>While Aemilius had the <hi rend="italics">imperium,</hi> that of Scipio was superior to his, and it is not certain that Aemilius had any authority on land, since he had been assigned the <hi rend="italics">maritima provincia</hi> (ii. 10 above). There would surely have been a dispute had Aemilius concluded a peace treaty under such conditions, before the arrival of the consul, and in any case the ratification of senate and assembly was necessary. The position of Eumenes is sound in Roman constitutional practice, as well as consistent with his own dignity. He did not wish Antiochus to use the siege of Pergamum as something with which to bargain.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so the result is that you stay in Asia and that your forces, led back once more to their winter stations, abandoning the war, exhaust your allies with furnishing supplies, and then, if it
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> seems proper to those with whom the authority lies, start <pb id="p.347"/>wholly afresh a new war, although this war, if there<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> is no slackening, through delay, of the impetus we now have, we can have finished, with the aid of the gods, before winter.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This argument prevailed, and the answer was given to Antiochus that until the arrival of the consul the question of peace could not be discussed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Antiochus, having tried in vain for peace, devastated first the lands of the Elaeans, then of the Pergamenians, and leaving there his son Seleucus, marching as though through a hostile country to Adramytteum, sought the rich land which they call the plain of Thebe, celebrated in
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the poem of Homer,<note>The city, but not the plain, of Thebe is mentioned by Homer (<hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> I. 366, etc.).</note> and in no place in Asia was richer booty won by the king's troops. Likewise to Adramytteum came Aemilius and Eumenes, brought thither by the fleet.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time there arrived at Elaea from Achaea one thousand infantry and one hundred cavalry, all under the command of Diophanes,<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxxi. 6.</note> and when they debarked guides, sent by Attalus to meet them, escorted them by night to Pergamum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were all veterans and skilled in war, and their leader too was a pupil of Philopoemen,<note>Cf. XXXV. xxv. 7, etc.</note> at that time the foremost general of all the Greeks. They took two days for the double purpose of resting men and horses and reconnoitring the enemy's dispositions and learning at what times and places they advanced and retired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king's troops would come up to about the base of the hill on which the town stood; thus the rear area was open for foraging. When no one came out of the city, not even to throw a javelin from a distance against the outposts,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> after the people had once, under the impulse of fear, shut themselves up within the walls, a feeling of contempt for them and hence carelessness arose among the forces of <pb id="p.349"/>the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A large part of them had no saddles or<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> bridles for their horses; a few being left with the arms and at their posts, the rest were scattered and dispersed here and there over the whole plain, some engaged in youthful play and pastime, some picnicking in shady spots, some even lying asleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Diophanes, watching this from the high-lying city of Pergamum, ordered his men to take their arms and be ready at the gates; he himself went to Attalus and told him that it was his purpose to make an attempt on an outpost of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When Attalus allowed it reluctantly, seeing that there were one hundred cavalry against six hundred, one thousand infantry against four thousand, Diophanes marched out of the gate and took his place not far from the outpost of the enemy, watching his chance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Both the people in Pergamum believed this to be folly rather than fearlessness, and the enemy, having watched them for a while and seen no signs of activity, themselves made no change in their customary carelessness, especially since they were scornful of their small numbers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Diophanes kept his men quiet for a while, as if they had been led out merely to watch a show;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> when he saw that the enemy had broken ranks, ordering the infantry to follow as fast as they could, he himself, at the head of the cavalry with his own troop, the horses being given the loosest possible rein, and a shout raised at the same moment by every footman and trooper, attacked the outpost of the enemy without warning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not the men alone but even the horses were terrified, and when they broke their halters they caused consternation and confusion among their own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A few horses <pb id="p.351"/>stood fearlessly; even these they could not easily<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> saddle or bridle or mount, the Achaeans causing far more terror than was warranted by the number of troopers. But the infantry, in formation and ready, attacked men who were scattered around in disorder and nigh half asleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There was slaughter and flight everywhere through the plains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Diophanes pursued the fugitives as far as it was safe, having won great glory for the Achaean people &mdash;for both men and women were watching from the walls of Pergamum &mdash;and returned to the garrisoning of the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day the king's outguards with better order and discipline established themselves five hundred paces farther from the city, and the Achaeans came out about the same time and to the same place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For many hours both parties waited on the alert as if an attack were about to come; after the time, not far from sunset, of returning to camp had arrived, the royal troops, grouped around their standards,<note>This meaning of the phrase is unusual but seems to be required here.</note> began to depart in a formation adapted to marching rather than fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Diophanes remained quiet as long as they were in sight; then, with the same impetuosity as the day before, he fell violently upon the rear and caused again so much panic and dismay that although they were being cut down from behind no one stood fast to fight; trembling and with difficulty keeping their march-formation they were driven back into camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This bold conduct of the Achaeans forced Seleucus to move his camp from the country of Pergamum.</p> 
				<p>When Antiochus heard that the Romans had come to defend Adramytteum, he left that city, at any <pb id="p.353"/>rate, alone; but after laying waste their lands he<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> took by storm Peraea, a colony of the Mitylenaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Cotto and Corylenus and Aphrodisias and Prinne fell at the first assault. Thence he returned to Sardis by way of Thyatira. Seleucus, remaining on the seacoast, was a source of fear to some and of assistance to others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman fleet with Eumenes and the Rhodians went first to Mitylene and then returned to Elaea whence it had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, on their way to Phocaea, they put in at the island which they call Bacchium &mdash;it overlooks the city of the Phocaeans &mdash;and when they had plundered like enemies the temples and shrines which they had not previously laid hands on &mdash;the island was beautifully adorned &mdash;they crossed to the city itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Dividing the tasks<note>I.e., the subordinate commanders received orders to undertake specific missions in the attack: cf. XXV. xxx. 6.</note> among themselves, they attacked it, and it seemed possible to take it without siege-works, by assault and escalade, but a garrison
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> of three thousand armed soldiers, sent by Antiochus, entered the city, and at once the attack was abandoned and the fleet returned to the island, without doing anything other than devastating the farms of the enemy around the town.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was then determined that Eumenes should return home and make ready for the consul and the army whatever was necessary for the crossing of the Hellespont, and that the Roman and Rhodian fleets should return to Samos and there remain on guard lest Polyxenidas should move from Ephesus. The king returned to Elaea, the Romans and Rhodians to Samos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There Marcus Aemilius, the brother of the praetor, died.</p> 
				<p>The Rhodians, when his funeral was over, with thirteen of their own ships and one Coan <pb id="p.355"/>quinquereme and another from Cnidus, set out for Rhodes,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> so as to be on guard there against a fleet which was reported to be coming from Syria.<note>Cf. viii. 3 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Two days before Eudamus with his fleet arrived from Samos, thirteen ships from Rhodes, with Pamphilidas in command, had been sent against the same Syrian fleet and, picking up four ships which were guarding Caria, they relieved the blockade of Daedala and several other fortresses of Peraea which were besieged by the king's troops. It was decided that Eudamus should leave at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Six undecked vessels were given to him in addition to the fleet which he had.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he had departed and made all possible haste, he overtook the ships which had gone on ahead at the harbour which they call Megiste. After proceeding to Phaselis in one column, it seemed best to await the enemy there.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Phaselis is on the border of Lycia and Pamphylia; it projects far into the deep, and is the first land sighted by travellers who are going to Rhodes from Cilicia and it allows ships to be sighted from afar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For that reason especially the place was chosen, so that they might be ready to meet the hostile fleet; but, and this they had not foreseen, on account both of the unhealthy country and of the time of year &mdash;for it was midsummer &mdash;besides, from the unaccustomed odour, diseases began to spread generally, especially among the rowers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In fear of this epidemic, they went on, and when they were sailing past the gulf of Pamphylia, putting in at the mouth of the river Eurymedon, they learned from the people of Aspendus that the enemy was off Sida.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king's navy had sailed rather slowly by <pb id="p.357"/>reason of the unfavourable season of the etesian<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> gales, which is, as it were, allotted to<note>The use of <hi rend="italics">stature</hi> here is peculiar. Usually employed to denote the appointment of days for festivals and similar occasions, it here suggests that this season was reserved (by Nature) for the etesian winds.</note> winds from the north-west.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were thirty-two<note>This number cannot be made to agree with those given in xxii. 2-4 above.</note> Rhodian quadriremes and four triremes; the royal fleet consisted of thirty-seven ships of larger size; among them they had three of seven banks of oars and four of six. Besides these there were ten triremes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And they saw from a certain watch-tower that the enemy was close at hand. At daybreak next day both fleets moved out of port as if to fight that day; and after the Rhodians had passed the promontory which juts out from Sida into the sea, they were seen by the enemy and sighted them as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the side of the king's fleet, on the left flank, which extended into open water, Hannibal was in command; on the right, Apollonius, one of the nobles; and already they had the ships formed in a straight line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Rhodians were approaching in a long column; first was the flagship of Eudamus; Chariclitus brought up the rear; Pamphilidas was in command of the centre of the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Eudamus saw the enemy arrayed and ready to engage, he too sailed out into deep water and directed the following ships, keeping their relative positions to one another, to form in a straight line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This order at first produced confusion; for he had not gone far enough out to sea to permit the array of all the ships to form in line toward the shore,<note>The manoeuvre described is that of forming line to the left. The flagship moved at a right oblique but failed to gain enough distance to the right to make room for the rear ships. Eudamus may have misjudged the distance or have been in too great haste; the sixth ship also moved off at too acute an angle to the original direction and increased the crowding on the left.</note> <pb id="p.359"/>and in his excessive haste, with only five ships,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> he encountered Hannibal; the rest, because they had been ordered to form in line, did not follow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There was no room left on the land side for the tail of the column; while they were entangled with one another the battle with Hannibal was already begun on the right flank.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But in an instant of time both the excellence of their ships and their experience in naval warfare took away all fear from the Rhodians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the ships, sailing quickly out into deep water, each gave the one in rear a place on the land side,<note>The congestion described in the preceding note automatically corrected itself, the ships naturally turning to the right where the battle was on. The ships that broke through the hostile line gave still more space for manoeuvre.</note> and, moreover, if a ship clashed head on with a ship of the enemy, it either crushed its prow or broke off its oars or, passing through the open intervals between the files, it attacked the stern.<note>These were the standard forms of naval attack. The Romans, although they had no native instinct for naval warfare, introduced some familiar and effective variations on these tactics.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The greatest fear was caused when a seven-banked ship of the king was sunk<note>This statement must not be taken too literally: cf. sect. 9 below.</note> with one blow by a much smaller Rhodian vessel; so now without question the right wing of the enemy was turned to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Eudamus, in the open, although he was superior in everything else, was hard pressed by Hannibal, particularly on account of the greater number of his ships, and Hannibal would have surrounded him had not the flagship of his fleet displayed the signal by which, as the custom is, a scattered fleet is collected into one place, and all the ships which had been victorious on the right<note>Livy appears here to change his point of view. The <quote>right wing</quote> of sect. 3 is that of the king's fleet, while the <quote>right flank</quote> here is that of the Rhodians. One or the other, however, may be a simple error on the part of Livy or a scribe.</note> flank had hurried off to bear aid to their comrades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then Hannibal also and the ships which followed him began to retire; nor could the Rhodians pursue, <pb id="p.361"/>since many of their rowers were sick and for that<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> reason more quickly exhausted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While they were restoring their strength with food in the open water, Eudamus watched the enemy towing their lame and crippled ships with hawsers from open vessels, and hardly more than twenty moving off undamaged, and from the bridge of the flagship he called for silence and exclaimed, <quote>Stand up and look upon a glorious sight.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Every man stood up, and seeing the confusion and panic of the enemy, they cried almost with one voice <quote>Let us pursue.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The ship of Eudamus himself had been damaged by many blows; but he ordered Pamphilidas and Chariclitus to follow as far as they deemed it safe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They pursued for some distance; but when Hannibal was close to land, fearing that they might be detained by the wind near a hostile coast, they returned to Eudamus, and with difficulty towed to Phaselis the captured seven-banked ship which had been struck at the first onset.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thence they returned to Rhodes, not so much rejoicing in their victory as blaming one another because, when it had been possible, the entire fleet of the enemy had not been sunk or captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hannibal, discouraged by this one defeat, did not even then dare to pass Lycia, anxious though he was to join the old fleet of the king as soon as possible;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and, that this course might not be open to him, the Rhodians sent Chariclitus with twenty beaked ships to Patara and the harbour of Megiste.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Eudamus, with the seven largest ships of the fleet which he had commanded, they ordered to rejoin the Romans at Samos, in order that with whatever wisdom and whatever influence he had, he might urge the Romans to the capture of Patara.</p> <pb id="p.363"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Great joy was brought to the Romans first<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> by the news of the victory and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> then by the coming of the Rhodians, and it was evident that if the Rhodians had been relieved of their present responsibility<note>The <quote>responsibility</quote> apparently concerns Patara, which was strategically situated, both to threaten Rhodes and to bar the way to reinforcements coming to Antiochus from Syria by sea or land (cf. xv. 7-8 above).

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But it was the departure of Antiochus from Sardis, and at the same time the fear that the coast cities would be crushed, which prevented them from leaving the guarding of Ionia and Aeolis; the Rhodians sent Pamphilidas with four decked ships to the fleet which was off Patara.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Antiochus was not only collecting reinforcements from the states which surrounded him, but had sent ambassadors and letters to Prusias, king of Bithynia, in which he complained of the crossing of the Romans into Asia:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> they were coming to destroy all kingdoms, so that in the whole world there might be no empire save that of Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philip, Nabis, had been defeated; he himself was the third to be attacked;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> as each came next after the last destroyed, the fire, catching, so to speak, one after another in succession, would be everywhere; from himself their next step would be into Bithynia, since Eumenes had already given himself into voluntary slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Prusias, troubled by this message, was diverted from such suspicions by the letter of Scipio the consul, and more by the words of his brother Africanus, who, by citing the enduring tradition among the Roman people of increasing with every sign of honour the dignity of allied kings, and also, by giving examples from his personal experience, induced Prusias to merit his friendship:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> tribal <pb id="p.365"/>chieftains, taken under his protection in Spain, he had<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> left kings; Masinissa he had not only established on his ancestral throne but had placed on that of Syphax, by whom he had been driven out before;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and he was both by far the richest of the kings of Africa and equal, whether in majesty or in power, to any king whatsoever in the whole world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philip and Nabis, enemies, defeated, too, in war by Titus Quinctius, had yet been left in their kingdoms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Philip the year before, in fact, had had his tribute cancelled and his hostage-son restored, and had recovered certain cities outside of Macedonia with the consent of the Roman generals. Nabis too would have been in the same position of honour had not his own madness and then the treachery of the Aetolians destroyed him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The favourable inclination of the king was especially strengthened after Gaius Livius, the commissioner, who as praetor earlier had commanded the fleet, came from Rome and showed him how much surer were the Roman prospects of
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> victory than those of Antiochus and how friendship with the Romans would be more respected and dependable.<note>Polybius (XXI. xi) redistributes and rearranges the arguments of both sides, attributing to Prusias himself the fear mentioned in sect. 5, naming some of the <hi rend="italics">reguli</hi> of sect. 9 and adding one in Illyria. There are small differences in the account of Nabis, but essentially the two chapters are the same in substance.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Antiochus lost his hope of an alliance with Prusias, he went to Ephesus from Sardis to inspect the fleet which for some months had been equipped and ready, more because he saw that with
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> his land forces he could not withstand the Roman army and its generals, the two Scipios, than because he had ever tried actual combat by sea with much success or had at this time any great and assured confidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was, however, a reason for hope at the moment, in that he had heard, first, that the larger part of the Rhodian fleet was in the vicinity <pb id="p.367"/>of Patara and, second, that King Eumenes with all<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> his ships had gone to meet the consul at the Hellespont; an additional stimulant to his spirits was the destruction of the Rhodian fleet at Samos under conditions attained by trickery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Relying on these circumstances, he sent Polyxenidas with the fleet to try fortune in any sort of engagement and himself led his troops to Notium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This is a town of Colophon, overlooking the sea, distant from old Colophon about two miles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And he wished to have the town itself in his hands, being so close to Ephesus that he could do nothing on land or sea which was not observed by the Colophonians, and through them was not immediately known to the Romans, and he had no doubt that when they heard of its siege they would move the fleet from Samos to bear aid to an allied city; this would be the opportunity for Polyxenidas to bring about an engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Therefore he began to lay siege to the city, constructing a line of fortifications down to the sea on each side alike, and in both ran mantlets and an outwork up to the wall and moved battering-rams under shelter.<note>The <hi rend="italics">testudo</hi> is ordinarily a temporary device, formed by the overlapping shields of an attacking column in close formation; here it is a portable roof to cover a battering-ram and its crew.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Terrified by these misfortunes, the Colophonians sent to Lucius Aemilius the praetor at Samos representatives to beg for the protection of the praetor and the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Aemilius, idle at Samos, was chafing under the long delay, thinking of nothing less than that Polyxenidas, twice challenged by him
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> in vain, would offer the opportunity for battle, and he thought it a disgrace that the fleet of Eumenes should assist the consul in transporting the legions into Asia while he was entangled in aiding the beleaguered Colophon, an operation of indefinite duration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Eudamus the Rhodian, who also had detained him at Samos, <pb id="p.369"/>although he wished to leave for the Hellespont, and<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> all the others, kept urging him and saying:
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> how much better it would be either to relieve the allies from siege
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> or again to defeat the navy already once defeated and to wrest completely from the enemy his mastery of the sea than, abandoning the allies and surrendering to Antiochus the land and sea of Asia, to go off to the Hellespont, where the fleet of Eumenes was sufficient, and run away from his own share in the war.<note>Again we see the perplexities which lack of communications and of satisfactory liaison between army and navy caused Aemilius. He probably had no instructions from the consul as to the co-operation he expected or from the senate as to his general policy. The multiplicity of possible lines of action resulted in his adopting none of them and in exposing him to pressure from his allies.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Leaving Samos to seek provisions, everything being now consumed, they were preparing to cross to Chios; this was the granary of the Romans, and thither all the cargo-boats from Italy directed their course.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sailing from the city to the other side of the island &mdash;the side facing Chios and Erythrae is exposed to the north wind &mdash;as they were preparing to cross, the praetor was informed by letter that a great quantity of grain had come from Italy, but the ships carrying wine had been delayed by storms; at the same time it was reported that the Teans had generously offered stores to the king's fleet and had promised five thousand casks of wine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When halfway across he suddenly turned the fleet towards Teos, intending either to use, with their consent, the provisions prepared for the enemy, or to treat the Teans as foes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they had turned their prows towards the land, about fifteen ships came into sight rounding Myonnesus, which at first the praetor, thinking they were from the king's fleet, started to pursue; then it was seen that they were swift and light pirate-vessels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They had plundered the sea-coast of the <pb id="p.371"/>Chians and were returning with all sorts of booty<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> when they saw the fleet from the open sea and turned to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They were both superior in speed, their ships being lighter and designed with that in view, and nearer the shore; so before the fleet approached them they escaped to Myonnesus, and the praetor followed, thinking that he would lure the ships out of port, as he was ignorant of the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Myonnesus is a promontory between Teos and Samos. It is a hill shaped like a cone terminating in a sharp point from a fairly extensive base<note>The <hi rend="italics">meta</hi> in the technical sense was a cone-shaped marker, used in the circus to indicate how many laps of a race had been finished.</note> ; from the mainland it has an approach by a steep path, on the side of the sea cliffs worn by the waves close it in, so that in some places the overhanging rocks rise to a greater height than do the ships which lie at anchor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In this vicinity, not daring to approach lest they come within range of the pirates posted on the cliffs, they wasted a day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When at length at nightfall they abandoned their fruitless undertaking, they came the next day to Teos, and stationing the ships in the harbour which is behind the town &mdash;the islanders call it Geraesticus &mdash;the praetor sent out troops to ravage the land around the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Teans, when the plundering was going on before their eyes, sent envoys with fillets and badges of suppliants to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they tried to clear the state of any deed or word unfriendly to the Romans, he both charged them with aiding the fleet of the enemy with provisions and reminded them how much wine they had promised Polyxenidas; if they would give the Romans the same amount, he would <pb id="p.373"/>recall his men from plundering; if not, he would<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> treat them as enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the envoys had taken back this threatening answer, the people was summoned to an assembly by the magistrates to consult as to what they should do.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On that day, as it happened, Polyxenidas with the royal fleet left Colophon, and when he heard that the Romans had moved from Samos, had pursued the pirates to Myonnesus, and were devastating the fields of the Teans, while the ships lay in the harbour of Geraestus, he himself dropped anchor
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> opposite Myonnesus in a concealed harbour of an island &mdash;the sailors call it Macris.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thence, reconnoitring at close range to see what the enemy was doing, he at first was very hopeful that as he had defeated the Rhodians at Samos by blockading the passage out of the harbour, so he would capture the Roman fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The nature of the place is not unlike: the headlands coming together close the harbour so that with difficulty two ships at a time can pass through.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Polyxenidas then conceived the design of occupying the exit by night, and with ten ships standing off each promontory, which could attack from both flanks the sides of the ships as they came out, and of landing armed men from the rest of the fleet, as he had done at Panhormus, to attack the enemy by land and sea at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This plan would not have failed had not the Romans, when the Teans had promised to do as they had been ordered, thought it more convenient to move the fleet around to the port which lies in front of the city, to receive the supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Also Eudamus the Rhodian is said to have called attention to a fault of the other harbour, when by chance two ships had broken their oars, entangled in the narrow entrance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <pb id="p.375"/>and among other things the praetor was induced to<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> transfer the fleet by the fact that there was danger from the land, since Antiochus had his base at no great distance away.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The fleet having moved over to the city without the knowledge of anyone, the marines and sailors landed to divide the provisions, and especially the wine,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> among the ships, when about midday a peasant was brought before the praetor and said that for two days now a fleet had anchored off the island of Macris and a little while before had been seen in motion as if getting ready for departure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The praetor, dismayed by this sudden crisis, ordered the trumpets sounded for the return of the men who were straggling through the fields and sent the tribunes to the town to muster the marines and sailors on ship-board.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Just as in a sudden fire or at the capture of a city there was panic, some running to the city to summon their comrades, others hurrying at full speed from the town to the ships, with confused shouts and these almost drowned out by the trumpets, at length, despite conflicting orders they were assembled at the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Scarcely could any man know or go aboard his own vessel in the excitement; and there would have been a dangerous panic, both on sea and on land, if, distributing the tasks,<note>Cf. xxi. 8 above.</note> Aemilius with the flagship had not led the way out of the harbour into open water, drawing after him those that followed, and had arranged them in line, each in his own place, and Eudamus and the Rhodian fleet had not remained near the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> shore, so that both the embarkation was without confusion and each ship set forth as it was ready.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So the ships in front opened up their line under the eyes of the praetor, and the Rhodians formed the <pb id="p.377"/>rear of the column, and the line thus formed, as if<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> they saw the royal fleet, moved out into deep water. They were between Myonnesus and the promontory of Corycus when they sighted the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And the king's fleet, advancing in a long column with two ships abreast, likewise formed in line facing the enemy, with its left flank so far extended that it could enfold and surround the right wing of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Eudamus, who brought up the rear, perceived that the Romans could not extend their front to equal it and could not prevent their being encircled on the right of the line, he speeded up his ships &mdash;and the Rhodians were by far the fastest of all in the whole fleet &mdash;and making the flanks equally long he drove his own ship at the flagship, in which was Polyxenidas.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now the engagement began through the entire fleets in every place at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the Roman side eighty ships were fighting, of which twenty-two were Rhodian; the fleet of the enemy consisted of eighty-nine vessels; of ships of the largest size they had three with six banks of oars and two with seven. In strength of ships and courage of soldiers the Romans were far the best, the Rhodian ships in quickness of movement and skill of pilots and dexterity of rowers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> yet the greatest terror was caused the enemy by those which carried fire before their prows,<note>Cf. xi. 13 above and the note.</note> and that which was their sole source of safety at Panhormus when they were surrounded was at this time the greatest factor in their victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For when, from fear of the flames in front of them, the royal ships had swerved to avoid the collision of their prows, they were unable to strike the enemy with their beaks, <pb id="p.379"/>and while turning
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> they exposed themselves broadside<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> to blows, and if one did clash it was covered by flames pouring upon it, and they were more afraid of the fire than of the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless, as usual, the valour of the soldiers had the greatest effect in the battle. For when the Romans had broken the centre of the hostile line, they swung around and took in the rear the royal ships which were engaged with the Rhodians; and in an instant of time both in the centre and on the left flank the ships of Antiochus were surrounded and sunk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The uninjured right wing was terrified more by the destruction of their comrades than by their own peril; but after they saw the others surrounded and the flagship of Polyxenidas abandoning the allies and setting sail, they quickly raised their top-sails &mdash;and the wind was favourable for ships bound for Ephesus &mdash;and took to flight, with a loss of forty-two ships in this fight, of which thirteen were captured and fell into the hands of the enemy and the rest were burned or sunk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Two Roman ships were damaged severely, several somewhat injured<note>Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 27) gives somewhat different figures: the Roman fleet consisted of 83 ships, of which 25 were Rhodian. The enemy lost only 29 ships (in XL. lii. 6 Livy still insists on 42). Even if we accept the account of Appian the Roman losses were exceedingly small.</note> ; one Rhodian ship was captured by a curious accident.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When it had struck a Sidonian vessel with its beak, its anchor,<note>The anchor was hung suspended abaft of the prow; it might easily then have fallen as Livy says and served as a grappling-iron.</note> dislodged from its own ship by the very shock, caught the prow of the other ship with its fluke, falling like an iron hand;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> then, in the ensuing excitement, since the Rhodians backed water trying to disengage themselves from the enemy, the anchor-cable, fouling the blades, swept one side clean of oars; the crippled ship was then captured by the very vessel which it had struck and <pb id="p.381"/>grappled. In this manner, in the main, the<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> seafight off Myonnesus was conducted.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Antiochus was alarmed at this because, having lost his dominion of the sea, he doubted whether he could defend his distant possessions, and ordered his garrison withdrawn from Lysimachia,<note>Lysimachia was strongly situated on the European side of the Hellespont and its abandonment removed the last obstacle in Scipio's way to Asia. Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 28) is equally severe with Antiochus and more specific.</note> lest it be destroyed there by the Romans &mdash;a foolish decision, as the actual outcome showed later.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For it was not only easy to defend Lysimachia from the first assault of the Romans, but even to maintain a siege for an entire winter and to reduce the besiegers even to the extremity of want by dragging out the time and meanwhile to try every chance to realize hopes of a peaceful settlement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Not only did he surrender Lysimachia to the enemy after the defeat on the sea, but he abandoned the siege of Colophon and withdrew to Sardis;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and thence he sent agents to Ariarathes<note>He was the son-in-law of Antiochus (Appian, <hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 5).</note> in Cappadocia to ask for auxiliaries, and he devoted himself entirely, in every possible way, to collecting troops, having now but one purpose &mdash;to settle the question on the battle-field.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Aemilius Regillus after the naval victory proceeded to Ephesus, and arraying his ships in front of the harbour, when he had forced from the enemy the final admission that he had yielded control of the sea, he sailed to Chios, whither he had been bound before the naval battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he had repaired there the damaged ships, he sent Lucius Aemilius Scaurus with thirty ships to the Hellespont to ferry the army across, and the Rhodians, honoured with part of the booty and naval trophies,<note>Usually captured figureheads and beaks, such as those which gave their name to the Rostra in the Roman Forum.</note> he ordered to return home;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <pb id="p.383"/>the Rhodians in their zeal chose first to transport the<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> consul's army; and having finished this additional task, then at length they returned to Rhodes. The Roman fleet from Chios crossed to Phocaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This city is situated at the extremity of a bay of the sea and is oblong in shape; it is surrounded by a wall of twenty-five hundred paces in length and it grows narrower at each end like a wedge; the people themselves call it Lampter.<note>Literally, the lighthouse.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There the width is twelve hundred paces; thence a tongue, like a dividing line, runs a mile into the sea, almost through the centre of the bay; where it joins the narrow entrance-way it produces two very safe harbours facing in opposite directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The one which faces south they call Naustathmus, because it shelters a great number of ships; the other is near Lampter itself.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these exceedingly safe harbours had been occupied by the Roman fleet, before he attacked the walls by either escalade or siege, the praetor thought he should send agents to test the attitude of the leading citizens and magistrates. When he found them intractable he began to attack in two places at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One part was not thickly built up; temples of the gods occupied much space; here first he moved a battering-ram and began to shake the walls and towers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> then, when the multitude rushed to its defence, a ram was moved up on the other side also;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and now the walls were being overthrown on both sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As they fell in, when the Roman soldiers were making their assault right over the heaps of ruins and still others were trying to climb the walls with ladders, the townspeople resisted so stubbornly that it was easily <pb id="p.385"/>apparent that they placed more reliance on arms and<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> courage than in walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Compelled, therefore, by the danger to his soldiers, the praetor ordered the recall sounded, lest he expose reckless men to those who were raging with despair and fury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the fighting stopped, not even then did they turn to rest, but rushed in every direction to build and repair what had been laid in ruins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> While engaged in this work, Quintus Antonius, sent by the praetor, approached them and, reproving their obstinacy, pointed out that it was more to the interest of the Romans than themselves that the fighting should not continue until the city was destroyed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> if they wished to refrain from their madness, the opportunity was open to them of surrendering on the same terms as were granted when they submitted to Gaius Livius before.<note>Livy does not state them.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they heard this they took a space of five days to deliberate, meanwhile searching for some hope of aid from Antiochus; but after the ambassadors sent to the king had reported that there was no protection in him, then they opened the gates, bargaining that they should not be treated as enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the standards entered the city and the praetor had proclaimed that he wished to spare the surrendered, there was a shout raised on all sides that it was a shameful thing that the Phocaeans, never faithful allies,<note>Cf. ix. 1-5 above.</note> always dangerous foes, should get off scot-free. With such shouts, as if they had received a signal from the praetor, they rushed off in every direction to plunder the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Aemilius at first opposed and tried to recall them, saying that captured, not surrendered, cities were plundered and that even so in these cases the decision rested with the commander, not the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After wrath and <pb id="p.387"/>greed proved stronger than authority, he sent heralds<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> through the city ordering all freemen to assemble in the forum in his presence, if they would escape harm; and in everything which was under his control the word of the praetor held good; the city, the farmlands and their laws were restored to them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> and, since winter was approaching, he chose the harbours of Phocaea as the winter station for the fleet.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time the consul,<note>This resumes the narrative of Scipio's march through Thrace. Part of the condensed account in vii. 16 above is thus repeated.</note> having crossed the territories of the Aenians and Maronians, received the news of the defeat of the royal fleet off Myonnesus and the abandonment of Lysimachia by its garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This gave him much greater joy than the naval victory, especially after they arrived there, and the city, filled with supplies of all kinds stored up as if for the arrival of the army, received them, where they had pictured to themselves the prospect of extreme want and hardship in besieging the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For a few days they remained there, in order that the baggage might catch up, and the sick who, throughout all the forts of Thrace, exhausted by illness and the length of the march had been left behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When all had rejoined they again took up the march through Chersonesus and came to the Hellespont. There all preparation for crossing had been made through the energy of King Eumenes,<note>Livy neglects to mention the services rendered by Scaurus and the Rhodians.</note> and they crossed to shores in, as it were, a state of peace, with no one opposing them, without confusion, different ships seeking different ports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This circumstance increased the ardour of the Romans, seeing that the crossing into Asia had been conceded to them, which they had believed would be the occasion <pb id="p.389"/>of a great battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then for a considerable time<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> they remained stationary in camp on the Hellespont, because it happened that the days on which the <hi rend="italics">ancilia</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">ancilia</hi> were a set of twelve shields, one of which had fallen from heaven in the time of Numa. Since the safety of Rome depended upon it, Numa had eleven duplicates made, so that no one knew which was the original. Their care was entrusted to a college of priests called the <hi rend="italics">Salii.</hi> Every March (this again indicates serious dislocation of the calendar) the shields were carried around the city (<hi rend="italics">ancilia movere</hi>), and these days were <hi rend="italics">religiosi,</hi> or days on which only necessary duties were performed (Festus, p. 278). It is uncertain how scrupulously an army on campaign observed them, but in this case it appears that Scipio grasped this convenient opportunity for their observance; see the following note.</note> were moved were sacred and had fallen in the period of the journey.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These same days had detached Publius Scipio from the army, their religious character concerning him even more because he was a Salian priest<note>Africanus apparently took his duties seriously even during a war.</note> ; he too caused a delay until he overtook the army.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During these days, by chance, an ambassador from Antiochus had come to the camp, Heraclides of Byzantium, bringing instructions about peace;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> real hope that this was attainable was created in him by the delay and procrastination of the Roman army, which, he had believed, as soon as they reached Asia would make at full speed for the camp of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He decided to approach first not the consul but Publius Scipio, and so he had been instructed by the king. In him he placed his greatest hopes, for in addition to the fact that both the greatness of his soul and his having had his fill of glory rendered him especially approachable, it was known to all men what
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> kind of conqueror he had been in Spain and later in Africa, his son also was a prisoner in the hands of the king. Where and when and by what chance he had been captured, like many other things, is by no means unanimously explained by the sources.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some say that at the beginning of the war, when he was travelling from Chalcis to <pb id="p.391"/>Oreus, he was surrounded by the king's ships, others<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> that after they had crossed to Asia he had been sent with a
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> troop from Fregellae to reconnoitre in the direction of the king's camp, and that when the cavalry rushed out to meet them and he had retreated, in the confusion he had fallen from his horse and had been captured with two troopers and so conducted to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What is well established is that if peace had continued with the Roman people and if personal relations of mutual hospitality had existed between the king and the Scipios, the young man could not have been treated and entertained with greater kindliness and generosity than he had received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For these reasons, when the ambassador had waited for the arrival of Publius Scipio, at his coming he called upon the consul and begged him to hear his instructions.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A full council was called and the speech of the envoy was heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He said that, after many earlier embassies about peace had been sent backwards and forwards in vain, his own very confidence was due to the fact that the previous ambassadors had succeeded in nothing: for Zmyrna and Lampsacus and Alexandria Troas and Lysimachia<note>The first three cities here mentioned have frequently been spoken of by Livy: cf. <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> XXXV. xlii. 2; Lysimachia has not figured in the debates and Polybius (XXI. xiii) omits it from his account of this incident.</note> in Europe had been objects of contention in those discussions;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> of these, the king had already withdrawn from Lysimachia, that they might not say that he had possessions in Europe; the cities in Asia he was ready to surrender, and any other cities which the Romans, because they belonged to their party, wished to separate from the king's realm; of the money too which had been spent on the war, the king would guarantee to the Roman people the payment of one-half.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These were the terms of <pb id="p.393"/>peace; the rest of his speech was that mindful of<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> human destiny, they should deal temperately with their own fortune and not hardly with that of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Let them limit their empire to Europe, that even this was very large; that it was possible to conquer and gain it part by part more easily than to hold the whole;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but if they wished to take some part of Asia too,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> provided they limited it by easily recognizable natural features, the king would permit his own self-restraint to be overcome by Roman greed for the sake of peace and harmony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What seemed to the ambassador great incentives for concluding peace seemed unimportant to the Romans: as to the money that had been spent on the war, they deemed it only fair that the king should assume payment of it all, since it
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> was by his fault that the war had been fomented, and that the king's garrisons should be withdrawn not only from Ionia and Aeolis, but, just as all Greece had been liberated, so all the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> cities which were in Asia should be set free<note>Polybius omits this comparison of Asia and Greece.</note> ; this could not be accomplished otherwise than by the retirement of Antiochus from the occupation of Asia on this side of the Taurus mountains.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Since the ambassador realized that he could obtain no fairness in the council, he tried privately &mdash;for such were his orders &mdash;to win over Publius Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First of all, he said that the king would restore to him his son without a ransom; then, ignorant of both the spirit of Scipio and the Roman tradition, he promised him a great sum of money and, with the single exception of the title of king, partnership in the entire kingdom if, through his aid, he succeeded in obtaining peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To this Scipio replied: <quote>That you do not know the Romans <pb id="p.395"/>as a race, that you do not know me, to whom you<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> have been sent, I am less surprised to find since I see that you do not know the situation of the man from whom you come.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Lysimachia should have been held, to prevent our entering the Chersonesus, or resistance should have been offered at the Hellespont, to prevent our crossing into Asia, if you intended to ask peace from foes who were anxious about the outcome of the war;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but when we were given passage into Asia and when not only our reins but also our yoke was accepted, what debate is left on the basis of equity, when you are obliged to put up with our sovereignty?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Of the generous offers of the king, I accept the greatest, my son; as to the rest, I pray the gods that my estate will never need them; my soul, at any rate, will not need them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In return for so great a gift to me, he will find me grateful to him if he desires private gratitude in return for a private kindness; in my public capacity I shall take nothing from him and give him nothing. What I can give him at this moment is my sincere advice.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Go, advise him in my words that he abandon the war and refuse no terms of peace.</quote><note>Livy has been at some pains to portray in this speech the incorruptible Roman, who will, while he accepts, allow not even the greatest private obligation to influence his public conduct. The rest of this narrative, save for this interpretation, is found in Polybius (XXI. xv).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His words had no effect upon the king, who thought that the gamble of war would be a safe one, since even now terms were declared to him as if he already had been defeated. Mention of peace was forgotten for the moment, and all his energy was devoted to preparation for war.<note>Antiochus had now nothing to lose by fighting, since the terms of peace were already as severe as they were ever likely to be.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When everything was ready for the execution of his designs and when he had moved from his base, the consul first advanced to Dardanus <pb id="p.397"/>and then to Rhoeteum, and both peoples thronged<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> to meet him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he went on to Ilium, and encamping on the level ground which lies below the walls, he went up to the city and the citadel and offered sacrifice to Minerva, the guardian of the citadel;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the people of Ilium, on their part, with every mark of honour in deed or word proclaiming the Romans as descendants, and the Romans rejoicing in their descent.<note>The tradition of the Roman descent from the Trojans was already familiar in the second century B.C.: cf. XXIX. xii. 14.</note> Departing thence, on the sixth day of marching they came to the mouth of the Ca&iuml;cus river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thither too came King Eumenes, having first tried to conduct his fleet back from the Hellespont to Elaea to winter, but then when on account of opposing winds he could not for several days round the promontory of Lecton, he disembarked at the nearest point, so as not to miss the preliminaries of the campaign, and hastened to the Roman camp with a small force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From his camp he was sent back to Pergamum to obtain supplies, and when he had delivered the grain to the consul as he was directed, he returned to the same station. From there the plan was, after previously preparing several days' rations, to march against the enemy before winter should prevent.<note>The maladjustment of the Roman calendar makes the chronology of the campaign difficult, and efforts to find a solution must be regarded as unsuccessful. It suffices here to assemble the evidence of Livy: (1) the eclipse of March 14, dated by Livy July 11 (iv. 4 and the note); (2) the preparations for wintering made by Aemilius (xxxii. 14) and by Eumenes (sect. 4 above); (3) the prospective approach of winter (xxxix. 2); (4) the observance, probably belated, of the festival of the <hi rend="italics">ancilia</hi> (xxxiii. 6). Beloch (p. 387, quoting Diest through Kromayer) says that the rainy season in this region begins in November.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The king's camp was near Thyatira. When Antiochus learned there that Publius Scipio was sick and had been taken to Elaea, he sent ambassadors to return his son to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The gift was not only grateful <pb id="p.399"/>to a father's heart, but the joy was healing also to his<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> body;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and at length sated with embracing his son, he said, <quote>Take the message to the king that I tender my thanks to him, but at present I can show my gratitude in no other way than to counsel him not to come forth in line of battle until he hears that I have returned to camp.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Although sixty thousand infantry and more than twelve thousand cavalry sometimes inspired his mind with hope as to the battle, yet Antiochus, moved by the authority of so great a man (in whom, having regard to the uncertain issues of war, he had placed his every hope of assistance), retired, crossed the river Phrygius and established his camp in the vicinity of Magnesia, which is near Sipylus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and, inasmuch as he wished to delay matters, that the Romans might not attempt his fortifications, when he had constructed a ditch six cubits deep and twelve cubits wide, on the outside he threw a double wall around the trench, on the inner lip of which he
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> raised a wall with numerous towers, whence the enemy could easily be prevented from crossing the ditch.<note>Livy's description is vague and the fortifications unusual in design if I have interpreted correctly.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, thinking that the king was near Thyatira, marching continuously, came down on the fifth day into the Hyrcanian plain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he found that the king had gone, following his trail along the river Phrygius, he encamped four miles from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There about a thousand cavalry &mdash;they were mostly Galatians with some Dahae and mounted archers<note>Cf. XXXV. xlviii. 3-5.</note> of other tribes mixed with them &mdash;crossing the river in a confused mass, made an attack on the outguards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first this threw them into confusion, since they were not in formation; <pb id="p.401"/>then, as the battle continued for a longer time and<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> the number of the Romans increased, it being easy to reinforce them from the adjacent camp, the king's troops were wearied and, unable to withstand the larger numbers, tried to retire along the banks of the river, and before they crossed the stream many were killed by the Romans, who pressed on from the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the next two days everything was quiet, neither side crossing the river; on the third day after, the Romans all crossed the river at the same time and made camp about twenty-five hundred paces from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As they were laying out the camp and engaged in fortifying it, about three thousand picked infantry and cavalry from the king's army came up, causing great fear and confusion; the number on outpost was considerably smaller;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> they nevertheless by themselves, without calling away any troops from the fortifying of the camp, both at first kept the contest even and later, as the battle grew more fierce, beat off the enemy, killing a hundred of them and capturing about a hundred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For the next four days both battle-lines were drawn up and stood before the ramparts; on the fifth day the Romans advanced to the middle of the space;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Antiochus did not advance his standards, but stood so that his rear troops were less than a thousand paces from the wall.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the consul perceived that the enemy declined to fight, he called a council the next day, to consider
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> what they should do if Antiochus would not give them an opportunity for a battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Winter, he said, was at hand; either they would have to keep the troops in tents or, if it was decided to withdraw
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> to winter quarters, the war would have to be postponed to the summer. No enemy was <pb id="p.403"/>ever held in such contempt by the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> cry from all sides was that he should immediately lead them out and take advantage of the enthusiasm of the soldiers, who, as if their task was, not to fight with so many thousands of the enemy, but
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> to slaughter the same number of cattle, were ready to attack the camp over ditch, over wall, if the enemy would not come out to fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Gnaeus Domitius was sent to reconnoitre the route of approach and where they could come up to the enemy's rampart, and when he brought back complete and definite information, it
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> was decided that on the following day they would move the camp nearer; on the third day the standards were advanced to the centre of the space and the battle-line began to form.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nor did Antiochus think that he should remain longer on the defensive, lest he both diminish the courage of his own
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> men by declining battle and increase the hopes of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the enemy, and he too led out his forces, advancing so far from the camp that it was clear that he meant to engage.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The Roman battle-line is generally about uniform in its arrangement, both as to number and as to their equipment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There were two Roman legions and two<note>The Latin organizations were usually called <hi rend="italics">alae</hi> (XXXI. xxi. 7 and the note), and this word may have dropped out here. It is equally possible that Polybius did not distinguish them in this case.</note> of allies of the Latin confederacy; each consisted of five thousand four hundred men.<note>The usual strength was 5,000 (XXVI. xxviii. 7) or 5,200 men (
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxxi. 2), but was sometimes as high as 6,200 (XXIX. xxiv. 14).</note> The Romans held the centre, the Latins the flanks; the advanced units were the <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> then came the <hi rend="italics">principes;</hi> the <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> held the rear.<note>This is the typical battle formation of the legion, the three lines corresponding roughly to the modern front-line, support and reserve. Each unit of <hi rend="italics">hastati,</hi> who formed also the skirmish-line, occupied enough frontage to permit the <hi rend="italics">principles</hi> to pass through them as reinforcements and replacements; the <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> were held out until the decisive blow was to be struck or a counter-attack organized.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Outside this, which may be called the regular battle-line, on the <pb id="p.405"/>right flank and in line with the legions, the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> placed the auxiliaries of Eumenes mixed with the Achaean <quote>targeteers,</quote> being about three thousand infantry; outside them he stationed less than three thousand cavalry, eight hundred of whom belonged to Eumenes, all the rest being Roman<note>This seems to include the Latin cavalry.</note> cavalry; on the extreme flank he placed the Tralli and Cretans, each contingent amounting to about five hundred men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The left flank did not seem to need such auxiliaries placed there, since the river and its steep banks gave protection on that side; nevertheless, he stationed there four troops of cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was the whole of the Roman force, with two thousand Macedonians and Thracians who had followed as volunteers; they were left as a guard for the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They placed sixteen elephants in reserve behind the <hi rend="italics">triarii,</hi> for, in addition to the fact that they seemed unable to face the greater number of the king's elephants &mdash;there were fifty-four of them &mdash;African elephants cannot resist even an equal number of Indian, whether because the latter are superior in size &mdash;for in fact they are far larger &mdash;or in fighting spirit.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>XL. The king's battle-line was more varied, made up of many races and auxiliary forces differently armed. There were sixteen thousand infantry armed in the Macedonian fashion, who are called <hi rend="italics">phalangitae.</hi><note>Cf. XXXVI. xviii. 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They formed the centre of the line, and their frontage was divided into ten sections; these sections were separated by intervals in which two elephants each were placed; from the front the formation extended thirty-two ranks in depth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This was the main strength of the king's army, and <pb id="p.407"/>it caused great terror, not only from its general<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> appearance, but by reason of the elephants, standing out especially conspicuously among the soldiers. They were of great size; head-armour and crests and towers placed upon their backs, and, in addition to the driver, four soldiers riding in each tower, added to their impressiveness. On the right of the <hi rend="italics">phalangitae</hi> he stationed fifteen hundred Galatian infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To these he added three thousand armoured cavalry &mdash;they call them <hi rend="italics">cataphracti.</hi><note>Cf. XXXV. xlviii. 3.</note> In addition to these there was a squadron of about a thousand cavalry; they called it the <hi rend="italics">agema;</hi><note>In XLII. lviii. 9 (cf. note), the <hi rend="italics">agema</hi> seems to be distinguished from the <hi rend="italics">equitum sacra, alia,</hi> lii. 4.</note> they were Medes, picked men, and cavalry from many races in the same region mingled with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Adjoining them a herd of sixteen elephants was posted in reserve.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On this side, the flank being advanced a little, was the royal bodyguard; they were called <hi rend="italics">argyraspides</hi><note>They carried silver shields.</note> from the character of their equipment; then the Dahae, mounted archers, to the number of twelve hundred; then the light infantry, three thousand in number, about equally divided between Cretans and Tralli; to them two thousand five hundred Mysian archers were added. The extremity of this flank consisted of four thousand mixed Cyrtians, slingers, and Elymaeans, archers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the left flank, next the <hi rend="italics">phalangitae,</hi> were posted fifteen hundred Galatian infantry and two thousand Cappadocians similarly armed &mdash;they had been sent to the king by Ariarathes; then twenty-seven hundred auxiliaries mixed from all races, and three thousand armoured cavalry and one thousand other cavalry, <pb id="p.409"/>the royal squadron, with lighter armour for them<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> selves and their horses, but otherwise with equipment not unlike the rest; they were mostly Syrians mingled with Phrygians and Lydians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In front of this cavalry were scythe-bearing chariots and camels of the breed called dromedaries. These were ridden by Arab archers carrying slender swords four cubits long, that they might be able to reach the enemy from so great a height. Then came another great crowd, corresponding to that on the right flank: first the Tarentini, then twenty-five hundred Galatian cavalry, next a thousand Neocretans and fifteen hundred Carians and Cilicians similarly equipped, and the same number of Tralli and four thousand <quote>targeteers</quote>:
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> these were Pisidians and Pamphylians and Lycians; then auxiliaries of the Cyrtians and Elymaeans equal to those stationed on the right flank, and sixteen elephants a short distance away.<note>Livy has not accounted for the 60,000 infantry and more than 12,000 cavalry of xxxvii. 9 above (about 43,700 infantry and 12,000 cavalry). But Antiochus held out a strong guard for the camp, and Livy does not give the strength of all the contingents. Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 32) differs from Livy in several respects.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The king himself was on the right flank; he placed his son Seleucus and Antipater the son of his brother on the left; the centre of the line was entrusted to three commanders, Minnio and Zeuxis and Philippus, the master of the elephants.<note>There is no mention of Hannibal, but in XXXVIII. lviii. 10 Nasica speaks as if he had been present. It would be ironical if the battle which was to test the prowess of the two great generals were fought when both were absent.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A morning mist, lightening into clouds as the day advanced, caused a fog; the moisture from this, like a rain brought on by the west wind, covered everything;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> these conditions brought absolutely no discomfort to the Romans, but at the same time they were very inconvenient for the king's army; for the faintness of the light, in a line of moderate frontage, <pb id="p.411"/>did not deprive the Romans of a view in all directions,<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> and the moisture, in a force almost entirely composed of heavy infantry, did not at all dull the swords and spears;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the king's troops, with their line so widely extended, could not see the flanks even from the centre, much less one flank from the other, and the moisture had softened the bowstrings and slings and the thongs<note>These thongs were wrapped around the shafts of javelins to impart to them a rotary motion, thereby giving longer range and more accurate aim.</note> of the javelins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The scythe-bearing chariots also, by which Antiochus had expected to cause panic in the hostile line, turned their terror upon their own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They were in general equipped in the following fashion: they had points along the pole, projecting like horns ten cubits from the yoke, with which to pierce whatever they encountered, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> on the ends of the yokes there were two scythes standing out in two directions, one in line with the yoke, the other pointed downward towards the ground, the former to cut up whatever was near it on the sides, the latter to wound men who had fallen and came under the chariot; also from the hubs of the wheels on both sides two other scythes, pointing in different directions, were similarly fastened.<note>The lack of intelligibility of this account is the best indication that Livy had never seen such a chariot. Other descriptions differ in various particulars: cf. Xenophon <hi rend="italics">Anab.</hi> I. viii. 10; Curtius IV. ix. 5; Vegetius III. xxiv. etc.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The chariots so equipped, because, if they were stationed on the flanks or in the centre, they would of necessity have been driven through their own ranks, had been posted by the king, as has been said, in the front rank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Eumenes saw this, being not unaware how uncertain was this sort of fighting and this kind of auxiliary, if one could frighten the horses rather than meet them in regular battle, he ordered the Cretan archers with the slingers and dart-throwers, with some <pb id="p.413"/>troops of cavalry, not in mass-formation but as widely<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> separated as possible, to rush out and shower weapons upon them from all sides at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This storm, as it were, partly by the wounds dealt by weapons hurled from all directions, partly by the discordant shouts, so frightened the horses that, as if they were set free from the reins, they rushed in every direction, not knowing where they were going;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> their charges were easily avoided by the light infantry and the lightly-equipped slingers and the swift-footed Cretans; and the cavalry pursuing increased the confusion and fright of the horses and camels, these too being overcome with terror, while added to it all were the manifold cries of the throng of bystanders.<note>The <quote>bystanders</quote> here are the infantry which was not yet engaged but which took this vocal part in this phase of the battle. Thucydides (VII. lxx.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> &mdash;lxxi.) had described the shouting of soldiers and civilians on shore during the naval battle at Syracuse, and the inclusion of such details became a regular feature of the technique of historical composition.</note> So the chariots were driven away from the space between the two lines and, this idle show being ended, then at length the signal was given on both sides and the clash of regular battle began.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That trivial thing, however, was presently the cause of real calamity. For the supporting auxiliaries which had been stationed next them, dismayed by the panic and fright of the chariots, also turned to flight and exposed the whole line as far as the armoured cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And they, when the Roman cavalry reached them, their supports being scattered, did not sustain even the first shock; part of them fled; others were held back on account of the weight of their armour and weapons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The whole left flank then wavered, and when the auxiliaries were broken, who were between the cavalry and those who were called the <hi rend="italics">phalangitae,</hi> the panic spread as far as the centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There, as soon as the ranks were thrown <pb id="p.415"/>into disorder and the use of the very long spears<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> &mdash;the Macedonians call them <hi rend="italics">sarisae</hi> &mdash;was prevented by their own friends rushing among them, the Roman legions advanced and hurled their javelins into the disorganized mass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Not even the elephants posted in the intervals deterred the Roman soldiers, accustomed already by the wars in Africa both to avoid the charges of the beasts and either to assail them with spears from the side or, if they could approach closer, to hamstring them with their swords.<note>Cf. XXVII. xxxix. 8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By now almost the entire centre was being beaten back from the front and the auxiliaries flanking them were being cut down in the rear, while on another side the Romans<note>The expression is careless, but the context demands that this statement refer to the Romans, who were being driven back on their own left although victorious everywhere else.</note> heard the rout of their comrades and the shouts of the panic-stricken now almost at the camp itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For Antiochus, on his right flank, since he saw that there were no auxiliaries there except four troops of cavalry, because of the Romans' confidence in the river, and that these, while they were maintaining contact with their neighbours, were leaving the bank unguarded, made an attack upon them with the auxiliaries and the armoured cavalry;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> nor did he charge from the front alone, but encircling them from the river was already pressing on from the flank, until first the cavalry fled and then the infantry who were nearest were driven headlong towards the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The camp was under the command of Marcus Aemilius, tribune of the soldiers, the son of that Marcus Lepidus who a few years later became pontifex maximus.<note>In <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date> (XL. xlii. 12).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he saw the flight of his men, he met them with his entire guard and ordered them first to halt and then to return to the battle, taunting them with fear and disgraceful flight;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> then <pb id="p.417"/>he uttered threats that they were rushing blindly to<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> their own deaths if they did not obey his orders; finally, he gave the signal to his own men to kill the first of the fugitives and with steel and wounds to drive against the enemy the mass of those that followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This greater fear prevailed over the lesser; driven by terror in front and rear they first halted; then they too returned to the fight, and Aemilius with his own guard &mdash;they were two thousand gallant men &mdash;boldly
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> withstood the onrushing king, and Attalus, the brother of Eumenes, from the right flank, where the enemy's left had been routed at the first attack, when he saw the flight of the troops on the left and the mellay around the camp, himself came in the nick of time with two hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Antiochus saw the troops at whose backs he had just been looking returning to the fight, and another body coming from the camp and another from the battle-line, he turned his horse to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So on both wings the victorious Romans, over piles of corpses which they had heaped up, especially in the centre, where the strength of the bravest troops<note>Appian several times mentions the gallant stand of the <hi rend="italics">phalangitae;</hi> when the time for flight came their weapons impeded them.</note> and the weight of their arms had delayed the flight of the enemy, proceeded to plunder the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The cavalry of Eumenes first of all, then the rest of the cavalry, pursued the enemy over the whole plain, killing the hindmost as they overtook them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But a greater peril to the fugitives, the chariots and elephants and camels being mingled with them, was the disordered mob of their own men, since their ranks once broken, as if blind they rushed one over <pb id="p.419"/>the other or were trampled down by the charging<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> beasts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the camp also there was great slaughter, greater, almost, than on the battle-field; for the first body of fugitives had chiefly made for the camp and, gaining confidence from this increase in numbers, the garrison fought with greater stubbornness from the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Romans, finding themselves held up at the gates and by the wall, which they had expected to carry at the first onset, when they finally broke through, in their passion caused greater destruction.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About fifty thousand infantry are said to have been slain on that day and three thousand cavalry; fourteen hundred were captured and fifteen elephants with their drivers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Of the Romans, many were wounded; there were killed not more than three hundred infantry and twenty-four cavalry, and from the army of Eumenes twenty-five.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And on that day, indeed, the victors, having plundered the camp of the enemy, returned to their own laden with booty; on the next day they despoiled the bodies of the slain and gathered up the prisoners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Ambassadors from Thyatira and Magnesia near Sipylus came to surrender their cities. Antiochus, fleeing with a few companions and collecting more along the way, with a moderate-sized body of soldiers reached Sardis about midnight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thence, when he heard that his son Seleucus and some of his friends had gone to Apamea, he too, about the fourth watch, with his wife and daughter sought Apamea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The guardianship of the city<note>Sardis.</note> was handed over to Xeno, and Timo was placed in charge of Lydia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but no regard was paid to them and, with the consent of the citizens and the soldiers who <pb id="p.421"/>were in the citadel, ambassadors were sent to the<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> consul.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time ambassadors came also from Tralles and from Magnesia which is on the Meander river and from Ephesus to surrender their cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Polyxenidas had left Ephesus when he heard of the battle, and having sailed with the fleet as far as Patara in Lycia, in fear of the guard of Rhodian ships which were at Megiste, he disembarked with a few men and made his way by land to Syria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The cities of Asia entrusted themselves to the good faith of the consul and the dominion of the Roman people. The consul was now at Sardis; thither too came Publius Scipio from Elaea, as soon as he could stand the hardships of the journey.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>About the same time a herald from Antiochus, through the mediation of Publius Scipio, asked and obtained from the consul permission for the king to send ambassadors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A few days later Zeuxis, who had been governor of Lycia, and Antipater, the son of his brother, arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> First meeting Eumenes, who, they thought, on account of their ancient quarrels, would be particularly opposed to peace, and finding him more favourably disposed towards peace than either they or the king had expected, they next interviewed Publius Scipio and through him the consul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and at their request they were received by a full council at which to announce their errand, and Zeuxis spoke thus: <quote>We do not ourselves have anything to say so much as we ask of you, Romans, by what atonement we can expiate the error of the king and obtain peace and pardon from the conquerors.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In your extreme generosity you have always pardoned defeated kings and <pb id="p.423"/>peoples; with how much greater magnanimity and<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> with inclinations how much more peaceful should you act in this victory which has made you masters of the world?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Laying aside now quarrels with all mortals, you, like the gods, should consider and spare the human race.</quote> Even before the ambassadors arrived it had been decided what to reply. It was agreed that Africanus should answer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He is reported to have spoken to this effect: <quote>Out of such things as were under the control of the immortal gods, we Romans have those things which the gods have given us;
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but our souls, which are subject to the will of our minds, we have kept and still keep unchanged in every kind of fortune, and neither has prosperity puffed them up nor has adversity depressed them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As proof of this, to omit all else, I should cite to you your Hannibal as witness if I could not cite yourselves.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After we crossed the Hellespont, before we set eyes on the king's camp or beheld his battle-line, when Mars was approachable to both sides and the outcome of the war undetermined, when you raised the question of terms of peace, we offered conditions, as equals to equals, and these same conditions we now propose as victors to vanquished: keep your hands off Europe; withdraw from all Asia on this side of the Taurus mountains.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then, for the expenses incurred in the war, you will pay fifteen thousand Euboean talents,<note>The Euboean talent was a universal standard of value, frequently employed in international transactions (XXXVIII. xxxviii. 13; Polybius I. Ixii; XV. xviii. etc.). Its value was the same as that of the Attic talent.</note> five hundred now, twenty-five hundred when the senate and the Roman people shall have ratified this treaty, then one thousand talents annually for twelve years. To Eumenes too it is our pleasure that four hundred talents be paid and the balance of the grain <pb id="p.425"/>which is due his father.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When we have made this<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> agreement, in order that we may hold it as certain that you will carry it out, there will be some guarantee if you give us twenty hostages of our selection;
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> but never will it be quite clear to us that the Roman people is at peace in any place where Hannibal shall be; him we demand before all else.<note>Nothing has been said of Hannibal since the defeat of the fleet by the Rhodians (xxiv. 11 above), but Nepos (<hi rend="italics">Hannibal</hi> 9) says that he fled to Crete, and Livy (XXXIX. li. 1) and Polybius (XXIII. xiii) report him in Bithynia after Magnesia. Possibly his departure from the kingdom of Antiochus should be placed before the battle rather than after it. For various reasons the genuineness of this item in Scipio's speech seems open to question, although Polybius (XXI. xvii) also has it. The Romans seem not to have taken the demand for Hannibal and the others mentioned in the next sentence very seriously: no such clause was included in the negotiations at the Hellespont (xxxv above), although Scipio asserts that their demands were unchanged (the clauses in this chapter which differ are rather interpretations than modifications); provision was made for amendments to the treaty with respect to these persons (XXXVIII. xxxviii. 8); the vindictiveness of Scipio's language is disproportionate to the actual damage done by Hannibal in this war and inconsistent with the character of Scipio as it is revealed in his other relations with Hannibal.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Thoas the Aetolian, too, provoker of the Aetolian war, who by your confidence in them armed you and by their confidence in you armed them against us, you will surrender, and with him Mnasilochus the Acarnanian<note>Cf. XXXVI. xii. 4.</note> and Philo and Eubulidas of Chalcis.<note>Not mentioned before by Livy, but cf. Polybius XXI. xvii.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> It will be in a worse plight that the king will make peace because he makes it later than he could have done. If he delays now, let him know that the majesty of kings falls with greater difficulty from the topmost point to the middle than it is hurled from the middle to the lowest point.</quote> The ambassadors from the king had been sent with instructions authorizing them to accept any proffer of peace; and so it was decided that ambassadors should be sent to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The consul divided his army to winter at Magnesia on the Meander and at Tralles and at Ephesus. A few days later the hostages were delivered by the king to the consul at Ephesus and the envoys who were to go to Rome arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Eumenes also set out <pb id="p.427"/>for Rome at the same time as the ambassadors of the<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> They were followed by embassies of all the peoples of Asia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on in Asia, two proconsuls at about the same time came from their provinces to Rome with hopes of triumphs; Quintus Minucius from the Ligures, Manius Acilius from Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the achievements of the two had been heard, Minucius was refused a triumph, Acilius was granted one with general approval; and he rode into the City in triumph over King Antiochus and the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were carried in this triumph two hundred thirty military standards, three thousand pounds of silver bullion, one hundred thirteen thousand minted Attic four-drachma pieces, <hi rend="italics">cistophori</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">cistophorus</hi> was a coin worth three <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> and stamped with the image of the chest used in the mysteries.</note> to the number of two hundred and forty-nine thousand, embossed silver vessels in large numbers and of great weight; he displayed also a set of silver furniture belonging to the king and a splendid garment, forty-five golden crowns, the gifts of allied cities, and spoils of all kinds.<note>Acilius was later accused of appropriating part of the booty to his own use (lvii. 12-13 below).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He led thirty-six noble prisoners, Aetolians and commanders in the king's army.<note>In iii. 8 above there were forty-three such prisoners. Probably still others had died or escaped.</note> Damocritus the Aetolian chief, a few days before, escaped from prison by night, and while the guards were pursuing him along the banks of the Tiber, slew himself with a sword before he was arrested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Only soldiers to follow the car were lacking; otherwise the triumph was splendid both as a spectacle and for the exploits it commemorated.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The pleasure of this triumph was diminished by a sad message from Spain, that in a defeat at the hands of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the Lusitani in the country of the Bastetani near <pb id="p.429"/>the town of Lyco, six thousand of the Roman army<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note> under the command of Lucius Aemilius the proconsul had fallen and the rest had been driven in panic inside the rampart, had defended the camp with difficulty and had been led back like fugitives with forced marches into pacified territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This was the news from Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From Gaul, ambassadors from the people of Placentia and Cremona were introduced to the senate by Lucius Aurunculeius the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they complained of the shortage of colonists, some having been taken off by the fortunes of war, and some by disease, while others had left the colonies from reluctance to live with their Gallic neighbours, the senate decreed that Gaius Laelius the consul, if it should seem wise to him, should enrol six thousand families to be divided between these colonies and that Lucius Aurunculeius the praetor should create a board of three to conduct these colonists to their homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The board created consisted of Marcus Atilius Serranus, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, the son of Publius, and Lucius Valerius Tappo, the son of Lucius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not very long afterwards, since the time for the consular election was at hand, Gaius Laelius the consul returned from Gaul to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He not only enrolled, in accordance with the decree of the senate passed in his absence, colonists as reinforcements for Cremona and Placentia, but he also moved that two new colonies should be established in the country which had belonged to the Boii, and on his proposal the Fathers so voted.</p> 
				<p>At the same time a despatch from Lucius Aemilius the praetor arrived, announcing the naval battle fought off Myonnesus and the fact that Lucius <pb id="p.431"/>Scipio the consul had transferred his army to Asia.<note type="margin">B.C. 190</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By reason of the naval victory a period of prayer for one day was proclaimed and a second day was added because a Roman army had then for the first time encamped in Asia, in order that this event might turn out prosperously and successfully. The consul was directed to sacrifice twenty full-grown victims on each day of the period of supplication.</p> 
				<p>Then the consular elections were held with active rivalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was a candidate amid universal disapproval because he had left his province of Sicily to conduct his campaign without a vote of the senate authorizing him to do so. The candidates with him were Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, Gnaeus Manlius Volso, and Marcus Valerius Messalla. Fulvius was the only consul elected, since the others did not win the necessary number of 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>centuries,<note>
						<p>An election required the votes of a majority of the centuries for each candidate, and Fulvius alone had a majority, the other votes being split in such a way that no one else had a sufficient number.</p> 
						<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Livy's account of the subsequent procedure is badly confused, and evidence with which to revise it is lacking. The first question is the date of the election of Fulvius. He could have presided at the election of his colleague only if he had himself been chosen on the last day of the preceding official year. The colloquialisms <hi rend="italics">deiecto</hi> and <hi rend="italics">iacuit</hi> and the technical
							<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> phrase <hi rend="italics">collegam dixit</hi> indicate that a second election was held and that Fulvius did not co-opt his colleague, and the last indicates that Fulvius presided at that election. On the other hand, the consuls and praetors were apparently inaugurated together as usual, and in that case Fulvius could not have been elected on the last day of one year and Manlius on the first day of the next. Livy has probably erroneously reconstructed the event from contradictory and ambiguous sources.</p></note> and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> he on the following day announced the choice of Gnaeus Manlius as his colleague, Lepidus being defeated &mdash;for Messalla had no chance<note>Livy's use of <hi rend="italics">iacuit</hi> is an echo of the political slang of his own day.</note> Then the praetors were chosen; two named Quintus Fabius, Labeo and Pictor &mdash;Pictor had been installed as priest of Quirinus that year, Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus, Spurius Postumius Albinus, Lucius Plautius Hypsaeus, Lucius Baebius Dives.</p> <pb id="p.433"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the consulship of Marcus Fulvius<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> Nobilior and Gnaeus Manlius Volso, Valerius Antias records that a rumour was generally circulated in Rome and taken as almost certain that, for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> purpose of recovering the young Scipio, the consul Lucius Scipio
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> and with him Publius Africanus had been invited to a conference with the king and had been arrested, and that after the capture of their generals the army had been led against the Roman camp, that this had been captured and all the Roman forces destroyed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that for this reason the Aetolians had taken heart and refused to obey orders and their chiefs had gone to Macedonia and the Dardanians and to Thrace to secure auxiliaries for hire and that
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Aulus Terentius and Marcus Claudius Lepidus had been sent to bring this report by Aulus Cornelius the propraetor in Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It added a further item to the story that the Aetolian ambassadors among other things were also asked in the senate, from what sources they had learned that the Roman commanders in Asia had been taken prisoners by King Antiochus and the army wiped out; that the Aetolians replied that they had been informed by their ambassadors who had been with the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Because I have no other authority for this story the rumour, in my judgment, should not have been given credence nor yet dismissed as without foundation.<note>The meaning of this sentence is obscure. The assumption that it is a criticism of the historiography of Antias is contradicted by the first clause, and Livy, of course, was aware that the story was untrue.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Aetolian ambassadors, when introduced to the senate, although both their own interests and their situation urged them by confessing their fault or their mistake, whichever one chooses to call it, to supplicate for
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> pardon, began by reciting their services to the Roman people, and almost <pb id="p.435"/>belligerently lauded their own valour in the war with Philip<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> and offended men's ears by their insolent language and, by recalling
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> old and forgotten incidents, brought things to such a pass, that the memory of the misdeeds of that people, far more numerous than their services, filled the minds of the Fathers, and that men whose need was for mercy roused only anger and hatred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On being questioned by one senator whether they would leave the decision regarding themselves to the Roman people, and then by another whether they would agree to have the same friends and enemies as the Roman people,<note>These are the alternatives of i. 5 above.</note> and making no reply to the questions, they were ordered to leave the temple.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The shout went up from almost the entire senate that the Aetolians still belonged entirely to Antiochus and that their thoughts turned on this one hope; and so the war should go on with them, as beyond doubt enemies, and their haughty spirits should be well broken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This circumstance too inflamed their minds, that at the very time when they were asking peace of the Romans they were invading Dolopia and Athamania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A decree of the senate was passed on the motion of Manius Acilius, the man who had conquered Antiochus and the Aetolians, that the Aetolians should be ordered to leave the City that day and Italy within fifteen days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Aulus Terentius Varro was delegated to safeguard their journey, and formal notice was served that if any embassy thereafter from the Aetolians came to Rome except with the consent of the commander who held that province and accompanied by a Roman commissioner, they would treat all its members as enemies. In this fashion the Aetolians were dismissed.</p> <pb id="p.437"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the question of the provinces was brought<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> up by the consuls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> it was decided that they should draw lots for Aetolia and Asia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the one to whom Asia was allotted should be assigned the army which Lucius Scipio had, and as reinforcement for it four thousand Roman infantry and two hundred cavalry, and of the allies of the Latin confederacy eight thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry; with these forces he was to conduct the war against Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To the other consul the army which was in Aetolia was decreed, and he was authorized to enlist as reinforcements the same number of citizens and allies as his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The same consul, moreover, was directed to fit out and take with him the ships which had been built the year before;<note>Cf. iv. 5 above.</note> and not to wage war with the Aetolians alone, but also to cross to the island of Cephallania.<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxxi. 10 and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The same consul was instructed, if he could do so advantageously to the state, to come to Rome for the elections; for, apart from the fact that the new annual magistrates were to be chosen, it was their pleasure to elect censors also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If anything detained him, he should inform the senate that he could not be present at the time of the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Aetolia fell to Marcus Fulvius, Asia to Gnaeus Manlius, as a result of the drawing. The praetors then drew lots, and Spurius Postumius Albinus received the civil jurisdiction and that between citizens and aliens, Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus Sicily, Quintus Fabius Pictor, the priest of Quirinus, Sardinia, Quintus Fabius Labeo the fleet, Lucius Plautius Hypsaeus Nearer Spain, Lucius Baebius Dives Farther Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For Sicily one legion and the fleet which was in the province were decreed; and the <pb id="p.439"/>new praetor was ordered to levy two tithes of grain on<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> the Sicilians; one of them he should send to Asia, the other to Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The same was also ordered to be exacted from the Sardinians and the corn shipped to the same armies as that from Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To Lucius Baebius as replacements for service in Spain were given one thousand Roman infantry and fifty cavalry and six thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry of the Latin confederacy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> to Plautius Hypsaeus for Nearer Spain were assigned one thousand Roman infantry<note>Probably a phrase concerning Roman cavalry has been lost.</note> and of the allies of the Latin confederacy two thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry; with these additions the two Spains would have one legion each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As for the magistrates of the year before, prorogation of the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> for one year was ordered for Gaius Laelius with his army; the same was done for Publius Junius, propraetor in Etruria, with the army which was in the province, and for Marcus Tuccius, propraetor among the Brutti and in Apulia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the praetors went to their provinces there was a dispute between Publius Licinius the pontifex maximus and Quintus Fabius Pictor the priest of Quirinus, such as within the memory of our fathers arose between Lucius Metellus and Postumius Albinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When that consul was setting out with his colleague Gaius Lutatius to Sicily and the fleet, Metellus the pontifex maximus had detained him for the religious ceremonies; this praetor was prevented from going to Sardinia by Publius Licinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both in the senate and before the assembly the quarrel was carried on with great vigour, and orders were issued on
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> both sides and guarantees taken and fines imposed and tribunes applied to and appeals <pb id="p.441"/>presented to the assembly.<note>Livy's account of this affair is more vivid than accurate. The phrase <hi rend="italics">ultro citroque</hi> probably belongs to all the verbs that follow, which describe various aspects of procedure under the <hi rend="italics">ius civile; pignera capta</hi> refers to the giving of bonds for appearance in court, while the other items are regular legal consequences. The praetor exercises jurisdiction by virtue of his <hi rend="italics">imperium,</hi> the pontifex by virtue of his right to supervise and if necessary to coerce priests of lower rank. In case of a judgment the right of appeal to the assembly (<hi rend="italics">provocatio</hi>) existed.</note> The religious argument<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> finally prevailed; the priest was ordered<note>This order came presumably from the assembly when the appeals were laid before it. The remission of the fine is clearly its work.</note> to obey the pontifex, and by command of the people the fine was remitted to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When, in anger at being deprived of his province,<note>A provincial command required absence from Rome and was thus incompatible with religious duties. Since resignation was not provided for in the constitutional system, the senate found employment in Rome for Fabius by reestablishing the two judicial <hi rend="italics">provinciae.</hi></note> he tried to resign his office,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the Fathers by their influence prevented him and decreed that he should exercise jurisdiction between citizens and aliens. The levies being then completed within a few days &mdash;for not many soldiers were to be enrolled &mdash;the consuls and praetors departed to their provinces.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Then there was a rumour idly circulated with no definite authority about events in Asia, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> a few days later trustworthy messengers and the despatches of the consul reached Rome, which did not so much bring joy after recent fear &mdash;for they had ceased to fear the king after his defeat in Aetolia &mdash;as
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> on account of his former reputation, since, when they entered upon the war he seemed a dangerous adversary, partly because of his own resources and partly because he had Hannibal as his director of operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless, they decreed that there should be neither any change in the plan to send the consul to Asia nor any diminution in his forces, for fear that he would be compelled to fight with the Gauls.<note>Livy means the Galatians, who had sent troops to aid Antiochus (xv. 5, etc. above).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not much later Marcus Aurelius Cotta, <pb id="p.443"/>representing Lucius Scipio, came with the ambassadors<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> of King Antiochus, and King Eumenes and the Rhodians arrived in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Cotta first in the senate and then before the assembly by order of the senate described what had occurred in Asia. A period of thanksgiving was then proclaimed for three days and forty full-grown victims were ordered sacrificed. Then first of all Eumenes was granted an audience by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had briefly thanked the Fathers because they had rescued him and his brother from siege and saved his kingdom from the violence of Antiochus, and then congratulated them because success had attended their efforts on land and sea and because they had driven
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> King Antiochus, defeated, routed and stripped of his camp, first out of Europe and then out of Asia on this side of the Taurus mountains, he said next that he preferred that they should hear of his own services from their own commanders and legates than from his relation of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All applauded this, and bade him lay aside his modesty in this respect and say himself what he thought should properly be given him by the senate and the Roman people:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the senate, they said, would act with greater readiness and greater generosity, if it were possible, in accordance with his merits;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to this the king replied that if a choice of rewards were offered him by others, he would have been glad, if only the privilege of consulting the Roman senate were granted him, to enjoy the advice of that most distinguished body, that he might not seem either to have conceived immoderate ambitions or to have stated them with too little restraint;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but in fact, since they themselves were planning to give something to him, so much the more should <pb id="p.445"/>their generosity to him and his brothers be controlled<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> by their own judgment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Fathers were not deterred by these words from urging him to speak, and when the argument had continued for some time between generosity on one side and modesty on the other, between men who were leaving the decision to one another with a suavity not more equal in both than difficult to modify, Eumenes left the temple.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The senate remained unaltered in the same determination, to the point of saying that it seemed unreasonable that the king should not know with what hopes and aspirations he had come; he himself knew best what was suitable for his kingdom; he was far better acquainted with Asia than the senate; he should therefore be recalled and compelled to say what he wished and what were his opinions.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The king was therefore brought back into the temple by the praetor, and, being ordered to speak, began thus: <quote>I should have continued, conscript Fathers, in my silence, did I not know that you would presently summon the embassy of the Rhodians and that after they were heard it would be necessary for me to speak.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This discussion, indeed, will be the more difficult because these demands of theirs will be such that they will not only seem to ask nothing which is against my interests, but not even seem to ask for what is particularly their concern.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For they will plead the cause of the Greek cities, and will say that they should be set free. If this is granted, who doubts that they will deprive us not merely of the states that are to be liberated but of our ancient tributaries<note>This point is a trifle embarrassing, since Rome had denied to Antiochus the right to recover cities that had once been free: cf. XXXV. xvi. 10-11. Rome now begins to see some of the pitfalls which confront her in the east.</note> as well, while they themselves will
						<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> have nominally, indeed, allies, <pb id="p.447"/>bound to them by so great a service, but in reality<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> subject to their dominion and dependent upon it?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And &mdash;heaven help us! &mdash;while they have their eyes fixed on such power, they will pretend that this is no concern of theirs; they will say only that this is suitable conduct for you and consistent with what you have done in the past.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That you shall not be entrapped by such reasoning must be your own care, and not only that you shall not unduly hold down some of your allies inequitably and raise up others beyond proper limits, but also that those who have borne arms against you shall not be in better case than your allies and friends.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So far as I am concerned, I should prefer to seem, in other respects, to have yielded something to anyone, though it was within the limits of my rights, than to have struggled too stubbornly to maintain it; but in a contest of friendship towards you, of goodwill towards you, of respect which is due you, I cannot willingly be overcome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This is the greatest inheritance I have received from my father, who first<note>Cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> which you waged in Greece, and he aided you with military and naval forces and all manner of supplies, so that none of your allies can be ranked on an equality with him in any respect; last of all, while he was urging the Boeotians to join your alliance, collapsing<note>Literally, fainting; cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> I took part in all the naval battles which were fought in many places; I never spared either my toil or my peril. The most wretched fate in war, siege, I suffered, shut up in Pergamum, to the extreme peril at once of life and throne.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Then, freed from siege, when Antiochus on one side, Seleucus on the other, had their camps around the citadel of my kingdom, I let my own affairs go and with my whole fleet met Lucius Scipio at the Hellespont to aid him in transporting his army across.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> After your army arrived in Asia, I never left the consul; no Roman soldier was more constantly in your camp than I and my brothers; no raid, no cavalry engagement, took place without <pb id="p.451"/>me; I stood in the battle-line and defended that<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> sector in which the consul wished me to be.
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> I shall not, conscript Fathers, ask: Who can be compared with me in his services in this war? I should not venture to compare myself with anyone, either people or king, whom you hold in great honour.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Masinissa was your enemy before he was your ally, nor was it while his kingdom was uninjured and he could bring his own troops to your help, but when he was an exile, banished, with all his resources gone, that he fled with one troop of cavalry to your camp;
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> nevertheless, because he stood loyally and steadfastly with you in Africa against Syphax and the Carthaginians, you not only restored him to his paternal kingdom but, bestowing upon him the richest part of the realm of Syphax, you made him pre-eminent among the kings of Africa.
						<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Of what reward and honour, pray, are we then worthy in your sight, who have never been your enemies, always your allies?
						<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> My father, myself, my brothers, not in Asia alone, but far from home, in the Peloponnesus, in Boeotia, in Aetolia, in the wars with Philip, with Antiochus, with the Aetolians, on land and sea, have borne arms in your cause. But someone may say,' What then do you ask?'
						<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> As to that, conscript Fathers, (since I must in any case obey your wish that I should speak) if you expelled Antiochus beyond the heights of Taurus with the intention of yourselves holding those lands, there are no neighbours or settlers whom I prefer to you, nor do I expect that my kingdom will be safer or more enduring under any other circumstances;
						<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> but if it is your purpose to retire and withdraw your armies from there, I should dare to say that no one of <pb id="p.453"/>your allies is more worthy than I to hold what you<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> have won in war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> But there will be protests because it is a fine thing to liberate enslaved cities. Such is my opinion, if they have committed no hostile acts against you; but if they were of Antiochus' party, how much more worthy of your wisdom and justice is it to have regard for well-deserving allies than for

The chief of their embassy, after setting forth the origins of their friendship with the Roman people and the services of the Rhodians, first in the war with Philip
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and later in the war with Antiochus, continued thus:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>Nothing in all our pleading, conscript Fathers, is so difficult for us or so painful as the fact that our difference of opinion is with Eumenes, with whom alone of kings and in preference to all others, both individuals of our community privately and, what moves us more, our state publicly, is in relations of hospitality.<note><hi rend="italics">Hospitium</hi> was a relationship entered into usually by individuals with one another, but sometimes by individuals with communities or communities with communities, in which each party owed the other certain services.

						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Yet, however that may be, the fact is rather that it is our respect for the king which stands in our way than that the question itself is either involved for us or likely, as it seems, to cause you any hesitancy in deciding.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For if in no other way could honour be paid an allied and friendly king and one who had rendered good service in this very war, about whose compensation there was debate, than by your giving free cities into servitude to him, the
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> discussion would be of doubtful issue, lest you either send away a friendly king without his meed of honour or depart from your tradition and stain the glory won in the war with Philip by now enslaving so many cities;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but from this necessity of either diminishing your recompense to a friend or detracting from your own fame, fortune offers you a splendid escape.

						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For the sake of standing and fame in the eyes of the whole world, which for long now has regarded your name and empire as next after those of the immortal gods, you have waged your wars.

The speech in Livy seems skilfully constructed, with its shrewd emphasis upon the original policy of the Romans (cf. the note to liii. 28 above), its artful playing upon Roman sympathies in the eulogy of Greek culture and the clever suppression of Rhodian ambitions, in sharp contrast with the method of Eumenes. We note too that while Eumenes took into account the possibility that the Romans would remain permanently in Asia, the Rhodians take it for granted that this will not be the case.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the Rhodians the ambassadors of Antiochus were summoned. In the usual fashion of envoys begging for mercy, they confessed the wrongdoing of the king and implored the conscript Fathers,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> in arriving at a decision, to pay regard to their own clemency rather than to the error of the king, who had paid a sufficient and more than sufficient penalty; finally, they requested that they would ratify by their authority the peace proposed by Lucius Scipio the commander, on the terms which he had stated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And the senate voted that this treaty of peace should be ratified, and a few days later the assembly so ordered. The treaty was struck on the Capitoline with Antipater the chief of the embassy and likewise the son of the brother of King Antiochus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then other embassies also from Asia were heard.<note>In addition to the major parties interested in the settlement, Antiochus, Eumenes and the Rhodians, there were apparently many other cities and states which neither Polybius nor Livy finds it necessary to mention by name, but whose claims had to be considered. One can easily imagine that the senate would feel somewhat bewildered, since war and victory had previously been simple problems in their experience.</note> To all these the same reply was given, that the senate, in the fashion of their forefathers, would send ten commissioners to adjudge cases arising in Asia <pb id="p.463"/>and to settle differences;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> yet the general principle<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> followed would be this, that on this side of the Taurus mountains the districts which had been within the boundaries of the kingdom of Antiochus should be assigned to Eumenes with the exception of Lycia and Caria as far as the Meander river;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that these should be given to the Rhodian state; that the other cities of Asia which had paid tribute to Attalus should also be tributaries to Eumenes; that those which had been vassals of Antiochus should be independent and free from tribute.<note>The terms of the final settlement, conforming in general to the principle here stated, are given in XXXVIII. xxxviii. It is obvious that an effort has been made to satisfy both Eumenes and the Rhodians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They chose these ten commissioners: Quintus Minucius Rufus, Lucius Furius Purpurio, Quintus Minucius Thermus, Appius Claudius Nero, Gnaeus Cornelius Merula, Marcus Junius Brutus, Lucius Aurunculeius, Lucius Aemilius Paulus, Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Publius Aelius Tubero.<note>The first three of these had been consuls. If the otherwise unknown Cn. Cornelius Merula is a mistake for Cn. Corn. Merenda, all the others had been praetors. In contrast to the habit of including former commanders in commissions sent to Greece, the Scipios and Acilius are &mdash;rather pointedly perhaps &mdash;omitted, as is Flamininus. The return of Paulus from Spain has not been mentioned before, and his name may have been added later as a concession to the Scipionic party. The commission is then undistinguished for either reputation or demonstrated capacity, though I hesitate to say that this was deliberate.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In matters pertaining to any discussion to be conducted on the spot, they were given a free hand; as to the chief issue involved, the senate made the decision.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> All Lycaonia and both Phrygias and Mysia, which King Prusias had taken from him, were restored to the king, as well as the Milyae<note>Livy uses the name of the people for the name of the district.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Telmessus also and the camp of the Telmessii, except the land which had belonged to Ptolemy of Telmessus.<note>He was probably in some way related to the Ptolemies of Egypt, and the special treatment given this district may be due to the fact that it was regarded as their property.</note> All these places which have been written down above were given to King Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Rhodians were given Lycia except the same Telmessus and the camp of the Telmessii and the land which had belonged to Ptolemy of Telmessus; this district was made an exception in the case of both Eumenes and the Rhodians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Also that part of Caria which is nearer to the island of Rhodes across the Meander river was given to them, and the towns, villages, forts and lands which face Pisidia except those of the towns which had been free the day before the battle had been fought with King Antiochus in Asia.<note>These dispositions imply some minute geographical knowledge of Asia Minor, and one wonders how the Romans acquired it. The presumable sources, in the absence of large-scale and accurate maps, were the ambassadors from the Asiatic states and possibly Cotta. The distinction of towns free on the day of and the day before the battle is hard to explain, but is obviously some kind of compromise, possibly suggested by the Rhodians.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the Rhodians had expressed their thanks for all this, they thus spoke regarding the city of Soli, which is in Cilicia: they also, like themselves, were sprung from Argos; by reason of this kinship there was a fraternal affection between them; they asked this exceptional favour, that they might rescue this city from slavery to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The ambassadors of King Antiochus were summoned, and the question was taken up with them but was not settled, <pb id="p.467"/>Antipater citing the treaty<note>The phraseology of the treaty had reference to the western end of the Taurus range, where it approaches the sea in Cilicia. Soli was beyond this point, and any assumption by the Romans of the right to dispose of the city would be a violation of the treaty even before it was concluded.</note> in opposition to what<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> the Rhodians had said, to the effect that not Soli but Cilicia was their object, and that they were crossing the ridges of Taurus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Rhodians were recalled to the senate, and when they had explained how forcibly the king's ambassador had argued, they went on to say that if the Rhodians believed that this matter absolutely concerned their national honour, the senate would in every way overcome the resistance of the ambassadors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then indeed the Rhodians thanked them more lavishly than before, and said that they would rather yield to the stubbornness of Antipater than offer any reason for disturbing the settlement. So no change was made with respect to Soli.<note>Justice seems to have been entirely on the side of Antiochus in this instance.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the period in which this took place, ambassadors from the Massilienses reported that Lucius Baebius the praetor, who was on his way to Spain, had been surrounded

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate, on receiving this news, voted that Publius Junius Brutus, who was propraetor in Etruria, should turn over his province and army to whichever of his lieutenants he saw fit, that he himself should set out for Farther Spain and that this should be his province.

It would seem then that the accusation in this case was based on political rather than moral grounds and that it was arranged to keep Acilius out of the race for the censorship.</note> Conflicting evidence was given by his lieutenants and military tribunes. Marcus Cato was conspicuous as a witness before the rest; but the honour gained in the whole course of his life was diminished by his candidate's dress.<note>A <hi rend="italics">candidatus</hi> was so called because he appeared during a campaign wearing a <hi rend="italics">toga candida.</hi> Cato's testimony was partially discredited because the conviction of Acilius would improve Cato's own chances of election.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In his testimony he said that vessels of gold and silver which he had seen in the captured camp along with the rest of the royal booty he had not seen in the triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Finally, in order chiefly to make Cato unpopular, Glabrio said that he would drop his candidature, since, while the nobles

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were some who tried to make out that that war had been magnified by rumour beyond its actual difficulty: that it had been brought to a conclusion by a single noteworthy battle, and <pb id="p.475"/>that the glory of that victory had been robbed<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> of distinction beforehand at Thermopylae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But to one who judges aright the battle at Thermopylae was with the Aetolians rather than the king; for with what part of his own forces had the king fought there?<note>It is difficult to form an intelligent opinion from Livy as to this question.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time both the consul Gnaeus Manlius arrived in Asia and the praetor Quintus Fabius Labeo came to the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Now a cause for war upon the Galatians was not lacking to the consul. The sea was peaceful after the defeat of Antiochus, and as Fabius reflected as to what occupation he should choose by preference, lest he have a year of idleness in office, it seemed best to cross to the island of Crete.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The people of Cydonia were waging war on the Gortynians and Gnosians, and a great number of prisoners, both Romans and men of the Italian race, were said to be in slavery throughout the whole island.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Setting out with the fleet from Ephesus, as soon as he landed on the Cretan coast, he sent messengers around to the cities to tell them that they should lay down their arms and should restore the prisoners, gathered up by each in his own city and lands, and should send ambassadors to him to treat of matters which concerned equally the Cretans and the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Cretans did not <pb id="p.479"/>pay much attention to this: none of them restored<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> the prisoners except the Gortynians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Valerius Antias wrote that four thousand prisoners were given back from the whole island because they feared the threat of war; and. that this was the explanation of the fact that Fabius, although he had done nothing else, received a naval triumph from the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Crete Fabius returned to Ephesus; thence he sent three ships to the coast of Thrace and ordered the garrisons of Antiochus withdrawn from Aenos and Maronea, that these states might be at liberty.<note>These cities seem to have been overlooked before, possibly because the withdrawal of Antiochus from Lysimachia was a <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> abandonment of his territorial claims in Europe.</note></p>

				<p>Lucius Cornelius Scipio the consul, with his brother
					Scipio Africanus as his lieutenant (Africanus had said that
					he would be his brother's lieutenant if the province of
					Greece were assigned to him, although it seemed that
					that province would be given to Gaius Laelius, who was
					very influential in the senate), started out to conduct the
					war against King Antiochus, and was the first of all Roman
					generals to cross to Asia. Regillus fought successfully
					with the royal fleet of Antiochus off Myonnesus, with the
					aid of the Rhodians. The son of Africanus was captured
					by Antiochus and restored to his father. When Antiochus
					had been conquered by Lucius Cornelius Scipio, with the
					assistance of Eumenes, son of Attalus and king of Pergamum, peace was granted him under this condition, that
					he should withdraw from all the districts on this side of
					the Taurus mountains. Lucius Cornelius Scipio, who had
					finished the war with Antiochus, was put on a level with
					his brother by the surname of <quote>Asiaticus.</quote> A colony
					was established at Bononia. Eumenes, by whose aid
					Antiochus had been defeated, had his kingdom enlarged.
					To the Rhodians too, who had also co-operated, certain
					cities were granted. Aemilius Regillus, who had defeated
					the prefects of Antiochus in a naval battle, celebrated a
					naval triumph. Manius Acilius Glabrio triumphed over
					Antiochus, whom he had driven out of Greece, and over
					the Aetolians.</p>
