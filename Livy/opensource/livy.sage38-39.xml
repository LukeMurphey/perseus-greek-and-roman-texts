					<p>Professor Evan T. Sage, the editor of this and the
						two preceding volumes of the Loeb edition of Livy,
						died in the Barnes Hospital, Saint Louis, after a
						severe surgical operation, on May 30, 1936. He was
						entering upon his fifty-sixth year, having been born
						May 16, 1881. A native of Nebraska, his undergraduate studies were pursued at the University of
						Nebraska, from which he received his first degree.
						He then entered the University of Chicago, which
						conferred upon him in 1906 the degree of Doctor of
						Philosophy. After teaching in the State Universities of Idaho and Washington he was called to the
						University of Pittsburgh in 1913. There he worked
						with marked success, both as a teacher of Latin and
						as the directing head of the Department of Classics.</p>
					<p>Professor Sage's scholarly pursuits lay in two distinct and unrelated fields&mdash;history, particularly the
						constitutional and political history of the last two
						centuries of Republican Rome, and palaeography and
						textual criticism, these centring about Petronius.
						He had personally collated most of the manuscripts
						of this author and had acquired during several
						periods of investigation in the libraries of Europe
						not only a large apparatus for reconstituting the text
						of Petronius but also an intimate knowledge of the
						habits and methods of work of the classical scholars
						of the Renaissance.</p>
					<pb n="viii"/>
					<p>Before his death Professor Sage had read all the
						proofs of the present volume at least once; he had
						also prepared the critical notes and a considerable
						portion of the translation of the rest of Livy from
						Book XL on. It will be the task of another editor
						to fill in the gap between Volume V, where Professor
						Foster left off, and Vol. IX, where Professor Sage
						began.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
					<p>THIS preface should be brief. The Books contained
						in Volume XI deal with minor matters, and Livy
						feels himself more at leisure, so that he can include
						anecdotes and digressions. Another possible consequence is that Livy, having less of moment to
						relate, felt able to examine details more closely and
						to compare his sources more consciously. This may
						be the explanation of the appearance here of the one
						serious bit of historical criticism to be found in Livy
						(XXXIX. lii).</p>
					<p>The textual problem grows more serious in this
						Volume. Our best MS., <hi rend="italics">B,</hi> now breaks off with <hi rend="italics">inci</hi>
						(XXXVIII. xlvi. 4). The major difference between my
						text and that of the latest revision of Weissenborn-
						M&uuml;ller is that I have occasionally restored readings
						of <hi rend="italics">B,</hi> and I believe that careful examination will
						reveal more readings which should be received into
						the text. But there are many indications that the
						consensus of the minor MSS. is of almost equal
						value, although we lack the precision of information
						that is necessary before accepting this as a principle
						of textual criticism in the case of Livy. It would
						be fortunate if this were so. But the individual
						minor MSS. do not always agree among themselves,
						and I have usually accepted and reported as the
						reading of <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> the reading of the majority of the MSS.,
						<pb n="x"/>
						so far as I could determine it from the reports
						accessible to me. In this part of the text I have
						preferred readings of <hi rend="italics">M,</hi> where reported, and have
						restored some without remark. A more difficult
						question is the relative authority of certain sixteenthcentury editions which are presumably based, at
						least in part, on M and possibly on the lost <hi rend="italics">S</hi>(<hi rend="italics">pirensis</hi>).
						The frequent references of Gelenius to <quote>antiqua
							scriptura,</quote> <quote>archetypa,</quote> <quote>ex archetypis,</quote> <quote>vetusti
								codices</quote> and the like are exasperating in their
						suggestion of buried treasures which seem the more
						valuable as they are at present lost to us. In practice I have followed M where it was reported, <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign>
						when there was no report of M, and have furnished
						critical notes on passages where <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> was preferred to
						<hi rend="italics">M</hi> or the sixteenth-century editions or later
						conjectures were preferred to <hi rend="italics">M</hi><foreign lang="greek">s.</foreign></p>
					<p>My obligations as to index, maps, incidental
						assistance, and editorial aid and encouragement are
						unchanged. No repetition of details would prove
						an adequate expression of my debts.</p>
					<p>New bibliography is covered in the notes, which
						I have tried to make useful from the historical
						standpoint, as before, and from the literary stand-point as well.

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Introductory Note</head>
					<p>BY the year <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> a Roman optimist (if such an
						one existed) might well have said that Rome's eastern
						difficulties were over: Philip had been reduced to
						impotence by Flamininus; the Aetolians had been
						severely punished; now Antiochus had been
						eliminated as a factor in Asian politics by Scipio.
						The only other eastern powers demanding consideration, Egypt, Pergamum and Rhodes, were
						Rome's allies and the last two were deeply in Rome's
						debt by reason of the projected settlement of Asia.
						Yet at the same moment a Roman pessimist might
						have argued just as insistently that her troubles in
						the east were just beginning. Asia, he would have
						admitted, presented no threatening problem. Philip
						had been allowed to regain some of his lost Greek
						possessions as compensation for his assistance
						against the Aetolians and Antiochus. The Aetolians
						had been defeated but not crushed completely, and
						their fundamental grievance, that they had been
						ill-treated after the victory over Philip, had not been
						removed. Perhaps most serious of all was the fact
						that Rome had no real base of operations east of
						the Adriatic: this was a theoretically laudable, but
						practically unfortunate, consequence of her desire to
						avoid assuming territorial responsibilities in the east.</p>
					<p>Within Europe there were numerous situations
						<pb n="xii"/>
						any one of which might provoke a war. In the
						Peloponnesus there was the Achaean&mdash;Lacedaemonian problem, since Rome had never pronounced
						judgment on the Achaean policy after the murder
						of Nabis. In the north there was the constant
						hostility of the Aetolians, rendered for the moment
						more serious because of the recent Macedonian
						expansion. These were only the most apparent
						dangers. Whether Rome honestly believed that a
						conquered nation could remain conquered and submissive after the withdrawal of Roman troops is a
						question which we are unable to answer; whether
						she honestly believed that the Greek states were
						capable, at this time, of self-government is also a
						question to which there is no answer. I fear that
						Roman generals, ambitious for triumphs and material
						rewards, were quite willing to defer as long as
						possible a definitive settlement in Greece for the
						sake of the fairly easy victories that were promised.</p>
					<p>In Asia, the withdrawal of Antiochus left a multitude of unsolved problems, and the solution of some
						of these soon appeared to be exceedingly profitable
						undertakings: the Galatian campaign will serve as
						a sufficient example.</p>
					<p>Another solution of the eastern problem might
						have been the enlargement of some one state, bound
						firmly by ties of alliance and dependence to Rome,
						which could have dominated the eastern Mediterranean and by virtue of her military superiority
						have maintained peace there. If Rome looked for
						such a state she failed to find one that could be so
						enlarged and could still be trusted. There was
						nothing left for Rome, apart from the cynically
						brutal course of allowing the eastern states to
						<pb n="xiii"/>
						destroy one another, except to assume the informal
						protectorate which she does insensibly assume in
						the years covered by this Volume.</p>
					<p>There seems little doubt that public sentiment
						would have rejected such a settlement as a formal
						occupation of Greece and Asia had it been proposed
						in Rome. But, in addition to sincere differences of
						opinion among Romans, there was an almost
						unanimous sentiment, which seems to increase in
						strength, that in some form or other Roman control
						of the east was necessary. But so great was the
						Romans' faith in Roman power that they were inclined
						to cut through diplomatic and political red tape and
						announce decisions in a form so categorically brief
						as to be unintelligible to others who were not Romans.
						One suspects that the Romans talked in riddles so
						frequently because they were not themselves sure
						of what they meant. It was easier to let time decide
						the exact interpretation and to punish the unfortunates who had in the meantime misunderstood.</p>
					<p>The Books contained in this Volume record events
						of a period of transition. With no major enemy to
						confront her, Rome turns her attention to smaller
						problems. Little tasks are performed by little
						men, who strive through partisan politics to make
						themselves and their achievements seem great.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the war in Asia was in progress, there was<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> no peace in Aetolia either,<note>The events here described belong to the previous year.</note> the trouble having been begun by the Athamanian people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Athamania at that time, after the expulsion of Amynander,<note>Cf. XXXVI. xiv. 9.</note> was held by royal garrisons under the prefects of Philip, and they, by their arrogant and lawless administration, had created a longing for Amynander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Amynander, who was then an exile in Aetolia, was inspired by the letters of his partisans, who described to him the state of affairs in Athamania, with the hope of recovering his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His agents, too, sent with his reply to the chiefs at Argithea &mdash;for this is the capital of Athamania &mdash;announced that if he perceived clearly enough the sentiments of his countrymen he would obtain the aid of the Aetolians and proceed to Athamania. They said that he had no doubt that he would easily come to an agreement with the chosen persons<note>The <hi rend="italics">apocleti</hi> (XXXV. xxxiv. 2, etc.).</note> who comprise the council of the people and with the praetor Nicander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When <pb id="p.5"/>he learned that they were ready for any event,<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> he at once informed his friends on what day he would arrive in Athamania at the head of an army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first there were four who had conspired against the Macedonian garrison. Each of these chose six assistants to aid in carrying out their plan; then, lacking confidence by reason of their small number, which was better suited to concealment than to action, they added a number equal to that which they had first enlisted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their number having thus become two and fifty, they divided themselves into four sections; one proceeded to Heraclea, one to Tetraphylia, which was the usual storehouse of the royal wealth, the third to Theudoria, the fourth to Argithea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It had been agreed upon among them all that at first they should move about quietly in the market-place as if they were engaged in transacting private business; that on the appointed day they should summon the whole population to drive the Macedonian garrisons from the citadels.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When this day came and Amynander with a thousand Aetolians was at the frontiers, according to agreement the Macedonian garrisons were expelled from the four places at once, and a despatch was sent in all directions to the other towns, summoning them to free themselves from the headstrong rule of Philip and to return to their hereditary and lawful sovereign. On all sides the Macedonians were expelled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The town of Theium, since the despatch had been intercepted by Xeno, the prefect of the garrison, and the citadel had been seized by the king's troops, held out for a few days against the besiegers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> finally <pb id="p.7"/>it also was delivered to Amynander, and all Athamania<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> was in his hands except the fortress of Athenaeum, lying on the borders of Macedonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, on hearing of the revolt of Athamania, set out with six thousand troops and very quickly arrived at Gomphi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There he left the greater part of his men &mdash;for they would not have had strength enough for such hard marching &mdash;and with two thousand went on to Athenaeum, which alone had been held by his garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, when he had quickly learned, by trial of the neighbouring towns, that everything else was unfriendly, he returned to Gomphi and thence, with his whole force united, marched into Athamania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He ordered Xeno to go ahead with a thousand infantry to seize Aethopia, which was favourably situated to threaten Argithea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and when he saw that his men were in possession of the place, he himself encamped near the temple of Jupiter Acraeus. There he was detained for a day by a violent storm, and on the next day began his march toward Argithea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Suddenly as they were advancing the Athamanians appeared, hurrying towards the hills that commanded the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the first glimpse of them the advance guard halted and throughout the whole column there was terror and confusion, each for himself considering what would happen if the column were led down into the valleys lying at the foot of the cliffs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This panic compelled the king, who had wished, should his troops follow him, to get through the pass with a rush, to recall the van and retire by the same road by which he had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Athamanians at first followed quietly, keeping their distance; after the Aetolians joined them, they left them to harass the column from the <pb id="p.9"/>rear and threw themselves upon the flanks, while<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> some, going ahead over familiar trails by a shorter route, blocked the crossing;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and such great confusion was caused among the Macedonians that in the fashion of a disorderly rout rather than a march under discipline, leaving behind many weapons and men, they crossed the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This was the end of the pursuit. From that point the Macedonians returned safely to Gomphi and from Gomphi to Macedonia. The Athamanians and Aetolians came from all sides to Aethopia to destroy Xeno and his thousand Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Macedonians, distrusting the strength of the place, withdrew from Aethopia to a hill higher and steeper on every side;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> from this the Athamanians dislodged them, finding ways to scale it in several places, and as they scattered over pathless country and unfamiliar cliffs that offered no aid to flight, part were captured and part killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Many, panic-stricken, plunged over precipices; a very few with Xeno escaped to the king. Later a truce was made to give them an opportunity to bury their dead.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amynander, having recovered his kingdom, sent ambassadors both to the senate in Rome and to the Scipios in Asia, since they were tarrying in Ephesus after the decisive battle with Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He asked for peace and defended himself for having recovered his ancestral kingdom through the aid of the Aetolians;<note>Amynander recognizes the necessity of placating Rome even if he does not admit her virtual protectorate over Greece. His own diplomatic status was somewhat uncertain: he had allied himself with the Aetolians and Antiochus (XXXV. xlvii. 8), and for that reason the Romans had consented to Philip's conquest (XXXVI. xiv. 9). It may be assumed that the return of Amynander would automatically restore Athamania to the status of an Aetolian ally, and that Amynander is trying to escape the dangers of such a position.</note> he laid the blame on Philip.<note>These charges must have been based on the character of Philip's government after his conquest (i. 2 above), as no other plausible cause for finding fault with him is apparent.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><pb id="p.11"/>
				<p>From Athamania the Aetolians moved against<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> the Amphilochians, and with the consent of the majority brought the whole tribe under their authority and control.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Amphilochia having been recovered<note>Cf. XXXII. xxxiv. 4.</note> &mdash;for it had once belonged to the Aetolians &mdash;they proceeded with the same hope to Aperantia; this state also surrendered, in large measure without resistance. The Dolopians<note>For Philip's recent acquisition of Aperantia and Dolopia, cf. XXXVI. xxxiii. 7. In the latter case it was a re-conquest, since Dolopia had been freed from Macedonian control in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxxiv. 6).</note> had never been subjects of the Aetolians, but belonged to Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first they rushed to arms, but after they learned that the Amphilochians were with the Aetolians, that Philip had been driven from Athamania and his garrison destroyed, they too went over from Philip to the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having set up these buffer-states and believing that they were now safe from the Macedonians on all sides, the Aetolians received the news that Antiochus had been defeated in Asia by the Romans; and not long afterwards their envoys returned from Rome with no promise of peace,<note>The embassy had been expelled from Italy: cf. XXXVII. xlix. 5-7.</note> and brought word that the consul Fulvius with the army had already crossed.<note>The appointment of Fulvius to Aetolia was reported at XXXVII. i. 8.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Terrified by this information, first summoning embassies from Rhodes and Athens,<note>These two states were frequently appealed to as peacemakers; for Rhodes, cf. XXVII. xxx. 4; for Athens, cf. XXXVII. vi. 4, where her intervention for Aetolia the preceding year is recorded.</note> that through the influence of these states their own prayers, though previously rejected, might obtain easier access to the senate, they sent the leading men of the people to Rome to try the last hope of peace, having given no thought to the avoidance of war until the enemy was almost in sight.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Marcus Fulvius had by now transported his army to Apollonia and was consulting with the chiefs of <pb id="p.13"/>the Epirotes as to where to begin the campaign.<note>Livy here seems to think that there were no other Roman forces in Greece at this time, and in this he apparently has the support of Polybius (XXII. ix). However, in XXXVII. ii. 7-8 the propraetor Cornelius was instructed to conduct an army to Aetolia, and in XXXVII. i. 4 the presence of an army there was assumed. Livy has, as often, changed sources without warning. The account of the siege of Ambracia follows Polybius closely.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> The advice of the Epirotes was to attack Ambracia, which had at this time joined the Aetolians:<note>Ambracia had been the capital of Pyrrhus (cf. v. 2 and ix. 13 below), and had later become a member of the Aetolian League.</note> if, on the one hand, the Aetolians should come to defend it, there were open plains on which to
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> fight; if, on the other hand, they declined an engagement, the siege would not be
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> difficult; for there was both abundance of material close at hand for building mounds and raising other siege-works, and a navigable river, the Aretho, suitable for the transportation of the necessary supplies, flowed past the very walls, and, moreover, summer was at hand, a season adapted to active operations. By such arguments they induced him to lead the army through Epirus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consul arrived before Ambracia, the siege seemed to him to involve great toil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ambracia lay at the foot of a rugged hill; the natives call it Perranthes. The city, where the wall turns towards the plains and the river, looks west; the citadel, which is situated on the hill, faces east.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The river Aretho, rising in Athamania, empties into the gulf of the sea which is called <quote>the Ambracian</quote> from the name of the neighbouring city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In addition to the fact that the river on one side and the hills on the other defended the city, it was also protected by a strong wall, extending in circumference a little more than four miles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fulvius established two camps on the side of the plain, separated from one another by a moderate distance, and one redoubt on a high spot facing the citadel;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> all these he planned so to connect by means of a wall and ditch that no <pb id="p.15"/>egress from the city might be allowed the besieged<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> nor ingress from without to a relieving force. At the report of the siege of Ambracia the Aetolians had already assembled at Stratus in response to the edict of the praetor Nicander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It had been their first intention to march from there with their entire force to prevent the siege; then, when they saw that the city was already in large part hemmed in by siege-works, and that the camp of the Epirotes lay on level ground across the river, they decided to divide their forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Eupolemus with a thousand light-armed troops, setting out for Ambracia, entered the city through the fortifications which had not yet been joined together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It had been the original plan that Nicander, with the rest of the troops, should make a night attack on the camp of the Epirotes, which could not readily be aided by the Romans because the river was between them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> later, thinking that there was in the enterprise the danger that the Romans might somehow learn of it and he have no escape to a place of safety, he abandoned that design and turned aside to plunder Acarnania.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul had by now completed the fortifications by which the town had to be surrounded as well as the siege-engines which he was making ready to move up to the walls, and attacked the ramparts in five places at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Three of the assaults, equidistant from one another, the approach from the plain being easier, he directed against what they call the <quote>Pyrrheum,</quote><note>Probably the palace of Pyrrhus: see the last note.</note> one on the side of the temple of Aesculapius, one against the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was shaking the walls with battering-rams; he was pulling down the parapets with hooks fixed on poles.<note>The <hi rend="italics">falx muralis</hi> of Caesar (<hi rend="italics">B.G.</hi> III. xiv. 5). This detail, like those which follow, is derived directly from Polybius (XXII. x).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The citizens were at first stricken with terror <pb id="p.17"/>and confusion both at the sight and at the blows which<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> struck the walls with fearful din; then, when they saw the walls still standing, contrary to expectations, they recovered their courage and with the aid of cranes they dropped on the rams masses of lead or stone or stout logs;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> seizing the wall-hooks with grappling-irons they pulled them inside the walls and broke off the poles; besides, by sallies conducted both by night against the guards of the engines and by day against the outposts they did their part in spreading terror.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>While matters before Ambracia were in this state, the Aetolians had now returned to Stratus from the devastation of Acarnania. Then the praetor Nicander, conceiving the hope of raising the siege by a bold stroke, sent a certain Nicodamus with five hundred Aetolians into Ambracia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He appointed a certain night and even an hour of the night when both the troops from the city should attack the enemy's siege-works which faced the Pyrrheum and he himself should cause a panic in the Roman camp, thinking that something memorable could be accomplished by an attack from two directions and with night adding to the terror.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And Nicodamus, at dead of night, after eluding some pickets and forcing his way past others by a resolute attack, crossed one branch of the wall<note>This was probably a low rampart connecting two of the Roman strong points.</note> and entered the town thereby inspiring in the besieged no small degree of courage for any deed of daring and of hope, and as soon as the appointed night arrived, according to the agreement, he suddenly attacked the siege-works.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This venture was more serious in its purpose than in <pb id="p.19"/>its result, since no attack was made from outside,<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> whether because the Aetolian praetor was prevented by fear or because it
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> seemed better to assist the Amphilochians who had just been recovered and whom Perseus, the son of Philip, sent to regain control of Dolopia and the Amphilochians, was attacking with the greatest vigour.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There were Roman works, as has been said before, in three places facing the Pyrrheum, all of which the Aetolians attacked at once, but not with the same equipment or violence:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> some advanced with flaming torches, others carrying tow and pitch and firebrands, the whole battle-line gleaming with flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They cut down many of the guards at the first attack; then, when the shouting and the din were heard in the camp and the signal was given by the consul, the Romans seized their arms and from all the gates hastened to the rescue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The battle raged with steel and fire; in two places the Aetolians retired without accomplishing anything, after trying rather than actually beginning an engagement; the severe fighting had concentrated in one place. There in different quarters the two captains Eupolemus and Nicodamus were urging on the fighters and encouraging them with the almost certain hope that Nicander would soon be there according to agreement and would take the enemy in the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This assurance kept up for a considerable time the spirits of the fighters;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but when they received no signal from their comrades according to the agreement and they perceived that the number of the enemy was increasing, being thus left unsupported, they pressed on less vigorously;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> finally, abandoning their effort, their retreat being by now scarcely safe, they were driven back into the city <pb id="p.21"/>in flight, after they had burned part of the siege-works<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> and killed a considerably larger number of the enemy than they had themselves lost.<note>This use of <hi rend="italics">ab ipsis</hi> (which is itself an emendation) is somewhat unusual, but the interpretation here given seems to be required.</note> But if the plan had been carried out according to the agreement there was no doubt that in one place at least the works could have been taken with heavy loss to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Ambraciots and the Aetolians who were inside the city not only gave up their attempt for that night, but for the future too, feeling that they had been deserted by their friends, they were more reluctant to face dangers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Henceforth no one took part in sallies, as before, against the outguards of the enemy, but posting themselves along the walls and towers they fought in safety.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Perseus learned that the Aetolians were approaching, he abandoned the siege of the city he was investing and, merely plundering the fields, withdrew from Amphilochia and returned to Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Aetolians too were called away from there by the devastation of their sea-coast. Pleuratus,<note>Cf. XXXIII. xxxiv. 11.</note> the king of the Illyrians, sailed into the Corinthian gulf with sixty cruisers and joining the ships of the Achaeans which were at Patrae was laying waste the coast districts of Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A thousand Aetolians sent against them, wherever the fleet went, following the indentations of the shoreline, would travel by shorter routes and meet them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Also the Romans before Ambracia, by battering at the walls with rams, had to a great extent laid bare the town, but nevertheless could not force their way into it;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for with equal speed a new wall was thrown up to replace what had been destroyed and armed men, standing on the ruins, served as a fortification.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly, since visibly applied force was not <pb id="p.23"/>progressing well for the consul, he determined to dig<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> secretly a tunnel in a place formerly covered by his sheds, and for a considerable period, although the work was in progress day and night, not only the men digging beneath the ground but also those who were carrying out the earth went unnoticed by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Suddenly a rising mound of earth betrayed the work to the townspeople, and, fearing that the walls had already been undermined and a way opened into the city, they began to dig a ditch inside the wall in the direction of that work which had been covered by the sheds.<note>The apparent meaning is that the trench of the defenders ran at right angles to the assumed direction of the tunnel. Polybius (XXII. xi) describes the trench as parallel to the city-wall.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they came to a depth as great as the bottom of the tunnel could have, they remained silent, and placing their ears against the walls in several places they listened for the sound of the diggers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they heard this they opened a way straight into the tunnel, nor was this a difficult task; for in a moment they came into the open space where the enemy was supporting the roof on props.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The works joining there, as the way was open from the trench to the tunnel, they began to fight, at first with the same tools which they had used in the work, then quickly armed men too came up and engaged in a hidden battle underground; later this fighting became more desultory, since they blocked the tunnel wherever they wished, now with curtains<note>Literally, garments made of the hair of goats.</note> stretched across, now with hastily constructed doors.<note>Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>) says that both sides protected themselves with shields (<foreign lang="greek">qure/ous</foreign>), and it has been suggested that Livy confused this word with <foreign lang="greek">qu/ras,</foreign> <quote>doors.</quote></note> A new device as well, and one easy of execution, was thought out against the Romans who were in the tunnel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They prepared a cask pierced at the <pb id="p.25"/>bottom, where a pipe of moderate size could be<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> inserted, and likewise an iron pipe and an iron lid for the cask, this lid too being perforated in several places. This cask, filled with light feathers, they placed with its mouth facing the tunnel. They fixed in the holes in the lid the very long spears which they call <quote>sarisae,</quote> so as to keep the enemy at a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A light spark of flame, placed among the feathers, they fanned by blowing with a smith's bellows placed at the mouth of the pipe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then, since smoke, not merely abundant in quantity, but, even more, unendurable by reason of the vile stench from the burning feathers, had filled the whole tunnel, scarcely anyone was able to remain within it.<note>Livy for some reason omits certain picturesque details given by Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>), but otherwise follows him closely. Smoking out an enemy in mine-warfare was a recognized device (Aeneas Tacticus 37), but we need not consider this an example of the early use of chemicals for military purposes: cf. Lamer's review of Vatter, <quote>Giftgase und Gasschutz</quote> (Stuttgart, 1934), in <hi rend="italics">Phil. Woch.</hi> 55, 1935, 202-204.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While affairs were in this condition at Ambracia,<note>The embassy mentioned in XXXVII. xlix (cf. iii. 6 above) is ignored in the following account.</note> Phaeneas and Damoteles came to the consul as ambassadors from the Aetolians, with full power to act, by decree of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For their praetor, when he saw that on one side Ambracia was undergoing siege, that on another the sea-coast was endangered by the enemy's ships, that on a third the Amphilochians and Dolopia were being plundered by the Macedonians, and that the Aetolians, rushing here and there to three different wars at the same time, could not hold out, called a council and laid before the chiefs of Aetolia the question of what should be done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The opinions of all tended in this direction &mdash;that peace should be sought, on fair terms if possible, if not, on endurable terms: they argued that they had begun the war because of their reliance on Antiochus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> when Antiochus was beaten on land and sea and driven virtually beyond the bounds of the <pb id="p.27"/>earth, to the other side of the ridges of Taurus, what<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> hope was there of continuing the war?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Phaeneas and Damoteles, they said, should do what they judged consistent with the best interests of the Aetolians, considering the straits they were in, and with their own sense of loyalty; for what plan that they could adopt or what choice of action was left them by fortune?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The envoys, sent with these instructions, begged the consul to spare the city and to have compassion on a people, once his ally, now driven to the point of madness, they would not say by their wrongs but at least by their misfortunes;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the Aetolians had not deserved to suffer any ill fortune, by reason of the war with Antiochus, outweighing the good service which they had rendered previously when they had fought against Philip; neither had liberal gratitude been shown them then nor should excessive punishment be imposed upon them now. To this the consul replied that the Aetolians ever sought peace frequently rather than sincerely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In their plea for peace they should follow the example of Antiochus, whom they had enticed into the war; he had withdrawn not from a few towns about whose liberty there was a question, but from the whole rich land of Asia on this side of the Taurus mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He would not, he said, listen to the Aetolians treating for peace unless they were disarmed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> they must first turn over their weapons and all their horses, then pay a thousand talents of silver to the Roman people, of which sum half must be paid at once if they wanted to have peace. He would, besides, add this clause to the treaty &mdash;that they should regard as friends and enemies the same persons whom the Romans so regarded.<note>It should be noted that this discussion makes no progress towards peace. It was one of the stock grievances of the Aetolians that their services against Philip had been inadequately recognized and rewarded, and this position they still maintain. The final demands of Fulvius are repetitions of those made by Rome in the futile negotiations of <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. i. 5), although nothing had been said before about Aetolian disarmament as a condition of peace.</note></p> <pb id="p.29"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To these proposals, both because they were<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> severe and because the ambassadors knew that the tempers of their people were fierce and changeable, they made no reply but returned home, that they might again and again consult the praetor and the chiefs as to what was to be done while they were still uncommitted to a decision.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were received with abusive shouts, being asked how long they would drag things out, and were ordered to bring back any sort of peace whatsoever, but when they were returning to Ambracia they were caught in an ambush set beside the road by the Acarnanians, with whom they were at war, and were taken to Thyrreum for confinement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This caused a delay to the peace, although ambassadors of the Athenians and the Rhodians, who had come to intercede for them, were now with the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Amynander also, the king of the Athamanians, had come to the Roman camp under a safeguard, more concerned for the city of Ambracia, where he had spent the greater part of his exile, than for the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Being informed by them of the misfortune of the ambassadors, the consul ordered them to be brought from Thyrreum; after their arrival the discussion of peace began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Amynander, since this was his particular mission, laboured earnestly to induce the Ambraciots to surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he met with little success in this, approaching the walls and conferring with the chiefs, finally, by permission of the consul, he entered the city, and partly by advice and partly by entreaty he prevailed upon them to entrust themselves to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Aetolians too received notable assistance from Gaius Valerius, son of the Laevinus,<note>Cf. XXXI. iii. 3, etc.; for the treaty of <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>, XXVI. xxiv. 8.</note> who had concluded the first treaty of friendship with that people, Gaius being the brother of the consul and <pb id="p.31"/>born of the same mother.<note>Her name is unknown. She had apparently married Laevinus after the death of the elder Fulvius, since Polybius (XXII. xii) speaks of Gaius as a young man. Cf. M&uuml;nzer, <hi rend="italics">R&ouml;m. Adelsparteien</hi> (Stuttgart, 1920), 210.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Ambraciots, having<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> first bargained that the Aetolian auxiliaries should be released in safety, opened their gates. Then terms of peace were given to the Aetolians: they were to pay five hundred Euboean<note>Cf. XXXVII. xlv. 14 and the note.</note> talents, two hundred of these at once and three hundred in equal instalments through six years; they were to restore the prisoners and deserters to the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> they were to bring under their jurisdiction no city which since the time when Titus Quinctius had crossed to Greece had either been captured by force by the Romans or had voluntarily entered into friendship with them; the island of Cephallania<note>This island, like Zacynthos (XXXVI. xxxi &mdash;xxxii), now had a strategic value for the Romans, and, since it did not come under either class of communities just mentioned, is excepted. It had belonged to Aetolia.</note> was to be outside the scope of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> treaty.<note>These conditions are essentially those given by Polybius (XXII. xiii).</note> Although these terms were much lighter than they had anticipated, the request of the Aetolians that they should submit them to their council was
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> granted. There was a brief dispute about the cities, since they took it hard that towns which had once been under their control should be torn, as it were, from their body, yet all unanimously agreed that the peace should be accepted. The Ambraciots presented the consul with a golden crown of one hundred and fifty pounds'
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> weight.<note>Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>) says practically the same thing, although he seems to use <foreign lang="greek">ste/fanos</foreign> to mean any sort of complimentary present. In XXXIX. v. 14 Livy says that Fulvius displayed in his triumph golden crowns weighing one hundred and twelve pounds.</note> The bronze and marble statues and the paintings with which Ambracia was more lavishly adorned than the other cities of this region, because the palace of Pyrrhus had been <pb id="p.33"/>there, were all removed and carried away; nothing<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> else was touched or harmed.<note>Fulvius was later severely criticized for his treatment of Ambracia: cf. xliii. 5 below, and his defence in XXXIX. iv. 11-12. Polybius does not mention this, and Livy may have inferred it from the later debate as to the triumph of Fulvius.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Leaving Ambracia for the interior of Aetolia, the consul encamped near Amphilochian Argos, it being twenty-two miles from Ambracia. There finally the Aetolian ambassadors came while the consul was wondering why they were delaying.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, when he learned that the council of the Aetolians had approved the peace, having ordered them to go to the senate in Rome and having given permission to both the Rhodians and the Athenians to go with them as intercessors, and appointed his brother Gaius Valerius to accompany them, he himself crossed to Cephallania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The ambassadors found that the ears and minds of the leading men at Rome had already been filled by the allegations of Philip, who, through envoys, through letters, complaining that the Dolopians, the Amphilochians and Athamania had been snatched from him and that his garrisons and finally even his son Perseus had been driven off from the Amphilochians, had made the senate disinclined to hear their petitions. Nevertheless, the Rhodians and the Athenians were listened to in silence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Athenian ambassador Leon, the son of Hicesias, is said to have created something of an impression by his eloquence; employing the familiar simile of a calm sea which is disturbed by the winds, likening to it the Aetolian populace, he said that as long as they had remained faithful to the Roman alliance they had been quiet with the natural calmness of the race; after Thoas and Dicaearchus began to blow from Asia and Menestas and Damocritus from Europe, then <pb id="p.35"/>that storm had arisen which had dashed them upon<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> Antiochus as upon a 
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>rock.<note>
						<p>Polybius (XXII. xiv) quotes this speech at greater length and with more direct application. However, he credits the speech to Damis, and a philosopher of that name is said to have been at some time a
							<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> resident of Athens. The corruption in the text of Polybius at this point probably makes it impossible to explain the variation in names between Livy and Polybius.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After long agitation the Aetolians finally succeeded in obtaining an agreement on the terms of peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These were the conditions:<note>The terms here given are in essence those given by Polybius (XXII. xv). The formal beginning appears to be that regularly employed in <hi rend="italics">foedera non aequa, i.e.</hi> treaties between a politically superior and a politically inferior state. It is thus interpreted by Cicero (<hi rend="italics">Balb.</hi> 35).</note> <quote>The people of the Aetolians shall uphold the sovereignty and dignity of the Roman people without fraud;<note><hi rend="italics">Dolus malus</hi> is technical and legal; its implication is the intent to injure or deceive another.</note> they shall permit no army which is being led against the allies and friends of the Romans to cross their borders and shall aid such an army in no way;

						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> they shall restore deserters, runaways and captives to the Romans and their allies, except such prisoners as were captured a second time after they had returned to their homes, or such as were captured from those who were enemies to the Romans at that time when the Aetolians were associated with the Roman forces,<note>The second class of exceptions apparently includes citizens of Rome and allied states who were in arms against their native cities during the period of the active Aetolian alliance with Rome in the Second Macedonian War. But neither the meaning nor the purpose of the clause is entirely clear.</note> and any of the others who shall be discovered within one hundred days to the magistrates<note>Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>) says merely <foreign lang="greek">tw=| a)/rxonti,</foreign> meaning, probably, a Roman prefect in Corcyra. Livy seems to misunderstand, and there seems to be no point in the demand that these persons be handed over to native magistrates in Corcyra.</note> of the Corcyraeans without fraud;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> those who shall not be discovered shall be turned over as soon as each of them is found;
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they shall deliver <pb id="p.37"/>to the Romans forty hostages, acceptable to the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> consul, none younger than twelve years nor older than forty, provided that no hostage shall be a
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> praetor, a commander of cavalry, a public secretary, or one who has previously been a hostage at Rome; Cephallania shall be excepted from the terms of peace.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Regarding the sum of money which they were to pay and the instalments thereof, no change was made in the conditions proposed by the consul; <quote>if in place of silver they propose to pay gold, let them do so,</quote> it was agreed, <quote>provided that one gold piece shall be the equivalent of ten pieces of silver.<note>Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>) states the equivalence in terms of <hi rend="italics">minae,</hi> preserving the ratio of 10:1, and adds certain details as to the financial settlement.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whatever cities, whatever districts, whatever persons have at any time been under the jurisdiction of the Aetolians and have, in the consulship of Titus Quinctius and Gnaeus Domitius or after that consulship,<note>Livy and Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>) agree on these names, but one or the other name is nevertheless wrong. The colleague of T. Flamininus in the consulship was Sex. Aelius Paetus (XXXII. viii. 1), while Domitius was consul in <date value="-192">192 B.C.</date> with L. Flamininus (XXXV. x. 10). Titus was named in the corresponding section of the consul's proposals (ix. 10 above), but it is possible that the senate made this particular condition easier by changing the date from <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date> to <date value="-192">192 B.C.</date></note> either been conquered by arms or submitted voluntarily to the control of the Roman people, none of these shall the Aetolians essay to recover; the Oeniadae with their city and lands shall belong to the Acarnanians.</quote> On these conditions the treaty with the Aetolians was concluded.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not merely in the same summer, but even practically during the same days when Marcus Fulvius the consul was thus engaged in Aetolia, the other consul Gnaeus Manlius in Gallograecia waged the war which I shall now proceed to describe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul arrived in Ephesus in the beginning of spring, and, having taken over the troops from Lucius Scipio <pb id="p.39"/>and purified<note>By sacrifice to possible hostile spirits; cf. XXXVI. xlii. 2, etc.</note> the army, he delivered a speech to the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> soldiers in which he gave great praise to their valour
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> because they had ended the war with Antiochus by a single battle, and urged them to undertake a new war with the Gauls, who had not only aided Antiochus with auxiliaries but possessed spirits so untamable that the expulsion of Antiochus beyond
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the ridges of the Taurus mountains would be in vain unless the power of the Gauls were broken, while as regards himself also he added brief remarks, neither false nor exaggerated.<note>The praetorship of Manlius in Sicily (XXXIII. xliii. 5) had been undistinguished, and it is not easy to see the basis for his eulogy of himself. He probably dwelt upon the exploits of earlier Manlii against Gauls, as he does in xvii. 8-9 below.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The joyous soldiers listened to the consul with great applause, believing that the Gauls had been only a part of the forces of Antiochus; after the defeat of the king there would be no strength in the Gauls alone and by themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul believed that Eumenes was away at an unsuitable time &mdash;he was then in Rome<note>Cf. XXXVII. lii. 1.</note> &mdash;as he was familiar with the country and the people and as it was to his interest that the power of the Gauls should be broken.<note>Pergamum and the Gauls were traditional enemies xvi. 14 below.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Manlius therefore summoned Eumenes' brother Attalus from Pergamum and urged him to join in the prosecution of the war, and on receiving the promise of the co-operation of himself and his countrymen sent him home to make preparations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A few days later, when the consul left Ephesus for Magnesia, Attalus met him with a thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry, having directed his brother Athenaeus to follow with the rest of the army and having entrusted the guardianship of Pergamum to those men whom he deemed loyal to his brother and the throne.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul, praising the young man, marched with the <pb id="p.41"/>entire force to the Meander and encamped, because<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> the river could not be crossed by fording and boats had to be collected to ferry the army across.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After crossing the Meander they advanced to Hiera Com&ecirc;.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was at this place a venerable shrine of Apollo and an oracle; the priests, it is said, give the responses in verses not without polish.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the second day's march from here they came to the Harpasus river, where ambassadors from Alabanda came with the request that he would compel, either by authority or by armed force, a stronghold which had recently revolted from them to accept its ancient status.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There also came Athenaeus, the brother of Eumenes and Attalus, with Leusus the Cretan and Corragus the Macedonian; they brought with them a thousand infantry of different nationalities and three hundred cavalry. The consul, sending a tribune of the soldiers with a force of moderate size, took the stronghold by storm and having captured it turned it over to the people of Alabanda.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He himself, not leaving the direct road, pitched camp at Antiochia on the Meander river. The sources of this river spring from Celaenae. The city of Celaenae was once the capital of Phrygia; thence there was a migration to a place not far from old Celaenae, and to the new town was given the name of Apamea, from Apama, the sister of King Seleucus.<note>Apama was actually the wife, not the sister, of Seleucus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Marsyas river also, rising not far from the sources of the. Meander, empties into the Meander, and the story runs thus, that at Celaenae Marsyas contended with Apollo in playing on the pipes.<note>Cf. the similar statements of Xenophon (<hi rend="italics">Anab.</hi> I. ii. 7-8).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Meander, rising on top of the citadel of Celaenae and flowing through the centre <pb id="p.43"/>of the city, then first through Carian and later<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> Ionian territory, empties into the gulf of the sea which lies between Prien&ecirc; and Miletus. At Antiochia, Seleucus, the son of Antiochus, came to the consul's camp to furnish the grain to the army in accordance with the treaty<note>The provisions of the treaty as given by Livy (XXXVII. xlv; cf. Iv) say nothing of any such obligation, nor does Polybius mention it. In xxxvii. 7 below Livy again speaks of grain (and now money) owed under the treaty. It may have been taken for granted that Antiochus owed supplies to the Romans until the treaty was formally ratified.</note> made with Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was a short argument regarding the auxiliaries of Attalus, since Seleucus maintained that Antiochus had bargained to supply grain to the Roman soldiers only.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This too was ended by the firmness of the consul, who sent a tribune with the order that no Roman soldiers should receive any grain until the auxiliaries of Attalus should have had their share. Thence he marched to the place called Gordiutichi.<note>
						<p>Many of the place-names in the following sections are doubtful, some
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> by reason of corruptions in the text, some, probably, because Livy did not understand his sources, while others are not mentioned elsewhere. I have been content in general to repeat the
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> names as they are found in the Latin text I have followed, realizing that beyond question many of them are wrong.</p> 
						<p>The route of the Romans can be followed more easily on the map than through notes. As one traces their course one wonders whether their dominating motive, in selecting the line of
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> march, was the topography of the country, the desire to come to grips with the Galatians as soon as possible, or the profits which quickly began to come in. (See Map 3.)</p></note> From there they came on the third march to Tabae. The city lies on the borders of the Pisidians, on the side which faces the Pamphylian sea. Since the strength of the region was unimpaired, its men were fierce
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> in warfare. At this time too the cavalry, charging the Roman column, threw it at first into no small degree of confusion; then, when it became evident that they were equal in neither numbers nor courage, when driven back into the town they begged pardon for their mistake and were ready to surrender the city. The consul exacted of them twenty-five talents <pb id="p.45"/>of silver and ten thousand

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the third day from there they came to the Casus river; on their departure thence they took the town of Eriza at the first assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They came next to Thabusium, a fortress overlooking the Indus river, which derived its name from an Indian<note>Presumably the driver of the elephant: cf. Polybius I. xl; III. xlvi.</note> who fell from his elephant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were not far from Cibyra, and no embassy was coming from Moagetes, tyrant of that city, a man faithless and hard to deal with in every way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To test his attitude, the consul sent Gaius Helvius ahead with four thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry. As this column was crossing the frontier ambassadors met them, bringing word that the tyrant was ready to do their bidding;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> they begged that he would enter their country peacefully and restrain the soldiery from laying waste the land, and brought him fifteen talents in the form of a golden crown.<note>Cf. ix. 13 above and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Helvius, promising to keep the farms safe from pillage, ordered the ambassadors to go to the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they delivered the same message, the consul said, <quote>We Romans have no indication of the good-will of the tyrant towards us, and it is well known to all that he is such a person that we must think about punishing him rather than cultivating his friendship.</quote><note>The characterization resembles that of Polybius (XXII. xvii).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Dismayed by this speech, the ambassadors asked nothing else than that he accept the crown and give the tyrant the opportunity to come to him, to speak and to defend himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With the permission of the consul the tyrant the next day came <pb id="p.47"/>to the camp, clothed and attended in a style inferior<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> to that of a private person of moderate wealth, and his speech was humble and incoherent, the speech of a man who belittled his own station and lamented the poverty of the cities under his control.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now there were under him, in addition to Cibyra, Sylleum and a city which they call <hi rend="italics">ad Limnen.</hi> From them, by robbing himself and his subjects, he promised, though hesitatingly, to raise twenty-five talents. <quote>Come, come,</quote> replied the consul, <quote>this trifling cannot be endured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It is not enough that you did not blush when, remaining away, you mocked us through your ambassadors; even when here you persist in the same shamelessness. Will five-and-twenty talents drain your tyranny dry?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Very well, unless you pay five hundred talents in three days, look forward to the devastation of your lands and the siege of your city.</quote> Though terrified by this threat he nevertheless persisted in his stubborn pretence of poverty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And little by little by grudging concessions, now amid much quibbling, now with prayers and feigned tears, he was worked up to the point of paying one hundred talents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Ten thousand <hi rend="italics">medimni</hi> of grain were added. All this was collected within six days.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Cibyra the army was led through the territory of the people of Sinda and crossing the Caulares river went into camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The next day they marched along the marsh of Caralitis; they encamped near Madamprus. As they advanced from there the inhabitants fled in terror from the neighbouring town of Lagum; empty of men and filled with abundance of all things, the town was sacked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thence they moved to the sources of the Lysis river and next day to the Cobulatus river.<note>Polybius (XXII. xviii) calls it Colobatus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Troops from Termessus <pb id="p.49"/>were at that time besieging the citadel of the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> Isiondenses after capturing the town. The besieged, since there was no other hope of relief, sent envoys to the consul asking aid: shut up in the citadel with their wives and children, they were expecting death day by day, to be suffered by either the sword or starvation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus the eager consul was offered an occasion to turn aside into Pamphylia. By his arrival he rescued the Isiondenses from siege; on payment of fifty talents of silver he granted peace to Termessus; he did the same for the Aspendians and other peoples of Pamphylia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Returning from Pamphylia, he encamped the first day on the river Taurus, the next at what they call Xylines Com&ecirc;.<note>The sites in this sentence cannot be placed, but Manlius has clearly turned north towards his proper route into Galatia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Advancing from there by continuous marches he came to the city of Cormasa. Darsa is the nearest town; this he found deserted by the inhabitants through fear, but full of all sorts of supplies. As he marched along the marshes ambassadors came from Lysino&euml; surrendering their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then they entered the country of the Sagalassenes, rich and abounding in all kinds of crops. Pisidians inhabit it, by far the best warriors in this region.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This circumstance gave them courage, as well as the fertility of the soil and their large population and the situation of their fortified town in a land where such strongholds were few. Since no embassy met him at the frontier, the consul sent out parties to plunder the fields. Then at last their stubbornness was broken when they saw their property being carried and driven away; sending ambassadors and agreeing to pay fifty talents, twenty thousand <hi rend="italics">medimni</hi> of wheat and as many of barley, they obtained peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then he proceeded to the Rhotrine springs and encamped at a village which they call <pb id="p.51"/>Acoridos Com&ecirc;.<note>Both places and names are uncertain.</note> Thither the next day Seleucus<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> came from Apamea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the consul had sent back thence to Apamea the sick and his useless equipment, receiving from Seleucus guides for the march, he came that day into the country of Metropolis and the following day to Dyniae in Phrygia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> From there he marched to Synnada, all the towns in the neighbourhood being deserted through fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Dragging after him a column which was now overloaded with their booty and barely accomplishing a march of five miles in a whole day, he arrived at Beudos, which they call <quote>the Old.</quote> Next he reached Anabura and the following day the sources of the Alander, and the third he encamped at Abbassius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There he maintained his camp for many days because he had come to the frontiers of the Tolostobogii.<note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There strife broke out among them; about twenty thousand men, with Lonorius and Lutarius as their chiefs, seceded from Brennus and turned aside into Thrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There, when they had penetrated as far as Byzantium, contending against those who resisted and imposing tribute upon those who sought peace, they occupied for a considerable time the coast of the Propontis, holding as tributaries the cities of the district.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the desire of crossing into Asia seized them, as they heard from their <pb id="p.53"/>neighbours how rich was this land; and having taken<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> Lysimachia by treachery and occupied the whole Chersonesus by force of arms they came down to the Hellespont.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There, as they saw Asia separated from them by a narrow strait, their souls were even more inflamed with the desire to cross, and they sent messengers to Antipater, the prefect of this coast, regarding the crossing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When this negotiation was dragging out longer than they had expected, another new revolt broke out between the chiefs. Lonorius with the larger part of the men went back to Byzantium whence he had come; Lutarius, when Macedonians were sent by Antipater to spy, under cover of being an embassy, took from them two decked ships and three cruisers. Using these as ferry-boats day after day and night after night, within a few days he transported his entire force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Only a little later Lonorius, with the aid of Nicomedes,<note>Nicomedes and Ziboetas were brothers, sons of the elder Ziboetas, the first king of Bithynia.</note> king of Bithynia, crossed from Byzantium. Then the Gauls were once more united and aided Nicomedes in the war he was waging against Ziboetas, who held some part of Bithynia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And, principally as a result of their assistance, Ziboetas was conquered and all Bithynia acknowledged the sovereignty of Nicomedes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Setting out from Bithynia they made their way into Asia. Of their twenty thousand men, not more than ten thousand were armed. Nevertheless, they inspired such terror in all the peoples who dwell on this side of the Taurus, those whom they approached and those whom they did not approach, that the most distant and the nearest alike obeyed their orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Finally, since there were three tribes, the Tolostobogii, the Trocmi, and the Tectosages, they split <pb id="p.55"/>up into three divisions, according to the states of Asia<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> which each held as tributaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To the Trocmi the coast of the Hellespont was assigned; the Tolostobogii received by the lot Aeolis and Ionia, the Tectosages the interior parts of Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And they exacted tribute from all Asia on this side of the Taurus, but established their own dwellings along the river Halys.<note>Their territory was called Galatia, comprising parts of Phrygia and Cappadocia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And so great was the terror of their name, their numbers being also enlarged by great natural increase, that in the end even the kings of Syria<note>The Seleucid kingdom was weakened by internal dissension and wars with Egypt, but may not have paid tribute regularly.</note> did not refuse to pay them tribute. Attalus, the father of King Eumenes, was the first of the inhabitants of Asia to refuse, and his bold step, contrary to the expectation of all, was aided by fortune and he worsted the Gauls in pitched battle.<note>Cf. XXXIII. xxi. 3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Yet he did not cow them so thoroughly that they refrained from exercising their power;<note>The displays of power which Livy has in mind were probably raids and demands for tribute. Possibly, however, <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> should be understood in a geographical sense.</note> their strength remained the same until the war between Antiochus and the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Even then, after the defeat of Antiochus, they entertained great hopes that, since they lived far from the sea, the Roman army would not march against them.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Since war was to be waged with this enemy, so terrible to all the inhabitants of this region, the consul summoned an assembly and addressed the soldiers in about this fashion:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>It does not escape me, soldiers, that of all the peoples who inhabit Asia the Gauls stand first in reputation for war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Among peoples of the most unwarlike sort this fierce tribe, travelling up and down in war, has almost made the world its residence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Tall bodies, long <pb id="p.57"/>reddish hair, huge shields, very long swords; in<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> addition, songs as they go into battle and yells and leapings and the dreadful din of arms as they clash shields according to some ancestral custom &mdash;all these are deliberately used to terrify their foes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But let Greeks and Phrygians and Carians fear these things to which they are unused and unaccustomed; to Romans Gallic riotings<note><hi rend="italics">Tumultus,</hi> which became almost technical for uprisings in Gaul (XXXI. x. 1, etc.), is here used in a different sense, as a summary of what has just preceded.</note> are familiar and their vain displays too are well known.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Once, when we first met them at the Allia,<note>The river which was the scene of the defeat which led to the capture of Rome (traditionally dated <date value="-390">390 B.C.</date>); cf. V. xxxvii. &mdash;xxxix.</note> our ancestors long ago fled before them; from that time now for two hundred years, terrified like animals they are slain and routed, and more triumphs, almost, have been celebrated over the Gauls than over all the
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> world. This has now been learned by experience: if you bear up under their first onset, into which they rush with glowing enthusiasm and blind passion, their limbs grow lax with sweat and weariness, their weapons fall from their hands; their soft bodies, their soft souls (when passion subsides) are overcome by sun, dust, thirst, so that you need not use arms against them. Not only when matched legion to legion have we learned this, but when fighting man to man
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> alone. Titus Manlius, Marcus Valerius have shown how far Roman valour surpasses Gallic madness. Then Marcus Manlius alone thrust down the Gauls as they climbed in close array to the
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Capitoline.<note>The three Romans named were famous for their exploits against the Gauls. The consul is quite willing to have the fact recalled that two of the three were members of his own <hi rend="italics">gens.</hi></note> And those forefathers of ours had to do with true Gauls, born in their own <pb id="p.59"/>land; these now are degenerates, of mixed race, and<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> really Gallogrecians, as they are named; just as, in the case of plants and animals, the seeds have less power to maintain their natural quality than the character of the soil and climate in which they live has power to change
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> it. The Macedonians who hold Alexandria in Egypt, who hold Seleucia and Babylonia and other colonies scattered throughout the world, have degenerated into Syrians, Parthians,
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Egyptians; Massilia,<note>The characterization given by the Rhodians (XXXVII. liv. 21-22) is quite different and probably more accurate.</note> situated among the Gauls, has acquired something of the disposition of its neighbours; what have the Tarentines retained of that stern and dreadful Spartan
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> discipline? Whatever grows in its own soil, has greater excellence; transplanted to a soil alien to it, its nature changes and it degenerates towards that in which it is nurtured. It is Phrygians,<note>The Phrygians of Livy's time were proverbially effeminate: cf., <hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi> Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> IV. 215-216.</note> therefore, burdened with the weapons of Gauls, whom, even as you slew them in the battle-line of Antiochus, you will slay, victorious over the
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> vanquished. I am afraid that there will be too little of glory rather than too much of war. King Attalus has often repulsed and routed
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> them. Do not think that it is only beasts which when newly caught first retain that fierceness of their forest life, and then, when long fed by the hands of men, grow tame, but that in moderating the ferocity of men nature does not do the
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> same. Do you believe that these are the same men that their fathers and their grandfathers
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> were? Exiles on account of the poverty of the land, they left home, travelling through the most inhospitable land of Illyricum, then Paeonia and Thrace, fighting with the fiercest tribes, and seized <pb id="p.61"/>these lands. Toughened and hardened by so many<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> misfortunes, they were received by a land which could stuff them with its abundance of all
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> things. In a land most rich, under a sky most kindly, among natives mild in disposition, all that fierceness with which they came has grown gentle. You, by Hercules, being men of Mars, must escape and avoid as soon as possible the pleasantness of Asia: such power have these foreign delights to destroy the vigour of the soul; such influence does contact with the habits and character of the natives
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> exert.<note>Such philosophizing seems hardly consistent with the character of Manlius and doubtfully appropriate to the occasion. Perhaps Livy wishes to prepare the reader for his analysis of Asiatic influence in XXXIX. i. and elsewhere, especially since he holds Manlius responsible for the enervation of his own soldiers and indirectly of Rome. If Polybius had a corresponding speech it is, unfortunately, lost.</note> Yet this turns out well in this respect
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> &mdash;that, while their strength against you is vain, still their reputation among the Greeks is the same as that of old, which they had when they came, and you will win, as victors, the same military glory among our allies as if you had conquered Gauls who had

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Dismissing the meeting and sending envoys to Eposognatus, who alone of the chiefs had both remained loyal to Eumenes and refused to aid Antiochus against the Romans, he moved his camp. The first day he marched to the Alander river, the second to the village which they call Tyscon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When ambassadors from the people of Oroanda had come there asking friendship, he demanded of them two hundred talents and granted them permission to report this at home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the consul proceeded to lead the army towards Plit&ecirc;; next he encamped at Alyatti. There the messengers sent to Eposognatus returned, accompanied by ambassadors of <pb id="p.63"/>that chief, who asked him not to make war upon the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> Tectosagi; Eposognatus himself, they said, would go to that tribe and persuade them to do what was ordered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Granting this favour to the chief, he began to lead the army through the district which is called Axylon. It derives its name from the fact it not only produces no wood at all but not even thorns or any other food for fire; they use cow-dung in place of wood.<note>Assuming with Livy that <hi rend="italics">Axylon</hi> is a Greek word, it means <quote>woodless.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While the Romans were encamped near Cuballum, a fortress of Galatia, the enemy's cavalry appeared with great uproar, and not only threw the Roman outguards into confusion by their unexpected attack, but even killed some men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When this disorder was reported in the camp, the Roman cavalry, pouring in haste from all the gates, repulsed and routed the Gauls and killed a considerable number in their flight. Thenceforth the consul, since he realized that he had now encountered the enemy, marched with scouts sent in advance and his column carefully formed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And when, marching without interruption, he had reached the Sangarius river, he determined to build a bridge, since there was nowhere a way to cross it by fording.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Sangarius river, flowing from Mount Adoreus through Phrygia, is joined near Bithynia by the river Thymbres; thence, enlarged by the doubling of its waters, it flows through Bithynia and discharges into the Propontis,<note>The river actually empties into the Euxine sea. It is now the Sakaria.</note> being, however, not so remarkable for its size as because it furnishes the inhabitants with vast quantities of fish.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they had finished the bridge and crossed the river and were marching along the bank, <hi rend="italics">Galli</hi> of the Great Mother from Pessinus <pb id="p.65"/>met them,<note>Cf. XXXVII. ix. 9. The Magna Mater had been brought to Rome from Pessinus (XXIX. xi. 7, etc.).

The consul said that he accepted the omen and encamped on that very spot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Next day he moved to Gordium. This is not indeed a large town, but is a market visited and frequented more than is usually the case with an inland city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It has three seas about equidistant from it, the Hellespont, the sea at Sinope and the shores of the opposite sea where the Cilicians of the coast dwell;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> besides, it adjoins the borders of several strong states, and their mutual needs concentrated their intercourse at this place especially. At this time the Romans found it deserted by the flight of the inhabitants, but likewise filled with abundance of all things.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> While he was maintaining a base there, ambassadors from Eposognatus came reporting that his visit to the chiefs of the Gauls had won no fair response;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> from the villages and farms in the plains they were moving in large numbers, accompanied by their wives and children, driving ahead of them and
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> carrying what they could carry and drive,<note>This combination of verbs is usually used of booty being removed by an enemy: so in xv. 10 above.</note> and were making for the Olympus mountain, that thence they might maintain themselves by arms and by the situation of the place.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Later the ambassadors from the people of Oroanda brought surer news, that the tribe of the Tolostobogii had occupied the Olympus range; that the Tectosagi, separated from them, had made for another mountain which was called Magaba;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that the Trocmi had left their wives and children among <pb id="p.67"/>the Tectosagi and with their armed forces on the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> march had decided to aid the Tolostobogii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The chiefs of these three tribes at this time were Ortiago and Combolomarus and Gaulotus. They had adopted this plan particularly for conducting the war &mdash;that, when they had occupied the highest peaks in the region, conveying everything there which would be sufficient for their use over however long a period, they would wear down the enemy by exhaustion;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for, they were convinced, the Romans would neither venture to climb over such steep and difficult ground, and, if they did attempt it, they could be stopped even by a small force or pushed back, nor would they sit quietly at the foot of cold mountains and endure chill and hunger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And, although the very height of the place was a defence, they also threw a ditch and other fortifications around the summits which they had occupied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They took little forethought for a supply of missile weapons, because they believed that the very roughness of the terrain would furnish stones in abundance.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, because he had foreseen, as a result of reflection, that the fighting would not be done hand to hand but by making attacks from a distance, had prepared a vast quantity of javelins, skirmishers' spears, arrows, bullets and stones
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of moderate size which could be thrown from slings, and equipped with this supply of missiles he led the army towards the Olympus mountain and encamped about five miles away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The next day, taking Attalus and four hundred cavalry, he set out to survey the character of the mountain and the situation of the Gallic camp, but the cavalry of the enemy, in double his number, rushing out of the camp put him to flight; a few <pb id="p.69"/>were killed in the flight, a larger number wounded.<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The third day he proceeded with his entire force to reconnoitre the ground, and, because no one of the enemy came out beyond the fortifications, he rode in safety around the mountain, and observed that on the southern side the hills were covered with earth and sloped gently up to a certain point, that
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> on the north there were steep and almost perpendicular cliffs, and that although almost everything else was impassable there were three roads, one in the centre of the mountain, where it was covered with soil, two difficult, on the side of the winter rising of the sun and of its summer setting.<note>Roughly, the south-east and north-west sides.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having inspected them, he encamped that day at the very base; the following day, having offered sacrifice and obtained favourable omens from the first victims,<note>It was regarded as especially propitious if the entrails of the first animals sacrificed gave favourable omens: cf. XXXVI. i. 3.</note> he divided the army into three columns and began the advance against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He himself, with the largest part of the forces, made the ascent where the mountain offered the most gradual slope; he directed his brother Lucius Manlius to move forward on the side of the winter rising, as far as the terrain permitted and as he could go in safety;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> if any dangerous and steep places confronted him he was not to contend against the unfavourable character of the ground or struggle with insuperable obstacles, but to turn aside crosswise over the mountain towards the consul and join his column; his orders to Gaius Helvius, commanding the third contingent, were to go slowly around the base of the mountain and then climb up on the side of the summer setting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The auxiliaries of Attalus he also divided into three sections, and ordered the young man himself to attend him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The cavalry with the <pb id="p.71"/>elephants he left in the plain close to the hills; his<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> orders to the prefects were to observe alertly what went on in every quarter and to render assistance wherever the situation should demand it.<note>On the return of Manlius to Rome his critics, Furius and Aemilius, savagely assailed him, partly on account of his conduct of this campaign (xlv &mdash;xlvi below). A less prejudiced examination of his tactical dispositions, while recognizing that his advance up the mountain in the face of the enemy was contrary to Roman practice and, under normal circumstances, too rash, judges him entitled to considerable praise as a tactician (cf. Pauly-Wissowa, XIV, col. 1219).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Gauls, being quite confident that their position could not be approached from the two flanks, in order to block with arms the road on the side which faces the south, sent about four thousand armed men to hold a hill overlooking the road and less than a mile from the camp, thinking that from this, as from a redoubt, they would hinder the approach.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the Romans perceived this they prepared for battle. A moderate distance in front of the standards marched the skirmishers<note>The <hi rend="italics">velites</hi> were usually advance parties thrown out by the legions as a screen; in this case they seem to have been independent units under their own commanders, but the grammar of the sentence is not clear.</note> and Cretan archers and slingers furnished by Attalus and the Trallianians and Thracians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the standards of the infantry, moving over difficult ground, proceeded at a slow rate, the men holding their shields before them so as only to ward off missiles, whilst they did not seem disposed to fight at close quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The discharge of missiles from a distance began the fighting, which at first was even, the Gauls having the advantage of position, the Romans of variety and a plentiful supply of weapons; as the battle continued there was no longer any equality. Their shields, long, but not wide enough for the size of their bodies and, moreover, flat,<note>The Roman shield presented a convex surface to the enemy and so deflected weapons more successfully.</note> offered poor protection to the Gauls. They had at this time no other <pb id="p.73"/>weapons than their swords, for which there was no<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> use, since the enemy did not meet them in hand-tohand conflict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Stones &mdash;but
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> not of suitable size, since they had made no preparations in advance, but took each what happened to come to his hand in his hasty search &mdash;they did use, but like men untrained in their employment, with neither skill nor strength to add effectiveness to the blow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Arrows, sling-bullets, darts, coming from all sides wounded them unexpectedly, nor did they see what to do, as their minds were blinded by rage and fear, and they were involved in a kind of battle for which they were very ill-adapted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For, as in hand-to-hand fighting, where they can receive and inflict wounds in turn, passion inflames their minds, so when they are struck by light weapons, coming from unseen and distant sources, and when they have no place at which they can charge with blind violence, like wounded animals they rush headlong upon their own friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The fact that they fight naked makes their wounds conspicuous and their bodies are fleshy and white, as is natural, since they are never uncovered except in battle;<note>The Gauls were not devotees of the exercise in the open air which tanned the Romans.</note> so that both more blood flowed from their abundant flesh and the wounds stood out to view more fearfully and the whiteness of their skins was more stained by the black blood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But they are not much disturbed by open wounds; indeed, sometimes they cut away the skin, when the gash is broad rather than deep, and think that thus they gain greater glory in the fight; the same men, when the sting of an arrow or of a bullet that has buried itself in the flesh torments them, having caused a wound small to look at,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> and, as they search for a way to extract the missile, it does not come out, turning <pb id="p.75"/>to madness and shame at being destroyed by so small<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> a thing, throw their bodies upon the ground. So in this instance they lay prostrate here and there; some, rushing against the enemy, were wounded from every side, and when they had come to close quarters they were slain by the swords of the skirmishers.<note>It would be interesting to know the source of this highly realistic and picturesque description of the manners of the Gauls in battle. One thinks of the apparent relish with which the source which Livy followed in XXXI. xxxiv. 4 described the wounds suffered by Philip's cavalry in an engagement with Roman cavalry, and wonders whether the same person is responsible for the originals of the two passages.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This type of soldier carries a three-foot shield and, in his right hand, javelins<note>According to XXVI. iv. 4 each man carried seven javelins.</note> which he uses at long range;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> he is also equipped with a Spanish sabre;<note>If Livy speaks with technical accuracy, this was the heavy weapon, adapted to cutting, carried by Roman cavalry; the infantry sword, which was short and adapted to both cutting and thrusting, is called <hi rend="italics">gladius Hispanus</hi>: cf. XXXI. xxxiv. 4 and the note.</note> if he is compelled to fight hand to hand, he shifts his javelins to his left hand and draws his sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> By now there were few of the Gauls surviving, and they, when they saw themselves defeated by the light troops and that the legionary standards were drawing near, in headlong flight sought their camp, which was already full of panic and confusion, as the women and children and the rest of the unarmed crowd were gathered there. The victorious Romans took possession of the hills abandoned by the flight of the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Lucius Manlius and Gaius Helvius, when they had marched up as far as the slopes of the hill admitted of progress, after they had reached the impassable places changed their direction towards that part of the mountain which alone
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> offered a road, and began to follow the consul's column, each at a moderate distance as if by agreement, being compelled by necessity itself to do what would from the first have been the best thing to do;<note>The implied criticism is perhaps that of Polybius, whose account of the battle has been lost.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.77"/>for reserves have often, on such unfavourable terrains,<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> been of the greatest service, that when the leading troops have perhaps been thrown into disorder the reserves may both shield the defeated and, being themselves fresh, take up the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the leading standards of the legions came to the hills which had been captured by the light troops, the consul ordered the men to take breath and to rest for a little while;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> at the same time he called their attention to the corpses of Gauls strewn over the hills and asked them what, when light-armed troops had worked such havoc in the fight, was to be expected of the legions, what of regular weapons, what of soldiers of the stoutest hearts? Their camp, he said, remained to be taken, into which the enemy had been driven in confusion by the light troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless, he ordered the light-armed men to lead the advance, and they, while the column was halted, had spent the time by no means idly, in collecting the weapons over the hills, that the supply of missiles might suffice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Now they were approaching the camp, and the Gauls, lest their fortifications should offer them too little shelter, had taken post under arms in front of the rampart. Then they were overwhelmed by missiles of every kind, and the more numerous and the more crowded together they were, the less did any weapon fall without effect, so that in an instant they were driven back within the rampart, leaving only strong guards at the actual gates of the fortifications.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A vast quantity of missile weapons was discharged at the throng which had been driven inside the camp, and the shouts mingled with the wails of women and children showed that many were wounded. Against the troops who had <pb id="p.79"/>blocked the gates at which they were posted, the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> <hi rend="italics">antesignani</hi> of the legions hurled their spears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The men indeed were not injured by them, but their shields in many cases were pierced and fastened together,<note>The Gauls stood with shields overlapping, and a spear which struck near the edge might fasten two of them together. Caesar (<hi rend="italics">B. G.</hi> I. xxv. 3) describes more clearly a similar occurrence.</note> nor did they longer resist the attack of the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The gates being now open, before the victors could break in, the Gauls began to flee from the camp in all directions. They rushed blindly along the roads and where there were no roads; no steep rocks, no cliffs, held them back; they feared nothing but the enemy; accordingly many were killed, falling headlong or slipping in weariness over tremendous precipices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul, having taken the camp, kept his soldiers from spoil and pillage; he ordered them each to follow as best he could, press the pursuit and increase the panic of the fugitives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The second column, under Lucius Manlius, also came up; he did not permit his men to enter the camp, but sent them at once to pursue the enemy, and he himself followed a little later, having entrusted the guarding of the prisoners to the tribunes of the soldiers, being convinced that the war was over if the largest possible number was killed or captured in that rout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the consul had gone, Gaius Helvius arrived with the third column and was unable to prevent his men from plundering the camp, and the booty, by a most unjust decree of fate, fell into the hands of men who had had no part in the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The cavalry, knowing nothing for a long time of either the battle or the victory of their comrades, remained stationary; later they too, with all the speed of which their horses were capable, pursuing the Gauls as they scattered in flight around the <pb id="p.81"/>base of the mountain, killed and captured them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> number of casualties could not easily be calculated because the flight and slaughter went on far and wide over all
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the outlying parts of the mountains, and a great number fell from the pathless cliffs into valleys of enormous depth, and some were killed in the forests and thickets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Claudius, who writes that there were two battles on the Olympus mountain, asserts that about forty thousand men were slain;<note>Manlius himself (xlvii. 6 below) says that he captured and killed more than forty thousand of the enemy, and Orosius (IV. xx; he credits the victory to the other consul Fulvius) says that forty thousand were killed. Appian, however (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> xlii), asserts that there were forty thousand prisoners and that the slain could not be counted. Perhaps the official report of Manlius was used by Claudius.</note> Valerius Antias, who is usually more unrestrained in exaggerating numbers, says that not more than ten thousand fell.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The number of prisoners without doubt brought the total up to forty thousand, because they had brought with them their whole population of every class and age, like a people in migration rather than setting out to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul, having burned all the weapons of the enemy in one pile, ordered all his troops to bring in the rest of the booty and either sold that part of the booty which it was his duty to convert to public use or carefully distributed it to the soldiers so as to secure the greatest possible measure of equity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Also before an assembly he praised everyone according to his merits, and Attalus before all, with the complete approval of the rest; for the young man had displayed not only remarkable courage and diligence amid all the toils and dangers, but also modesty of behaviour.<note>The vividness of the preceding narrative gives rise to a question as to its sources. Valerius Antias and Claudius are quoted, and in the preceding note I suggest that the latter may have used the official report of Manlius. For some reason or other the Galatian campaign attracted an unusual amount of attention: Hannibal is said to have written an account of it (Nepos, <hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> xiii. 2), but there is no trace of this. In the note to xv. 5 above I mentioned the generally accepted assumption that Livy had access to a diary of some participant in the campaign: Mommsen once suggested (<hi rend="italics">R&ouml;m. Forsch.</hi> II. 538 ff.) that he was Polybius, but this has not been taken seriously. Whether the sanguinophile source of chap. xxi (see the note to xxi. 12 above) was one of those already mentioned cannot be determined.</note></p> <pb id="p.83"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There remained an entirely new war with<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> the Tectosagi. Setting out against them the consul came on the third day of marching to Ancyra, a famous city in that region,<note>This city (modern Angora) was important enough later to have the <hi rend="italics">Res Gestae</hi> of Augustus (<hi rend="italics">Monumentum Ancyranum</hi>) set up there.</note> from which the enemy was a little more than ten miles distant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While they were established in camp there, a memorable deed was done by a captive woman. The wife<note>Polybius and others give her name as Chiomara.</note> of the chieftain Orgiago,<note>Probably identical with Ortiago of xix. 2 above.</note> a woman of surpassing beauty, was held under guard among a large number of prisoners; the commander of the guard was a centurion, characterized by both the lust and the greed of the soldier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first he tried her disposition; when he found it shrinking from voluntary fornication, he did violence to her body, which fortune had made a slave.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, to quiet her indignation at the injury, he held out to the woman the hope of a return to her own people, but not even that, as a lover might have done, did he grant her for nothing. Having stipulated for a definite quantity of gold, to avoid taking one of his own men as an accomplice, he allowed the woman herself to send as a messenger to her people whomsoever of the prisoners she should choose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He designated a spot near the river to which not more than two of the kinsmen of the captive were to come with the money the following night to receive her. It happened that one of the woman's own slaves was among the prisoners under the same guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This man, as messenger, the centurion at nightfall conducted beyond the line of sentinels. The following night both the two kinsmen of the woman and the centurion with the prisoner came to the appointed place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While they were displaying the money, which was to amount to an Attic <pb id="p.85"/>talent &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> so great had been the sum agreed upon<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> &mdash;the woman in her own language ordered them to draw sword and kill the centurion as he was weighing the money.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they had slit his throat and cut off his head, the woman herself wrapped it in her garment and carried it on her return to her husband Orgiago, who had escaped home from Olympus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> before she embraced him she dropped at his feet the head of the centurion, and, when he wondered whose head this was and what this act meant, so unlike that of a woman, she confessed to her husband the violence done to her person and the vengeance exacted for her forcibly violated chastity, and, as the story goes, by the purity and dignity of her life in other respects maintained to the end the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> glory won by a deed that marked her as a true matron.<note>Practically the same story is told by Polybius (XXII. xxi), Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Mul. Virt.</hi> 43), Valerius Maximus (VI. i. ext. 2) and Florus (I. xxvii. 6). All probably came from the same ultimate source (the diary mentioned above?), although Plutarch quotes as from Polybius an item not now found in Polybius' own version.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ambassadors from the Tectosages came to the consul at his base at Ancyra, requesting that he should not move from Ancyra until he had conferred with their chiefs: there were no terms of peace which would not be preferable in their sight to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The time fixed was for the next day and the place one which seemed approximately half-way between the camp of the Gauls and Ancyra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the consul had come there at the designated time, attended by a guard of five hundred cavalry, and had returned to his camp without having seen any Gaul there, the same ambassadors returned, apologizing that their chiefs could not come by reason of religious objection;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the leading men of the tribe, they said, through whom the business could equally well be transacted, would come. The consul said that he too would send a representative, namely, Attalus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both parties attended this conference. When <pb id="p.87"/>Attalus had brought up with him a bodyguard of<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> three hundred cavalry, terms of peace were discussed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> since a conclusion to the matter could not be reached in the absence of the principals, it was agreed that the consul and the chiefs should meet in that place the following day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The evasiveness of the Gauls had this purpose: first, that they might waste time until they could transport their property, which they did not wish to jeopardize, together with their wives and children, across the river Halys; second, that they were plotting against the consul himself, who had not been sufficiently on guard against treachery at the conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For this purpose they chose from their entire number a thousand cavalry of tried boldness; and success would have attended their treachery had not fortune stood on the side of the law of nations which they had planned to violate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Roman foragers and wood-gatherers were led in the direction in which the conference was to be held, the tribunes thinking that this would be safer, since they would have between them and the enemy the consul's bodyguard, placed as a sort of outpost for them; nevertheless, they posted another outguard of their own, consisting of six hundred cavalry, nearer the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul, on the assurance of Attalus that the chiefs would come and that the business could
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> be settled, set out from camp with the same guard of cavalry as before, and, when he had gone about five miles and was not far from the appointed place, suddenly he saw the Gauls coming, their horses at full gallop, and with the air of enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He halted his column, and, ordering the troopers to prepare arms and, minds for the combat, at first he stoutly received the onset of the attack and did not <pb id="p.89"/>give way; then, when the weight of numbers was<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> bearing him down, he began to retire gradually, preserving the formation of his troops; finally, when there was now more danger in delay than protection in maintaining the formation, all scattered in random flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then indeed the Gauls began to pursue and kill the scattered cavalry; and a great part of them would have been destroyed had not the outpost of the foragers, the six hundred cavalry, come up to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When they had heard from afar the terrified shouts of their comrades and had made ready their weapons and horses, they came upon the rout with their force still fresh. So straightway fortune changed and the panic changed sides, from the vanquished to the victors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And at the first attack the Gauls were routed and the foragers flocked in from the fields and foes faced the Gauls from every side, so that they did not find even flight either easy or safe, since the Romans with fresh horses were pursuing the weary. And so few then escaped; no one was taken prisoner; by far the greatest part paid with their lives the penalty for breaking the faith of a conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Romans, their hearts on fire with wrath, advanced the next day with their whole strength against the enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul spent two days in exploring for himself the character of the mountain,<note>Cf. xix. 1 above.</note> that nothing might be unfamiliar to him; on the third day, after giving his attention to the auspices and then offering sacrifice, he divided his army into four columns and led them out, planning to lead two up
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the central part of the mountain and to send two from the sides to oppose the flanks of the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Tectosagi and the Trocmi, who constituted the <pb id="p.91"/>strength of the enemy, held the centre of their line<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> with fifty thousand men; the cavalry, being dismounted since there was no use for horses on the rough cliffs, and numbering ten thousand men, they placed on their right flank; the Cappadocians of Ariarathes and the auxiliaries of Morzius<note>A Paphlagonian prince.</note> on the left flank amounted to about four thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul, as at the Olympus mountain, placed the light-armed troops in the van and made provision that there might be at hand an equally large supply of every kind of weapon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they approached, everything was the same on both sides as in the former battle except courage, which was increased in the victors by reason of their success and diminished in the enemy because, while they themselves had not been conquered, they considered as their own the disaster suffered by men of their own race.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so from like beginnings the affair had the same end. The discharge of a veritable cloud of light missiles overwhelmed the line of the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No one dared to rush forward from their ranks lest he expose his body to wounds from all sides, and, standing fast, the more closely they were crowded together the more wounds they received, the attackers aiming, so to speak, at a target.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul, thinking that if he disclosed the standards of the legions to an enemy already disorganized on its own account they would all at once turn to flight, received within his ranks the skirmishers and the rest of the throng of auxiliaries and moved forward his battle-line.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Gauls, terrified as they were by the recollection of the defeat of the Tolostobogii, carrying weapons fixed in their bodies and wearied both by <pb id="p.93"/>standing and by wounds, did not endure even the<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> first assault and shout of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their flight was directed towards their camp, but few found their way within the ramparts; the majority was carried past to right and left and fled wherever the course of each led.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The victors, cutting them down from behind, followed as far as the camp; then they remained in the camp in their greed for plunder, nor did anyone pursue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the flanks the Gauls stood firm longer because the attack was slower to reach them; but they did not endure even the first volley of weapons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Since the consul was unable to tear away from their plundering the troops who had entered the camp, he at once sent those who had been on the flanks to pursue the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although they followed for a considerable distance, they did not kill more than eight thousand men in the flight, for there was no battle; the rest crossed the river Halys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A large part of the Romans stayed that night in the camp of the enemy; the consul led the rest back to their own camp. The next day he surveyed the prisoners and booty, which was as great as a people most greedy for plunder could amass after holding under armed control for many years everything on this side of the Taurus mountain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Gauls, assembling in one place after their scattered and disorderly flight, most of them being wounded or unarmed, stripped of everything, sent ambassadors to the consul concerning peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Manlius ordered them to come to Ephesus; he himself &mdash;for it was now mid-autumn &mdash;was in haste to get away from regions cold owing to the neighbourhood of the Taurus mountain<note>It is improbable that the Taurus mountain could have much effect on the climate of Galatia.</note> and led the victorious army back into winter quarters on the sea coast.</p> <pb id="p.95"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> revolted. Because the city enjoyed a strategic position, they said that they were afraid that they would be compelled by the Romans to move away. But whether they had invented this alarm for themselves and in baseless terror had roused a sleeping evil, or the subject had been discussed by the Romans and reported to them, nothing has been ascertained, except that when they had already given hostages they suddenly closed their gates and not even in response to the prayers of their own people
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> &mdash;for the consul had sent some of them to the foot of the walls to stir up pity for their parents and fellowcountrymen &mdash;were they willing to abandon their undertaking. Then, when their replies showed no pacific intent, the siege of the city
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> began. He had all the equipment of artillery and siege-engines transferred from the siege of Ambracia, and what works had to be constructed the soldiers zealously
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> undertook. Accordingly, the battering-rams were moved up in two places and the walls attacked.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nor was any measure overlooked by the Sameans by which either the works or the enemy could be interfered with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nevertheless, their resistance depended mainly upon two things; first, the <pb id="p.99"/>construction of a new wall, equally strong throughout,<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> on the inner side and in place of the wall that was destroyed; second, their sudden sallies, now against the enemy's siegeworks, now against his outguards; and generally in these battles they had the advantage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> One device was found to hold them in check, though trivial to mention.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A hundred slingers were recruited from Aegium and Patrae and Dymae. These peoples were trained from boyhood, in accordance with a tradition of the race, in hurling with a sling at the open sea the round stones which, mingled with the sand, generally strew the coasts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In consequence they use this weapon at longer range, with greater accuracy and with more powerful effect than the Balearic slinger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Moreover, the sling is not composed of a single strap, like those of the Baleares and other peoples, but the bullet-carrier is triple, strengthened with numerous seams, that the missile may not fly out at random, from the pliancy of the strap at the moment of discharge, but, seated firmly while being whirled, may be shot out as if from a bow-string.<note>The corresponding passage in Polybius is lost, and the source of this description is uncertain. A somewhat similar account is found in XLII. lxv. 10, but it does not seem from either that Livy entirely understood what he was describing.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having been trained to shoot through rings of moderate circumference from long distances, they would wound not merely the heads of their enemies but any part of the face at which they might have aimed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These slings prevented the Sameans from making sallies so frequently or so boldly, to such an extent that from the walls they begged the Achaeans<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the slingers.</note> to withdraw for a while and in quiet to watch them fighting with the Roman outguards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For four months Same underwent the siege. Since every day some of their small number were killed or wounded and those who remained were wearied <pb id="p.101"/>in both body and mind, the Romans at night, by way<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> of the citadel which they call Cyneatis &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the city slopes towards the sea and faces west &mdash;crossed the wall and entered the market-place. When the Sameans realized that part of the city had been captured by the enemy, they took refuge with their wives and children in the larger citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then the next day the city was plundered and all who had surrendered were sold as slaves.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, having arranged matters in Cephallania and stationed a garrison at Same,

After the assassination of Nabis by the Aetolians in the same year, Philopoemen had taken Lacedaemon into the Achaean League (XXXV. xxxvii. 2), where its status was somewhat uncertain. Philopoemen's own policy was definitely anti-Laconian, and the unsettled question of the banished Spartan aristocrats was a continual problem (XXXVI. xxxv. 7). Livy now recounts the history of Achaean &mdash;Spartan relations from this time to the holding of the council at which Fulvius was present.</note> The state was kept in anxiety especially<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> by the exiles, a great part of whom lived in the fortresses along the Laconian sea coast, all of which had been taken away from Sparta. The Lacedaemonians, angered at this, in order that somehow they might possess free access to the sea, if ever they sent ambassadors to Rome or elsewhere, and at the same time that they might have a market and a place for the storage of foreign merchandise for necessary purposes, made an unexpected night attack on the coast town of Las and captured it. The townspeople and the exiles who lived there were at first terrified by this unlooked-for event; then, assembling at daybreak, with a slight effort they expelled the Lacedaemonians. Nevertheless, the panic spread to the whole sea coast, and all the forts and villages and the exiles whose residences were there sent a joint embassy to the Achaeans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>XXXI. The praetor Philopoemen, who had from the very beginning championed the cause of the exiles and had always urged the Achaeans to diminish the power and influence of the Lacedaemonians, gave the complainants an audience before the council, and on his motion a decree was passed that, whereas Titus Quinctius and the Romans had put the fortresses and villages of the Laconian coast under the protection and guardianship of the Achaeans, and whereas, <pb id="p.105"/>although under the treaty the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> Lacedaemonians were<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> under obligations to let them alone, the village of Las had been attacked and men had been killed there, therefore, unless those who had been principals in and accessories to this act should be surrendered to the Achaeans, the treaty should be deemed to have been violated.<note>The motion as quoted by Livy has the verbal characteristics of the actual decree. The treaty referred to was with the Romans, not the Achaeans, and the moral and legal right of the latter to enforce it is not unquestioned.</note> Messengers were at once sent to Lacedaemon to demand them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This demand seemed to the Lacedaemonians so insolent and unmerited that if the ancient fortune of the state had continued they would without doubt have immediately taken up arms. The principal cause of the terror which struck them was that, if they once accepted the yoke by obedience to these first commands, Philopoemen would turn Lacedaemon over to the exiles, as he had long been planning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Mad with wrath, then, they killed thirty men of the faction with which Philopoemen and the exiles had shared any other plans, and decreed that the alliance with the Achaeans should be broken off and that ambassadors should at once be sent to Cephallania to surrender Lacedaemon to the consul Marcus Fulvius and the Romans and to implore him to come to the Peloponnesus to receive the city of Lacedaemon under the good faith and protection of the Roman people.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the ambassadors reported this to the Achaeans, with the approval of all the cities which were represented at that council, war was declared upon the Lacedaemonians.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> disturbance brought the consul to the Peloponnesus; and by his order a council was called at Elis and the Lacedaemonians summoned to take part in the debate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not only a lively debate took place there but also a violent quarrel, to which the consul, although in other respects, favouring both sides in a spirit of conciliation, he had given ambiguous replies, put an end by the one peremptory demand that they should refrain from war until they had sent ambassadors to the senate in Rome. Both sides sent embassies to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Lacedaemonian exiles also entrusted their case and their representation to the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Diophanes and Lycortas, both from Megalopolis, were chiefs of the Achaean delegation, and they, opposed as they were to one another on public questions generally, at this time also delivered speeches quite inconsistent with one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Diophanes was for entrusting to the senate the adjudication of all questions: they, he said, would best settle the disputes between the Achaeans and the Lacedaemonians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lycortas, acting on the instructions of Philopoemen, demanded that the Achaeans be permitted to carry out whatever they had decreed in accordance with the treaty and their own laws, and that the Romans should grant them, unabridged, the freedom of which they themselves were the source.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The people of the Achaeans at that time had great influence with the Romans; nevertheless, it was decreed that no change should be made in the status of the Lacedaemonians.<note>The senate probably intended that the Lacedaemonians should remain members of the Achaean League and that their surrender to Fulvius should be ignored. It seems a fair inference that the Achaeans were not to interfere, as Philopoemen proposed to do, in local Spartan affairs. But Roman fondness for sententiousness in legislation made this decree unpardonably vague, considering the gravity of the situation, and one is tempted to conclude that the senate did not really grasp the arguments and was not greatly interested.</note> The reply, however, was so ambiguous that both the Achaeans accepted it as a concession of freedom of action regarding Lacedaemon and the <pb id="p.109"/>Lacedaemonians interpreted it as not granting the Achaeans full<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This power the Achaeans employed unrestrainedly and tyrannically. Philopoemen was re-elected to the chief magistracy.<note>Elections were normally held in the autumn, and Philopoemen may have been chosen for his sixth term before the embassy to Rome.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The rest kept silent from fear; those whom he had demanded by name declared that they would go on receipt from the ambassadors of a guaranty that they should suffer no violence until they had pleaded their cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Other well-known men also went with them, both to support them as private citizens and because they knew that their case affected the public interest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Under no other circumstances had the Achaeans taken Lacedaemonian exiles with them to the frontiers,<note>At this time the Achaeans were deliberately trying to provoke the Lacedaemonians to violence.</note> because it was obvious that nothing would offend so much the feelings of the state; on this occasion practically the whole of the advance troops of the army consisted of exiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They formed in a body and met the Lacedaemonians as they came to the gates of the camp; and at first they assailed them with insults and then, as a quarrel broke out and passions were aroused, the most impetuous of the exiles attacked the Lacedaemonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they appealed to the gods and the pledges of the ambassadors, both the ambassadors and the praetor were trying to push the mob aside and to protect the Lacedaemonians and to restrain some who were already binding them with chains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The crowd grew as the <pb id="p.111"/>excitement increased; and first the Achaeans rushed<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> up to see the sight;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> then the exiles began bitterly to proclaim what they had suffered and to beg for aid, at the same time asserting that they would never have such an opportunity if they let this one slip; the treaty, they said, which had been ratified with religious sanction on the Capitoline, at Olympia, and on the Acropolis at Athens, had been made void by those men;<note>Their exact meaning is uncertain.</note> before they were bound anew by another treaty they urged that the guilty should be punished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then the multitude, inflamed by these words, at the call of one man, who shouted out that they should strike, began to throw stones. And so seventeen of those who had been put into chains in the excitement were killed.<note>This affair was too ingeniously explained by Lycortas in <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. xxxvi. 9-16).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The next day sixty-three were arrested whom the praetor had protected against violence, not because he was concerned for their safety but because he did not wish them to be killed without pleading their cause, becoming the victims of an angry mob, and when they had spoken briefly to hostile ears all were condemned and handed over for execution.</p>

						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxxvii. 2). The apparent purpose of the Achaeans at this time was to weaken their military power, although their pretext has a fairer sound.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> and adjust themselves to the laws and institutions of the Achaeans: thus, they said, they would all become one body and would agree more readily on all matters. They obeyed no command more willingly than the order to tear down their walls,<note>They were supposed to have been built by the tyrants (XXXIV. xxxviii. 2).</note> nor were they more reluctant to accept any than the one which required that the exiles be
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> restored. The decree for their restoration was passed at Tegea in the common council of the Achaeans,<note>Since these men had been banished as a result of party strife, their restoration practically assured the progressive weakening of Lacedaemon by internal political conflict.</note> and when the report was submitted that the foreign auxiliaries had been discharged and that the newly-registered Lacedaemonians &mdash;for so they called the men who had been set free by the tyrants &mdash;had left the city and had scattered through the country, they ordered the praetor, before the army was dismissed, to go with the light-armed troops and arrest men of this category and sell them under the law governing
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> booty. Many were arrested and sold. Out of this money, with the permission of the Achaeans, they rebuilt a portico at Megalopolis which the Lacedaemonians had destroyed. Also the <hi rend="italics">ager Belbinates,</hi><note>Probably the territory of the town of Belemina in Tripolis.</note> which had been wrongfully seized by the tyrants of the Lacedaemonians, was given back to that state under an old decree of the Achaeans which had been passed while Philip, the son of Amyntas, was on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> throne.<note>This Philip was the father of Alexander the Great.</note> The Lacedaemonian state, thus, so to speak, emasculated, was long at the mercy of the Achaeans; yet nothing did them so much injury as the subversion of the discipline <pb id="p.115"/>of Lycurgus to which they had been accustomed for<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> eight hundred years.<note>The numeral cannot be taken too literally, although it is used again in XXXIX. xxxvii. 5 (in the speech of Lycortas).</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>XXXV. From the council at which the case of the Achaeans and the Lacedaemonians had been argued before the consul,<note>Livy omits to say how the case was decided. The events described in the preceding chapters (see the note to xxx. 6 above) must all have antedated this meeting, although the chronology is badly confused.</note> Marcus Fulvius, since his year was now near its end, set out for Rome to hold the elections and announced the selection as consuls of Marcus Valerius Messala and Gaius Livius Salinator, when he had secured the defeat of his personal foe, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who was a candidate that year
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> also.<note>Lepidus had been defeated the preceding year (XXXVII. xlvii. 7).</note> Next the praetors were elected; Quintus Marcius Philippus, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Gaius Stertinius, Gaius Atinius, Publius Claudius Pulcher, and Lucius Manlius Acidinus. When the elections were over it was decided that the consul Marcus Fulvius should return to the province and the army, and for him and for his colleague Gnaeus Manlius the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> was prolonged for one
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> year. In that year in the temple of Hercules a statue of the divinity himself was installed in accordance with a decree of the decemvirs, and a six-horse chariot of gold was set up on the Capitoline by Publius Cornelius;<note>Probably Scipio Nasica.</note> the inscription read that <quote>one who had been consul had dedicated it.</quote><note>The use of <hi rend="italics">consul</hi> in such inscriptions would not mean that the donor was consul at the time of the dedication, but merely that he had held the office. The inscription may have existed in Livy's time.</note> Also twelve gilded shields were set up by the curule aediles, Publius Claudius Pulcher and Servius Sulpicius Galba, out of the money which they had condemned the grain-dealers to pay for hoarding the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> grain-supply; likewise the plebeian aedile, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, <pb id="p.117"/>after convicting only one defendant &mdash;for they had<note type="margin">B.C. 189</note> prosecuted independently<note>The aediles usually acted in unison.</note> &mdash;dedicated two gilded statues; his colleague Aulus Caecilius condemned no one. The Roman Games in their entirety were repeated three times, the Plebeian Games five times.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Then, when Marcus Valerius Messala and Gaius<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> Livius Salinator had been inaugurated as consuls on the Ides of March, they consulted the senate regarding the general policy and regarding the provinces and armies. No change was made respecting Aetolia and Asia; to one consul was assigned Pisa together with the Ligurians, to the other Gaul, as their
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> provinces. They were directed to arrange between them or to cast lots and to enroll new armies of two legions each and to requisition from the allies of the Latin confederacy fifteen thousand infantry for each and twelve hundred cavalry.<note>The meaning must be that each consul was to have six hundred cavalry. The ratio of cavalry to infantry fluctuates so much that emendation of distributive numerals (twelve hundred cavalry for each) is not justified</note> The lot gave to Messala the Ligurians and to Salinator Gaul. Then the praetors cast lots: Marcus Claudius received the jurisdiction between citizens and Publius Claudius that between citizens and aliens; Quintus Marcius Sicily, Gaius Stertinius Sardinia, Lucius Manlius Nearer Spain and Gaius Atinius Farther Spain.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Regarding the armies, this was the decision: the legions from Gaul, which had been under the command of Gaius Laelius, to be transferred to Marcus Tuccius the propraetor for service among
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the Brutti, the army which was in Sicily to be brought home, and the fleet which was there to be conducted to Rome by Marcus Sempronius the propraetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the Spains the single legions which were then in those provinces were decreed, and the praetors were allowed to enlist as reinforcements from the allies and to transport with them each three thousand <pb id="p.119"/>infantry and two hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Before the new<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> magistrates departed for their provinces a three day period of prayer was proclaimed in the name of the college of decemvirs at all the street-corner shrines because in the day-time, between about the third and fourth hours, darkness had covered everything.<note>This eclipse has been dated July 17, <date value="-188">188 B.C.</date> (corrected calendar).</note> Also a nine-day sacrifice was decreed because (so it was said) there had been a shower of stones on the Aventine.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Campanians,<note>Cf. xxviii. 4 above.</note> since, according to the decree which had been passed the year before, the censors compelled them to be assessed at Rome &mdash;for previously it had been uncertain where they should be assessed &mdash;requested that they should be permitted to take Roman citizens as wives, that any who had already married Roman citizens should be allowed to keep them, and that children born before this day should be legitimate, and capable of inheriting from their fathers.<note>This would grant them, retroactively, <hi rend="italics">conubium,</hi> a right characteristic of Roman citizenship.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both requests were granted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Respecting the residents in the municipalities<note>The <hi rend="italics">municipia</hi> in general enjoyed only the private rights (<hi rend="italics">commercium</hi> and <hi rend="italics">conubium</hi>) of Roman citizens: Livy describes their status as <hi rend="italics">civitas sine suffragio.</hi> This incident illustrates the gradual promotion of the <hi rend="italics">municipia</hi> to full civic rights.</note> of Formiae, Fundi and Arpinum, Gaius Valerius Tappo, tribune of the people, proposed that the right to vote &mdash;for previously the citizenship without the right to vote had belonged to them &mdash;should be conferred upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When four tribunes of the people vetoed this bill, on the ground that it was not proposed with the sanction<note>Measures intended for an assembly were ordinarily, but not necessarily, submitted first to the senate, and those which the senate favoured received its <hi rend="italics">auctoritas.</hi> In this instance the assembly seems to assert its legislative independence of the senate, but Livy's habit of abbreviating his accounts of constitutional debates complicates the problem.</note> of the senate, and they were informed that it was the prerogative of the assembly, not the senate, to bestow the franchise upon whomsoever it desired, they gave up the effort.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the winter in which these events occurred in Rome, Gnaeus Manlius, who was wintering in Asia, first as consul, then as proconsul, received embassies from all quarters, from all the cities and tribes which live on this side of the Taurus mountain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And while the Roman victory over King Antiochus had been more glorious and more splendid than that over the Gauls, yet the victory over the Gauls afforded the allies more satisfaction than that over Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The slavery imposed by the king was more endurable than the ferocity of the rude barbarians and the constant and uncertain fear as to whither a storm so to speak would bring the Gauls marauding upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, since from the overthrow of Antiochus they had received liberty and peace from the defeat of the Gauls, they had not only come to offer congratulations but had brought golden crowns, each in proportion to his ability.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Also ambassadors came from Antiochus, and from the Gauls themselves, asking that terms of peace should be stated, and from King Ariarathes of Cappadocia, to ask pardon and to wash away with money his guilt in that he had aided Antiochus with auxiliaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.123"/>Six hundred talents of silver were demanded of him;<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> the Gauls were told that when King Eumenes had arrived he would give them terms. The embassies from the cities were sent away with gracious responses and in an even happier mood than when they had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The envoys of Antiochus were directed to bring to Pamphylia the money and grain agreed upon in the treaty concluded with Lucius Scipio; the consul and the army would come there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then at the beginning of spring, having purified the army, he set out and reached Apamea on the eighth day. Having spent three days in camp there, in three more marches from Apamea he arrived in Pamphylia, where he had ordered the king's agents to bring the money and grain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Two thousand five hundred talents of silver were received and conveyed to Apamea; the grain was distributed to the army. Then he led the troops towards Perga, which alone in this district was held by a royal garrison.<note>Polybius (XXII. xxvi) says that the commander had received no instructions from Antiochus to evacuate the town.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As he approached the commander of the garrison met him, asking for a truce of thirty days in order that he might consult King Antiochus about surrendering the city. The time having been granted for that period, the garrison withdrew.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> From Perga he sent his brother Lucius Manlius with four thousand men to Oroanda to collect the balance of the money which they had agreed to pay,<note>CL xviii. 2 above.</note> and he himself, since he had heard that King Eumenes and the ten commissioners had arrived in Ephesus from Rome, ordered the envoys of Antiochus to follow and led the army back to Apamea.</p>

							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> control. Antiochus shall have no right to wage war upon those peoples who inhabit the islands nor to cross to
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Europe. He shall withdraw from the cities, lands, villages and strongholds on this side of the Taurus mountain as far as the Halys river and from the valley as far as the ridges of Taurus where it slopes down into
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lycaonia.<note>The crucial part of this sentence is lost from the text of Polybius and the MSS. of Livy offer a variety of readings. No combination of emendations has been found which pays due regard to the readings of the Livy MSS. and also gives a definite and easily recognizable boundary. I have therefore translated the text as it is printed in the latest Weissenborn-Mueller revision, although I may have given to <hi rend="italics">Tauri</hi> a construction differing from theirs. I have chosen this course with full appreciation of the difficulties involved, some of which it seems proper to discuss briefly. The reference to the Halys river seems inappropriate unless it was the intention of the treaty-makers to dispose also of the territories brought to notice by the defeat of the Gauls. But no Tana&iuml;s river is known and a Taurus river must be imaginatively identified. (Livy mentions a river of this name in xv. 7 above, but even if he is correct the position he gives it is wrong.) Furthermore, no natural boundary is provided between the crest of the Taurus range and the Halys river (I presume that this means the portion of the river above the point where it turns north-west near the Cappadocian &mdash; Cilician frontier). If a Tanais river could be plausibly identified north of the Taurus range, I should be inclined to read . . . <hi rend="italics">cis Taurum montem usque ad Tanaim amnem, et ab ea valle Tauri usque ad iuga . . .</hi> (<quote>on this side of the Taurus mountain as far as the river Tana&iuml;s and from the valley of this river as far as the crest of Taurus</quote>), although the order in which these geographical points are mentioned seems unnatural. It seems hardly necessary to establish an eastern frontier for Asia. For reviews of recent discussion of these questions see the <hi rend="italics">Bericht</hi> on Livy by Rau and that on Greek History by Lenschau in <hi rend="italics">Jahresbericht &uuml;ber die Fortschritte der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft,</hi> 242, 1934, esp. p. 87, and 244, 1934, esp. pp. 120-121, respectively, and Map 3 in this volume.</note> He shall carry <pb id="p.127"/>away nothing but his weapons from these towns,<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> lands and fortresses from which he is withdrawing; if he has removed anything, he shall duly restore it to the place in which each item belongs.

If any citizens of those cities which are separating from his kingdom are with King Antiochus and within the borders of his kingdom, they shall all return to Apamea before a designated day; whatever persons from the kingdom of Antiochus are with the Romans or their allies shall have the right to depart or

He shall surrender also his warships and their rigging, and he shall have not more than ten decked ships nor more than ten merchant vessels,<note>The MSS. of Livy provide for <hi rend="italics">decem naves actuarias</hi> only. Polybius, however, allows ten decked ships, and it seems necessary then to assume the loss of some words, including a numeral for <hi rend="italics">actuarias.</hi> For the sake of simplicity, I have assumed in the translation, though I have not ventured to include it in the text, that this numeral was <hi rend="italics">decem</hi>: anything is a guess, since Polybius mentions neither the <hi rend="italics">actuariae</hi> nor the <hi rend="italics">moneris.</hi> The restriction on <hi rend="italics">moneres</hi> should apply equally to such <hi rend="italics">actuariae</hi> as could easily be adapted to military uses, so that there may be more corruption in both Livy and Polybius than has been recognized.</note> nor shall any of these be propelled by more than thirty oars, nor shall he have a ship of one bank for a war in which he himself shall be

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul swore to observe this treaty; to secure the oath from the king, Quintus Minucius Thermus was sent and Lucius Manlius, who chanced at that time to return from Oroanda.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He wrote also to Quintus Fabius Labeo, who was in command of the fleet,<note>Cf. XXXVII. lx.</note> to proceed at once to Patara and to destroy and burn the ships of the king that were there. Setting out from Ephesus, he either wrecked or burned fifty decked ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Telmessus, since the townspeople were alarmed at the unexpected appearance of the fleet, was recovered on the same expedition. From Lycia, ordering the ships which had been left at Ephesus to follow from there, Labeo crossed straight to Greece by way of the islands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Delaying a. few days at Athens, until the ships from Ephesus should reach Piraeus, he conducted the entire fleet from there to Italy.</p> 
				<p>When Gnaeus Manlius, among the other things which were to be received from Antiochus, had received the elephants also and had presented them all to Eumenes as a gift, he next investigated the affairs of the cities, since many were in confusion in consequence of the changes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And King Ariarathes, half of the money which had been demanded of him having been remitted through the good offices of Eumenes, to whom he had about this time betrothed his daughter, was received into friendship. The ten <pb id="p.133"/>commissioners, having looked into the situation of the<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> cities, made different dispositions in different cases.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Those which had been tributaries to King Antiochus but had sided with the Roman people were granted freedom from taxation; those which had been partisans of Antiochus or tributaries to King Attalus were all ordered to pay tribute to Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In addition, they granted freedom from taxation expressly to the Colophonians who live in Notium,<note>Cf. XXXVII. xxvi. 5-6.</note> to the Cymaeans and the Mylasenians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> to the Clazomenians, in addition to immunity, they gave the island of Drymussa as a gift, and to the Milesians they restored what they call the <quote>sacred land,</quote> and to the people of Ilium they added Rhoeteum and Gergithus, less as a reward for recent services than in recognition of their descent. This was also the reason for liberating Dardanus. The Chians, Zmyrnaeans and Erythraeans, because of the extraordinary loyalty they had displayed in the war, were rewarded with lands and in addition were treated with every mark of honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To the Phocaeans they both gave back the lands which they had held before the war and permitted them to live under their ancient laws.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Rhodians were confirmed in the possession of what had been given them by the earlier decree; they received Lycia and Caria as far as the Meander river with the exception of Telmessus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Upon King Eumenes they bestowed, in Europe, the Chersonesus and Lysimachia, the strongholds, villages and lands within the boundaries of Antiochus; in Asia, both Phrygias &mdash;the one on the Hellespont, the other which they call the Greater;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and they gave back to him Mysia, which King Prusias had taken from him, and Lycaonia and Milyas and Lydia and expressly <pb id="p.135"/>the cities of Tralles and Ephesus and Telimessus.<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When a dispute over Pamphylia broke out between Eumenes and the ambassadors of Antiochus, because part of it was on this side of Taurus and part on the other,<note>
						<p>Polybius (XXII. xxix) seems to think that the dispute
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> concerned all Pamphylia, not regarding it, as Livy does, as cut in two by the range. It is evident that not even the commissioners, while on the spot, could tell where the western end of the
							<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> Taurus chain was situated, and one does not see how the senate could be expected to determine that geographical fact. The incident shows how indistinct was the
							<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> boundary established by the treaty: cf. the note to xxxviii. 4 above. In XLIV. xiv. 3 Pamphylia seems to be free, but otherwise there is no indication of the senate's decision.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having published these treaties and decrees, Manlius with the ten commissioners and all the army set out for the Hellespont, summoning thither the chiefs of the Gauls, and stated the terms on which they should observe

Rome acquired no territory from the Galatians and recognized no Galatian interest in the treaty with Antiochus. Nevertheless, Rome had a moral responsibility for all Asia and particularly for the kingdom of Eumenes, the nearest neighbour and the traditional enemy of the Galatians.</note> and warned them that they should discontinue their habit of wandering about under arms and should keep themselves within the boundaries of their own lands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, collecting ships from the whole coast, the fleet of Eumenes also being brought up from Elaea by his brother Athenaeus, he ferried all his forces across' to Europe.<note>Appian (<hi rend="italics">Syr.</hi> 43), who abridges the account of the return journey of Manlius, criticizes severely the decision to return by land rather than by sea, and emphasizes the services rendered to Scipio by Philip (XXXVII. vii. 16).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, leading a column heavily laden with every sort of booty by short stages through the Chersonese he established a base at Lysimachia, in order that with his pack-animals as far as possible fresh and in good condition he might enter Thrace, the journey through which was generally feared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the day of his departure from Lysimachia he reached the river called Melas and on the day after that Cypsela.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From Cypsela <pb id="p.137"/>a road awaited him, for about ten miles wooded,<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> narrow, rough, and by reason of the difficulty of this route he divided the army into two sections, and, having ordered one to go ahead and the other to bring up the rear at a great distance, he placed the baggage between them; there were carts loaded with public money and other valuable booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they were marching in this order through the defile, not more than ten thousand Thracians, of four tribes, the Astii and the Caeni and the Maduateni and the Coreli, blocked the road at the narrow point.<note>It was the Thracian plan to let the van go through, block the road so that the van could not get back, and then attack the baggage.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was generally believed that this did not happen without treachery on the part of Philip, king of the Macedonians; he knew that the Romans would return by no other route than through Thrace, and he knew how much money they would bring with them. The commander was with the van, being concerned about the unfavourable character of the terrain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Thracians did not move until the armed troops were past; when they saw that the van was out of the defile and that the rear was
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> not yet at hand, they fell upon the trains and the baggage, and having killed the guards some of them carried off what was in the wagons, others drove off the pack-animals, loads and all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the uproar reached first those who were following and just entering the defile and then came to the head of the column, there was a rush from both directions towards the centre, and a disorderly battle began in several places at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Thracians were exposed to slaughter, hampered as they were by the burden of the booty itself, while many of them were without arms, in order that they might keep their hands free to plunder; the Romans were betrayed by the unfavourable ground, since the barbarians <pb id="p.139"/>charged them over familiar paths and sometimes laid<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> ambushes for them in low-lying valleys. Even the loads and the wagons, inconveniently placed for one side or the other, as chance determined, hindered the fighters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Here the plunderer fell, there the defender of the plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Just as the terrain was unfavourable or favourable for one party or the other, just as the spirits of the fighters varied, just as their numbers &mdash;for some met parties larger than their own and others smaller &mdash;just so the fortune of the battle changed; many fell on both sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Night was now at hand when the Thracians retired from the fight, not to avoid wounds or death, but because they had enough of spoils.<note>Livy does not commit himself with regard to this battle. For the contradictory accounts of it, cf. xlvii. 6-9 with xlix. 7-12 below.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The head of the Roman column encamped outside the defile near the temple of Bendis<note>A native divinity identified with Artemis or with Cybele.</note> on open ground; the rest remained within the defile to guard the trains, sheltered by a double rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The following day, having reconnoitred the defile before they moved, they joined the van.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this battle there was a loss both of baggage and of camp-followers and a considerable number of soldiers had fallen, since there was fighting everywhere along the whole defile, but the most serious blow received was the death of Quintus Minucius Thermus, a man of courage and energy.<note>He had been consul in <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> and was one of the ten commissioners.</note> That day they reached the Hebrus river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then they crossed the frontiers of the Aenians near the temple of Apollo, whom the natives call Zerynthius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Another pass confronted them near Tempyra &mdash;this is the name of the placenot less rough than the former; but, because there is no wooded country around it, it does not furnish <pb id="p.141"/>even hiding-places for ambuscades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Thrausi,<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> these too being Thracians, assembled here with the same hope of plunder; but, since the exposed valleys brought it about that those who blocked the pass could be seen from afar, there was less consternation and confusion among the Romans; indeed, although on uneven ground, there was none the less a pitched battle to be fought, a regular engagement with battle-lines open to view.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They moved forward in close array, and charging with a shout they first dislodged the enemy and then broke their line; then flight and slaughter began to take place, since the enemy were entangled in the narrow pass which they had themselves selected. The victorious Romans encamped near a village of the Maroneans &mdash;they call it Sal&ecirc;.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The next day, marching in open country, the Priatic plain received them, and they spent three days there collecting grain, partly from the fields of the Maroneans, brought in by the people themselves, partly from their own ships, which were following with all manner of supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From this station it was a day's march to Apollonia. Thence they came through the country of the Abderites to Neapolis.<note>The modern Cavalla.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All this journey was peaceful, amid the colonies of Greeks; the rest from there on, through the midst of the Thracians, while not dangerous, yet required vigilance by day and night until they arrived in Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The same army, led over the same route by Scipio, had found the Thracians more peacefully inclined, for no other reason than that there was less of booty to be sought;<note>Philip received the credit for this in XXXVII. vii. 16.</note> and yet Claudius<note>Perhaps Livy had not read the account of Claudius when he wrote XXXVII. vii. 16 and xxxiii.</note> asserts that even then about fifteen thousand Thracians <pb id="p.143"/>encountered Muttines the Numidian who was<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> preceding the column to reconnoitre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He says that there were four hundred Numidian cavalry with a few elephants; that the son of Muttines with a hundred and fifty picked troopers broke through the centre of the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and that a little later, when Muttines, having placed the elephants in the centre and stationed the cavalry on the flanks, had closed with the enemy, this same son had caused panic by an attack in the rear, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> that the enemy, thrown into confusion by this cavalry-storm, so to speak, had not reached the column of the infantry. Gnaeus Manlius led the army through Macedonia into Thrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When he had proceeded from there through Epirus to Apollonia, not yet holding the wintry sea in such light esteem that he dared to cross it, he passed the winter in Apollonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At almost the end of this year the consul Marcus Valerius came from the Ligurians to Rome to hold the elections of magistrates, having done nothing in the province so worthy of note that it could be a plausible reason for delay, to cause him to arrive later
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> than usual for the elections. The election of consuls took place on the twelfth day before the Kalends of March;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the successful candidates were Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Gaius Flaminius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The next day the praetors were chosen, Appius Claudius Pulcher, Servius Sulpicius Galba, Quintus Terentius Culleo, Lucius Terentius Massiliota, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, Marcus Furius Crassipes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having finished the elections, the consul referred to the senate the question as to which provinces they desired to assign to the praetors. They decreed that two should be stationed in Rome to <pb id="p.145"/>administer justice, two outside Italy, in Sicily and<note type="margin">B.C. 188</note> Sardinia, and two in Italy, at Tarentum and in Gaul;<note>The whole procedure is irregular, probably because the elections were held less than a month before the inauguration.</note> and they were ordered to cast lots at once, before they were inaugurated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Servius Sulpicius received the civil jurisdiction, Quintus Terentius that between citizens and aliens, Lucius Terentius Sicily, Quintus Fulvius Sardinia, Appius Claudius Tarentum, Marcus Furius Gaul.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In that year Lucius Minucius Myrtilus and Lucius Manlius, because they were said to have beaten Carthaginian ambassadors, by order of Marcus Claudius, the city praetor, were delivered by the fetials to ambassadors and taken to Carthage.<note>Claudius probably acted under instructions from the senate. Valerius Maximus (VI. vi. 3), who cites this incident as an example of <hi rend="italics">publica fides,</hi> dates it a year later.</note></p> 
				<p>There was the rumour of a great war, growing more<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> dangerous every day, among the Ligurians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So, on the day when the new consuls laid before the senate the question of the provinces and the general policy, the senate decreed to both consuls the Ligurians as their province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To this decree of the senate the consul Lepidus objected, declaring that it was improper that both the consuls should be shut up in the valleys of the Ligurians while Marcus Fulvius and Gnaeus Manlius for two years now, the one in Europe, the other in Asia, were lording it as if they were the successors to Philip and Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If it were the senate's pleasure that there should be armies in those lands, consuls rather than private citizens<note>Lepidus raises an important constitutional question, not to be easily answered, whether a magistrate could hold his <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> indefinitely, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> until he was relieved. The <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Fulvius and Manlius had been prorogued for one year (xxxv. 3 above), and this period was now at an end. Another question which he raises is whether a proconsul was technically a <hi rend="italics">privatus</hi> in the sense that Scipio, for example, was <hi rend="italics">privatus cum imperio</hi> in Spain. Unfortunately, Lepidus is too much influenced by his feud with Fulvius to be a good witness on either point.</note> should command them. These men were wandering about, carrying the threat of war to nations upon whom no war had been declared, selling peace for a <pb id="p.147"/>price.<note>Manlius, rather than Fulvius, was guilty of this conduct, and the narrative of the Galatian campaign (xii
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> &mdash;xxvii above; see also the notes, <hi rend="italics">passim</hi>) gives altogether too much support to these charges. They were elaborated by Furius and Aemilius Paulus in chaps. xlv &mdash;xlvi below.</note> If it was necessary, he continued, to hold<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> these provinces with troops, just as the consul Lucius Scipio had succeeded Manius Acilius and had in turn been superseded by the consuls Marcus Fulvius and Gnaeus Manlius, so Fulvius and Manlius should have been replaced by the consuls Gaius Livius and
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Marcus Valerius. Now, at any rate, when the Aetolian war was finished, when Asia was rescued from Antiochus, when the Gauls were conquered, either consuls should be sent to command consular armies or the legions should be recalled from there and at length restored to
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the state. After hearing this the senate persisted in its decision that both consuls should have the Ligurians as their province; it was voted that Manlius and Fulvius should retire from their provinces and withdraw their armies from them and return to Rome.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was a feud between Marcus Fulvius and the consul Marcus Aemilius, and, in addition to everything else, Aemilius considered that it was due to the efforts of Marcus Fulvius that he himself had reached the consulship two years late.<note>Fulvius had presided at the election of his own colleague in the peculiar election for <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. xlvii. 7) and at the election for <date value="-188">188 B.C.</date> (xxxv. 1 above), and on both occasions Aemilius was defeated. He had then some reason for blaming Fulvius particularly for his failures. However, the interval between his praetorship (<date value="-191">191 B.C.</date>) and his consulship was not unusually long for this period.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore, with a view to making Fulvius unpopular, he introduced to the senate ambassadors of the Ambraciots, previously coached as to their charges, who were to complain that, while they were at peace and had performed the orders of the previous consuls and were ready to render the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> same obedience to Marcus Fulvius, war had been declared on them, and first their fields had been laid waste and fear of plunder <pb id="p.149"/>and slaughter held before the city, so that they were<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> compelled by that fear to close their gates;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that then they were beleaguered and besieged and that every form of war had been waged against them &mdash;slaughter, fires, destruction, plunder of the city;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that their wives and children had been carried off into slavery, their property taken from them, and, what disturbed them most of all, the temples throughout the city had been stripped of their ornaments; the images of the gods, or rather the gods themselves, had been torn from their seats and carried away;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> bare walls and door-posts, they said, had been left to the Ambracians to adore, to pray to, and to supplicate: as they made these complaints the consul, asking leading questions as they had agreed, drew them on, as if against their will, to say even more.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the Fathers were aroused, the other consul, Gaius Flaminius, took up the cause of Marcus Fulvius, saying that the Ambraciots were following an old and long-abandoned path; thus Marcus Marcellus had been accused by the Syracusans, thus Quintus Fulvius by the Campanians.<note>Cf. XXVI. xx. 12.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nay, would they permit similar accusations to be brought against Titus Quinctius by King Philip, against Manius Acilius and Lucius Scipio by Antiochus, against Gnaeus Manlius by the Gauls and even against Marcus Fulvius by the Aetolians and the peoples of Cephallania?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>That Ambracia was besieged and captured and that its statues and works of art were removed from there and that other things were done which are usually done when cities are captured, do you think that either I on behalf of Marcus Fulvius or Marcus Fulvius on his own behalf will deny,
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> conscript Fathers, since for these achievements he will <pb id="p.151"/>claim from you a triumph, the captured Ambracia<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a representation of the captured city.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> and the statues which they accuse him of removing and the other spoils of that city will be carried before his chariot and fixed to his
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> door-posts? There is no respect in which they can separate themselves from the Aetolians; the situation of Ambraciots and Aetolians is
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> identical. Let my colleague, then, either expend his malice in some other case or, if he prefers to do so in this matter especially, let him keep his Ambraciots here until the arrival of Marcus
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Fulvius; I shall permit no decree to be passed concerning either the Ambraciots or the Aetolians in the absence of Marcus Fulvius.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While Aemilius was thus assailing the shrewd hostility of his enemy as if known to all, and was claiming that Fulvius would drag out the time by delaying, that he might not come to Rome while his foe was consul, two days
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> were wasted by the bickering of the consuls; and it seemed that no decree could be passed while Flaminius was present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Aemilius took advantage of an opportunity when Flaminius was kept away by illness, and on his motion the senate passed a decree that the Ambraciots should recover all their property;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that they should be free and should enjoy their own laws; that they should collect port duties at their pleasure, by land and sea, provided that the Romans and the allies of the Latin confederacy should be exempt from paying them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that as to the statues and other works of art which they complained had been taken from their sacred shrines, when Marcus Fulvius had returned to Rome, the question concerning them should be referred to the college of pontiffs, and that whatever they should have ordered should be done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul was not <pb id="p.153"/>satisfied with this, but later, in a sparsely attended<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> meeting, added a decree of the senate, to the effect that it did not appear that Ambracia had been captured by force.<note>This last charge has some substantiation (cf. ix. 9 above), and one wonders why it was not pressed. Cato emphasized it in his attacks on Fulvius (Gellius, V. vi. 25; Meyer, pp. 52-53). If it was true, the action of Fulvius was illegal.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Then a three-day period of prayer was proclaimed in accordance with a decree of the decemvirs for the health of the people, because a severe pestilence was wasting the City and the country districts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Next the Latin Festival was held. The consuls, released from these ceremonies and having finished the levy &mdash;for each of them preferred to employ new soldiers &mdash;departed to the province and discharged all the veterans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>After the departure of the consuls, Gnaeus Manlius the proconsul arrived in Rome; when an audience before the senate in the temple of Bellona had been granted him by the praetor Servius
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> Sulpicius and he, after relating his exploits, had demanded that on account of them honour should be paid to the immortal gods and that he should be permitted to ride into the City in triumph, the majority of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> the ten commissioners who had been with him opposed it, and, beyond the rest, Lucius Furius Purpurio and Lucius Aemilius Paulus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They said that the commissioners had been assigned to Gnaeus Manlius<note>The commissioners could have had relations with Manlius only because he had succeeded to the tasks left unfinished by Scipio. According to xxxvii. 11 above they did not reach Asia until after the Galatian campaign was concluded, and they could have had no military duties as <hi rend="italics">legati</hi> except on the return, although Manlius speaks of them as eye-witnesses of his victory (xlvii. 4 below).</note> for the purpose of making peace with Antiochus and of putting into final form the terms of the treaty which had been initiated by Lucius Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gnaeus Manlius, they said, had striven with all his might to break the peace and to take Antiochus by treachery, if the king should have given him any opportunity to do so; but he, being aware of the deceitfulness of the consul, although often approached with requests for conferences, had <pb id="p.155"/>avoided, not merely a meeting with him, but even the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> sight of him.<note>There seems to be no basis for either charge in the preceding narrative of Livy, but this may be due to his selection of sources.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the argument of Furius and Aemilius.<note>Livy may have used a speech by one or the other of the two &mdash;there is no way to determine which &mdash;as the basis for his version of the dispute.</note> Manlius, I have heard, replied in about the following manner: "It was formerly the custom, conscript Fathers, that tribunes of the people should oppose candidates
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for triumphs; in this case I am grateful to them because they have conceded this much, whether to me or to the greatness of my achievements &mdash;that they do not merely by their silence approve my distinction but even seem ready to propose it if necessary; it is among the ten commissioners (heaven

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> my opponents. Lucius Furius and Lucius Aemilius forbid me to mount the triumphal car, they strip the garland of victory from my head, these men whom, if the tribunes were obstructing my triumph, I should have summoned as witnesses to what I
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> have done. For my part, conscript Fathers, I grudge no man his distinction; when the tribunes of the people, brave <pb id="p.163"/>and energetic men, not long ago were opposing the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> triumph of Quintus Fabius Labeo,<note>In XXXVII. lx. 6 Livy quoted Valerius Antias as the authority for this triumph and seemed to have no other information about it.</note> you checked them by

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> my accusers! Their charge, as you have observed, conscript Fathers, is twofold: for they said that I should not have waged war with the Gauls and that the war was conducted rashly
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and heedlessly. 'The Gauls,' they say, 'were not enemies, but you attacked them while they were peaceful and obedient to
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> our orders.' I shall not ask you, conscript Fathers, to believe about those Gauls also who dwell in Asia what you know in general about the barbarous character of the people of the Gauls and their most deadly hatred of the name of Rome; setting aside the ill repute and ill fame of the race as a whole, judge them
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> by themselves. Would that King Eumenes were here, would that all the cities of Asia were here, and that you could hear them complaining of rather than me accusing
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the Gauls. Come, send ambassadors around all the cities of Asia and ask them whether they were freed from a more grievous slavery when Antiochus was expelled beyond the <pb id="p.165"/>ridges of Taurus or when the Gauls
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> were subdued.<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> Let them tell you how often their fields were devastated, how often plunder was carried away, when they had barely the wealth to ransom their captives and kept hearing of human victims slain and their own

He refutes this imaginary argument by pointing out Rome's new position in the world.</note> Delphi, the common oracle of the human race, the navel of the world, the Gauls despoiled, and the Romans did not on that account declare or wage a war upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For my part, I thought that there was some difference between that time, when Greece and Asia were not yet under your control and sway, as regards your interest and concern in what
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> was happening in those lands, and this time, when you have fixed the Taurus mountain as the boundary of the Roman empire, when you bestow liberty and immunity upon cities, increase the territory of some, deprive others of their lands, impose tribute upon others, enlarge, diminish, give, take away kingdoms, and deem it your responsibility that they shall have peace on land and sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Or, <pb id="p.167"/>supposing that Antiochus had not withdrawn his<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> garrisons, which remained peacefully in their citadels, would you consider that Asia had not been set free; but, on the other hand, should the armies of the Gauls be wandering at will, would these gifts which you have presented to King Eumenes have been assured, would liberty have been assured to the cities?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But why do I argue as if I had made the Gauls our enemies, not found them so?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I appeal to you, Lucius Scipio (and when I succeeded to your authority I prayed to the immortal gods, and not in vain, for your valour and good fortune), to you, Publius Scipio, who had the rank of lieutenant but the authority of a colleague both with your brother the consul and with the army, to say whether you know that in the army of Antiochus there were legions of Gauls,<note>Manlius omits, as damaging to his argument, the fact that some, at least, of these Gauls were mercenaries (XXXVII. xviii. 7).</note> whether you saw them in the line of battle, stationed on both flanks &mdash;for

In XXXVII. xl. 3 the phalanx is called the strongest part of the army, and the meaning here may be simply that the Gauls were more valuable on the-flanks than in the centre.</note> &mdash;whether you fought with them as with lawful enemies, slew them, and carried off their spoils.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But yet, they say, it Was with Antiochus and not with the Gauls that both the senate had decreed and the assembly had ordered. war. But at the same time, in my judgment, they had decreed and ordered war with those who were within his ranks;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of those, with the exception of Antiochus, with whom Scipio had contracted a peace and with whom you had expressly ordered that a treaty be made, all were enemies who bore arms against us in the cause of Antiochus.<note>The line of argument, not entirely free from fallacy, is briefly this: Rome had declared war on Antiochus and would have included his allies had she known in advance who they would be; peace had been made with Antiochus but not with the allies, upon whom war had not been formally declared; Manlius, on succeeding Scipio, had inherited any unfinished business and therefore needed no new or specific declaration of war upon such allies.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Although the Gauls <pb id="p.169"/>before all were in this class and certain chiefs and<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> tyrants,<note>Livy's narrative does not support this.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Respect for this tradition prevailed over ill-will and a full session voted the triumph.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some reproached, not the tribunes of the people, but the whole state, for being able to allow this &mdash;the two greatest cities in the world, they said, were at about the same time found ungrateful towards their foremost citizens, but Rome was more ungrateful, because conquered Carthage had driven the conquered Hannibal into exile, while victorious Rome was driving out the victorious Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Others argued that no single citizen should attain such eminence that he could not be questioned under the laws; that nothing was so essential to equally distributed liberty as that every man, however powerful, should plead his cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What now &mdash;not to mention supreme position in the state &mdash;could be safely entrusted to any man if no accounting could be asked? Against a man, they said, who. cannot brook equitable law, no violence <pb id="p.177"/>is illegal.

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Being bidden to plead his cause, he began so magnificent a speech about his achievements that it was very clear that no man had ever been better eulogized or more truthfully.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that, if the plea of illness were submitted, it was their pleasure that this plea should be accepted and the case adjourned by their colleagues. One of the tribunes of the people at this time was Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus,<note>Cf. XXXVII. vii. 11; he plays an important part in the following chapters.</note> between whom and Publius Scipio there was a feud.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he had forbidden his name to be signed to the decree of his colleagues, and all men were anticipating a harsher proposal, he thus decreed: that, since Lucius Scipio had given illness as the excuse for his brother, this seemed to him sufficient;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that he would not permit Publius Scipio to be prosecuted before he returned to Rome; that even then, if he were appealed to, he would come to Scipio's aid, to save him from pleading his cause:<note>Gracchus would prevent, by the use of his tribunicial powers, a condemnation in Scipio's absence and, on request, any further prosecution.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> such heights had Publius Scipio reached, as a result of his own deeds and of the honours conferred by the Roman people, with the approbation of gods and men, that to compel him to stand as a defendant before the Rostra and listen to the insults <pb id="p.185"/>of young men<note>In later times at least, if not at this time, the prosecution of some prominent person was a means of self-advertisement much sought after by ambitious young men: the careers of Cicero and Caesar illustrate.</note> would be a greater disgrace to the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> Roman people than to Scipio himself.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He supplemented his decree with an indignant speech: <quote>Are your feet, tribunes, to trample down Scipio, that conqueror of Africa?
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Was it for this that he repulsed and routed four of the most noted generals of the Carthaginians in Spain, and four armies?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Was it for this that he captured Syphax, overthrew Hannibal, made Carthage tributary to us, drove Antiochus &mdash;for Lucius Scipio admits his brother to a share in this glory &mdash;beyond the ridges of Taurus, that he should fall a victim to the two Petillii?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Will you allow a victory over Publius Africanus to be sought? Shall distinguished men by no services of their own, by no honours of your bestowal, ever reach a safe and, as it were, sacred citadel where their old age, if not respected, at least secure, may find rest?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both the decree and the supplementary speech touched not only the tribunes but even the prosecutors themselves, and the latter said that they would take counsel as to what their right and duty required. After that, when the assembly of the people had been adjourned, a meeting of the senate began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There boundless gratitude was expressed by the whole order and especially by the senators of consular rank and greater age, because Tiberius Gracchus had shown greater regard for the public interest than for his personal quarrels, and the Petillii were assailed with abuse because they had tried to become conspicuous by darkening another's reputation and were seeking spoils from a triumph over Africanus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thenceforth there was silence regarding Africanus. He spent his life at Liternum, with no desire to <pb id="p.187"/>return to the City;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> when dying<note>One infers from this and from liv. 1 below that the death of Scipio soon followed, but in XXXIX. lii. 1 his death is said to have occurred in <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date> The same uncertainty prevailed regarding his burial-place and the circumstances of his death, on which Livy declines to express an opinion. He gives, however, in chap. lvi. below, some interesting historical criticism which contrasts strangely with his dogmatic statements elsewhere (but note <hi rend="italics">ferunt</hi> in this section).</note> they say that he<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> gave orders that he should be buried in that same place in the country and that his tomb should be erected there, that his funeral might not be held in an ungrateful home-land. He was a man to be remembered, although more to be remembered for his achievements in war than for his deeds in peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The first part of his life was more distinguished than the last, since in his youth he was continually waging wars, while with old age his deeds too faded, nor was any opportunity afforded to display his talent. What was his second consulship compared to the first, even if you add the censorship?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> What was gained by his lieutenancy in Asia, rendered unprofitable as it was by his illness and disfigured by the misfortune<note>Cf.

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nevertheless, since he brought to an end the Punic War, than which there was waged none greater nor more dangerous by the Romans, he has secured a singular pre-eminence of fame.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the death of Africanus the spirits of his
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> adversaries rose, the first of them being Marcus Porcius Cato, who even during his life had been accustomed to snarl at his greatness. It was with his backing, it is thought, that the Petillii initiated the prosecution of Africanus while he lived and after his death introduced a motion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The motion was to this effect: <quote>Do you wish and order,<note>The formula retains the subjunctive even in direct quotation.</note> citizens, with <pb id="p.189"/>respect to the money which was captured from,<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> taken from, levied upon King Antiochus and those who were under his rule, and what of this money has not been accounted for to the state,<note>There was no systematic or effective method of verifying a general's returns of the booty he had collected; one device, of uncertain validity, was seen in the case of Glabrio (XXXVII. lvii. 13-14). The episode of Scipio Nasica (XXXVI. xxxvi. 1-2 and the note) suggests that the senate was either unable to secure accurate information or tolerant of plausible irregularities in the accounts of a general and his quaestor. Yet the fears of Manlius and the investigation which follows of the accounts of the Scipios show that some method existed, although one wonders how the Petillii knew that there were discrepancies in the present instance.</note> that regarding this matter Servius Sulpicius
						<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the city praetor shall refer to the senate the question, whom, of those who are now praetors, the senate wishes to investigate this matter?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This proposal was at first vetoed by Quintus and Lucius Mummius; they deemed it proper that the senate should inquire regarding money which had not been turned in to the treasury in the manner in which it had always been done before.<note>The protest is not against the auditing of the accounts but at the method, which, to judge from similar incidents in Roman history, was designed to increase the probability of a conviction. The Romans were generally intuitively distrustful of special procedures invented for particular situations.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Petillii kept assailing the influential position and tyrannical power of the Scipios in the senate. Lucius Furius Purpurio, a man of consular rank, who had been one of the ten commissioners in Asia, proposed to extend the field of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the investigation to include moneys which had been taken, not only from Antiochus, but from other kings and peoples as well, striking at his enemy Gnaeus Manlius.<note>It is clear from XXXIX. vi. 4 that Manlius was afraid of such an inquiry, although he could say that missing property had been carried off by the Thracians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lucius Scipio also, who was evidently about to speak for himself rather than against the bill, came forward to oppose it. He complained that only after the death of his brother Publius Africanus, a man conspicuous above all for courage and fame, this proposal had originated;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for it was not <pb id="p.191"/>enough that no eulogy had been pronounced before<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> the Rostra over Publius Africanus after his death<note>The habit of pronouncing public <hi rend="italics">laudationes</hi> over distinguished men was very old (II. xlvii. 11, etc.). It would appear from liii. 8 above that Africanus had not wanted such a eulogy.</note> without also bringing charges against him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> even the Carthaginians had been satisfied with the exile of Hannibal, the Roman people was not content even with the death of Publius Scipio without also tearing to shreds his reputation as he lay in the tomb, and, besides, sacrificing his brother as an additional victim to their jealousy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Marcus Cato supported the bill &mdash;and a speech of his on the money of King Antiochus is extant &mdash;and by his influence deterred the tribunes, the Mummii, from further opposing the measure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With their veto withdrawn, therefore, all the tribes voted <quote>aye.</quote><note>The alternative formula <quote><hi rend="italics">uti rogas</hi></quote> is also employed: ef XXXIII. xxv. 7.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Servius Sulpicius then brought up the question of what praetor they wished to have conduct the investigation under the Petillian law, and the Fathers selected Quintus Terentius Culleo.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before this praetor, either so friendly to the Cornelian family that those who say that Publius Scipio died and was buried at Rome &mdash;for this too is reported &mdash;have put it on record that, wearing the cap of freedom, just as he had marched in the triumphal procession,<note>Cf. XXX. xlv. 5. The <hi rend="italics">pilleus</hi> was the conical cap worn by newly-manumitted slaves.</note> he walked also before the bier at the funeral, and at the Porta Capena<note>Cf. lvi. 4 below. The tomb of the Scipios, still to be seen, is close to this gate.</note> served wine and honey to those who attended the funeral, because he had been rescued from
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the enemy by Scipio, along with the other prisoners in Africa, or, on the other hand, so hostile that on account of his well-known unfriendliness the faction which was opposed to the Scipios chose him in preference to anyone else to conduct the investigation;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> at any rate,<note>Livy becomes so involved in his discussion of the partisanship of Culleo that he has to make a fresh start in his sentence.</note> before this praetor, too well or <pb id="p.193"/>too ill disposed, Lucius Scipio was immediately<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> arraigned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same time the names of two of his lieutenants, Aulus and Lucius Hostilius Cato,<note>They have not been mentioned before as <hi rend="italics">legati</hi> of Scipio.</note> were both brought forward and accepted, and that of his quaestor, Gaius Furius Aculeo, and, that everything might seem infected by a conspiracy for peculation, also those of two clerks and an orderly. Lucius Hostilius and the clerks and the orderly were acquitted<note>They were discharged for lack of evidence by the praetor at the preliminary hearing; there seemed to be a <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> case against the others.</note> before the trial of Scipio took place; Scipio and his lieutenant Aulus Hostilius and Gaius Furius were convicted:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the charge was that, in order to secure more favourable terms of peace for Antiochus, Scipio had received six thousand pounds of gold, and four hundred and eighty pounds of silver more than he turned in to the treasury,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> Aulus Hostilius eighty pounds of gold and four hundred and three of silver, the quaestor Furius one hundred and thirty pounds of gold, two hundred of silver. These amounts of gold and silver I have found recorded in the writings of Antias.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the case of Lucius Scipio, I should myself prefer to see an error of the scribe rather than a falsification of the historian<note>Livy is more charitable than on other occasions towards the vagaries of Antias; it is not quite clear what the annalist said about the fine.</note> in the amounts of gold and silver;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for it is more probable that the greater weight would have been of silver and not of gold and that the fine assessed would have been four million sesterces rather than twenty-four million,<note>Reckoning one pound of gold as 4,000 sesterces and one pound of silver as 336 sesterces, 6,000 pounds of gold, leaving the silver out of account, would be 24,000,000 sesterces; reversing the figures, 480 pounds of gold (1,920,000 sesterces) plus 6,000 pounds of silver (2,016,000 sesterces) would produce approximately 4,000,000 sesterces to be recovered by the fine. (I have borrowed these calculations from Weissenborn- M&uuml;ller, from Mommsen and Hultsch.)</note> the more so because there is a tradition<note>This other tradition (Polybius or another annalist) may be the actual source of this criticism of Antias. At any rate, Livy appears at this point to abandon Antias, whom he has followed from 1. 5 above, in favour of another authority. He appears also to go back to Antias at chap. lviii. below.</note> that an
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> accounting for just this <pb id="p.195"/>sum<note>That is, 4,000,000 sesterces.</note> was also demanded in the senate from Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> Scipio himself, and that, when he had directed his brother Lucius to
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> bring the account-book, he had himself, with his own hands, torn it up, being angry
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> that after he had brought two hundred millions into the treasury he should be asked to account for four millions.<note>This anecdote is told also by Polybius (XXIV. ix; he has also the following story), Gellius (IV. xviii. 7-12), <hi rend="italics">Auct. De Vir. III.</hi> (49. 17), all with small variations. Polybius alone mentions definite sums, substituting 3,000 talents and 15,000 talents for those given by Livy. Under the circumstances it seems useless to try to determine whether Polybius or an annalist, probably Claudius, is Livy's source. The following chapter well illustrates the uncertainty which still exists regarding these events.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> With the same self-confidence, they say, when the quaestors did not dare to take money from the treasury<note>No pre-Livian source for this anecdote is known except Polybius; he makes it clear that this episode had nothing to do with the preceding. The impossibility of equating the sums given by Polybius (see the preceding note) with those of Livy leaves it doubtful still whether Polybius is the source for both anecdotes. The second means, of course, that it was due to Scipio that there was any money to be guarded in the treasury.</note> contrary to the law, he demanded the keys and said that he would open the treasury who had brought it to pass that it was closed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Much else is said, especially about the end of Scipio's life, his trial, his death, his funeral, his tomb, all so contradictory that I find no tradition, no written documents, which I can accept.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There is no unanimity as to his accuser: some say that Marcus Naevius<note>Naevius was tribune in <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. lii. 4 below).</note> accused him, others the Petillii; there is no agreement as to the time when he was prosecuted nor as to the year when he died<note>Livy returns to this question in dealing with the year <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date> (XXXIX. lii.).</note> nor as to where he died or was buried; some say that both death and burial took place at Rome, others at Liternum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In both places tombs and statues are shown;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for at Liternum<note>Seneca, writing to Lucilius from Scipio's villa at Liternum, says . . . <hi rend="italics">ara quam sepulchrum esse tanti viri suspicor</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi> LXXXVI. 1). Strabo (p. 243) also mentions the tomb, but there seems to be no other reference to the statue of which Livy speaks.</note> there is a tomb and a statue placed upon <pb id="p.197"/>the tomb, which I myself saw recently, shattered by<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> a storm, and at Rome, outside the Porta Capena, in the tomb of the Scipios, there are three statues, two of which are said to represent Publius and Lucius Scipio, the third the poet Quintus Ennius.<note>No inscriptions to Publius or Lucius Scipio and no identifiable statue of either has been found in the Scipio tomb. The bust which some suppose to be that of Ennius exists in the Vatican Museum.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Not only is there disagreement among historians, but the speeches also (if indeed those which are in circulation are genuine works of these men) of Publius Scipio<note>Cicero (<hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi> 77) had few specimens of Scipio's style, but he quotes a punning fragment from a speech against Naevius (<hi rend="italics">quid hoc Naevio ignavius</hi>: De Or. II. 249). But Livy (sect. 6 below) says that Naevius was not mentioned in the speech itself. There is a slight indication that Livy and Gellius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>) read the same speech, since Livy says that Scipio called his accuser <hi rend="italics">nebulonem,</hi> and this word occurs in the direct quotation given by Gellius.</note> and Tiberius Gracchus<note>This speech is otherwise unknown.</note> are inconsistent with one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The <hi rend="italics">index</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">index</hi> was a tag fastened to the projecting end of the rod on which the roll was wound, containing the title of the work contained in that roll.</note> of the speech of Publius Scipio contains the name of Marcus Naevius, tribune of the people; the speech itself lacks the name of the accuser; it calls him now <quote>a ne'er-do-well,</quote> now <quote>a no-good.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor does the speech of Gracchus make any mention at all either of the Petillii as accusers of Africanus or of the prosecution of Africanus. Another entirely different story must be put together, consistent with the oration of Gracchus,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and those writers must be followed who say that, when Lucius Scipio was both accused and convicted of receiving money from the king, Africanus was serving on a commission in Etruria;<note>Nothing further is known of this commission, although Gellius (VI. (VII.) xix) tells the rest of the story, with greater detail.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that, leaving this post after receiving the news of his brother's downfall, he hastened to Rome, and when he had gone from the gate straight to the Forum, because it was said that his brother was being put in chains, that he drove the messenger from him, and that when the tribunes tried to stop him he attacked them, with more <pb id="p.199"/>affection for his-brother than respect for the laws.<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For it is just this conduct that Tiberius Gracchus complains of &mdash;that the tribunicial power had been infringed by a private citizen, and at the end, when he promised his official assistance to Lucius Scipio, he added that it seemed to be a more endurable precedent that a tribune of the people rather than a private citizen should have overthrown both the tribunicial power and the state.<note>The presumable situation was this: L. Scipio had been condemned by a tribune to pay a fine; in default of bond he would be imprisoned and could be released only by another tribune; Gracchus finally assumed the responsibility of freeing him after Africanus had committed his assault.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But this one act of uncontrolled violence on Scipio's part he loaded with reproaches in such a way that, taunting him because he had fallen so far below his own standards, he paid him, as compensation for his criticism of the moment, lasting and accumulated praises for his integrity and self-command; for he said that the people had once been rebuked by Scipio because they wished to make him perpetual<note>Valerius Maximus (IV. i. 6) tells a similar story, but the occasion of the rebuke is unknown.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that he forbade statues to himself to be erected in the Comitium, on the Rostra, in the Curia, on the Capitoline, in the cell of Jupiter;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that he prevented also a decree that his image in triumphal dress should appear to be coming out of the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.<note>Appian (<hi rend="italics">Iber.</hi> 23) reports that this was done despite the protests of Scipio.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such statements, even if included in a eulogy, would indicate the unusual greatness of a soul which restricted distinctions to conformity with a democratic constitution, and they were made by an enemy and accompanied by censure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To this Gracchus the younger of Scipio's two daughters &mdash;for the elder was betrothed to Publius Cornelius Nasica <pb id="p.201"/>and beyond doubt by her father &mdash;was married, as all<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> agree.<note>They were the parents of the famous tribunes.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What is not certain is whether she was both betrothed and married after the death of her father, or whether the opinions are true, that Gracchus, when Lucius Scipio was being taken to prison and no one of his colleagues was coming to his assistance, swore that his feud
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> with the Scipios continued as before and that he was doing nothing to curry favour, but that he would not permit the brother of Africanus to be put into that prison into which he had seen Publius Africanus thrusting kings and generals of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The story goes on that the senate, which chanced to dine that day on the Capitoline,<note>Probably in connection with some religious festival.</note> had risen up and begged that during the banquet Africanus should betroth his daughter to Gracchus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the contract had been duly made at this public ceremony and Scipio had returned home, he told his wife Aemilia that he had arranged a marriage for their younger daughter. When she, being irritated, as a woman would naturally be, that he had not consulted with her about
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the daughter of both of them, had added that not even if he were promising her to Tiberius Gracchus should the mother have been excluded from the deliberation,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Scipio, they say, rejoicing at their harmony of opinion, replied that it was to Gracchus that he had betrothed her.<note>Whether this is anything more than a pleasant story which Livy had picked up somewhere or not, it is probably characteristic of the conduct of the Roman aristocracy at this period.</note> However much at variance are these accounts of so great a man, they have seemed worthy of presentation.<note>With this anecdote Livy concludes his parenthetical miscellany and returns to the narrative based on Valerius Antias: cf. the note to Iv. 10 above.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the trials<note>Livy seems to be technically correct in his terminology. The <hi rend="italics">iudicium</hi> was the trial proper, as distinguished from the preliminary hearing: cf. Iv. 5 above and the note.</note> had been completed by Quintus Terentius the praetor, Hostilius and Furius, who were convicted, gave bond the same day to the <pb id="p.203"/>City quaestors;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when Scipio protested that all the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> money which he had received was in the treasury and that he had no public property, they proceeded to put him in prison.<note>Execution of judgment on the person of the condemned was permitted when he had or claimed to have no property and did not furnish bond.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Publius Scipio Nasica appealed to the tribunes and delivered a speech full of deserved tributes, not only to the Cornelian <hi rend="italics">gens</hi> as a whole, but specifically to his own family.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The fathers, he said, both of himself and of Publius Africanus and the Lucius Scipio who was being imprisoned, were Gnaeus and Publius Scipio, men of the highest distinction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After they had, through many years in the land of Spain, against many generals and armies alike of Carthaginians and Spaniards, increased the fame of the Roman name, not only in war but because they had given those peoples an
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> example of Roman self-control and devotion, both had in the end met death for their fatherland.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While it would have been enough, he continued, to maintain for posterity their standard of glory, Publius Africanus had so far surpassed his father's praises that he had given reason to believe that he was born, not of human blood, but of divine stock.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lucius Scipio, whose fate was now in question, not to mention what he had done in Spain, in Africa, while serving as his brother's lieutenant, had, as consul, been deemed by the senate worthy to have decreed to him, without recourse to the lot, the province of Asia and the war with King Antiochus, and had been deemed by his brother worthy to be attended to Asia by that brother as his lieutenant, after he had been twice consul and censor and had celebrated a triumph.<note>Cf. XXXVII i. 9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There, that the greatness and glory of the lieutenant might not obscure the consul's fame, it happened that, on the day when <pb id="p.205"/>Lucius Scipio defeated Antiochus in pitched battle<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> at Magnesia, Publius Scipio was sick at Elaea, some days' journey away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That army, he went on, was no smaller than that of Hannibal, with which they had fought in Africa; that same Hannibal,<note>Cf. XXXVII. xli. 1 and the note.</note> who had been commander in the Punic War, was there among many other generals of the king. And the war indeed had been so conducted that no one could find fault even with fortune; it was in the peace that ground for accusation was sought; the peace, they said, had been sold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On this point, he maintained, the ten commissioners were likewise accused, by whose advice the peace had been concluded;<note>This is one of the minor mysteries in this affair: Livy's narrative shows that their dealings had been entirely with Manlius, who, as a matter of fact, had far more opportunity to convert tribute and booty to his own use than Scipio had had. The following sentence is almost conclusive proof that the Scipios were victims of political animus, regardless of their actual guilt or innocence.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> although some of the ten commissioners had come forward to accuse Gnaeus Manlius, this charge had failed, not only to win belief in his guilt, but even to delay his triumph.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But, by Hercules, they say in the case of Scipio that the very terms of peace were suspicious, as too favourable to Antiochus; for it was implied that his kingdom had been left undiminished; that after his defeat he possessed everything he had owned before the war;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that, although he had had a great quantity of gold and silver, none of it had been turned in to the treasury, all of it converted to private use;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but (as to the last charge) had not so much gold and silver been displayed before the eyes of all in the triumph of Lucius Scipio as had not been carried in ten other triumphs if they were combined into one?<note>Cf. XXXVII. lix. 2-5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For what (returning to their first charge) shall I say <pb id="p.207"/>about the boundaries of the kingdom of Antiochus?<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had held, as we know, all Asia and the adjacent parts of Europe. How great this section of the earth is, extending from the Taurus mountain clear to the Aegean Sea, how many cities and even nations it contains, all men know.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This region, extending in length more than thirty days' march and ten in width between the two seas, as far as the crest of the Taurus mountain, had been taken from Antiochus, who had been driven back into the farthest corner of the earth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What more could have been taken from him by a peace granted without a bribe? Macedonia, he reminded them, had been left to Philip after his defeat, Lacedaemon to Nabis, nor had Quinctius been the victim of a trumped-up charge; he, of course, had not had Africanus as a brother; although his fame should have aided Lucius Scipio, his unpopularity had done him harm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Judgment had been given that so much gold and silver had been conveyed into the house of Lucius Scipio as the sale of all his property could not produce. Where, then, he asked, was the royal gold, where all the legacies he had received?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In a house which extravagance had not drained, this heap of new wealth should be apparent. But, of course, what cannot be obtained from his property the foes of Lucius Scipio will seek from his body and from his back, by means of persecution and insults, so that this most distinguished man may be shut up in prison among thieves of the night and brigands and may die in the: darkness of a cell and then be cast out naked before the prison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And it was not, he concluded, to the Cornelian family so much as to the City of Rome that this would bring the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> blush of shame.</p> <pb id="p.209"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In reply to this the praetor Terentius read the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> Petillian law and the decree of the senate and the sentence which had been passed on Lucius Scipio;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> unless the fine which was imposed was paid to the treasury there was nothing which he could do except to order the convicted man to be arrested and taken to prison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the tribunes had withdrawn for consultation, a little later Gaius Fannius announced that, in accordance with the decision of himself and his colleagues except Gracchus, the tribunes would not interfere with the praetor so as to prevent his exercise of his authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Tiberius Gracchus thus decreed: that he would not prevent the praetor from collecting, out of the property of Lucius Scipio, the fine that had been imposed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius Scipio himself, who had conquered the richest king in the world, extended the empire of the Roman people to the most distant limits of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the earth, bound King Eumenes, the Rhodians, and so many cities of Asia by obligations to the Roman people, had led in his triumph and thrown into prison so many leaders of the enemy, he would not permit to lie in prison and in chains among the enemies of the Roman people, and he ordered him to be released.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This decree was listened to with such applause and with such joy did men see Scipio released that it scarcely seemed that the trial had taken place in the same state. Then the praetor sent the quaestors to take possession, on behalf of the state, of the property of Lucius Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Not only was there no trace of the king's wealth discovered, but by no means was there as much property found as would equal the amount of the fine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Such a sum was raised for Lucius Scipio by his relatives and friends and clients that if he had <pb id="p.211"/>received it he would have been a great deal richer<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> than he had been before his downfall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He accepted none of it; what was necessary for a decent existence was redeemed for him by his nearest relatives; and the ill-will against the Scipios ended by recoiling upon the heads of the praetor and his advisers and the accusers.<note>It has seemed unwise to attempt any further reconstruction of these scenes in the drama of the Scipios. Livy is unusually conscious of the contradictions and difficulties of the story without being able to solve the problems they create. Excessive space would be required to discuss these problems adequately, and the results would be incommensurate with the effort required.</note></p>

				<p>The consul Marcus Fulvius besieged the Ambraciots
					in Epirus and received their surrender, subdued Cephallania, and granted peace to the conquered Aetolians.
					Gnaeus Manlius his colleague defeated the Gallogrecians,
					that is, the Tolostobogii, the Tectosagi and the Trocmi,
					who had crossed into Asia under the leadership of Brennus,
					when they alone of the peoples on this side of the Taurus
					mountain did not offer submission. Their origin and
					the manner in which they gained control of the districts
					which they hold are recorded. An example also of virtue
					and chastity in a woman is reported. She, being the
					wife of the king of the Gallogrecians, and being a prisoner,
					slew a centurion who had violated her. The <hi rend="italics">lustrum</hi> was
					closed by the censors. The number of citizens rated was
					two hundred and fifty-eight thousand three hundred and
					ten. A treaty of friendship was concluded with Ariarathes,
					king of Cappadocia. Gnaeus Manlius, despite the opposition
					of the ten commissioners by whose advice he had put
					into form the treaty with Antiochus, having pleaded his
					cause in person before the senate, triumphed over the
					Gallogrecians. Scipio Africanus, having been accused, as
					some say, by Quintus Petillius the tribune of the people,
					as others say, by Naevius, on the ground that he had
					cheated the treasury of booty taken from Antiochus,
					when the day came and he was summoned to the Rostra,
					said: <quote>On this day, citizens, I conquered Carthage,</quote>
					and with the people attending him ascended the Capitoline.
					Then, to avoid being further annoyed by the attacks of
					the tribunes, he withdrew to Liternum in voluntary
					exile. It is uncertain whether he died there or in Rome;
					<pb id="p.215"/>
					for there was a tomb to him in each place. Lucius Scipio
					Asiaticus, the brother of Africanus, was accused and
					convicted on the same charge of embezzlement, and,
					when he was being led to chains and prison, Tiberius
					Sempronius Gracchus, tribune of the people, who had
					formerly been an enemy of the Scipios, intervened for
					him, and in return for that act of kindness was given the
					daughter of Africanus in marriage. When the quaestors
					had been sent to take possession, on behalf of the state,
					of the property of Scipio, not only was there no trace of
					the king's wealth discovered, but by no means was there
					as much found as would equal the amount of the fine.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were going on at Rome, if<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> indeed they did happen that year,<note>The allusion is to the uncertainty as to the date of the trial of the Scipios: cf. XXXVIII. lvi. 2 above.</note> both consuls were waging war against the Ligurians.<note>The assignment of Liguria to the consuls was reported at XXXVIII. xliii. 8 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This enemy was born, as it were, to keep alive the military discipline of the Romans during the intervals between their great wars; nor did any province do more to put an edge to the soldier's courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For Asia, on account of the pleasantness of its cities and the abundance of its treasures of land and sea and the feebleness of the enemy and the wealth of its kings, made armies richer rather than braver.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Especially under the command of Gnaeus Manlius was discipline slackly and indifferently enforced;<note>This charge was not made in the speech of Furius Aemilius (XXXVIII. xlv. &mdash;xlvi. above), but is brought up again in vi. 5 and vii. 3 below. Its presence here, in contrast with its absence from the preceding Book, may indicate a change of source.</note> and so a somewhat more difficult advance in Thrace and a rather more effective enemy had taught them a lesson with great
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> slaughter. Among the Ligurians there was everything to keep an army alert &mdash;hilly and rough ground, which was difficult both for the men themselves to occupy and to dislodge the enemy who had already occupied it, and roads difficult, narrow, dangerous by reason of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> ambuscades; an enemy lightly equipped, mobile and unexpected in his movements, who permitted no time or place whatever to be quiet or <pb id="p.221"/>safe; the besieging of fortified points was necessary<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> and at the same time toilsome and dangerous; the district was poor, which constrained the soldiers to simple living and offered them little plunder. Accordingly, no civilian camp-follower went along, no long train of pack-animals stretched out the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> column. There was nothing except arms and men who placed all their trust in their
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> arms. Nor was there ever wanting either the occasion or the cause for war with them, because on account of their poverty at home they were constantly raiding their neighbours' lands. And yet the fighting never brought about the final settlement of a campaign.<note>This reflection seems to be fully warranted by Livy's narrative, and raises doubts as to the legitimacy of some of the Ligurian triumphs, which were still notorious in Cicero's day (<hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi> 255).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul Gaius Flaminius, having fought several successful battles with the Ligurian Friniates<note>The Friniates lived mainly south of the Apennines.</note> on their own soil, received the tribe in surrender and disarmed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they were reproved because they did not surrender the arms in good faith, they abandoned their villages and fled to the Auginus mountain. The consul followed in haste.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But they scattered again, the largest part being unarmed, and fled at full speed through pathless country and over steep cliffs where the enemy could not pursue. So they departed across the Apennines. Those who remained in camp were surrounded and captured. Thence the legions were led across the Apennines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There the enemy defended themselves for a while by virtue of the height of the mountain which they had occupied, but presently yielded in surrender. At this time the arms were sought out with greater diligence, and all were taken from them. The war was then transferred to the Ligurian Apuani,<note>The Apuani lived west of the Apennines. A raid covering all the country between Pisa and Bologna was an ambitious undertaking.</note> who <pb id="p.223"/>had raided the lands of Pisa and Bologna to such<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> effect that they could not be cultivated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having subdued them too, the consul granted peace to their neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And, because he had brought it to pass that the province was free from war, that he might not leave his army idle, he built a road from Bologna to Arezzo.<note>If, as seems probable, there was already a road from Arezzo to Rome, the new road provided a route to Gaul shorter than the Via Flaminia (built in <date value="-220">220 B.C.</date> by the father of the present consul) and the Via Aemilia (see sect. 10 below), by way of Ariminum.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The other consul, Marcus Aemilius, burned and ravaged the farms and villages of the Ligurians which were in the plains or valleys, the people themselves holding the two mountains Ballista and Suismontium. Then, attacking the men who were on the mountains, he first wore them out with small skirmishes, then forced
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> them to come down to face his battle-line and defeated them in a regular battle, in the course of which he vowed a temple to Diana.<note>In XL. lii. 1-3, Aemilius, as censor in <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date>, received an appropriation for games in connection with the dedication of temples to Diana and Juno Regina (sect. 11 below). Both were near the Circus Flaminius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Having subdued all the tribes on this side of the Apennines, Aemilius then attacked those beyond the mountains &mdash;among whom there were those Ligurian Friniates also whom Gaius Flaminius had not visited &mdash;and subdued them all, took away their arms and transferred the population from the hills to the plains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Leaving the Ligurians pacified, he led his army into Gallic territory, and built a road from Placentia to Ariminum, in order to make a junction with the Via Flaminia. In the final encounter in which he engaged the Ligurians in a pitched battle, he vowed a temple to Juno Regina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Such were the events of that year among the Ligurians.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Gaul the praetor Marcus Furius, seeking in peace the appearance of war, had disarmed the <pb id="p.225"/>Cenomani,<note>The Cenomani had been quiet since their defeat by Cethegus in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxiii. 4).</note> who had given no provocation:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> they in<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> consequence laid a complaint about this before the senate at Rome, and were referred to the consul Aemilius, whom the senate had authorized to investigate and decide, and after engaging in great contention with the praetor won their case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The praetor was ordered to restore their arms to the Cenomani and to leave the province.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then ambassadors from the allies of the Latin confederacy, who had assembled from all Latium in great numbers from every side, were granted an audience by the senate. When they complained that a great number of their citizens had migrated to Rome and had been assessed there,<note>The allied cities and the Latin colonies, whose status was similar, were under obligations to Rome, in accordance with their several treaties and constitutions. The migration of their citizens to Rome increased the burden on those who remained at home; the status of the migrants is uncertain: they seem not to have acquired Roman citizenship and yet to have been assessed by the censors.</note> Quintus Terentius Culleo the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> praetor was instructed to search them out, and, on receiving from the allies proof that any person or the father of such person<note>Since only heads of families were listed, the omission of this provision would have opened the door to persons who moved to Rome in the lifetimes of their fathers.</note> had been assessed among the allies in the censorship of Gaius Claudius and Marcus Livius<note>They were censors in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> The date chosen was probably arbitrary and the result of compromise.</note> or after that censorship, to compel such persons to return to the places where they had been registered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As a consequence of this investigation twelve thousand of the Latins returned home, for even at that time a multitude of aliens was burdening the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the consuls returned to Rome, the proconsul Marcus Fulvius returned from Aetolia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and when the senate, in the temple of Apollo, had heard him describe his exploits in Aetolia and Cephallania, he asked the Fathers, if they deemed it proper, by <pb id="p.227"/>reason of his successful and fortunate conduct of the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> business of the state, both to order that honour should be paid to the immortal gods and to decree a triumph to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcus Aburius, tribune of the people, announced that, if any decree on that subject were passed prior to the arrival of Marcus Aemilius, he would veto it: Aemilius, he said, wished to speak against it, and on his departure to his province had given instructions to him, the tribune, that this whole discussion should be reserved for his return.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Fulvius, he said, was suffering the loss of time only: even with the consul present the senate would decree what he wished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then Fulvius replied: if either the quarrel between him and Marcus Aemilius was unknown to men, or if it was unknown with what uncontrollable and almost tyrannical passion Aemilius carried on the feud, even then it would have been unendurable that the absent consul should both stand in the way of the honour due to
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the immortal gods and delay an earned and merited triumph, and that a general after a brilliant campaign and a victorious army with its booty and prisoners should stand
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> before the gates until it suited the fancy of a consul (who stayed away for just that reason) to return to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But as a matter of fact, he went on, since his quarrel with the consul was very well known, what justice could be expected from a man who had deposited in the treasury a decree of the senate passed stealthily and in a poorly attended meeting, to the effect that Ambracia did not appear to have been taken by force, although it had been besieged with
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> a mound and sheds, where other works were built anew when the first were burned, where the battle had raged <pb id="p.229"/>around the walls for fifteen days, above and below<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> the ground, where from daylight, after the soldiers had already scaled the walls, until nightfall the battle had been maintained with uncertain issue, and where more than three thousand of the enemy had perished?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, too, as to the plundering of the temples of the immortal gods in the captured city, what kind of insult was it that he had turned the booty over to the pontiffs?<note>I have filled out the suspected lacuna in what seems the simplest way consistent with grammar and sense. Madvig takes the passage to mean that spoils captured by Fulvius would bestow fame upon the pontiffs when they used them in the decoration of temples. The action referred to is the decree reported in XXXVIII. xliv. 5 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Unless it had been lawful to adorn the City with the trophies of Syracuse and other
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> captured towns, but that in the case of captured Ambracia alone the law of war did not hold good!
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He begged the conscript Fathers and he requested of the tribune that they should not permit him to be made a laughing-stock by this most insolent personal enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Everybody from all sides began to address the tribune, some with entreaties, some with reproaches.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The argument of his colleague Tiberius Gracchus impressed him most. He said that it was not a good precedent to follow up even one's own contentions while holding a magistracy; but it was disgraceful for a tribune of the people to take sides in the contentions of others, and unworthy of the authority of that college and of its sacred laws.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Each man, he said, in accordance with his own judgment should both hate or love men and approve or disapprove measures, should not depend upon another's expression and nod or be led this way or that under the pressure of another's will, nor should a tribune of the people be a second<note><hi rend="italics">Adstipulari</hi> is at least semi-technical, implying giving support to a legal proceeding.</note> to an angry consul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he should not remember any commission which Marcus Aemilius had privately<note>The consul had no right to issue official orders of this sort to the tribune.</note> entrusted to him, and forget the office of tribune which had been <pb id="p.231"/>entrusted to him by the Roman people, and entrusted<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> for the purpose of rendering assistance to and protecting the liberty of private citizens, not of bolster ing up the consular authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Aburius, he said, did not even see that the result would be that tradition and posterity would have the story how in the same college one of two tribunes of the people had laid aside his own enmities for
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the sake of the state, the other had assumed and carried on those of another because they had been entrusted to him.<note>The first tribune is, of course, Gracchus himself.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the tribune, overcome by this criticism, had left the temple, after the question was raised by Serv. Sulpicius, praetor, the triumph was voted to Marcus Fulvius. When he had thanked the conscript Fathers, he went on to say that he had vowed the Great Games to Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the day when he had captured Ambracia, that for this purpose a hundred pounds of gold had been contributed by the cities;<note>Neither the vow nor the contribution has been mentioned before. The celebration of the games is reported at xxii. 1 below.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he requested that, from this money which he had planned to display in his triumph and then deposit in the treasury, this particular sum should, by their order, be kept separate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senate ordered the college of pontiffs to be consulted whether it was necessary to spend this entire sum on the games.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the pontiffs had replied that from the point of view of religion it was immaterial how much should be spent on the games, the senate granted permission to Fulvius for whatever amount he should spend, provided that he did not exceed a total of eighty thousand sesterces.<note>The denomination of the coins is omitted. If the allowance was 80,000 sesterces, as is probable, only twenty pounds of gold would be used; 80,000 <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> would amount to eighty pounds. In either case, one wonders what became of the balance. The senate's decree probably did not forbid the expenditure of private funds in addition.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He had decided to triumph in the month of January;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> but when he had heard that the consul Marcus Aemilius, having received a letter from Marcus Aburius about the withdrawal of the veto, was himself coming to Rome <pb id="p.233"/>to hinder the triumph, but had been detained on the<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> way by illness, he advanced the date, lest he have more strife in the triumph than in the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He triumphed the tenth day before the Kalends of January over the Aetolians and over Cephallania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Golden crowns of one hundred and twelve pounds<note>It is always uncertain whether <hi rend="italics">pondo</hi> should be read in such passages, and I have followed in each case what seems to be the most trustworthy reading of the MSS. The additional complication exists in this instance, that Livy has already recorded (XXXVIII. ix. 13 above) the gift of a single crown weighing 150 pounds, but we do not know that this was to be carried in the procession, nor whether the gift for the games should be included. See also the note to the passage just quoted.</note> in weight were carried before his car; he displayed also eighty-three thousand pounds of silver, two hundred and forty-three pounds of gold, one hundred and eighteen thousand Attic four-drachma pieces, twelve thousand three hundred and twenty-two coins
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> called <quote>Philippei,</quote><note>Cf. XXXVII. lix. 4 and the note.</note> bronze statues to the number of seven hundred and eighty-five and two hundred and thirty of marble, weapons, javelins and other spoils taken from the enemy, in great quantities, besides catapults, ballistae and every variety of artillery;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> there marched also generals, whether Aetolians and Cephallanians or commanders of the king left there by Antiochus, to the number of twenty-seven. On that day, before he rode into the City, in the Circus Flaminius,<note>This circus was probably the only enclosure of suitable size which lay outside the <hi rend="italics">pomerium.</hi></note> he presented many tribunes, prefects, cavalrymen and centurions, Romans and allies, with military decorations.<note>The generosity of Fulvius in this respect was severely criticized by Cato (Gellius V. vi. 24-25, where a fragment of a speech is preserved).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> To the soldiers, out of the booty, he gave twenty-five <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> each, twice that amount to each centurion, and thrice to each cavalryman.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The time for the consular elections was now at hand; for these, since Marcus Aemilius, to whom <pb id="p.235"/>this responsibility had fallen by lot, was unable to<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> come, Gaius Flaminius came to Rome. He announced the choice of Spurius Postumius Albinus and Quintus Marcius Philippus as consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then the praetors were elected, Titus Maenius, Publius Cornelius Sulla, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Marcus Licinius Lucullus, Gaius Aurelius Scaurus, Lucius Quinctius Crispinus.<note>It may be accidental that so many of the names on this list are relatively unfamiliar; it may also be true that conditions had made the Romans somewhat distrustful of the families that had been exercising political and military leadership and had encouraged them to look elsewhere for talent.</note></p> 
				<p>At the end of the year, when the new magistrates had already been elected, on the third day before the Nones of March, Gnaeus Manlius Volso triumphed over the Gauls who inhabit Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His purpose in delaying so long to celebrate his triumph was to avoid pleading his cause under the Petillian
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> law before the praetor Quintus Terentius Culleo and being himself consumed in the flames of another's trial, in which Lucius Scipio had been condemned,<note>Manlius probably had good reason to fear prosecution, especially before Culleo, who had displayed his inflexibility in the trial of Scipio. Until his triumph Manlius was outside the City and exempt from prosecution by virtue of his proconsulship; in the brief interval between the triumph and the Ides (when a new praetor would succeed Culleo) a trial could not be completed. See the notes to XXXVIII. liv. 3; 7; lviii. 12 above.</note> seeing that the jurors were far more hostile to him than to Scipio because it was rumoured
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> that he, when he succeeded Scipio, had ruined the military discipline, strictly maintained by his predecessor, by permitting every kind of licence. Nor was this only a matter of unfavourable report of what was said to have happened in the province, far from their eyes, but still more of what was apparent every day among his soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the beginnings of foreign luxury were introduced into the City by the army from Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They for the first time imported into Rome couches of bronze, valuable robes for coverlets, tapestries and other products of the loom, and what at that time was considered luxurious furniture &mdash;tables with one <pb id="p.237"/>pedestal and sideboards.<note>Pliny (XXXIV. 14) derives from the annalist Piso a similar list of articles of luxury first imported at this time. It does not necessarily follow that Piso was Livy's source also.</note> Then female players of<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> the lute and the harp and other festal delights of entertainments<note>He probably includes dancing-girls, buffoons, and the like.</note> were made adjuncts to banquets; the banquets themselves, moreover, began to be planned with both greater care and greater expense.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At that time the cook, to the ancient Romans the most worthless of slaves, both in their judgment of values and in the use they made of him, began to have value, and what had been merely a necessary service came to be regarded as an art.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Yet those things which were then looked upon as remarkable were hardly even the germs of the luxury to come.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In his triumph Gnaeus Manlius carried two hundred and twelve golden crowns, two hundred and twenty thousand pounds of silver, two thousand one hundred and three pounds of gold, of Attic four-drachma pieces one hundred and twenty-seven thousand, of <hi rend="italics">cistophori</hi><note>Cf. XXXVII. xlvi. 3.</note> two hundred and fifty thousand, of gold <hi rend="italics">Philippei</hi> sixteen thousand three hundred and twenty; there were also arms and many Gallic spoils transported in carts, and fifty-two leaders of the enemy led before his car.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the soldiers he gave forty-two <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> each, twice that amount to each centurion and thrice to each cavalryman, and he gave them also double pay;<note>The grammar of the sentence is peculiar and there is corruption in the text. I have given what seems to be the most reasonable translation.</note> many of all ranks, presented with military decorations, followed his car.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Such songs were sung by the soldiers about their commander that it was easily seen that they were sung about an indulgent leader who sought popularity, and that the triumph was <pb id="p.239"/>marked more by the applause of the military than<note type="margin">B.C. 187</note> of the civil population.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the friends of Manlius were able to curry favour with the people as well;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> at their instance a decree of the senate was passed that, with regard to the tax<note>This <hi rend="italics">stipendium</hi> may have been some extraordinary tax, paid in an emergency and regarded as a loan to the treasury, analogous to the contribution mentioned in XXVI. xxxvi. 8 (cf. XXIX. xvi. 1; XXXI. xiii. 2-9; XXXIII. xlii. 2). Nothing further is known of it, and no translation can be more than a guess.</note> which had been paid by the people into the treasury, whatever portion of this was in arrears should be paid out of the money which had been carried in the triumph. The city quaestors, displaying fidelity and diligence, paid twenty-five and one-half <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each per thousand <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi><note>It is not clear whether this is a final payment, a payment on account, or a favourable composition with creditors.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Fathers, disturbed by this omen, voted, first, that one day should be added to the Games, and, second, that two statues should be set up in place of one and the new one gilded.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following year diverted the consuls<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> Spurius Postumius Albinus and Quintus Marcius Philippus from the army and the administration of wars and provinces to the suppression of an internal conspiracy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The praetors drew lots for their provinces, Titus Maenius receiving the city jurisdiction, Marcus Licinius Lucullus that between citizens and aliens, Gaius Aurelius Scaurus Sardinia, Publius Cornelius Sulla Sicily, Lucius Quinctius Crispinus Nearer Spain, Gaius Calpurnius Piso Farther Spain. To both consuls the investigation of secret conspiracies was decreed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A nameless Greek came first to Etruria, possessed of none of those many arts which the Greek people, supreme as it is in learning, brought to us in numbers for the cultivation of mind and body, but a dabbler in sacrifices and a fortune-teller;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> nor was he one who, by frankly disclosing his creed and publicly proclaiming both his profession and his system, filled minds with error, but a priest of secret rites performed by night.<note>Rome's treatment of the Christians illustrates her general attitude towards meetings conducted with any degree of concealment.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were initiatory rites which at first were imparted to a few, then began to be generally known among men and women. To the religious element in them were added the delights of wine and feasts, that the minds of a larger number might be attracted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When wine had inflamed their minds, and night and the mingling of males with females, youth with age, had destroyed every sentiment of modesty, all varieties of corruption first began to be practised, since each one had at hand the pleasure answering to that to which his nature was more inclined.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was not one form of vice alone, the promiscuous matings of free men and women, but perjured witnesses, forged seals and wills and evidence, all issued from this same <pb id="p.243"/>workshop: likewise poisonings and secret murders, so that at times not even the bodies were found for burial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Much was ventured by craft, more by violence. This violence was concealed because amid the howlings and the crash of drums and cymbals no cry of the sufferers could be heard as the debauchery and murders proceeded.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The destructive power of this evil spread from Etruria to Rome like the contagion of a pestilence. At first the size of the City, with abundant room and tolerance for such evils, concealed it: at length information came to the consul Postumius in about this manner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Aebutius, whose father had performed his military service with a horse supplied by the state,<note>He was an <hi rend="italics">eques equo publico,</hi> receiving an annual allowance for the purchase and upkeep of his mounts.</note> was left a ward, and later, on the death of his guardians, was brought under the tutelage of his mother Duronia and his stepfather Titus Sempronius Rutilus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His mother was devoted to her husband, and his stepfather, who had so administered his guardianship that he could not render an accounting,<note>A <hi rend="italics">tutor</hi> rendered to the court which appointed him an account of his administration of the property, at least when the ward came of age.</note> desired that the ward should either be done away with or be made dependent upon them by some tie. The one method of corrupting him was through the Bacchanalia. The mother addressed the young man: while he was sick, she said, she had vowed for him that as soon as he had recovered she would initiate him into the Bacchic rites; being compelled, by the kindness of the gods, to pay her vow,<note>A vow, to a Roman, created a quasi-contractual obligation, which was as effective as the sentence of a court: hence <hi rend="italics">damnatam voti.</hi></note> she wished to fulfil it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For ten days, she continued, he must practise continence: on the tenth day she would conduct him to the banquet and then, after ritual purification,<note>Paulus Diaconus (p. 248) defines <hi rend="italics">pure lautum</hi> as <hi rend="italics">aqua pura lautum.</hi></note> to the shrine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was a <pb id="p.245"/>wellknown courtesan, a freedwoman named Hispala<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> Faecenia, not worthy<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi> worthy of something better.</note> of the occupation to which, while still a mere slave, she had accustomed herself, and even after she had been manumitted she maintained herself in the same way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Between her and Aebutius, since they were neighbours, an intimacy developed, not at all damaging either to the young man's fortune or to his reputation; for he had been loved and sought out without any effort on his part, and, since his own relatives made provision for all his needs on a very small scale, he was maintained by the generosity of the courtesan.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> More than that, she had gone so far, under the influence of their intimacy, that, after the death of her patron, since she was under the legal control of no one, having petitioned the tribunes and the praetor for a guardian, when she made her will she had instituted Aebutius as her sole heir.<note>A freedwoman was subject to the <hi rend="italics">manus</hi> of her patron, who was often her former owner. Faecenia had no patron and no relative who would naturally assume the responsibilities of guardianship, and could therefore petition the praetor and the tribunes jointly for the appointment of a <hi rend="italics">tutor,</hi> whose approval was necessary to the performance of any legal act, such as making a will.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Since there were these bonds of affection between them, and neither had any secrets from the other, the young man jestingly told her not to be surprised if he were away from her for several nights: as a matter of religious duty, he said, to free himself from a vow made for the sake of his health, he intended to be initiated in the Bacchic rites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the woman heard this she exclaimed in great distress, <quote>The gods forbid!</quote> She said that it would be much better both for him and for her to die rather than do that; and she called down curses and vengeance upon the heads of those persons who had given him this counsel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Wondering both at her language and at her so manifest distress, the young man bade her spare her curses: it was his mother, he said, with the approval of his stepfather, who had ordered it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.247"/><quote>Your stepfather, then,</quote> she replied, <quote>is making<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> haste &mdash;for perhaps it is not right to accuse your mother &mdash;to destroy in this way your virtue, your reputation and your life.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As he marvelled the more and asked her what she meant, beseeching gods and goddesses for peace and forgiveness if, compelled by her love for him, she had declared what should be concealed, she told him that while she was a slave she had attended her mistress to that shrine, but that as a free woman she had never visited it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> She knew, she said, that it was the factory of all sorts of corruptions; and it was known that for two years now no one had been initiated who had passed the age of twenty years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As each was introduced, he became a sort of victim for the priests. They, she continued, would lead him to a place which would ring with howls and the song of a choir and the beating of cymbals and drums, that the voice of the sufferer, when his virtue was violently attacked, might not be heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then she begged and besought him to put an end to this matter in any way he could and not to plunge into a situation where all disgraceful practices would have first to be endured and then performed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nor would she let him go until the young man gave her his promise that he would have nothing to do with those mysteries.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he came home and his mother began to tell him what he had to do that day and on the following days in connection with the rites, he informed her that he would do none of them and that it was not his intention to be initiated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His stepfather was present at the interview. Straightway the woman exclaimed that he could not do without his mistress Hispala for ten nights; infected with the <pb id="p.249"/>enchantments and poisons of that vampire, he had no<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> respect for his mother or his stepfather or yet the gods. Berating him thus, his mother on one side, his stepfather with four slaves on the other, drove him from the house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The young man thereupon went to his aunt Aebutia and explained to her the reason why his mother had driven him out, and on her recommendation the following day reported the affair to the consul Postumius with no witnesses present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul sent him away with instructions to return the third day; he himself asked his mother-in-law Sulpicia, a woman of high character, whether she was acquainted with an elderly woman, Aebutia, from the Aventine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When she replied that she knew that she was a virtuous woman of the old style, he said that he felt the need of an interview with her: Sulpicia should send her a message to come. Aebutia, summoned by Sulpicia, came, and a little later the consul, as if he had come in by chance, brought in an allusion to Aebutius, the son of her brother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Tears flowed from the woman's eyes, and she began to bewail the fate of the young man who was
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> robbed of his estate by those who should least of all have treated him thus, and who was then at her house, driven from home by his mother because the virtuous youth &mdash;might the gods be gracious<note>The prayer is due to the fear that the compliment might provoke the jealousy of the gods.</note> &mdash; refused to be initiated into rites which, if reports were to be believed, were full of lewdness.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, thinking that he had learned enough about Aebutius to trust his story, sent Aebutia away and asked his mother-in-law to summon to her Hispala, also from the Aventine, a freedwoman and no stranger in the neighbourhood: he wished to ask her also certain questions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hispala, <pb id="p.251"/>alarmed by her message, because without knowing<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> the reason she was summoned to so important and respected a woman, when she saw the lictors in the vestibule and the consul's retinue and the consul himself, almost swooned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Conducting her into the inner part of the house, with his mother-in-law present, the consul told her that if she could bring herself to tell the truth she had no cause to feel alarmed; she would receive a pledge either from Sulpicia, a woman of such standing, or from himself; she should state to them what rites were usually performed in the nocturnal orgies at the Bacchanalia in the grove of Stimula.<note>Stimula is identified with Semele, the mother of Bacchus. The name is obviously appropriate. The grove was near the Tiber and the Aventine.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When she heard this, such fear and trembling seized the woman in all her limbs that for a long time she could not open her mouth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Being at length restored, she said that when quite young and a slave she had been initiated with her mistress; that for many years after her manumission she had known nothing of what went on there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the consul praised her on this ground, that she had not denied that she had been initiated; but she was to tell, under the same pledge, the rest as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When she insisted that she knew nothing more, he told her that she would not receive the same
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> forgiveness or consideration if she were convicted by the evidence of someone else as if she had confessed of her own accord; the man, he added, who had heard it from her had told him the whole story.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The woman, thinking without a doubt, as was indeed the fact, that Aebutius had revealed the secret, threw herself at the feet of Sulpicia, and at first began to plead with
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> her not to try to turn the chatter of a freedwoman with her lover into something that was not merely serious but even fatal: <pb id="p.253"/>she had spoken thus for the purpose of frightening<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> him, not because she knew anything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At this point Postumius, inflamed with wrath, said that she believed even then that she was jesting with her lover Aebutius, and not speaking in the house of a most respectable matron and in the presence of a consul. Sulpicia too lifted up the terror-stricken woman, and at the same time encouraged her and mollified the anger of her son-in-law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At length regaining her self-control, and complaining much of the treachery of Aebutius, who had returned such gratitude to one who deserved so well of him, she declared that she feared greatly the wrath of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> gods whose hidden mysteries she was to reveal, but far more the wrath of the men who would, if she informed against them, with their own hands tear her limb from limb.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly she begged Sulpicia and the consul that they would banish her somewhere outside Italy, where she could pass the rest of her life in safety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul bade her be of good cheer and assured her that it would be his responsibility to see that she could safely live in Rome. Then Hispala set forth the origin of the mysteries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At first, she said, it was a ritual for women,<note>One thinks of the <hi rend="italics">Bacchae</hi> of Euripides.</note> and it was the custom that no man should be admitted to it. There had been three days appointed each year on which they held initiations into the Bacchic rites by day; it was the rule to choose the matrons in turn as priestesses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Paculla Annia, a Campanian, she said, when priestess, had changed all this as if by the advice of the gods; for she had been the first to initiate men, her sons, Minius and Herennius Cerrinius; she had held the rites by night and not by day, and instead of a mere three days a year she had established five days of initiation in every month.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <pb id="p.255"/>From the time that the rites were performed in common,<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> men mingling with women and the freedom of darkness added, no form of crime, no sort of wrongdoing, was left untried. There were more lustful practices among men with one another than among women. If any of them were disinclined to endure abuse or reluctant to commit crime, they were sacrificed as victims.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To consider nothing wrong, she continued, was the highest form of religious devotion among them. Men, as if insane, with fanatical tossings of their bodies, would utter prophecies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Matrons in the dress of Bacchantes, with dishevelled hair and carrying blazing torches, would run down to the Tiber, and plunging their torches in the water (because they contained live sulphur mixed with calcium) would bring them out still burning.<note>The torches probably contained the elements mentioned in the form of a mixture of free sulphur and calcium sulphate, which is still to be found in Italy. A torch of this composition, if burning well, would not be extinguished by a brief or partial immersion in water, so that the Bacchanals could perform the feat mentioned if they were reasonably swift in their movements. Calcium sulphate will not burn; free elementary sulphur burns, and we should probably translate <hi rend="italics">vivum</hi> as <quote>free</quote> or <quote>elementary</quote> and therefore <quote>burnable.</quote> But it is rather remarkable that Livy, who was not a scientist, should have approached scientific fact so closely. I am indebted for this information to Dr. E. Ward Tillotson, Assistant Director, and Dr. W. W. Duecker, Senior Industrial Fellow, both of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research of the University of Pittsburgh.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Men were alleged to have been carried off by the gods who had been bound to a machine and borne away out of sight to hidden caves: they were those who had refused either to conspire or to join in the crimes or to suffer abuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Their number, she said, was very great, almost constituting a second state; among them were certain men and women of high rank. Within the last two years it had been ordained that no one beyond the age of twenty years should be initiated: boys of such age were sought for as admitted both vice and corruption.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having finished her testimony, again falling at their feet, she repeated the same prayers that they should banish her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul asked his mother-in-law to vacate some part of the house into <pb id="p.257"/>which Hispala might move. An apartment above<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> the house<note>The <hi rend="italics">cenaculum</hi> was an apartment on an upper floor, with its own stairway to the street. In this house there was also a stairway to the inside of the house.</note> was assigned to her, the stairs leading to the street being closed up and an approach to the house arranged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All the household goods of Faecenia were at once moved and her slaves summoned, and Aebutius was directed to move to the house of a client of the consul.</p> 
				<p>When both witnesses were thus available, Postumius laid the matter before the senate, everything being set forth in detail; first what had been reported, then what he had himself discovered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Great panic seized the Fathers, both on the public account, lest these conspiracies and gatherings by night might produce something of hidden treachery or danger, and privately, each for himself, lest anyone might be involved in the mischief. The senate, moreover, decreed that the consul should be thanked because he had investigated the affair both with great industry and without creating any confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the investigation of the Bacchanals and their nocturnal orgies they referred to the consuls, not as a part of their regular duties;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they directed the consuls to see to it that the witnesses Aebutius and Faecenia did not suffer harm and to attract other informers by rewards; the priests of these rites, whether men or women, should be sought out, not only at Rome but through all the villages and communities, that they might be at the disposal of the consuls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that it should be proclaimed in addition in the city of Rome and that edicts should be sent through all Italy, that no one who had been initiated in the Bacchic rites should presume to assemble or come together for the purpose of celebrating those rites or to perform any such ritual.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Before all, it <pb id="p.259"/>was decreed that an inquiry should be conducted<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> regarding those persons who had come together or conspired for the commission of any immorality or crime. Such was the decree of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consuls ordered the curule aediles to search out all the priests of this cult and to keep them under surveillance, in free custody for the investigation; the plebeian aediles were to see to it that no celebration of the rites should be held in secret.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The task was entrusted to the <hi rend="italics">triumviri capitales</hi><note>They were minor magistrates charged with assisting in the maintenance of order.</note> of placing guards through the City, of seeing that no night meetings were held, and of making provision against fire; as assistants to the <hi rend="italics">triumviri,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">quinqueviri uls cis Tiberim</hi><note>It is not known whether these two boards of five, one operating on the left bank (<hi rend="italics">cis</hi>) of the river, the other on the right bank (<hi rend="italics">uls</hi>), were regular magistrates or posses of civilians, organized in case of emergency.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the magistrates had been dispatched to these posts, the consuls mounted the Rostra and called an informal meeting<note>Cf. XXXI. vii. 1 and the note. This meeting was called simply to hear the news about the conspiracy and the measures taken to suppress it.</note> of the people, and, when the consul had finished the regular formula of prayer which magistrates are accustomed to pronounce before they address the people, he thus began:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> "Never for any assembly, citizens, has this formal prayer to the gods been not only so suitable but even so necessary, a prayer which reminds us that these are the gods whom our forefathers had appointed to be worshipped, to be venerated, to receive our prayers, not those gods
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> who would drive our enthralled minds with vile and alien rites, as by the scourges of the Furies, to every crime and every lust.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For my part, I do not discover what I should refrain from telling or how far I should speak out. If you <pb id="p.261"/>are left ignorant of anything, I fear that I shall<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> leave room for carelessness; if I lay bare everything, that I shall scatter abroad an excess of terror.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whatever I shall have said, be sure that my words are less than the dreadfulness and the gravity of the situation: to take sufficient precautions will be our task.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As to the Bacchanalia, I am assured that you have learned that they have long been celebrated all over Italy and now even within the City in many places, and that you have learned this not only from rumour but also from their din and cries at night, which echo throughout the City, but I feel sure that you do not know what this thing is:
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> some believe that it is a form of worship of the gods, others that it is an allowable play and pastime, and, whatever it is, that it concerns only a few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As regards their number, if I shall say that there are many thousands of them, it cannot but be that you are terrified, unless I shall at once add to that who and of what sort they are.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> First, then, a great part of them are women, and they are the source of this mischief; then there are men very like the women, debauched and debauchers, fanatical, with senses dulled by wakefulness, wine, noise and shouts at night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The conspiracy thus far has no strength, but it has an immense source of strength in that they grow more numerous day by day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Your ancestors did not wish that even you should assemble casually and without reason, except when the standard was displayed on the citadel and the army was assembled for an election,<note>For the military character of the <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata,</hi> of which the speaker is thinking, cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whatever villainy there has been in recent years due to lust, whatever to fraud, whatever to crime, I tell you, has arisen from this one cult.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Not yet have they revealed all the crimes to which they have conspired. Their impious compact still limits itself to private crimes, since as yet it does not have strength enough to crush the state. Daily the evil grows and creeps abroad. It is already too great to be purely a private matter: its objective is the control of the state.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Unless you are on guard betimes, citizens, as we hold this meeting in the day-time, summoned by a consul, in accordance with law, so there can be one held at night.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the meeting was dismissed there was great panic in the whole City, nor was this confined only to the walls or the boundaries of Rome; but gradually <pb id="p.269"/>through all Italy, as letters were received from their<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> friends concerning the decree of the senate, concerning the assembly and the edict of the consuls, the terror began to spread.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Many during the night after the day when the revelation was made in the meeting were caught trying to escape and brought back by the guards whom the <hi rend="italics">triumviri</hi> had posted at the gates: the names of many were reported. Certain of these, men and women, committed suicide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the conspiracy, it was said, more than seven thousand men and women were involved. But the heads of the conspiracy, it was clear, were Marcus and Gaius Atinius of the Roman <hi rend="italics">plebs,</hi> and the Faliscan Lucius Opicernius and the Campanian Minius Cerrinius: they were the source of all wickedness and wrongdoing, the story went, and they were the supreme priests and the founders of the cult.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was seen to that at the first opportunity they were arrested. They were brought before the consuls, confessed, and asked for no delay in standing trial.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But so numerous were the persons who had fled from the City that, since in many instances legal proceedings and causes were falling through,<note>Cases could not be tried because of the absence of one or both parties to suits. The remedy adopted was the proclamation of a <hi rend="italics">iustitium</hi> for thirty days: this suspended all ordinary public and private business.</note> the praetors Titus Maenius and Marcus Licinius were compelled, through the intervention of the senate, to adjourn court for thirty days, until the investigations should be finished by the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The same depopulation, because at Rome men whose names had been given in did not respond or were not found, compelled the consuls to make the rounds of the villages and there investigate and conduct trials.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Those who had merely been initiated and had made their prayers in accordance with the ritual formula, <pb id="p.271"/>the priest dictating the words, in which the wicked<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> conspiracy to all vice and lust was contained, but had committed none of the acts to which they were bound by the oath against either themselves or others, they left in chains; upon those who had permitted themselves to be defiled by debauchery or murder, who had polluted themselves by false testimony, forged seals, substitution of wills or other frauds, they inflicted capital punishment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> More were killed than were thrown into prison. There was a large number of men and women in both classes. Convicted women were turned over to their relatives or to those who had authority over them, that they might be punished in private:<note>Such punishments were inflicted by virtue of <hi rend="italics">patria potestas.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> if there was no suitable person to exact it, the penalty was inflicted by the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the task was entrusted to the consuls of destroying all forms of Bacchic worship, first at Rome and then throughout Italy, except in cases where an ancient altar or image had been consecrated.<note>Their antiquity was their guarantee that they antedated the abuse of the Bacchus worship and were free from its bad features. In any case the Romans were inclined to respect venerable age.</note> For the future it was then provided by decree of the senate that there should be no Bacchanalia in Rome or Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If any person considered such worship to be ordained by tradition or to be necessary, and believed that he could not omit it without sin and atonement, he was to make a declaration before the city praetor, and the latter would consult the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If permission were granted to him, at a meeting where not fewer than one hundred were in attendance, he should offer the sacrifice, provided that not more than five people should take part in the rite, and that there <pb id="p.273"/>should be no common purse or master of sacrifices<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> or priest.<note>
						<p>The last clauses prevent a definite organization of the cult. The decree, however, legalizes traditional rites in honour of Bacchus and necessary individual acts of worship.</p> 
						<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>We are fortunate in possessing an inscription (CIL. I. 196), containing, in the form of a letter addressed to the Teurani, a federated state of Bruttium, the substance of the senate's decisions (the celebrated <hi rend="italics">Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus</hi>). In general the statements of Livy agree with the inscription, although the evidence of language gives no indication that Livy saw the inscription.</p></note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then another decree of the senate, allied to this, was passed on the motion of the consul Quintus Marcius, that the entire question of those whose services as informers the consuls had enjoyed should be referred to the senate when Spurius Postumius should have returned to Rome after completing the investigations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Minius Cerrinius the Campanian they voted should be sent to Ardea for imprisonment, advance notice being given to the magistrates of the Ardeans that they should keep especially close guard over him, not only to prevent his escape but also to allow him no opportunity to commit suicide.<note>The ultimate fate of Cerrinius is not recorded.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Spurius Postumius returned to Rome a considerable time later: on his motion with reference to the rewards for Publius Aebutius and Hispala Faecenia, because it was through their information that the Bacchanalia had been discovered, a decree of the senate was passed that to each of them one hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi><note>This was the sum required for assignment to the first census-class.</note> should be paid by the city quaestors out of the treasury;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and that the consuls should take up with the tribunes of the people the matter of their presenting to the assembly at the earliest possible moment proposals that Publius Aebutius should be rated as having performed his military service,<note>The proposal to exempt Aebutius from his military obligations is genuine, so far as one can see, but nevertheless odd at this period, when military service was still a recognized part of the citizen's duty. It cannot be determined whether the exemption carried with it immediate eligibility to office, since Aebutius had no political ambitions.</note> that he should not serve in the <pb id="p.275"/>army except by his own act, that the censor should<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> not assign him a public horse without his consent;<note>The assignment of an <hi rend="italics">equus publicus</hi> (cf. xlii. 6 and xliv. 1 below and the notes) would make Aebutius liable to service and so cancel the exemption just granted.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that Hispala Faecenia should have the rights of bestowing and alienating property,<note>The interests of a <hi rend="italics">patronus</hi> in the property of his <hi rend="italics">libertus</hi> were well protected by Roman law. Although the <hi rend="italics">patronus</hi> of Faecenia was dead his interests survived, descending in this case to his <hi rend="italics">gens,</hi> and the senate therefore bestows upon her the right to give away or otherwise alienate her property irrespective of gentile rights (<hi rend="italics">datio</hi> may be synonymous with <hi rend="italics">alienatio,</hi> the term employed by later jurists). The proposal of some scholars to understand <hi rend="italics">capitis</hi> with <hi rend="italics">deminutio,</hi> which would grant her the right to accept inferior civic status, seems to be self-contradictory. But it is not certain that Livy understood what he wrote.</note> of marriage outside her <hi rend="italics">gens,</hi><note>The conditions surrounding <hi rend="italics">gentis enuptio</hi> are only vaguely known. It is clear, however, that Faecenia is to have the maximum of privilege allowed to women.</note> and choice of a <hi rend="italics">tutor</hi> just as if her husband had given it to her by his will;<note>A wife <hi rend="italics">in manu</hi> might be granted this privilege by her husband's will. By the bestowal of these four rights Faecenia acquired a legal status at least not inferior to that of free women generally.</note> that she should be permitted to marry a man of free birth, nor should any fraud or disgrace on this account attach to a man who should have married her;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that the consuls and praetors who were at this time in office and those who should follow them should have a care that no injury should be done to this woman and that she should be secure. The senate, they were to say, wished and judged it proper that this should be done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All these motions were presented to the assembly and passed in accordance with the decree of the senate; with respect to the impunity and rewards of the rest of the informers discretion was left to the consuls.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And by this time Quintus Marcius, having completed the investigation in his district, was preparing to set out against the Ligurians, who composed his province, having received three thousand Roman infantry and one hundred and fifty cavalry and five thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry of the allies of the Latin confederacy as reinforcements.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The same province and the same numbers <pb id="p.277"/>of infantry and cavalry had been decreed to his<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> colleague as well. They received the armies which Gaius Flaminius and Marcus Aemilius had commanded as consuls the preceding year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Besides, they were directed, under the decree of the senate, to enlist two new legions, and they called upon the allies of the Latin confederacy for twenty thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry, and they enlisted three thousand Roman infantry and two hundred cavalry.<note>Unless the last clause of the sentence depends upon <hi rend="italics">scribere</hi> above, despite the intervening clause, a verb has dropped out, which I have supplied in the translation.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All this army, except the legions, it was resolved to send to reinforce the army in Spain. Accordingly the consuls, while they were themselves busy with the investigations, placed Titus Maenius in charge of conducting the levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the investigations were completed, Quintus Marcius set out before his colleague against the Ligurian Apuani.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While he was following them into a retired glade, which had always been their secret retreat and hiding-place, he was surrounded on unfavourable ground in a narrow pass which had been occupied in advance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Four thousand soldiers were lost and three standards of the second legion and eleven ensigns<note>The term <hi rend="italics">vexilla</hi> is used for variety only: it is more regularly used for the guidons of cavalry, while both Roman and allied infantry carried <hi rend="italics">signa.</hi></note> of the allies of the Latin confederacy fell into the hands of the enemy, as well as many weapons which were thrown away everywhere because they hindered the flight along the paths in the forest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Ligurians desisted from their pursuit before the Romans stopped their flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As soon as the consul got free of the enemy's country, that it might not be seen how great was the loss, he disbanded the army in a peaceful region.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He could not, however, erase the record of his defeat; for the glade from <pb id="p.279"/>which the Ligurians had driven him was called<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> <quote>Marcius.</quote><note>Its position is unknown.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the time the news from the Ligurians was published, dispatches from Spain were read, bringing sorrow mingled with joy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gaius Atinius, who as praetor two years before had set out to that province, had engaged in pitched battle with the Lusitanians in the territory of Hasta: about six thousand of the enemy fell and the rest were repulsed and routed and stripped of their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then led the legions to assault the town of Hasta: this too he took without much more of a fight than the camp; but while he was too carelessly approaching the walls he was hit and a few days later died from his wound.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the letter regarding the death of the propraetor was read, the senate decreed that a messenger should be sent to overtake the praetor Gaius Calpurnius at the harbour of Luna and announce to him that the senate deemed it proper that he should hasten his departure, that the province might not be left without a governor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The messenger who was sent arrived at Luna on the fourth day: Calpurnius had departed a few days before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And in Nearer Spain Lucius Manlius Acidinus, who had gone to the province at the same time as Gaius Atinius, engaged in a battle with the Celtiberians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both sides withdrew with the result indecisive, except that the Celtiberians moved their camp from there the next night and gave the Romans the chance both to bury their dead and collect the spoils from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A few days later, having collected a larger army, the Celtiberians spontaneously challenged the Romans to battle near the town of Calagurris. It is not explained what made <pb id="p.281"/>them weaker after their numbers were increased.<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were defeated in the battle: about twelve thousand men were killed and two thousand captured and the Romans gained possession of the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And, if the arrival of his successor had not prevented the victor from exploiting his success, the Celtiberians might have been subdued. Both new praetors led their armies into winter quarters.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the time that these reports were brought from Spain, the Taurian Games<note>These games, instituted under the monarchy, were in honour of the gods of the lower world.</note> were performed for two days for religious reasons.<note>While the expression is vague, it would seem that there was some special reason for celebrating these games at this time.</note> Then for ten days, with great magnificence, Marcus Fulvius gave the games which he had vowed during the Aetolian war.<note>Cf. v. 7-10 above. If the emendation here adopted is correct, Fulvius probably exceeded his appropriation of 80,000 sesterces there mentioned.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Many actors too came from Greece to do him honour. Also a contest of athletes<note>They were probably boxers or wrestlers.</note> was then for the first time made a spectacle for the Romans and a hunt of lions and panthers was given, and the games, in number and variety, were celebrated in a manner almost like that of the present time.<note>The Greek features of the games were marks of the Greek culture of Fulvius.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then a nine-day feast took place because in Picenum through three days there had been showers of stones, and especially because flames shining in the sky in many places were said to have set fire to the garments of many when a light breeze blew upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A one-day period of prayer was also added by decree of the pontiffs because the temple of Ops on the Capitoline had been struck by lightning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls atoned for this with full-grown victims and purified the City. About the same time <pb id="p.283"/>it was reported too from Umbria that a hermaphrodite<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> about twelve years old had been discovered. In their fear and awe of this portent they ordered the prodigy to be removed from Roman soil and killed as soon as possible.<note>Cf. the treatment of a similar creature reported at XXXI. xii. 8.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In the same year Transalpine Gauls, crossing into Venetia without any devastation or war, took possession of a site for founding a town not far from where Aquileia now stands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Roman ambassadors sent across the Alps to inquire into the matter received the reply that this party had not set out with the authority of the state, nor did they know what they were doing in Italy.<note>This is the first invasion of Italy over the eastern passes of the Alps. Possibly these invaders were not Gauls, but came from farther east.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Lucius Scipio at this time celebrated for ten days the games which he said he had vowed during the war with Antiochus, with money contributed for the purpose by the kings and cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Valerius Antias is the authority for the statement that after his condemnation and the sale of his property he had been sent as an ambassador to Asia to resolve the disputes between the two kings, Antiochus and Eumenes:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> he adds that at that time the money was contributed to him and artists collected throughout Asia, and that finally, after his embassy, action was taken in the senate about these games, of which he had made no mention after the war in which he said that they had been vowed.<note>Neither the vow nor the embassy is mentioned elsewhere by Livy.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the year was now coming to its end, Quintus Marcius was about to retire from office while absent from Rome and Spurius Postumius, having conducted the investigations with the greatest faithfulness and energy, held the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consuls elected were Appius Claudius Pulcher and Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus. Next day the <pb id="p.285"/>praetors were chosen, Publius Cornelius Cethegus,<note type="margin">B.C. 186</note> Aulus Postumius Albinus, Gaius Afranius Stellio, Gaius Atilius Serranus, Lucius Postumius Tempsanus, Marcus Claudius Marcellinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the end of the year, because the consul Spurius Postumius had reported that on his journeys in the prosecution of the investigations on both coasts of Italy he had found colonies abandoned, Sipontum on the upper sea, Buxentum on the lower, three commissioners to enroll colonists for them were elected in accordance with a decree of the senate and under the presidency of the praetor Titus Maenius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The commissioners were Lucius Scribonius Libo, Marcus Tuccius, Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus.<note>Livy omits to record the inauguration of the new magistrates and the assignment of provinces and armies.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The war<note>Livy here makes an abrupt transition from Rome to Macedonia. His chronology, however, is uncertain, as is inevitable in a transitional passage designed to sum up the causes of the war with Perseus, who, incidentally, was not yet king. Livy has said little about Greek affairs since he described the Achaean-Lacedaemonian difficulties in XXXVIII. xxx. &mdash;xxxiv., where the chronology is also obscure.</note> with King Perseus and the Macedonians<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> which was threatening did not arise from the causes which most people assign to it, nor from Perseus himself: the beginnings had been made by Philip; and Philip himself, had he lived longer, would have waged that
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> war. One thing, when terms of peace were dictated to him after his defeat, especially offended him &mdash;that the right of punishing those of the Macedonians who had revolted from him during the war had been taken from him by the senate, although, since Quinctius, in their negotiations for peace, had postponed the whole question, he had not despaired of obtaining
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> it.<note>The allusion must be to such states as the Orestae (XXXIII. xxxiv. 6), although Livy has mentioned no such prohibition as that of which Philip complained, and, indeed, has said nothing at all of the treatment of revolted Macedonian cities except in the instance mentioned.</note> Then, when King Antiochus had been defeated at Thermopylae, the tasks had been divided,<note>For the phrase, cf. XXXVII. xxi. 8, where, as here, it refers to co-ordinated action of commanders. The joint campaign referred to was described by Livy in XXXVI. xxxv.</note> and at the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> same time <pb id="p.287"/>the consul Acilius had laid siege to Heraclea, Philip<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> to Lamia; but when Heraclea was taken Philip had felt aggrieved because he had been ordered to retire from the walls of Lamia and the town had been surrendered to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Romans. The consul soothed his wrath, because, when he was himself in haste to move towards Naupactus, whither the Aetolians had gone
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> from their flight, he had permitted Philip to make war on Athamania and Amynander and to add to his kingdom the cities which the Aetolians had taken from the Thessalians. Without great effort he had both driven Amynander from Athamania and recovered a considerable number of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> towns. Demetrias also, a powerful city, opportunely situated in every respect, and the tribes of the Magnesians he had brought under his
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> control.<note>The sequence of events here described does not quite agree with that found in Book XXXVI <hi rend="italics">passim.</hi> The passages agree in general as to the extent of Philip's gains, which had awakened the suspicions of Flamininus (XXXVI. xxxv. 9-10).</note> After that he had also gained certain cities in Thrace, amid the disorder caused by the quarrels of their leading citizens
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash;the fault of new and unwonted liberty &mdash;by joining himself to the parties which were being worsted in this internal rivalry.<note>The occupation of Aenus and Maronea had taken place after the other events related, and has not been previously mentioned by Livy. These towns had been at various times under Ptolemaic, Macedonian and finally Seleucid rule before they were liberated by the Romans after the defeat of Antiochus (XXXVII. lx. 7).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By these means the anger of the king against the Romans was temporarily assuaged. Never, however, did he relax his attention to the assembling in time of peace of strength which, whenever the chance should be given, he could use in time of war.<note>The true story of the alienation of Philip after the reconciliation during the war with Antiochus would be interesting and revealing. We cannot, however, expect to find it in Livy, and the narrative of Polybius is too fragmentary to be very helpful.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He not only increased the revenues of his kingdom from the farm crops and the harbour duties, but also reopened old mines long <pb id="p.289"/>disused and began operations on new ones in many<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> places.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But that he might restore the ancient population, which had been lost in the calamities of war, he did not merely look to the natural increase of the people, by requiring all to beget and rear children, but
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> he had transferred a great number of Thracians to Macedonia as well, being for some time free from wars and devoting all his thought to increasing the resources of his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then causes recurred which aroused anew his anger against the Romans. The complaints of the Thessalians and the Perrhaebians with regard to their
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> cities which were in his hands and those of the envoys of King Eumenes with regard to his violent occupation of the Thracian towns and the transfer of the population to Macedonia had been so received that it was plainly evident that they would not be ignored.<note>The dangers attending Rome's policy in the east are here manifest. The adversity of one eastern power inevitably meant the prosperity of another, and constant vigilance on Rome's part was necessary to ensure the maintenance of any equilibrium. The fact that there was now no considerable Greek power made the <quote>liberation</quote> of the Greeks more and more a farce and prevented the Romans from developing a Greek state which could check Philip in Europe as Eumenes checked Antiochus in Asia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate had been especially moved by the fact that they had heard that he now coveted the possession of Aenus and Maronea; they were less concerned about the Thessalians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Athamanian ambassadors had also arrived, complaining, not of the occupation of part of their kingdom or of the loss of territory, but that all Athamania had come under the sovereignty and sway of the king;<note>This embassy must have antedated the recovery of Athamania by Amynander (XXXVIII. i. l
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> &mdash;iii. 2), unless Philip had again expelled him, and of this there is no record.</note> exiles of the Maroneans had also come, expelled because they had defended the cause of liberty against the king's garrison: they brought the news that not only Maronea but also Aenus was in the <pb id="p.291"/>power of
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Philip.<note>The various events which inspired these complaints had extended over a considerable period of time, but may have been forced upon Rome's attention simultaneously. One can picture the bewilderment of the senate, forced to listen to contradictory arguments and decide claims on the basis of justice plus diplomatic policy, and being, probably, none too familiar with the Greek language.</note> Ambassadors too from Philip had<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> come to clear him on these counts, and they asserted that he had done nothing except with the consent of the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> generals:<note>The negotiations between the Roman commanders Baebius and Acilius and the king had been conducted in haste, under the pressure of war-time conditions, and had probably never been given definiteness by statement in written form. It is by no means impossible that a liberal interpretation justified Philip in keeping what he had gained and that the Roman problem at this time was how to take away, while avoiding making Philip an enemy, what their generals had so generously and thoughtlessly given.</note> the cities of the Thessalians and Perrhaebians and Magnesians and the people of the Athamanians, including Amynander, had been in the same situation as the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Aetolians; after the defeat of King Antiochus the consul, kept busy with besieging the Aetolian cities, had sent Philip to recover the above-mentioned places; subdued by arms, they now obeyed
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> him. The senate, in order not to reach any decision in the absence of the king, sent as commissioners to settle these disputes Quintus Caecilius Metellus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, Tiberius
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Sempronius.<note>Metellus is probably the consul of <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date>, Baebius the praetor of <date value="-192">192 B.C.</date> who had co-operated with Philip in the early campaigns against Antiochus, Sempronius probably the tribune of <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date></note> On their arrival at Thessalian Tempe all the states which had matters of dispute with the king were summoned to a council.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There, when they had taken their places, the 'Roman commissioners in the position of arbitrators, the Thessalians, Perrhaebians and Athamanians as unquestionably accusers, and Philip to hear the charges almost as a criminal,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> each one of the men who were chiefs of embassies, in accordance with his own inclinations, whether towards sympathy for Philip or towards hatred, made more harsh or more lenient proposals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the principal grounds for controversy were Philippopolis, Tricca, Phaloria, <pb id="p.293"/>Eurymenae<note>Tricca and Phaloria, as well as Malloea and Ericinium in sect. 16 below, but not Philippopolis and Eurymenae, are on the list of towns recovered from the Athamanians by Baebius and Philip (XXXVI. xiii. 6).</note> and other cities near them, whether,<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> at a time when they were under Thessalian control, they had been forcibly seized and occupied by the Aetolians &mdash;for
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> it was agreed that Philip had taken them from the Aetolians<note>This is inconsistent with the narrative quoted in the preceding note.</note> &mdash;or whether these towns had been Aetolian in earlier times; for Acilius had given them to the king subject to the condition that they had belonged to the Aetolians and, furthermore, that they had joined with the Aetolians voluntarily, not under compulsion of armed force.<note>The text of this passage seems to be corrupt in so many places that the real meaning remains obscure and uncertain, and no combination of emendations possesses both palaeographical and intrinsic probability. It is clear, however, that the general question involved is the priority of Thessalian and Aetolian claims to these towns. Two details make the answer particularly difficult: first, the uncertainty as to the meaning of the word <hi rend="italics">antiquitus,</hi> since Aetolian expansion seems to have begun only after the Macedonian conquest; second, the fact that the condition said here to have been imposed by Acilius has not been mentioned before. Both text and translation, it must be admitted, are a patch-work.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Under the same procedure the dispute was conducted as to the cities of the Perrhaebians and Magnesians; for the Aetolians had confused all claims by seizing them as opportunity offered.<note>The incessant shifting of military control rendered impossible any purely legal adjudication of such questions which could be regarded as final. Rome's decisions were certain to offend some party and were likely to offend all parties, even if they were purely impersonal and equitable.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Besides these questions, which were matters for legal adjudication, there were the complaints of the Thessalians that if these cities should be restored to them he would give them back after they had been despoiled and abandoned;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for in addition to those who had been lost in the hardships of war he had taken five hundred of the leaders of the youth away to Macedonia and was misusing their services on tasks fit only for slaves;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and what he had restored to the Thessalians, under compulsion, he had taken care to return unusable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Phthian Thebes, they said, had once been <pb id="p.295"/>the one maritime market of the Thessalians which<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> was profitable and productive of revenue: by assembling there cargo-boats which would steer past Thebes to Demetrias, the king had diverted thither all the sea-trade. At last not even ambassadors, who were inviolable under the law of nations, had he refrained from attacking: he had laid an ambush for them while they were on their way to Titus Quinctius.<note>This incident has not been mentioned.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As a result, then, they said, all Thessalians had been thrown into such a panic that no one dared to open his mouth either in his own city or in the common councils of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Romans, the source of their liberty, were far away: close beside them was a threatening master, forbidding them to take advantage of the kindnesses of the Roman people. What, pray, was free if there was no free speech? Even now, with the confidence and under the safeguards of ambassadors, they were lamenting rather than stating their case. Unless the Romans found some device by which both the fear of the Greeks who were neighbours of Macedonia and the aggressiveness of Philip could be diminished, both his defeat and their liberation would be in vain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Like a stubborn horse which would not obey, more cruel reins must be employed to control him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These remarks the last speakers made in bitterness, although previous speakers had gently soothed his wrath, begging that he would pardon their pleas for liberty, that he would lay aside the harshness of a tyrant and train himself to act as an ally and friend, and that he would imitate the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> people, which preferred to win for itself allies by affection rather than by fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When the Thessalians had been heard, the Perrhaebians argued <pb id="p.297"/>that Gonnocondylum, which Philip had named<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> Olympias, belonged to Perrhaebia and should be restored to them; the same demand was also made for Malloea and Ericinium. The Athamanians sought liberty and the forts of Athenaeum and 
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Poetneum.<note>
						<p>This demand is inconsistent with Livy's previous narrative. Poetneum is otherwise unknown. For Athenaeum cf. XXXVIII. i. 11.</p> 
						<p>The discrepancies between these chapters and Livy's account in Book XXXVI suggest that Livy here follows a different source. The real facts become, in consequence, less attainable.</p></note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, so as to assume the pose of the accuser rather than the accused, himself began with complaints, alleging that the Thessalians had seized by force of arms Menelais in Dolopia, which had belonged to his kingdom; similarly, Petra in Pieria had been taken by the same Thessalians and the Perrhaebians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Xyniae indeed, which was certainly an Aetolian town, they had annexed as their own; and Parachelo&iuml;s, which was under Athamania, had been made Thessalian under no rule of law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now as to the charges which they had made against him regarding the ambushing of ambassadors and the frequenting or deserting of maritime harbours, the one, he said, was nonsense, that he should be accountable for what
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> harbours merchants or sailors would seek, the other was inconsistent with his character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was so many years now that ambassadors had never stopped going now to Roman commanders, now to the senate in Rome, carrying charges against him: who of these, he asked, had ever been harmed even by word? They said that once ambassadors going to Quinctius had been ambushed; but what had happened to them they did not add.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These were the allegations of men seeking some false charge to make, since they had nothing true to say.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <pb id="p.299"/>Arrogantly and excessively did the Thessalians<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> misuse the indulgence of the Roman people, as if after a long thirst they drank too greedily a draught of pure freedom: thus, like slaves suddenly set free contrary to their expectations, they were trying out their freedom of voice and tongue and were making a show of themselves by attacking and insulting their masters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Carried away by anger, he added that the sun of all his days had not yet set.<note>The expression has a proverbial sound; Philip's last day had not come.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This remark not only the Thessalians took as a. threat against them, but the Romans also. And when after this speech a roar of protest began and was finally quieted, he replied next to the Perrhaebians and the Athamanians, that the status of the cities about which they were arguing was the same.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He claimed that the consul Acilius and the Romans had given them to him because they were on the side of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If they who had given them wished to take away their gift, he was aware, he said, that he would have to yield;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> but they would be doing an injury to a better and more loyal friend to gratify fickle and useless allies. For nothing was gratitude less enduring than for liberty, especially when bestowed upon men who are certain to spoil it by misuse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Having heard the case, the commissioners gave judgment that it was their pleasure that the Macedonian garrisons should be withdrawn from these cities and that the kingdom should be reduced to the ancient boundaries of Macedonia.<note>What boundaries are meant is uncertain: the treaty of <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxx.) fixed them only vaguely and only on the south. Roman decisions at this period frequently and perhaps deliberately err in the direction of being too sententious and consequently ambiguous.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Regarding the injuries which they complained of as committed by both sides, they would have to determine the rule of procedure to be followed, so as to know in what manner to settle the disputes between these peoples and the Macedonians.</p> <pb id="p.301"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thence, having given serious offence to<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> the king, they proceeded to Thessalonica to investigate the condition of the cities of Thrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There ambassadors of Eumenes told them that if the Romans wished Aenus and Maronea to be free, the king's sense of propriety permitted them to say nothing more, except to suggest that they leave them free in fact and not merely in name, and not allow their own work to be a source of gain to another.<note>By <quote>another</quote> they, of course, mean Philip. The words have a peculiar sound on the lips of Eumenes, who had profited so much from Rome's victory over Antiochus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But if there were less concern for the cities situated in Thrace, it was far more proper that towns which had belonged to Antiochus should fall as prizes of war to Eumenes rather than to
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> Philip, either in consideration of the services of his father Attalus in the war which the Roman people had waged against Philip himself, or of his own services, in that he had taken part, during the war with Antiochus, in all its labours and perils on land and sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They said that Eumenes had in addition the preliminary opinion of the ten commissioners<note>The commissioners who had been sent to Asia to formulate the peace-treaty with Antiochus.</note> on the matter, who, since they had given him the Chersonesus and Lysimachia, surely gave him Maronea and Aenus too, which, from their nearness to his country, were mere appendages to the larger gift.<note>Aenus and Maronea had apparently been in some way overlooked in the final settlement with Antiochus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In consequence of what service to the Roman people, they asked, or of what right to rule had Philip imposed his garrisons upon these cities when they were so far away from the boundaries of Macedonia?<note>Philip's claim to these cities seems weak in comparison with his rights to some of the other districts in dispute.</note> Let the commissioners order the Maroneans to be summoned: from them they would receive all certain information about the condition of these cities.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The agents of the Maroneans, when called in, said that the royal garrison occupied, not merely one place in the city, as in other towns, but several at <pb id="p.303"/>once, and that Maronea was full of Macedonians.<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As a result, the king's partisans were in control: they alone were permitted to speak in the senate and in the public meetings; they either held themselves or gave to others all offices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> All the aristocrats, who felt some concern for liberty and the laws, were either in exile, driven from their homes, or were silent, unhonoured and at the mercy of their inferiors.<note>The aristocratic party in a Greek city of this period was generally pro-Roman, and the constitutions of Flamininus (cf. XXXIV. li. 6; XXXV. xxxiv. 3 and the note) favoured this element. It is interesting to note that the commissioners feel no necessity of hearing from the opposing (democratic and pro-Macedonian) party in Maronea.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And as to the boundary rights, they had little new to say: only that Quintus Fabius Labeo, when he had been in that region, had fixed as the boundary for Philip the ancient royal road which leads to Paroreia in Thrace, nowhere approaching the sea: Philip had later laid out a new road which encompassed the cities and lands of the Maroneans.<note>The meaning seems to be that Labeo had established as a boundary between Macedonia and the territory surrendered by Antiochus an old road which perhaps followed the general course of the Roman Via Egnatia. Since the boundary was probably described by a term as vague as <quote>a certain road,</quote> Philip had availed himself of the vagueness by relocating the old road or building a new one which put Maronea on his side of the boundary as thus described. But corruption in the text and the lack of any other version of the affair leave the true sense in doubt. It may be added that the authority of Labeo to take such action as is here described (Livy has not mentioned it before) is more than questionable.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In reply to this Philip followed a very different line of argument from that recently used against the Thessalians and Perrhaebians: <quote>With the Maroneans or with Eumenes,</quote> he said, <quote>I have no debate, but now, Romans, the debate is with you, from whom I have for some time observed that I receive no fair treatment.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The cities of the Macedonians which had revolted from me during the truce<note>Possibly the truce of <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXII. xxxvi. 8), but the revolt has not been mentioned before.</note> I deemed it right that I should recover, not because it would be an important addition to my kingdom &mdash;for <pb id="p.305"/>they are small towns and, moreover, situated on the<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> farthest frontiers &mdash;but because it was a valuable precedent for holding within bounds the other Macedonians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was refused me. During the Aetolian war, ordered by the consul Manius Acilius to besiege Lamia, after I had been wearied for a long time by the siege and battles and when I was on the point of scaling the walls, I was recalled by him from the city, which was all but taken, and compelled to march my troops away.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As a consolation for this injustice it was permitted to me to recover certain fortresses (such they were rather than cities) of Thessaly and Perrhaebia and the Athamanians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even these, Quintus Caecilius, you took away from me a few days ago. Just now (heaven help us!) the ambassadors of Eumenes assumed it as not to be gainsaid that it was more just for Eumenes than for me to have what had belonged to Antiochus. I judge the matter far differently. Eumenes could not have remained in his kingdom, I do not mean if the Romans had not conquered, but if they had not undertaken the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so he has received favours from you, not you from him. So far from true was it that any part of my kingdom was in danger that when Antiochus voluntarily promised me three thousand talents and fifty decked ships and all the cities of Greece which I had held before, as the price of my alliance,<note>Hannibal had urged that every means should be used to win over Philip (XXXVI. vii. 3 ff.), but Livy has said nothing to suggest that actual overtures were made to him by Antiochus.</note> I refused; I preferred to be his enemy even before Manius Acilius brought his army across to Greece.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And with that consul I conducted whatever campaign he assigned to me;
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and for the following consul, Lucius Scipio, when he had decided to lead his army to the Hellespont by land, I not merely gave him a right of way through our kingdom but also paved roads, built <pb id="p.307"/>bridges, furnished supplies; and this not through<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> Macedonia alone but also through Thrace, where, along with everything else, I had to maintain peace with the barbarians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For this zeal in your behalf, not to say for these services to you, was
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> it right, Romans, that you should add to and enlarge and increase somewhat my domains by your generosity, or that you should take away what I have, either by my own right or by your kindness, as you are doing now?<note>Philip's claims here are supported by Livy's narrative. The commissioners had left his services entirely unrewarded.</note> The cities of the Macedonians, which you admit were part of my dominion, are not restored.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Eumenes has come to despoil me as if I were Antiochus, and (heaven help us!) he brings forward, for his most impudent manipulation of the facts, the decree of the ten commissioners, by which more than anything else he can be both refuted and convicted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For it was written therein most explicitly and clearly that the Chersonesus and Lysimachia were given to Eumenes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Where, pray, were Aenus and Maronea and the Thracian cities assigned to him?<note>The silence of the commissioners receives an interpretation contradicting that of xxvii. 5 above.</note> What he did not even dare to ask of them shall he obtain from you as if he had been granted it by them? It makes a difference in what category you wish me to be with reference to you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If you have determined to harass me as a private and public enemy, continue to act as you have begun; but if some consideration is due me as an allied and friendly king, I beg you not to judge me worthy of such an injury.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The speech of the king affected the commissioners profoundly. Therefore they left the question unsettled by an indecisive answer: if by the decree of the ten commissioners these cities had been assigned to Eumenes, they were making no change;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> if Philip had captured them in war, he should <pb id="p.309"/>hold them as the prize of victory under the law of<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> war; if neither of these was true, it was their pleasure that the decision should be reserved for the senate and, in order that everything might remain in its original state, that the garrisons which were in these cities should be withdrawn.<note>From Philip's standpoint this decision does not leave the affair <quote>in its original state,</quote> and one is not surprised that it contributed to Philip's feeling that he was being mistreated. The opposite decision would have been equally unfair to the other parties in the case. It is never made clear whether the Maroneans wished to be given to Eumenes.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>These were the principal causes which had turned the thoughts of Philip away from the Romans, so that the war can appear, not as begun for new reasons by his son Perseus, but as a heritage from the father to the son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At Rome there was no suspicion of a Macedonian war. Lucius Manlius the proconsul had returned from Spain; when he demanded from the senate, meeting in the temple of Bellona, a triumph for his achievements, their importance made the request reasonable;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> precedent stood in the way, because it had been so arranged by the custom of their forefathers that a general who had not brought back his army should not triumph unless he had handed over to his successor a province thoroughly conquered and pacified.<note>This is a variation on the form of statement adopted in XXXVIII. i. 3; it is obvious that the senate has discovered the art of juggling with the conditions to suit its shifting purposes.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nevertheless, the intermediate distinction, of entering the City in ovation, was granted to Manlius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He carried in his procession fifty-two golden crowns, in addition to one hundred and thirty-two pounds of gold and sixteen thousand three hundred of silver, and he declared in the senate that his quaestor Quintus Fabius was bringing ten thousand pounds of silver and eighty of gold: this too he would put into the treasury.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>There was a serious slave insurrection that year in Apulia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Lucius Postumius the praetor had Tarentum as his province. He conducted a strict <pb id="p.311"/>investigation into a conspiracy of shepherds who had<note type="margin">B.C. 85</note> endangered the highways and the public pasturelands by their brigandage. He condemned about seven thousand men: many of them escaped, many were executed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consuls, long delayed in the City by the levies, at length set out for their provinces.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same year the praetors in Spain, Gaius Calpurnius and Lucius Quinctius, when in the beginning of spring they had led their troops out of winter quarters and had united in Baeturia, marched into Carpetania, where the camp of the enemy lay, and prepared to conduct the campaign with a common plan and policy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not far from the towns of Dipo and Toletum a fight broke out between foraging parties, and as these were reinforced, each from its own camp, gradually all the troops were drawn out into the line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this sudden engagement both the familiar ground and the nature of the fighting favoured the enemy. The two Roman armies were routed and driven back into camp. The enemy did not keep up their pressure on the defeated foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Roman praetors, in order that their camp might not be attacked the next day, in the quiet of the following night with silent signals<note>The order for departure was given not by voice or trumpet but by written message (<hi rend="italics">per tesseram</hi>).</note> led the army away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At daybreak the Spaniards approached the rampart in battle-line and entering an empty camp, contrary to expectations, plundered what had been left behind in the confusion of the night, and returning to their own camp remained quietly in their quarters for a few days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> About five thousand of the Romans and allies fell in the battle and rout, and with their spoils the enemy armed themselves. Then they moved away to the river Tagus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Meanwhile the Roman praetors spent all their time in collecting <pb id="p.313"/>auxiliaries from the allied towns of the Spaniards and<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> in restoring the courage of the men after the panic of the defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When their strength was sufficient and even the soldiers were now demanding the enemy in order to wipe out the previous disgrace, they encamped twelve miles from the river Tagus. Thence, breaking camp in the third watch, they marched in a hollow square at dawn to the banks of the Tagus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Across the river on a hill was the camp of the enemy. Immediately, where the river revealed fords in two places, Calpurnius on the right, Quinctius on the left, led the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> army across, the enemy quietly watching while they marvelled at their sudden advance and talked about how they might have caused confusion while the Romans were disorganized in the act of crossing the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Meanwhile the Romans, having brought over all their trains and massed them in one place, because they saw the enemy already in motion and there was no opportunity to fortify a camp, drew up their line of battle. In the centre were posted the fifth legion of Calpurnius and the eighth of Quinctius: these constituted the strength of the whole army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They had an open plain as far as the camp of the enemy, free from any danger of ambuscade.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Spaniards saw the two Roman columns on the nearer bank, in order to catch them before they could unite and form their ranks, rushing hastily out of their camp they hastened to the conflict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was a fierce fight at the outset, the Spaniards on the one side being puffed up by their recent victory, the Roman soldiers on the other incensed by their unaccustomed defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The fiercest fight was in the centre of the line, composed of the two bravest <pb id="p.315"/>legions. When the enemy saw that they could be<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> dislodged in no other way, they began to attack in wedge formation; and ever more men, more closely massed, were pressing on the centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After Calpurnius the praetor saw that the line was in distress there, he sent Titus Quinctilius Varus and Lucius Juventius Talna, the lieutenants, at full speed to encourage the single legions;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he ordered them to instruct and remind the troops that in them lay all their hopes of victory and of holding Spain: if they retired from that spot, no one in that army would ever see &mdash;not to mention Italy &mdash;even the farther bank of the Tagus river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He himself with the cavalry of the two legions, making a short detour, took in flank the wedge of the enemy which was pressing on the centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius with the allied cavalry attacked the other flank of the enemy. But the cavalry of Calpurnius fought far more furiously, and the praetor beyond the rest:
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for he was both the first to strike down an enemy and so threw himself into the midst that it could scarcely be told to which side he belonged; and the cavalry were inspired by the remarkable valour of the praetor and in turn inspired the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Shame moved the senior centurions when they saw the praetor amid the weapons of the enemy. And so each for himself urged on the standard-bearers, ordered them to advance and the soldiers to follow at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The shouting was renewed by all: an attack was launched as if from higher ground. And so they swept forward like a torrent and overwhelmed the panic-stricken enemy, nor as they charged wave after wave could they be resisted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The cavalry pursued the fugitives to the camp, and mingling with the throng of the enemy <pb id="p.317"/>made their way inside the rampart; there the battle<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> was renewed by the troops who had been left to guard the camp, and the Roman cavalry were forced to dismount.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> While they were fighting thus the fifth legion came up; then, as they could, new forces were joining the battle. Spaniards were being slaughtered everywhere through the whole camp, and not more than four thousand men escaped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> About three thousand of them, who had kept their weapons, occupied a mountain near by; a thousand, most of them partially armed, straggled through the fields. There had been more than thirty-five thousand of the enemy, of whom so small a remnant survived the battle. One hundred and thirty-three standards were taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Of the Romans and allies a few more than six hundred fell, and of the auxiliaries from the province about a hundred and fifty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The loss of five tribunes of the soldiers and of a few Roman knights particularly gave the appearance of a bloody victory.<note>The apparent meaning is that the losses of officers and knights (i.e. men of rank) were disproportionately heavy.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They remained in the camp of the enemy because there had been no opportunity to fortify their own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Before an assembly the next day Gaius Calpurnius praised and decorated the cavalry with trappings for their horses and proclaimed publicly that the enemy had been defeated and his camp taken and captured mainly through their efforts. Quinctius, the other praetor, decorated his cavalry with chains and clasps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Also many centurions from both armies were honoured, especially those who had held the centre of the line.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls, having finished the levies and the other business which had to be transacted in Rome, led the army against the Ligurians, who constituted their province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sempronius, setting out <pb id="p.319"/>from Pisa against the Ligurian Apuani, devastating<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> their lands and burning the villages and forts, opened up the pass as far as the river Macra and the harbour of Luna.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The enemy retired to a mountain, the ancient seat of their forefathers; even from there, the handicap of unfavourable ground having been overcome, they were dislodged by an attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Appius Claudius too equalled the good fortune and valour of his colleague among the Ligurian Ingauni<note>They probably lived south-west of Genoa.</note> in a number of victories. In addition he captured six of their towns; in them he took many thousands of men; forty-three, who had been responsible for the war, he beheaded.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The time for the elections was now approaching. But Claudius arrived in Rome earlier than Sempronius, to whom had fallen by lot the conduct of the elections, because his brother Publius Claudius was seeking the consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had as patrician competitors Lucius Aemilius, Quintus Fabius, Servius Sulpicius Galba, all perennial candidates, who after defeats were again seeking an office which was due them all the more because it had been at first refused.<note>For the psychology cf. XXXV. xxiv. 5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Also, because it was not lawful that more than one from the patricians should be elected, there was a closer race among the four candidates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Influential plebeians also were contending for the office, Lucius Porcius, Quintus Terentius Culleo, Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus,<note>The dates of the praetorships of the candidates were: Claudius, 188; Aemilius, 191; Fabius, 189; Sulpicius, 187; Porcius, 193; Terentius, 187; Baebius, 199 (all B.C.). These dates give some indication of the possible duration of a political career at this period, and show that there were other hard-fought campaigns than those which Livy singles out for special mention: cf. also XL. xxxvii. 6 below.</note> and these too, having suffered defeat, were put off in the hope that some day they would at last<note>The combination <hi rend="italics">tandem aliquando</hi> is highly colloquial.</note> win in the election.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Claudius was the only new candidate of them all. In the general <pb id="p.321"/>opinion of men Quintus Fabius Labeo and Lucius<note type="margin">B.C. 185</note> Porcius Licinus were almost certain of success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But the consul Claudius, without his lictors, flitting with his brother around the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> whole Forum, though his adversaries and the greater part of the senate kept crying out that he should remember that he was the consul of the Roman people rather than the brother of Publius Claudius (why should he not take his seat on the tribunal<note>The <hi rend="italics">tribunal</hi> was a platform erected in the Campus Martius, from which the presiding magistrate conducted the election.</note> and act either as an umpire or else as a silent spectator of the elections?), nevertheless could not be restrained from his zealous canvass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Great contentions among the tribunes of the people, as well, who took part in the fight either against the consul or on his side, disturbed the elections several times, until Appius succeeded in bringing in his brother, Fabius being defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Publius Claudius Pulcher was elected contrary to his own expectations and those of others. Lucius Porcius Licinus held his place because among the plebeians the contest was conducted with moderate partisanship, not with Claudian violence.<note>The direct reference is to the activity of the consul in the election, with more than a hint that such impetuosity was characteristic of the <hi rend="italics">gens Claudia.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then the praetorian elections were held: Gaius Decimius Flavus, Publius Sempronius Longus, Publius Cornelius Cethegus, Quintus Naevius Matho, Gaius Sempronius Blaesus and Aulus Terentius Varro were chosen praetors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Such were the events, at home and abroad, of the consular year of Appius Claudius and Marcus Sempronius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of the following year,<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> when Quintus Caecilius, Marcus Baebius and Tiberius Sempronius, who had been sent to arbitrate between the kings, Philip and Eumenes, and the cities of the Thessalians, had reported on their mission, the consuls Publius Claudius and Lucius Porcius
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> also introduced into the senate the ambassadors of these <pb id="p.323"/>kings and of the cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The same arguments were<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> repeated on both sides that had been used before the commissioners in Greece. Then the Fathers decreed another new commission, of which Appius Claudius was the chief, to go to Greece and Macedonia to see whether the cities had been restored to the Thessalians and Perrhaebians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were also instructed that the garrisons were to be withdrawn from Aenus and Maronea and that the whole sea coast should be freed from Philip and the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were directed to visit the Peloponnesus also, from which the previous commission<note>In chaps. xxiv. &mdash;xxix. above, Livy said nothing about a visit to the Achaean League by the commission headed by Caecilius.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> requested. When Quintus Caecilius complained bitterly of this conduct and the Lacedaemonians at the same time lamented that their walls had been destroyed, their common people taken away to Achaia and enslaved, the laws of Lycurgus, on which their state had been based up to that time, annulled,<note>Cf. XXXVIII. xxxiv; the enslaved commons here are apparently the <hi rend="italics">adscripti</hi> of that chapter.</note> the principal reply of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> the Achaeans to the charge that a council had been refused was to read the law which forbade the calling of the council except when it was a question of peace or war or when ambassadors arrived from the senate with letters or written
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> instructions.<note>It is nowhere made clear whether this was a law of the council itself (cf. XXXI. xxv. 9) or a part of the treaty between Rome and the League.</note> That this excuse might not be given again, the senate made it plain that it was their duty to see that Roman commissioners should always have the opportunity to address the council of the people, <pb id="p.325"/>just as to them too the senate was open as often as<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> they wished.<note>The situation required a delicate adjustment between the sovereignty of the League and the quasi-protectorate of Rome.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these embassies had been dismissed, Philip was informed by his representatives that he was to retire from the cities and withdraw his garrisons; being angered at everyone, he vented his wrath on the Maroneans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He sent word to Onomastus, who was in command of the sea coast, to kill the leading men of the opposing party. Onomastus, through the agency of a certain Casander, one of the king's supporters who had long been a resident of Maronea, admitting the Thracians by night, caused a slaughter as if the town had been captured in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the Roman commissioners complained of such cruel treatment of the unoffending Maroneans and of such arrogant conduct towards the Roman people, that those men whose liberty the senate had declared was to be restored were murdered as if they were enemies, Philip in reply denied that any of this concerned himself or any one of his subjects;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> there had been fighting as a consequence of internal strife, since some were for transferring the city to him, others to the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> this fact they could easily ascertain; let them, he said, question the Maroneans themselves &mdash;not doubting that when all were smitten with the terror of so recent a massacre no one would dare to open his mouth against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Appius replied that so clear a case needed no investigation as if it were not clear. If Philip wished to avert blame from himself he should send Onomastus and Casander, through whom it was said that the plan had been executed, to Rome, in order that the senate might question them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech at first so disconcerted the king that he could not control his colour or <pb id="p.327"/>expression; then, at length collecting his wits, he<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> said that he would send Casander, who had been at Maronea, if they really wished it;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but how did this affair concern Onomastus, who had not only not been at Maronea but had not even been in any district close to it?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And in fact he was both careful to spare Onomastus, as a more valued friend, and was likewise much more afraid of him as an informer, because he himself had exchanged views with him and used him as an agent and accomplice in many such affairs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Casander, moreover, when men were sent to conduct him through Epirus to the sea, was believed to have been done away with by poison, lest in some way his evidence might get out.<note>Polybius (XXIII. xiv.) says bluntly that he was poisoned.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And the commissioners went away from the conference with Philip in such fashion as to advertise the fact that nothing in his conduct pleased them, and Philip
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had no doubt at all that he would have to resort to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Yet, since his strength was still insufficient for that, in order to cause delay, he determined to send his younger son Demetrius<note>The earlier career of Demetrius is briefly sketched in the following. A still younger son, Philip (XLII. lii. 5), is consistently ignored in the Books contained in this volume.</note> to Rome, partly to explain away the charges against him, partly to turn aside the wrath of the senate, being well persuaded that he, even though a young man, because while he was a hostage at Rome he had shown signs of possessing a kingly nature, would have some influence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Meanwhile, setting out under the pretence of bringing aid to the Byzantines, but in reality in order to inspire the chiefs of the Thracians with fear, having defeated them in one battle and captured their leader Amadocus, he returned to Macedonia, sending agents to stir up the barbarians<note>The barbarians referred to were probably the Bastarnae (XL. v. 10), who lived along the lower Hister (Danube)river.</note> living along the Hister river, to the end that they might invade Italy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><pb id="p.329"/>
				<p>In the Peloponnesus also the coming of the Roman<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> commissioners, who had been ordered to proceed from Macedonia to Achaia, was being awaited; and in order that they might have their arguments prepared in advance with which to confront the Romans, the praetor Lycortas called a council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There the question concerned the Lacedaemonians: from enemies they had turned accusers, and there was danger that in defeat they would prove more to be feared than they had been when at war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the war, they reflected, the Achaeans had had the Romans as allies: now the same Romans were more favourably disposed towards the Lacedaemonians than towards the Achaeans, in a situation where even Areus and Alcibiades, both exiles,<note>They had been exiled by Nabis.</note> restored through Achaean influence, had undertaken an embassy to Rome against the Achaean people which had deserved so well of them, and had expressed sentiments so hostile that they seemed to have been driven from their country, not restored to it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A cry went up from all sides that the praetor should offer a motion concerning them by name; and since everything was governed by passion, not deliberation, they were condemned to death. A few days later the Roman commissioners arrived. A council was called for them at Clitor in Arcadia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before they did anything, fear struck the Achaeans and the thought came to them on how unequal grounds the argument was likely to be
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> conducted, because they saw Areus and Alcibiades, who had been condemned to death by them at the latest council, with the commissioners; nor did anyone dare to open his mouth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Appius stated that the conduct of which the Lacedaemonians had complained before the senate was displeasing to the senate: first, the <pb id="p.331"/>slaughter which took place at Compasium of those<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> Lacedaemonians who had come in response to the summons of Philopoemen to plead their cause;<note>Cf. XXXVIII. xxxiii. The scene of the episode has not been mentioned before. Rome had apparently given no indication of its attitude towards this affair, except as it might be inferred from their general attitude towards the Achaeans.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> second, that after they had treated men with such violence, that they might overlook no form of cruelty, they had torn down the walls of a most illustrious city, had repealed their most ancient laws, and had done away with the discipline of Lycurgus, famed as it was throughout the world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Appius had said this, Lycortas, both because he was praetor and because he belonged to the party of Philopoemen, who was responsible for whatever had been done in Lacedaemon, replied thus: "It is more difficult for us, Appius Claudius, to speak in your presence than it was recently in Rome before the senate.<note>He probably means the embassy reported in xxxiii. 7 above, although it is not recorded that Lycortas himself was a member of that embassy, and Livy has not mentioned any argument with the Lacedaemonians at that time. Lycortas was also at Rome in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVIII. xxxii. 5-10).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For then our task was to answer the accusations of the Lacedaemonians: now we have been accused by you, before whom we must plead our cause.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This disadvantage of situation we accept in the hope that you will listen in the spirit of a judge, laying aside the vehemence of a prosecutor with which you spoke a little while ago.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I at any rate, when these complaints which were presented, both here previously before Quintus Caecilius<note>There must have been unofficial conferences with the commissioners even if no meeting of the council was held: cf. xxxiii. 6 above.</note> and in Rome later by the Lacedaemonians, were repeated by you a little while ago, shall believe that I am replying, not to you, but to them in your presence. You bring up the murder of those men who were killed when they had been summoned by the praetor Philopoemen to plead their <pb id="p.333"/>cause. This charge, in my opinion, should not only<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> not have been made against us by you, Romans, but not even by them before you. Why so?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Because it was stated in your treaty that the Lacedaemonians should keep their hands off the towns on the coast. At the time when they took up arms and seized, by a night attack, those cities which they had been ordered to let alone, if Titus Quinctius, if a Roman army, as before, had been in the Peloponnesus, the captured and oppressed would doubtless have fled to them.<note>Cf. XXXVIII. xxx.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> &mdash;xxxi. and the note to xxx. 6.</note> Since you were far away, where else could they flee except to us, whom they had previously seen bringing aid to Gytheum and besieging Lacedaemon in common cause with you? On your behalf, then, we undertook a legal and righteous
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> war. Since others applaud it, since not even the Lacedaemonians can criticize it, and since the very gods themselves, by giving us the victory, have approved it, how can those things which took place under the law of war come into dispute? Yet the greatest part of those things have nothing to do with
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> us. It is our affair that we summoned to plead their cause those who had called the multitude to arms, who had captured the coast towns, who had plundered them, who had caused the murder of the leading men. But as to the fact that they were killed while they were coming to our camp, that is your affair, Areus and Alcibiades &mdash;who now (heaven help us!) are accusing us &mdash;not
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> ours. The exiles of the Lacedaemonians, to which number even these two belonged, were indeed at that time with us, and because they had chosen as their places of residence the towns on the coast believing that they were being sought out, they made an attack on those men thanks to whose efforts they <pb id="p.335"/>saw with indignation that they, exiles from home,<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> could not grow old even in a safe place of
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> exile. Lacedaemonians, then, were killed by Lacedaemonians, not by Achaeans; whether they were killed justly or unjustly it is not important to 
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>inquire.<note>
						<p>Lycortas overlooks the fact that on the day after the riot 63 Lacedaemonians were put to death after a sort of trial, apparently before the Achaeans (XXXVIII. xxxiii. 11). The responsibility of the exiles can extend, then, only to the 17 who were killed in the rioting.</p> 
						<p>It may be remarked that the Achaeans show no sympathy for the victims of Nabis on the ground of their aristocratic tendencies, and are interested in them, so far as one can judge, solely because they provided a means of creating internal discord in Lacedaemon.</p></note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But how can both these criticisms be

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> I believe, too, that the measures we took were not for the disadvantage of the Lacedaemonian state, since we made it part of our League and united it with us, so that there was one body and one council for the whole Peloponnesus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some of them, let us assume, were killed by us: what of it? Did you not behead Campanian senators? But, you say, we tore down their walls: you destroyed, not the walls alone, but the city, the farm lands. The treaty, you say, looks as if it were between equals: in fact, among the Achaeans liberty is a thing bestowed as a favour, among the Romans it amounts even to sovereignty.<note>This must be regarded as a fair statement of the situation, even if the Greeks themselves were mainly to blame. Lycortas appears to mean by the last clause that such liberty as the Achaeans possess under a treaty that was nominally <hi rend="italics">aequum</hi> is the gift of the Romans (<hi rend="italics">precaria</hi>), but that the Romans by virtue of their <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> could take away their gift as easily as they could make it. The reply of Claudius confirms this.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I know this, Appius, and if I should <pb id="p.339"/>not I do not object; but at any rate I beg you, no<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> matter how great the difference may be between the Romans and the Achaeans, not to permit your enemies and ours to be on an equal footing before you with us, your allies, or rather on a better footing.

Lycortas was the father of Polybius, and therefore, even if any corresponding speech in Polybius were preserved, we should find it impossible to judge how much of the version of Livy was genuine. Its sophistry is evident, and it is difficult to see how even a supporter of Philopoemen could have honestly maintained that Lacedaemon had equal rights in the League. But, genuine or imaginary, the speech seems to picture fairly the actual situation that existed in Greece, and its accuracy suggests that Livy had some evidential basis for his composition. For an excellent and well-documented discussion of this question, see Larsen, <quote>Was Greece Free between 196 and <date value="-146">146 B.C.</date>?</quote> in <hi rend="italics">Classical Philology</hi> 30, 1935, 193-214. Larsen's findings agree in general with the point of view of this note, although he does not use this speech as evidence.</note> Lycortas was heard with applause on the part of the majority, and all said that he had spoken in a manner consistent with the dignity of his office, so that it was readily apparent that by a soft answer the Romans could not maintain their position. Then Appius said that he earnestly advised the Achaeans to come to terms while it was still possible to do so of their own free will, lest presently they be forced to take the same action against their will and under compulsion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech was received with a general groan, but it made the Achaeans fear to refuse what <pb id="p.341"/>was ordered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They requested only this, that the<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> Romans should make such changes as seemed proper to them regarding the Lacedaemonians and should not involve the Achaeans in the religious difficulty of making void what they had ratified by oath.<note>The Achaeans, recognizing the inevitability of changes, ask that these changes be enforced upon them by Rome, to spare them the humiliation of breaking their oaths by repealing laws which they had sworn to obey.</note> Only the vote of condemnation which had recently been passed on Areus and Alcibiades was repealed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>XXXVIII. At Rome, in the beginning of this year, when the question of the provinces for the consuls and praetors came up, the Ligurians were decreed to the consuls, since there was war nowhere else. Of the praetors, Gaius Decimius Flavus received the civil jurisdiction, Publius Cornelius Cethegus that between citizens and aliens, Gaius Sempronius Blaesus Sicily, Quintus Naevius Matho Sardinia and the additional task of investigating cases of poisoning, Aulus Terentius Varro Nearer Spain, Publius Sempronius Longus Farther Spain. From these two provinces at about the same time came the lieutenants, Lucius Juventius Talna and Titus Quinctilius Varus, who, after informing the senate how great a war had now been finished in Spain, asked at the same time that by reason of such victories honour should be paid to the immortal gods and that the praetors should be permitted to bring home their armies.<note>The praetors were clearly warned by the experience of Acidinus (xxix. 4-5 above and the note), and tried to avoid giving the senate an excuse to refuse their triumphs.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A thanksgiving for two days was decreed: as to bringing back the legions, they ordered that the question should be brought up anew when the matter of troops for the consuls and praetors was discussed. A few days later the consuls were assigned, for service against the Ligurians, two legions each, which had been under the command of Appius Claudius and Marcus Sempronius. With respect to the Spanish armies, great strife arose between the new praetors and the <pb id="p.343"/>friends of the absent, Calpurnius and Quinctius.<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> Each side had tribunes of the people, each a consul. The one side threatened that they would veto a decree of the senate if they should vote that the armies should be brought home: the others, that if this veto should be used they would permit no other decree to be passed.<note>Since the negative always prevailed in such circumstances, a complete deadlock and suspension of public business were threatened.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In the end the influence of the absent praetors proved unavailing, and a decree of the senate was passed that the praetors should enlist four thousand Roman infantry, three hundred cavalry, and of the allies of the Latin confederacy five thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry, whom they should take with them to Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When they had assigned these four thousand to the legions, in proportion as they numbered more than five thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry per legion, they should discharge the surplus; first, those who had completed their terms of service, second, those individuals whose conspicuous services Calpurnius and Quinctius had enjoyed in the battle.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this strife had calmed down, another straightway arose as a consequence of the death of Gaius Decimius the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Gnaeus Sicinius and Lucius Pupius, who had been aediles the preceding year, and Gaius Valerius the <hi rend="italics">flamen Dialis</hi> and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus &mdash;he, because he was curule aedile elect,<note>Livy has confused the story. If Fulvius was aedileelect only, there could have been no objection to his wearing the <hi rend="italics">toga candida</hi> (a curule magistrate wore the <hi rend="italics">toga praetexta</hi>), and no question of holding two offices at once could have arisen, since his partial term as praetor would expire when his term as aedile began (cf. VII. xlii. 2 for the law forbidding two offices at the same time). We must therefore conclude with Mommsen (St. <hi rend="italics">R.</hi> I. 513, n. 3) that Fulvius was aedile, not aedile-elect.</note> did not wear the <hi rend="italics">toga candida,</hi> but was canvassing more energetically than the rest &mdash;were the candidates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The race was between Fulvius and the <hi rend="italics">flamen.</hi> And when Fulvius <pb id="p.345"/>seemed at first to be on equal terms with Valerius<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> and then even to be passing him, part of the tribunes of the people declared that his candidacy ought not to be accepted<note>The presiding magistrate had wide discretion in accepting or rejecting candidacies.</note> because one man could not seek or hold two offices simultaneously, especially curule offices;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> part thought that he should be exempted from the operation of the laws, so that the people might have the opportunity of electing whomsoever they wished to the praetorship.<note>The doctrine here expressed had been most recently invoked for the benefit of Flamininus in <date value="-199">199 B.C.</date> (XXXII. vii. 11).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius Porcius the consul was at first of the opinion that he should not accept his name; then, that he might take this action with the authorization of the senate,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> calling together the Fathers, he said that he was referring the matter to them because there was neither any law nor any precedent, acceptable in a free state, that a curule aedile elect might seek the praetorship; unless something else seemed best to them, it was his intention to hold the election in accordance with the law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Fathers voted that the consul Lucius Porcius should appeal to Quintus Fulvius not to stand in the way of the election of a praetor, as a successor to Gaius Decimius, being held in accordance with the law. When the consul made this appeal in accordance with the decree of the senate, Flaccus replied that he would do nothing which was unworthy of himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By this ambiguous answer he had created, in the minds of men who interpreted it to suit their own desires, the hope that he would yield to the authority of the Fathers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At the election he continued his canvassing even more actively than before, charging that the consul and the senate were wresting from him the gift of the Roman people and were arousing hostility to him by their talk of duplicated offices, as if it were not evident that when he should be elected<note>One expects <hi rend="italics">renuntiatus</hi> rather than <hi rend="italics">designatus,</hi> but there is no authority for it in the MSS.</note> <pb id="p.347"/>praetor he would immediately resign the aedileship.<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the consul saw both that the stubbornness of the candidate increased and that the favour of the people was turning more and more to him, he adjourned the assembly and summoned the senate. A full meeting declared that, since the authority of the Fathers had had no influence with Flaccus, the appeal to Flaccus should be made before the assembly.<note>The first appeal had been made privately, although the reply of Flaccus had at once been made known.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the consul had called an informal meeting and presented his plea, Flaccus, not even then moved from his position, expressed his gratitude to the Roman people because with such enthusiasm, as often as the opportunity to declare their desires had been granted to them, they had wished to make him praetor: it was not his intention to disappoint these desires of his fellow-citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This speech, obstinate though it was, aroused so much enthusiasm for him that he would be praetor beyond a doubt if the consul would accept his candidacy.<note>Their ardour cooled later, and Flaccus did not become praetor until two years after this (lvi. 5 below).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then the tribunes had a great argument, both among themselves and with the consul, until the senate was convoked by the consul and passed this decree: that since the stubbornness of Quintus Flaccus and the base desires of men prevented the holding, in accordance with the
					<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> laws, of the election to fill a vacancy among the praetors, the senate decreed that there were enough praetors; Publius Cornelius should hold both jurisdictions in the City and should preside at the games to Apollo.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this election had been avoided by the wisdom and courage of the senate, another followed,<note>Cf. the similar contest at the preceding election of <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVII. lvii. 9 &mdash;lviii. 2).</note> involving a greater contest, as it was both for a more important prize and participated in by more and more powerful

Publius Scipio is Nasica, Lucius Scipio was striving for rehabilitation after his trial, but the outcome of the election suggests that the glory of the Scipios had, at least for a time, departed.</note> But among all the patricians and plebeians of the most illustrious houses, Marcus Porcius Cato stood out most conspicuously. In this man there was such force of mind and character that in whatever station he had been born it seemed that he would have made his fortune for
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> himself. No art of conducting either private or public business was lacking to him; he was equally skilled in affairs of the city and of the farm. Some men were advanced to the highest offices by knowledge of the law, others by eloquence, others by military reputation: his comprehensive genius was so adapted to everything alike that you would say that whatever he was doing was the one thing for which he was
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> born: in war he was the bravest of fighters and was famous for many remarkable battles,<note>That is, battles in which he took part as a private.</note> and after he attained to the highest offices, he was likewise a consummate commander; the same man in peace was, if you asked advice on law, most skilled therein, if there was a case to be pleaded, most eloquent, nor was he merely one whose tongue was potent while he lived but left no record of his
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> eloquence: rather, he lives and flourishes by his eloquence, enshrined in books of every kind. There are many orations, both for himself and for and against others; for he wore down his enemies not only by accusing them but also by pleading his own
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> cause.<note>Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Cato Major,</hi> xv.) says that Cato was put on trial about fifty times.</note> Feuds in excessive numbers pursued him <pb id="p.351"/>and he himself pursued them;<note>The play on the verb is so clumsy that it may have been preserved from Livy's source.</note> nor could you easily<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> say whether the nobility worked harder to suppress him or he to irritate the nobility. Without question he had a stern temper, a bitter tongue and one immoderately free, but he had a soul unconquerable by appetites, an unwavering integrity, and a contempt for influence and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> wealth. In his economy, in his endurance of toil and danger, he was of almost iron-like body and mind, and his mind not even old age, which weakens everything, could break down, since at
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the age of eighty-six he pleaded a case, spoke and wrote in his own defence, and in his ninetieth year brought Servius Galba to trial before the 
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>assembly.<note>
						<p>According to <hi rend="italics">Per.</hi> XLIX, L. Scribonius and not Cato prosecuted Galba for his treacherous treatment of the Lusitanians. Cato, however, spoke against him (Cicero. <hi rend="italics">de oratore</hi> I. 227; <hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi> 89, etc.).</p> 
						<p>This characterization raises once more the question of a special source dealing with Cato which Livy used (cf. XXXIV. xxi. 8; XXXVI. xxi. 4-6 and the notes).
							<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> I see no reason &mdash; least of all the play on words mentioned in the preceding note &mdash; why this passage and the account of the censorship in the' following chapters should not have been derived from the same source.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Against him as a candidate on this occasion the nobility, as throughout his life, used their influence; and all the candidates except Lucius Flaccus, who had been his colleague in the consulship, had formed a combination
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> to keep him from the office,<note>Formal <hi rend="italics">coitiones</hi> were illegal, but informal combinations could not be prevented. The other candidates were all more or less closely allied with the Scipionic party.</note> not only that they themselves might rather win it nor because they objected to seeing a <quote>new man</quote><note>Cf. XXXVII. lvii. 2 and the note.</note> chosen censor, but also because they anticipated a stern censorship dangerous to the reputation of many, from a man who had both been injured by many and was eager to do injury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For even then he was canvassing by means of threats, charging that <pb id="p.353"/>he was being opposed by men who feared a free and<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> courageous censorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the same time he canvassed for Lucius Valerius also: with him alone as his colleague could he chastise the new vices and revive the ancient character. Aroused by such arguments and against the opposition of the nobility, the citizens not only chose Marcus Porcius as censor, but also gave him Lucius Flaccus as his colleague.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the election of the censors the consuls and praetors departed for their provinces, with the exception of Quintus Naevius, who was detained for not less than four months before he could set out for Sardinia by the investigation of poisonings, a great part of which he conducted outside the City, in the municipalities and rural communities, because this method seemed more convenient.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If one wishes to trust Valerius Antias, he condemned about two thousand persons. And Lucius Postumius the praetor, to whom the province of Tarentum had fallen, broke up large conspiracies of shepherds<note>Cf. xxix. 8-9 above, which seems to be duplicated by this item.</note> and diligently prosecuted what was left of the Bacchanalian investigation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Many who either had not appeared when summoned or had abandoned their sureties, hiding in that part of Italy, he pronounced guilty in some cases, and in others he arrested them and sent them to the senate in Rome. All were thrown into prison by Publius Cornelius.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Farther Spain, the Lusitanians having been broken in the last campaign, things were quiet; in Nearer Spain Aulus Terentius among the Suessetani took the town of Corbio with sheds and siegeworks and sold the captives: after that the nearer province too had a quiet winter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The former praetors Gaius Calpurnius Piso and Lucius Quinctius <pb id="p.355"/>returned to Rome. To each of them a triumph was<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> decreed by the general consent of the Fathers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> First Gaius Calpurnius triumphed over the Lusitanians and Celtiberians: he displayed eighty-three golden crowns and twelve thousand pounds of silver. A few days later Lucius Quinctius Crispinus triumphed over the same Lusitanians and Celtiberians: the same amount of gold and silver was carried in this triumph.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The censors Marcus Porcius and Lucius Valerius chose the senate amid suspense mingled with fear;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> they expelled seven from the senate, one of whom was distinguished by both high birth and political success, Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, a man of consular rank.<note>Though older than his brother Titus, he had served under him against Philip and had reached the consulship in <date value="-192">192 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Within the memory of our fathers the custom is said to have arisen that the censors should affix the <hi rend="italics">nota</hi> to the names of those who are expelled from the senate. But in this case there are speeches of Cato<note>H. Meyer (<hi rend="italics">Oratorum Romanorum Fragmenta</hi>) listed twentysix censorial speeches of Cato (nos. 24-49 incl.), although not all are directed at individuals and the dates of some are uncertain. Other scholars compile different lists, but it is at least clear that Cato's censorship was active and that his decisions were vigorously contested.</note> and indeed other bitter orations. against those who were either expelled from the senate or whose horses were taken from them,<note>This constituted removal from the list of <hi rend="italics">equites.</hi></note> by far the most vehement being that against Lucius Quinctius, and if he had made this speech as an accuser before the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> branding rather than as censor after the branding, Lucius Quinctius could not have been kept in the senate even by his brother Titus Quinctius, had he been censor at the time. Among other things he reproached him regarding Philippus, a Carthaginian, a notorius prostitute whom he loved and whom he had attracted from Rome to his province of Gaul by the promise of great gifts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This boy, says Cato, in the course of his playful jesting, used frequently to reproach the consul because just on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> eve of the gladiatorial games he had been <pb id="p.357"/>carried off from Rome, that he might sell his favours<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> to his lover.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By chance, when they were dining and were by now heated with wine, it was announced in the dining-room that a noble Boian, accompanied by his sons, had come as a deserter; he wished, they said, to meet the consul, that he might obtain a safeguard from him personally. Having been introduced into the tent, Cato continued, he began to address the consul through an interpreter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> While he was speaking, Quinctius said to the boy, <quote>Do you wish, since you missed the gladiatorial show, to see now this Gaul dying?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And when he nodded, although not really in earnest, the consul, at the boy's nod, seized the sword that was hanging above his head and first struck the head of the Gaul while he was speaking, and then, as the Gaul was fleeing and calling for the protection of the Roman people and of those who were present, he stabbed him through the side.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Valerius Antias, as one who had never read the speech of Cato and had accepted the story as if it were nothing but a story anonymously circulated, gives another version,<note>This form of the story was followed by Valerius Maximus (II. ix. 3) and possibly by Cicero (<hi rend="italics">Cato maior</hi> 42).</note> similar, however, in its lust and cruelty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He writes that at Placentia a notorious woman, with whom Flamininus was desperately in love,<note>The phrase is conventional in erotic literature.</note> had been invited to dinner. There he was boasting to the courtesan, among other things, about his severity in the prosecution of cases and how many persons he had in chains, under sentence of death, whom he intended to behead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the woman, reclining below him, said that she had never seen a person beheaded and was very anxious to behold the sight. Hereupon, he says, the generous lover, ordering one of the wretches to be brought to him, <pb id="p.359"/>cut off his head with his sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This deed, whether<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note> it was performed in the manner for which the censor rebuked him, or as Valerius reports it, was savage and cruel: in the midst of drinking and feasting, where it is the custom to pour libations to the gods and to pray for blessings, as a spectacle for a shameless harlot, reclining in the bosom of a consul, a human victim sacrificed and bespattering the table with his blood!
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the end of the speech a challenge of Cato to Quinctius is reported: if he would deny this act and the other things which Cato had charged, he should defend himself by legal methods,<note>Although mentioned also by Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Cato</hi> 17), the procedure is obscure. The <hi rend="italics">sponsio</hi> (a sort of judicial wager) was a recognized feature of legal procedure, but it may be less technically used here. Plutarch represents this challenge as given and accepted before the assembly: this could be true only in case of a conviction and an appeal.

				<p>In the same year two colonies, Potentia in the <pb id="p.363"/>Picene territory, Pisaurum in the Gallic, were<note type="margin">B.C. 184</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> founded. Six <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> were given to each colonist. The division of the land and the organization of the colonies were the work of the same commissioners, Quintus Fabius Labeo, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus and Quintus Fulvius

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For the following year they announced the election of Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Quintus Fabius Labeo as consuls.</p> 
				<p>Marcus Claudius and Quintus Fabius, on the Ides<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> of March, the day on which they were inaugurated, brought up the question of provinces for themselves and the praetors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The praetors who had been elected were Gaius Valerius, the <hi rend="italics">flamen Dialis,</hi> who had been a candidate the preceding year also, and Spurius Postumius Albinus and Publius Cornelius Sisenna, Lucius Pupius, Lucius Julius, Gnaeus Sicinius.<note>It seems strange that Livy should have separated the praetorian election from the consular in this fashion, and the use of conjunctions in this sentence is unusual. Yet the MSS. show no signs of dislocation, and the tense of <hi rend="italics">creati erant</hi> shows that the sentence was meant to be here, unless it was emended by some very early scribe after the dislocation had occurred.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the consuls the Ligurians were decreed as their province, with the same armies which Publius Claudius and Lucius Porcius had had. The Spains, excluded from the lot, were reserved for the praetors of the previous year, along with their armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The praetors were ordered to draw lots with the provision that the province of the <hi rend="italics">flamen Dialis</hi> should be one of the jurisdictions in Rome:<note>He was not permitted, by virtue of his priesthood, to be away from Rome overnight (V. lii. 13). Livy says nothing about the arrangement about his oath, which he had to take by proxy when he held the office of aedile (XXXI. i. 7 and the note).</note> the praetorship which he drew dealt with cases between citizens and aliens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The civil jurisdiction fell to Cornelius Sisenna, Sicily to Spurius Postumius, Apulia to Lucius Pupius, Gaul to Lucius Julius, Sardinia to Gnaeus Sicinius. Lucius Julius was directed to <pb id="p.365"/>hasten his departure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Transalpine Gauls, as has<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> been said before,<note>Cf. xxii. 6-7 above and the note.</note> crossing into Italy by a pass hitherto unknown, were building a city in the territory which now belongs to Aquileia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The praetor was instructed to prevent them from doing this, so far as it was possible for him to do so without war. If they had to be prevented by arms, he was to inform the consuls: it was the senate's desire that one of them should lead the legions against the Gauls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>At the end of the preceding year an election had been held to choose an augur in the place of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus, who had died; Spurius Postumius Albinus had been elected.<note>I have chosen the simplest course, by retaining the reading of <hi rend="italics">M</hi> as the nearest possible approach to the true text now available. The various readings of <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> differ as to the proper nouns but agree on <hi rend="italics">creatus erat,</hi> so that <hi rend="italics">M<foreign lang="greek">s</foreign></hi> all preserve the apparent error of fact that Postumius is said to have been elected, whereas co-optation was the rule until <date value="-104">104 B.C.</date> There is, then, nothing to be gained by piecemeal emendation. The question of dislocation again arises (cf. the note to sect. 2 above), and it can be argued here that the displacement was deliberate, for the sake of continuity with the following sentence, but this emphasis seems disproportionate to the historical or rhetorical importance of the sentence. Again the MSS. show no signs of dislocation and the tense of the verbs must have been changed very early, if at all.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the occasion of the funeral of Publius Licinius a public distribution of meats took place, and one hundred and twenty gladiators fought and funeral games were given for three days, and after the games a banquet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> During this, when the banqueting tables had been arranged through the whole Forum, a storm coming up with great gusts of wind drove most people to set up <pb id="p.367"/>tents in the Forum: these, a little later, when it<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> had cleared up all around, were taken down;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and the general talk was that the omen had been fulfilled, because the soothsayers had declared that it was among the decrees of the fates that it was destined that tents should be set up in the Forum.<note>Pessimists would naturally expect that the tents of the prophecy would be those of the enemy who was master of the City, but the omen has now been harmlessly fulfilled.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> From King Eumenes also came an embassy, including his brother Athenaeus, to complain both because the garrisons were not withdrawn from the cities in Thrace and because aid had been sent to Prusias in Bithynia, who was waging war against Eumenes.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he replied that he had received them, it was resolved that nothing should have preference or precedence over hearing the answers of the king himself to these several charges. They immediately demanded the book and then allowed him to read it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The arguments, however, on single items were given in a brief digest; for example, that he had done some things in accordance with the decrees of commissioners, other things he had been prevented from doing, not through his own fault, but that of the very persons who made the accusations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had included also complaints about the injustice of the decrees and how unfair had been the discussion before Caecilius, and how he had been trampled upon by everyone unjustifiably and in no wise as he deserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate took these to be indications of his irritation; but when the young man apologized for some things and undertook that in the future <pb id="p.371"/>other things should be done as the senate specifically<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> desired, it was decided to reply that his father had done nothing more correctly or more in accordance with the senate's wishes than that, whatever his own conduct
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> had been, he had wished to be justified in the eyes of the Romans through his son Demetrius. The senate, they said, could close its eyes to much and could forget and let the past be past and continue to trust to Demetrius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For they held his soul hostage, even though his body had been restored to his father, and they knew that,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> so far as his loyalty to his father would permit, he would be a friend to the Roman people, and for the sake of doing him honour they would send ambassadors to Macedonia, to say that if anything had not been done which should have been done, it might even then be done without any atonement being required for previous omissions.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>One event worthy of record occurred: although the Achaeans had the advantage in the war, their praetor Philopoemen was captured, who, in order to get the lead in occupying Coron&ecirc;, for which the enemy was making, entered a dangerous valley, accompanied by a small guard of cavalry, and was surprised.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They say that he himself could have escaped with the aid of the Thracians and Cretans; but the shame, if he should abandon the cavalry, the noblest of the people, and recently chosen by him personally, restrained him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> While he was offering them a way of escape from the narrow pass by holding the rear in person, sustaining <pb id="p.375"/>the charge of the enemy, his horse fell and he himself<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> was very near to perishing from the shock to
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> himself and the weight of the horse which came down upon him, being now seventy years old and much weakened in strength as the result of a long illness from which he was then just recovering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The enemy, rushing past, came upon him lying there; recognizing him at once, because of their veneration for him and their recollection of his past services, they raised him up as if he were their own leader, revived him and carried him out of the retired
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> valley to the high-road, scarcely believing their own eyes for this unexpected joy; part of them sent messengers ahead to Messen&ecirc; to say that the war was over and that they were bringing Philopoemen a prisoner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first this seemed so incredible that his words were listened to, not merely as vain, but as the words of a messenger who was scarcely sane.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, as one after another came, all bringing the same tidings, at length they were convinced; and before they knew for certain that he was approaching the city, all alike, free and slave, children along with the women, rushed out. So the crowd had blocked the gate, while each for himself, if he had not seen it with his own eyes, would scarcely accept so great a thing as true.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The men who were bringing Philopoemen were hardly able to thrust aside the bystanders and enter the gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> An equally crowded mass had blocked the rest of the way; and when the largest part had been excluded from the spectacle, they suddenly filled the theatre, which adjoined the street, and with one voice all demanded that he should be brought there to be seen by the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The magistrates and leading citizens, fearing that pity for so great a <pb id="p.377"/>man, present before their eyes, might cause some<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> disturbance, since regret at his former greatness compared with his present fortune would move some and recollection of his tremendous services others, placed him in sight but at a distance, and then speedily removed him from the eyes of men, the praetor Dinocrates saying that
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> there were matters pertaining to the final issue of the war on which the magistrates wished to question him. Then, after taking him to the senate-house and calling the council, they began their deliberations.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now growing dark, and not only were all other things uncertain, but even where they could guard him with sufficient safety even for the ensuing night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had been awed by the greatness of his former success and courage, and neither did they dare to receive him into their own homes for guarding nor were they satisfied to entrust the guardianship of him to any one man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then someone reminded them that there was a public treasury underground, walled in by hewn stones.<note>It resembled the Tullianum in Rome, in design if not in use.</note> Bound, he was let down into it and a great stone by which it was closed placed by machinery over it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So, thinking that they should trust the place, rather than any man, to keep him safe, they waited for the coming morning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The next day the whole multitude, mindful of his former services to the state, considered that he should be spared and that through him remedies should be sought out for their present troubles:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the authors of the revolt, who had the administration in' their hands, held a secret consultation, and all were agreed upon his death. But it was not agreed whether they should act at once or delay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The faction that was more insistent on punishment prevailed, and a <pb id="p.379"/>man was sent to take him the poison. Receiving the<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> cup, he asked only if Lycortas &mdash;he was the other commander<note>The <hi rend="italics">hipparchus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">praefectus equitum</hi> (XXXV. xxxiv. 9) was second in command.</note> of the Achaeans &mdash;was safe and if the cavalry had escaped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When he was assured that they were safe, he said <quote>it is well,</quote> and courageously draining the cup perished no long time afterwards. The persons responsible for this act of cruelty had no great time in which to rejoice in his death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For Messen&ecirc;, being conquered in the war, at the demand of the Achaeans handed over the guilty persons, and the bones of Philopoemen were given back and he was buried by the whole Achaean League, all human distinctions being heaped upon him to such a degree that they did not even refrain from divine honours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Greek and Latin historians pay such tribute to this man that some of them have put it on record, as if it were a conspicuous brand of infamy set against this year, that three famous generals died during this year &mdash;Philopoemen, Hannibal, Publius Scipio:
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> on terms of such equality have they placed him with the greatest commanders of the two most. powerful nations.<note>This revives the question of the date of Scipio's death, to which Livy had found no answer when he wrote the latter chapters of Book XXXVIII, and which he discusses again in chap. lii. below. (It remains a mystery why he did not consolidate this chapter with his earlier discussion.) Antiquity was fond of coincidences, and it was convenient, if only for mnemonic reasons, 'to have the three greatest generals associated in death, even if only two were associated in life (Philopoemen had been compared with Flamininus rather than with Scipio: cf. XXXV. xxx. 12-13 and the note).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Titus Quinctius Flamininus went as an ambassador to King Prusias, whom the Romans suspected both because he had given shelter to Hannibal after the flight of Antiochus<note>Cf. XXXVII. xlv. 16 and the note.</note> and because he had begun and was carrying on war against Eumenes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, whether Prusias was reproached by Flamininus on this ground among others, because <pb id="p.381"/>of all living men the one who was most dangerous<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> to the Roman people was at his court, the man who had first urged his own country and then, after its defeat, King Antiochus to war upon the Roman people, or whether Prusias himself, in order to do a favour to Flamininus when he came and to the Romans, formed the plan of killing him or giving him into custody;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for whatever reason, immediately after the first conference with Flamininus he sent soldiers to put the house of Hannibal under guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal had always foreseen such an end to his life, both from his knowledge of the insatiable hatred of the Romans for him and from his lack of faith in the loyalty of kings: as for Prusias, he had in fact experienced his fickleness;<note>The meaning of the allusion is not known.</note> then too the arrival of Flamininus had made him tremble as at the signal for his doom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Having regard to the dangers which were all around him, in order that he might always have some way of escape in readiness, he had made seven exits from his house, and some of these were secret, lest he might be hemmed in by guards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the dread power of kings leaves nothing unexplored when they want it traced down. They surrounded the whole area about the house with guards, so that no one could escape from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the word was brought to him that the king's troops were in the vestibule, Hannibal attempted to escape by a side door which was out of the way and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> especially adapted to a stealthy departure, and when he found that this too was blocked by guards stationed around it, he called for the poison which he had long kept ready for such emergencies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <quote>Let us,</quote> he said, <quote>relieve the Roman people of their long anxiety, since they <pb id="p.383"/>find it tedious to wait for the death of an old man.<note>Nepos (<hi rend="italics">Hannibal</hi> 13) gives his age at his death as 70, but says that different authorities place his death in 183, 182, and <date value="-181">181 B.C.</date></note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> Neither magnificent nor memorable will be the victory which Flamininus will win over a man unarmed and betrayed. How much the manners of the Roman people have changed, this day in truth will
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> prove. Their fathers sent word to King Pyrrhus, an enemy in arms, commanding an army in Italy, warning him to beware of poison: these Romans have sent an ambassador of consular rank to urge upon Prusias the crime of murdering his
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> guest.</quote> Then, cursing the person and the kingdom of Prusias and calling upon the gods of hospitality to bear witness to his breach of faith, he drained the cup. This was the end of the life of Hannibal.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Scipio also, as both Polybius and Rutilius<note>Polybius (XXIV. ix. &mdash;ix.a) and Rutilius (consul <date value="-105">105 B.C.</date>, a member of the Scipionic circle, although much younger than the majority, and a writer of memoirs) should have had access to family records and other evidence as to the date. Yet apparently Polybius (<hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>; cf. Nepos, <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>), despite what Livy says here, puts the date a year later. Rutilius is nowhere else quoted by Livy.</note> write, died this year. For my part, I agree neither with them nor with Valerius<note>Antias dated Scipio's death in <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date>: XXXVIII. liii. 8.</note> &mdash;not with them, because in the censorship of Marcus Porcius and Lucius Valerius I find that the <hi rend="italics">princeps senatus</hi> chosen was the same Lucius Valerius who was censor, whereas in the two preceding <hi rend="italics">lustra</hi><note>The censors of <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> gave him this rank for the third time (XXXVIII. xxviii. 2 and the note). The choice of Valerius in <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> is not mentioned in the running account of the censorship (xliii. 5 &mdash;xliv. 9 above).</note> Africanus had held this distinction, and while he lived, unless he had been expelled from the senate, a disgrace which no one has recorded, another <hi rend="italics">princeps</hi> would not have been chosen in
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> his stead.<note>Livy thus concludes that Scipio was dead before the <hi rend="italics">lectio</hi> by Cato and Flaccus. Their active term as censors extended from March 15, <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date>, to about mid-September <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date>, and the <hi rend="italics">lectio</hi> might have been held late in the period. So far as this evidence goes, then, Scipio's death might have occurred as late as the summer of <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date>, and Livy's criticism is not necessarily valid.</note> The refutation of Antias as an authority is the tribune of the people Marcus Naevius, <pb id="p.385"/>against whom was directed, according to the title,<note>Cf. XXXVIII. lvi. 6 and the note. Livy forgets here his own remark, that the speech itself did not contain the name of Naevius.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> the speech of Publius Africanus. This Naevius, in the books of the magistrates,<note>Presumably official registers containing the names of the magistrates year by year.</note> is named as tribune of the people in the consulship of Publius Claudius and Lucius Porcius, but he entered upon the tribunate in the consulship of Appius Claudius and Marcus Sempronius, on the fourth day before the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Ides of December. From that time it is three months to the Ides of March, when Publius Claudius and Lucius
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Porcius were inaugurated.<note>Inauguration day for consuls at this period was March 15; for tribunes, apparently at all times, December 10. Naevius then entered upon his office December 10, <date value="-185">185 B.C.</date> (Ap. Claudius M. Sempronius coss.), and his term was concurrent with that of P. Claudius and Porcius (and of Cato and Flaccus) from March 15 to December 10, <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> If Naevius was the prosecutor Scipio could not have been tried in <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date> Livy does not observe that his criticism brings under suspicion his entire narrative of the trial, so far as it is based on Antias.</note> Thus it seems that he lived in the tribunate of Naevius and that he might have been accused by him, but died before the censorship of Lucius Valerius and Marcus Porcius.<note>
						<p>The last sentence seems to be an attempt to reconcile conflicting testimony. Livy has rejected <date value="-183">183 B.C.</date> (Polybius and Rutilius) because he believes that Scipio was dead before the censorship of Cato and Flaccus beginning March 15, <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date> He has rejected <date value="-187">187
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> B.C.</date> (Antias) because he now believes that Naevius was the prosecutor (term beginning December 10, <date value="-185">185 B.C.</date>). Since Livy thinks that death followed soon after the trial, this reasoning brackets both events as having occurred between December 10, <date value="-185">185 B.C.</date>, and March 15, <date value="-184">184 B.C.</date>, this being the portion of the term of Naevius which does not overlap that of Cato and Flaccus.</p> 
						<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The whole is an interesting specimen of Livy's historical criticism, the more valuable because there are
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> so few parallels. But his readiness to follow one source, almost blindly in Book XXXVIII, while professing his inability to reconcile it with other sources, his refutation of that same source in this passage, the fallacies in his own argumentation, and his ability to omit important details, do not increase our faith in his critical sense. (Of the two pieces of evidence employed here, he neglected one and rejected the other in Book XXXVIII.) One wonders how much of what he had said in Book XXXVIII. was in his active memory when he wrote Book XXXIX. and why the earlier narrative was allowed to stand after he was convinced that it was wrong.</p></note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>It seems that the deaths of these three men, each the most famous among his own people, are comparable not so much because of the coincidence of their times, as because no one of them met an end worthy of the brilliance of his life. In the first <pb id="p.387"/>place, none of them either died or was buried in his B.C. 183<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> native
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> land. Hannibal and Philopoemen were carried off by poison; Hannibal was an exile, betrayed by his host, Philopoemen, a captive, died in prison and in chains; Scipio, although not an exile or condemned, yet, because he was absent when summoned, on the day he failed to stand trial, pronounced a sentence of voluntary exile not only upon himself but upon his funeral.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these events,<note>Cf. xlviii. 6 above.</note> from which my narrative turned aside, were occurring in the Peloponnesus, the return of Demetrius and the other ambassadors to Macedonia had made different impressions upon different minds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The mass of the Macedonians, terrified by the fear of the war which threatened from the Romans, looked with very great favour upon Demetrius as the author of peace, and at the same time marked him with assured hope for the throne after the death of his father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For although he was younger in years than Perseus, men recalled that Demetrius was born of a legal wife, the other of a concubine; that the elder, the offspring of a body accessible to all, bore no sure mark of his father,<note>Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Aemilius,</hi> viii.) hints that Perseus was not the son of Philip, and in XL. ix. 2 Perseus himself suggests the same possibility.</note> while Demetrius displayed a notable resemblance to Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Besides, they said, the Romans would establish Demetrius upon his father's throne, while Perseus would have no influence with them. Such was the general talk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly Perseus, on the one hand, was anxiously afraid that his age by itself would not carry sufficient weight in his behalf, while his brother had the advantage in all other respects, and on the other, Philip himself, believing that
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> it would hardly be in his power to decide which son, he should leave as heir to his <pb id="p.389"/>throne, kept saying that his younger son was a<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> greater burden to him than he wished.<note>Both thought and language closely parallel those of Antiochus in similar circumstances (XXXV. xv. 4).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was displeased at times by the throngs of Macedonians who visited his son, and was indignant that while he lived there should be a second court.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And there is no doubt that the young man had returned too much puffed up regarding himself,<note>Livy hints at (xlvii. 3-11 above), and Polybius XXIII. (XXIV.) iii. stresses the harm which the senate did by stimulating the vanity of Demetrius.</note> relying somewhat on the judgments of the senate about him, and on the concessions made to him of what had been refused to his father;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and whatever importance every reference to the Romans brought to him with the rest of the Macedonians, it brought him also exactly as much ill-will,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> not only with his brother but even with his father, especially after other<note>Probably Marcius is meant (xlviii. 5 above).</note> Roman commissioners came and Philip was compelled to evacuate Thrace and withdraw his garrisons and do other things in accordance with either the decisions of previous commissioners or the new arrangements of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But, although it was with grief and lamentation, the more because he saw his son more frequently in the company of the commissioners than with himself, he nevertheless obeyed the Romans in everything, in order to give them no reason for immediately declaring war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thinking also that their thoughts should be diverted from any suspicion of such designs, he led his army through the interior of Thrace against the Odrysae and Dentheleti and Bessi:
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> he took the city of Philippopolis,<note>Probably in the territory of the Odrysae; not the town of the same name mentioned in xxv. 3 above.</note> deserted by the flight of its citizens, who with their families had fled to the nearest mountains, and received in surrender the barbarians of the plain, after plundering their farms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Leaving a garrison in Philippopolis <pb id="p.391"/>(it was expelled a little later by the Odrysae), he<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> decided to found a city in Deuriopus &mdash;this is a district in Paeonia &mdash;near the Erigonus river, which flows from Illyricum through Pelagonia and empties into the Axius river not far from the ancient city of Stobi:
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> to the new city he ordered the name of Perseis to be given, so as to show honour to his elder son.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was going on in Macedonia, the consuls departed for their provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcellus sent a messenger ahead to the proconsul Lucius Porcius, ordering him to move the legions to the new town of the Gauls.<note>Cf. xxii. 6-7 and xlv. 6-7 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the arrival of the consul the Gauls surrendered. There were twelve thousand armed men: most of them had weapons picked up in the country;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> these were taken from them, to their great displeasure, and whatever else they had either carried off while ravaging the fields or had brought with them. They sent ambassadors to Rome to complain of this treatment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Introduced to the senate by Gaius Valerius the praetor, they explained that since the population of Gaul was too great, compelled by poverty and the unproductiveness of the soil, they had crossed the Alps in search of a home, and when they found a region which was untilled for lack of settlers, there they established themselves without injuring anyone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had even, they said, begun to build a town, which was an indication that they had come with no design to harm either farm or city. Recently Marcus Claudius had sent a message to them that he would make war upon them if they did-not surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Preferring an assured though unattractive peace to the uncertainties of war, they had entrusted <pb id="p.393"/>themselves to the good faith rather than to the power of<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> the Roman people.<note>Their situation is not unlike that of the Aetolians (XXXVI. xxvii. 8
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;xxviii. 6 and the notes).</note> When, a few days later, they were ordered to leave the town and the country as well, they had planned to go away in silence, wherever in the world they could. Then, they went on to say, their arms were taken from them, and finally everything else which they were carrying or
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> driving. They begged the senate and the Roman people not to treat innocent persons who had surrendered more harshly than
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> enemies. The senate ordered the reply to be given to this appeal, that neither had they acted properly when they came into Italy and attempted to build a town on others' land, without the permission of any Roman magistrate who was in charge of that province;<note>The eastern boundary of Cisalpine Gaul had never been defined, and the Gauls may have innocently supposed that the Romans did not intend to occupy this region. Roman ambitions, however, were now directed to Histria, and a colony at Aquileia was contemplated (lv. 4-6 below).</note> nor did it please the senate to despoil men who had
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> surrendered. Accordingly, the senate would send with them ambassadors to the consul who would direct him, on condition that they would return whence they had come, to give back all their property, and who would then cross the Alps and warn the Gallic tribes to keep their population at home: the Alps were an almost insuperable boundary between
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> them: in any case they would fare no better than those who had first made them passable.<note>That is, earlier Gallic invaders who had met defeat on Italian soil.</note> The ambassadors who were sent were Lucius Furius Purpurio,<note>Furius may have been one of the senators who received the <hi rend="italics">nota</hi> (xlii. 5-6 above): the fragments of Cato's speeches against a Furius (the identification is not quite certain) seem to date from his censorship. If this is true, the embassy must have preceded the <hi rend="italics">lectio senatus.</hi></note> Quintus Minucius, Lucius Manlius
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Acidinus. The Gauls, having recovered all the property which they acquired without injuring anyone, left Italy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman ambassadors were graciously answered by the Transalpine peoples. Their elders <pb id="p.395"/>reproved the Roman people for their excessive<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> lenience, because those men who had set out without the permission of their state and had attempted to occupy land belonging to the Roman empire and to build a town on others' soil had been let go unpunished: they should have been made to pay a heavy toll for their rash action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Moreover, as to the restoration of their property, the elders feared that such generosity might tempt more peoples to try the same venture.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The ambassadors were both received and sent on their way with gifts.</p> 
				<p>Marcus Claudius the consul, having expelled the Gauls from the province, began to scheme for a war with the Histrians,<note>Since the territory of the Veneti had now been tacitly absorbed, the Histrians, living on the peninsula to the south of the modern Trieste, were near neighbours. There seems to be no evidence that they had given the Romans any cause to attack them at this time.</note> sending letters to the senate for permission to lead the legions into Histria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This did not please the senate. They were discussing the question of establishing a colony at Aquileia, but it was not generally agreed whether it should be a Latin colony or one of Roman citizens. Finally, the Fathers voted that a Latin colony rather should be founded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The three commissioners elected were Publius Scipio Nasica, Gaius Flaminius, Lucius Manlius Acidinus.</p> 
				<p>In the same year Mutina and Parma, colonies of Roman citizens, were established.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two thousand men in each case were settled on the land that had recently belonged to the Boi<note>Cf. XXXVI. xxxix. 3.</note> and previously to the Etruscans, and the allotments at Parma were eight <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> each, at Mutina five.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The board of three which founded them consisted of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Titus Aebutius Parrus, Lucius Quinctius Crispinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Also, a colony of Roman citizens was established at Saturnia in the <hi rend="italics">ager Caletranus.</hi><note>In Etruria.</note> The board of three <pb id="p.397"/>which founded it consisted of Quintus Fabius Labeo,<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> Gaius Afranius Stellio, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Ten <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> were given to each colonist.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same year the proconsul Aulus Terentius, not far from the river Ebro, in the country of the Ausetani, both fought successful battles with the Celtiberians and captured a number of towns which they had fortified.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Farther Spain that year was at peace, partly because Publius Sempronius the proconsul was suffering from a long illness, and with no one to provoke them the Lusitanians very fortunately remained quiet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor was anything worth recording done by the consul Quintus Fabius among the Ligurians.</p> 
				<p>Marcus Marcellus, recalled from Histria, disbanded his army and returned to Rome to hold the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He returned as consuls Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus and Lucius Aemilius Paulus. The latter had been curule aedile with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus; this was the fifth year after the consulship of Lepidus, although Lepidus himself became consul after two defeats.<note>Lepidus was consul in <date value="-187">187 B.C.</date> We are left to conjecture the number of defeats suffered by Paulus. Livy seems to dwell on the failures of Paulus, possibly for the contrast with his later brilliant career in Macedonia.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next the praetors were chosen, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, Marcus Valerius Laevinus, Publius Manlius (for the second time),<note>His first praetorship was in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xlii. 7). No reason is known for this unusual career.</note> Marcus Ogulnius Gallus, Lucius Caecilius Denter, Gaius Terentius Istra.</p> 
				<p>At the end of the year there was a period of prayer by reason of the prodigies, because the Romans were well persuaded
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> that there had been a shower of blood, lasting two days, in the precinct of Concord,<note>Cf. also xlvi. 5 above and the note and XL. xix. 2.</note> and because it was reported that not far from Sicily, a new island which had not been there before had <pb id="p.399"/>risen from the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Valerius Antias says that<note type="margin">B.C. 183</note> Hannibal died this year, ambassadors having been sent to Prusias for this purpose, namely, Lucius Scipio Asiaticus and Publius Scipio Nasica,<note>Again Livy appends an afterthought, inconsistent with his previous narrative.</note> in addition to Titus Quinctius Flamininus, whose name is best known in this connection.</p>

					Flaccus and Marcus Porcius Cato (the latter the greatest
					of men in the arts of both war and peace) expelled from
					the senate Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, the brother
					of Titus, on the ground that while he was holding
					the province of Gaul as consul, at the request of a
					Carthaginian, Philippus, a notorious degenerate whom
					he loved, he had, at a banquet, killed with his own hand
					a certain Gaul, or, as some say, that he had beheaded a
					man under sentence of death at the request of a courtesan
					of Placentia with whom he was desperately in love. The
					speech of Marcus Cato against him is extant. Scipio died
					at Liternum and, as if fortune were bringing them together,
					two deaths occurred about the same time of very great
					men&mdash;Hannibal, who committed suicide by poison when
					Prusias, king of Bithynia, with whom he had taken refuge
					after the defeat of Antiochus, was about to surrender
					him to the Romans who had sent Titus Quinctius Flamininus to demand him, and also Philopoemen, chieftain
					of the Achaeans and a very great man, who was poisoned
					<pb id="p.403"/>
					by the Messenians after they had captured him in war.
					The colonies of Potentia and Pisaurum and Mutina and
					Parma were founded. In addition the book contains the
					victories over the Celtiberians and the beginnings and
					causes of the Macedonian war. The origin of this was
					found in Philip's anger that his kingdom was diminished
					by the Romans and that he was compelled to withdraw
					his garrisons from Thrace and elsewhere.</p>
