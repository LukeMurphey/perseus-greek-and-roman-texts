			<div2 type="chapter"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
				<p>AT the beginning of the Middle Ages there were
					extant three copies of the Third Decade, though
					two of these<note>The Spirensis and the Turin palimpsest. Something will be said of these two MSS. in the preface to Vol. VII (Books XXVI.-XXVII.).</note> contained only the second half, Books
					XXVI.-XXX. The incomplete manuscripts subsequently disappeared, but we still have the one that
					included the whole Decade, and is known as the
					Puteanus (= Codex Parisinus 5730 = <hi rend="italics">P</hi>).</p>
				<p>This famous codex was revised (in the sixth
					century) at Abellinum (the modern Avellino), near
					Naples, as appears from the subscription after several
					of the books: <hi rend="italics">recognobi</hi> (for <hi rend="italics">recognovi</hi>) <hi rend="italics">abellini.</hi> Precisely when or where the book was originally
					written is not known, but it is now assigned
					to the fifth century. Early in the Carolingian
					period it came into the possession of the abbey
					library at Corbie in Picardy, where many copies of
					it were made.<note>Traube, Bamberger Fragmente, p. 16.</note> In the second half of the sixteenth century it was acquired by Claude Dupuy (Claudius
					Puteanus), a jurisconsult and book-collector of Paris,
					whose son Jacques bequeathed it, along with the
					rest of his ancient manuscripts, to the King; and
					since 1657 it has been one of the treasures of the
					<pb id="p.viii"/>
					Biblioth&egrave;que nationale. In 1907 the Department
					of Manuscripts of this library issued a facsimile
					reproduction of the Puteanus, considerably reduced
					in size.<note>The title-page is not dated. I am indebted to the brief introduction by H[enri] O[mont] for the description of the book.</note> The manuscript is a large quarto containing
					470 leaves of fine parchment, measuring 235 X 278
					millimetres. The writing is in the uncial character.
					There are two columns to the page, of 26 lines each.
					Originally there were 65 gatherings of 8 leaves each,
					except gatherings 43 and 45, which had 6 each. Of
					these gatherings 1, 2, 4 and 64 have been lost, as
					well as leaves 2-7 of the 3rd, and the following
					sections of the text are consequently missing:
					<list>
						<item>XXI. i. 1. (<hi rend="italics">in parte</hi>)&mdash;xx. 8 (<hi rend="italics">auro cu-</hi>).</item>
						<item>xxi. 13. (<hi rend="italics">Carthagini</hi>)&mdash;xxix. 6 (<hi rend="italics">adfirmantes in</hi>).</item>
						<item>xxx. 11. (<hi rend="italics">posse Poenus</hi>)&mdash;xli. 13 (<hi rend="italics">vobis et</hi>).</item>

						<item>xxxviii. 2. (<hi rend="italics">-niensibus</hi>)&mdash;xlv. 7 (<hi rend="italics">ceperunt</hi>).</item></list></p>
				<p>The scribe who wrote the Puteanus made a large
					number of corrections (distinguished in the critical
					notes by the symbol <hi rend="italics">P</hi>1) of his own text as he
					proceeded with the task of transcription. Many
					others are due to a second hand (<hi rend="italics">P</hi>2), and a very
					few to a third (<hi rend="italics">P</hi>3). From the forms of the letters
					employed and the colour of the ink it is almost
					always possible to refer these corrections to their
					respective scribes. The corrections were not derived
					from other manuscripts than <hi rend="italics">P'</hi>s exemplar, but
					originated with the scribes themselves,<note>Luchs, Praef. (1888) v.-vi.</note> and the manuscript is not interpolated.</p>
				<pb id="p.ix"/>
				<p>Of the other manuscripts now existing which have
					the text of Books XXI.-XXV. there is none which
					is not (directly or through one or more intermediaries)
					derived from <hi rend="italics">P,</hi> and none, therefore, which possesses
					any value for establishing the text of these books,
					except for those passages at the beginning of Book
					XXI. where the evidence of <hi rend="italics">P</hi> has been destroyed
					by the mutilation of the manuscript. To supply the
					place of the missing leaves editors avail themselves
					of two later codices, the Colbertinus and the
					Mediceus.</p>
				<p>The Colbertinus (= Parisinus 5731= <hi rend="italics">C</hi>) is a minuscule manuscript of the tenth or eleventh century,
					and is thought to be a direct copy of the Puteanus.</p>
				<p>The Mediceus (=Mediceus Laurentianus LXIII.
					20 = <hi rend="italics">M</hi>) is also a minuscule manuscript and was
					written in the eleventh century. It was formerly
					believed to have been copied from the Vaticanus
					Reginensis 762 (=<hi rend="italics">R</hi>),<note>Luchs, Prolegomena to edition of 1879, p. lviii.</note> and inasmuch as this MS. was copied from <hi rend="italics">P</hi>&mdash;late in the eighth century or
					early in the ninth<note>Rand and Howe argue plausibly for a date prior to the coming of Alcuin to Tours in 796.</note> &mdash;it would be superfluous to cite the readings of <hi rend="italics">M,</hi> were it not that the first and
					last parts of <hi rend="italics">R</hi> are wanting and its existing text
					begins at XXII. vi. 5 (<hi rend="italics">veluti caeci</hi>) and ends at XXX.
					v. 7 (<hi rend="italics">continua complexes</hi>), and all that comes between
					is found in <hi rend="italics">P</hi> itself. <hi rend="italics">R</hi> is therefore of no use in
					constituting the text,<note><hi rend="italics">R</hi> is nevertheless interesting (1) as providing a means of tracing the vicissitudes of a Latin text in the process of transcription from an uncial MS. of the fifth century into the early Caroline minuscule, and (2) as being a striking landmark in the history of eighth and ninth century calligraphy and the Scriptorium of Tours. In the former aspect it has been studied minutely by F. W. Shipley and in the latter by E. K. Rand and George Howe (see Bibliography).</note> but <hi rend="italics">M,</hi> if a copy of <hi rend="italics">R,</hi> would
					<pb id="p.x"/>
					be a valuable witness (at second hand) to the text
					of <hi rend="italics">P</hi> at the beginning and the end of the Third
					Decade, where both <hi rend="italics">P</hi> and <hi rend="italics">R</hi> are defective. Within
					recent years the statement that <hi rend="italics">R</hi> was <hi rend="italics">M'</hi>s exemplar
					has been called in question,<note>F. W. Shipley (<hi rend="italics">Studies,</hi> p. 475) holds that Luchs's statement of the relationship between <hi rend="italics">R</hi> and <hi rend="italics">M</hi> needs modification; and R. S. Conway (<hi rend="italics">The Sources of the Text,</hi> etc., p. 11) declares that evidence has been collected which shows quite certainly that M was not copied from <hi rend="italics">R</hi> or <hi rend="italics">C.</hi></note> but at the same time
					it has been shown that the scribe of <hi rend="italics">M</hi>&mdash;whatever
					his exemplar may have been&mdash;had access to the
					Puteanus, whose text he often reproduced, sometimes
					rightly, sometimes wrongly, where the scribe of <hi rend="italics">R</hi> had
					departed from it.<note>Shipley p. 416 ff.; Conway, <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi></note> Since, therefore, <hi rend="italics">M</hi> is directly in the tradition of the Puteanus, it must continue to be given consideration&mdash;along with <hi rend="italics">C</hi>&mdash;by the editor of Livy, whose business it is to reconstruct, as far as possible, the text which was contained on the
					missing leaves of <hi rend="italics">P.</hi></p>
				<p>The Puteanus then and, where the Puteanus is
					defective, the Colbertinus and the Mediceus are the
					MSS. on which editors found the text of Books
					XXI.-XXV. The text of this volume (XXI. and
					XXII.) is based chiefly on the apparatus in the
					critical edition of August Luchs, Berlin, 1888, supplemented by the appendices to Rossbach's revision
					(1921.10) of the Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller edition (with
					<pb id="p.xi"/>
					German notes) of XXI., and to the Weissenborn-
					M&uuml;ller edition of XXII. (1905.9), and here and there
					by notes and suggestions from other sources. I have
					aimed to inform the reader in the footnotes at every
					point where the reading in the text is not found
					either in <hi rend="italics">P</hi> or&mdash;where <hi rend="italics">P</hi> is wanting&mdash;in <hi rend="italics">M</hi> or <hi rend="italics">C,</hi>
					except in a few places where the correction seemed
					obvious and certain. The spelling conforms to that
					adopted (from the Oxford edition of Books I.-X. by
					Conway and Walters) for Volumes I.-IV. For the
					punctuation I must myself assume the responsibility,
					and hope it may prove more helpful to English and
					American readers than the German system, which
					has too often made its way into classical texts edited
					primarily for use elsewhere than in Germany.</p>
				<p>In the brief Bibliography I have listed a few of
					the multitude of books and articles useful for the
					understanding of Livy. My choice has been guided
					by two considerations: I wished first to put the
					reader who is beginning the study of Livy into touch
					with some of the recent work on his history, and
					more especially the Third Decade, and the various
					questions as to sources, style, antiquities, etc. arising
					in connection with it; and secondly, to list the books
					that have been of most assistance to me in preparing
					my own text and translation. To this general
					acknowledgment I would add a special word of
					appreciation of the help I have received from the
					various English translations and editions, from one
					or another of which I have sometimes borrowed a
					phrase or turn of expression.</p>
				<p>To Messrs. H. Wagner and E. Debes, of Leipzig,
					I am very grateful for their courteous permission to
					continue to adapt for the Loeb Livy the series of
					<pb id="p.xii"/>
					maps and plans in the Kromayer-Veith <hi rend="italics">Schlachten-
						Atlas zur antiken Kriegsgeschichte.</hi> Thanks to the
					learned labours of Professor Kromayer and the
					generosity of his publishers, the present edition of
					Books XXI. and XXII. may fairly boast of being
					better equipped in this respect than any of its elders.
					It is perhaps unnecessary to remind the reader that
					these maps were drawn to represent the facts, so far
					as ascertainable by a critical study of all the ancient
					sources and their modern interpreters and by examination of the ground itself, and may therefore
					sometimes be at variance with Livy's conception of
					the facts. A brief summary of the evidence for the
					conclusions adopted will be found in the letter-press
					accompanying the maps in the <hi rend="italics">Schlachten-Atlas;</hi> it is
					presented at greater length in the <hi rend="italics">Antike Schlachtfelder</hi>
					of the same authors.</p>

			<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN this preface to a part of my history I may<note type="margin">B.C. 218-201</note> properly assert what many an historian has declared at the outset of his entire work,<note>Thucydides began his history as follows: <quote>Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war which the Peloponnesians and Athenians waged against one another, beginning at its very outset, in the expectation that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it.</quote></note> to wit, that the war which I am going to describe was the most memorable of all wars ever waged &mdash;the war, that is, which, under the leadership of Hannibal, the Carthaginians waged with the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For neither have states or nations met in arms possessed of ampler resources, nor was their own might and power ever so great. Nor yet were they strangers to one another's modes of fighting, which the First Punic War had made them understand. And so variable were the fortunes of the war and so uncertain was its outcome that those who ultimately conquered had been nearer ruin.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The animosity, too, with which they fought was almost greater than their strength: the Romans were enraged that the conquered should be actually drawing sword upon their conquerors; the Phoenicians, because they believed that the conquered had been treated with domineering arrogance and greed.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><pb id="p.5"/><p>It is said moreover that when Hannibal, then<note type="margin">B.C. 218-201</note> about nine years old, was childishly teasing his father Hamilcar to take him with him into Spain, his father, who had finished the African war and was sacrificing, before crossing over with his army, led the boy up to the altar and made him touch the offerings and bind himself with an oath that so soon as he should be able he would be the declared enemy of the Roman People.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The loss of Sicily and<note type="margin">B.C. 241</note> Sardinia was a continual torture to the proud spirit of Hamilcar. For he maintained that they had surrendered Sicily<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the western part of the island, which had been in the possession of the Carthaginians at the beginning of the First Punic War.</note> in premature despair, and that the Romans had wrongfully appropriated Sardinia &mdash; and even imposed an indemnity on them besides &mdash;in the midst of their African disturbances.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Tormented by these thoughts, he so bore<note type="margin">B.C. 237-229</note> himself in the African War, which followed hard upon the Roman peace and lasted for five years, and likewise afterwards, during the nine years he spent in Spain in extending the Punic empire, that it was plain to see that he meditated a more important war than the one he was engaged in, and that if his life had been prolonged,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the Phoenicians would have invaded Italy under the leadership of Hamilcar, as they did in fact under that of Hannibal.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Hamilcar's very timely death and the boyhood<note type="margin">B.C. 229-222</note> of Hannibal delayed the war. In the interval betwixt father and son, the supreme command devolved, for about eight years, on Hasdrubal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was his youthful beauty, they say, that won for him in the first instance the favour of Hamilcar, who subsequently selected him, no doubt for other, that is mental, qualifications, to be his son-in-law. As such &mdash;through the influence of the Barcine <pb id="p.7"/>faction<note>This was the war-party in Carthage, named for its leader Hamilcar Barca, which opposed the peace-at-any-price policy of the merchant-aristocracy.</note> which was very strong with the soldiers<note type="margin">B.C. 229-222</note> and the common people &mdash;he was given the command, though the leading citizens had no liking for this step.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Relying more often on policy than force, Hasdrubal enlarged the sway of Carthage rather by setting up friendly relations with the petty kings and winning over new tribes through the goodwill of their leaders than by war and arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But he was not a whit more safe for being at peace. A certain barbarian slew him openly, to avenge his master, whom Hasdrubal had put to death. On being seized by the bystanders he expressed in his countenance the cheerfulness of one who had escaped, and even as he was being tortured, joy so got the upper hand of agony that he seemed actually to smile.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With this Hasdrubal, because of the marvellous skill which he had shown in tempting the native tribes to join his empire, the Roman People had renewed their covenant,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the treaty of <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date> (<hi rend="italics">Per.</hi> XX. and Chap. xix. &sect;&sect; 1-5).</note> with<note type="margin">B.C. 226</note> the stipulation that neither side should extend its dominion beyond the Ebro, while the Saguntines, situated between the empires of the two peoples,<note>Saguntum (Murviedro) lay about midway between the Ebro and New Carthage (Cartagena). Livy does not mean that it lay between the two <quote>spheres of influence</quote> &mdash;for it must, in that case, have occupied an island in the Ebro &mdash;but, vaguely, that the Carthaginians were still far to the south of it and the Romans had not yet approached it from the north.</note> should be preserved in independence.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For Hasdrubal's successor there could be no<note type="margin">B.C. 221</note> question but that the choice originating with the soldiers &mdash;who immediately bore young Hannibal into the praetorium and with loud and universal acclamation hailed him general &mdash;would obtain the ratification of the senate. The approval of the <pb id="p.9"/>commons followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The new commander had been<note type="margin">B.C. 221</note> summoned to Spain by Hasdrubal when a mere lad, and the matter had even been debated in the senate. The Barcine party were urging that Hannibal should become inured to warfare and succeed to the resources of his father, when Hanno, the leader of the other faction, addressed the House.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>There is reason,</quote> said he, <quote>in Hasdrubal's request, nevertheless I am opposed to granting it.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When astonishment at a speech so inconsistent had attracted everybody's attention, he continued: <quote>The youthful charms which Hasdrubal himself permitted Hannibal's father to enjoy he considers that he has the right to require again at the hands of the son. But that we should accustom our young men, by way of military training, to gratify the concupiscence of our generals is most unseemly.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Or do we fear lest Hamilcar's son may too late behold the inordinate powers and the regal pomp which his father has set up? that the son of the king who left our armies as a legacy to his son-in-law may find us too slow in accepting him for our master?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For my part, I think that the young man should be kept at home and taught to live in submission to the laws and the magistrates, upon an equal footing with the others, lest one day this small fire kindle a great conflagration.</quote></p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few, and these included nearly all the best men, supported Hanno, but, as often happens, the larger party prevailed over the better. Hannibal was sent to Spain, where he was no sooner come than he won the favour of the entire army.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The old soldiers thought that Hamilcar was restored to them as he had been in his youth; they beheld <pb id="p.11"/>the same lively expression and piercing eye, tile<note type="margin">B.C. 221</note> same cast of countenance and features. But he soon brought it to pass that his likeness to his father was the least consideration in gaining him support.
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Never was the same nature more adaptable to things the most diverse &mdash;obedience and command. And so one could not readily have told whether he were dearer to the general or the army.
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When any bold or difficult deed was to be done, there was no one whom Hasdrubal liked better to entrust with it, nor did any other leader inspire his men with greater confidence or daring.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To reckless courage in incurring dangers he united the greatest judgment when in the midst of them. No toil could exhaust his body or overcome his spirit. Of heat and cold he was equally tolerant. His consumption of meat and drink was determined by natural desire, not by pleasure.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His times of waking and sleeping were not marked off by day or night:
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> what time remained when his work was done he gave to sleep, which he did not court with a soft bed or stillness, but was seen repeatedly by many lying on the ground wrapped in a common soldier's cloak amongst the sentinels and outguards. His dress was in no way superior to that of his fellows, but his arms and horses were conspicuous.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Both of horsemen and of foot-soldiers he was undoubtedly the first &mdash;foremost to enter battle, and last to leave it when the fighting had begun.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These admirable qualities of the man were equalled by his monstrous vices: his cruelty was inhuman, his perfidy worse than Punic; he had no regard for truth, and none for sanctity, no fear of the gods, no reverence for an oath, no religious scruple.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> With this endowment of <pb id="p.13"/>good and evil traits he served for the space of three<note type="margin">B.C. 221</note> years under Hasdrubal, omitting nothing that should be done or seen by one who was to become a great commander.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For the rest, from the day on which he was proclaimed commander-in-chief, as though Italy had been assigned to him for his field of operations and he
								<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> had been instructed to make war on Rome, he felt that no postponement was permissible, lest he too, like his father Hamilcar, and afterwards Hasdrubal, should be overtaken, while delaying, by some accident, and resolved upon attacking the Saguntines.<note>Up to this point it is probable that Livy has been drawing his material chiefly from Coelius Antipater. He now turns to Polybius (or an account based on Polybius), and somewhat awkwardly effects the transition by means of the sentence following, in which he tries to smooth over the contradiction between <hi rend="italics">nihil prolatandum ratus</hi> and the two years that Hannibal now spent in wars that had nothing to do with the Saguntines. (<hi rend="italics">De Sanctis,</hi> p. 182.)</note>
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since an attack on them must certainly provoke the Romans to hostile action, he marched first into the territory of the Olcades &mdash;a tribe living south of the Ebro, within the limits of the Carthaginians but not under their dominion &mdash;that he might appear not to have aimed at the Saguntines but to have been drawn into that war by a chain of events, as he conquered the neighbouring nations and annexed their territories.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Cartala,<note>This place &mdash;unknown except for its mention in this connexion &mdash;is called Althaea by Polybius (III. xiii. 5) The name is perhaps preserved in the modern Melkart.</note> a wealthy town, the capital of that tribe, he stormed and sacked; and this so terrified the lesser towns that they submitted and agreed to an indemnity. The victorious army, enriched with spoil, was led back to New Carthage for
								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the winter. There, by a generous partition of the booty and the faithful discharge of all arrears of pay, he confirmed them all, both citizens and allies, in their allegiance to himself; and early in the spring pushed forward into the land of
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the Vaccaei. Their cities, Hermandica<note>Supposed to have stood on the site of Salamanca.</note> and <pb id="p.15"/>Arbocala, were taken by assault. Arbocala, thanks to the<note type="margin">B.C. 221</note> bravery and numbers of its inhabitants, held out for a
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> long time. The fugitives from Hermandica, uniting with the exiles of the
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Olcades &mdash;the tribe which had been subdued in the previous summer &mdash;roused up the Carpetani, and falling upon Hannibal as he was returning from the Vaccaei, not far from the river Tagus, threw his column, encumbered as it was with booty, into
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> some disorder. Hannibal refrained from battle and encamped on the bank of the river. As soon as the enemy were settled for the night and silent, he crossed the river by a ford, and so laid out his rampart as to allow them room for crossing, resolving to attack them as they were
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> passing over. He ordered his cavalry to charge their column of foot when they saw that it had
								<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> entered the stream, and posted the elephants, of which he had forty, along the bank. The Carpetani, together with the contingents of the Olcades and Vaccaei, numbered a hundred thousand &mdash;an invincible array, had they been going to fight in a
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> fair field. And so, inspired by a native intrepidity, confiding in their multitude, and believing &mdash;since they supposed that their enemies had retreated out of fear &mdash;that victory was delayed but till they should have passed the river, they broke into a cheer, and, staying for no man's orders, rushed into the stream wherever it happened to
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> be nearest. From the other side a great body of cavalry was sent in
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> against them. The meeting in mid-channel was no equal conflict, for there the footmen were unsteady, and, scarce trusting to the ford, might even have been overthrown by unarmed riders, urging their horses forward at haphazard; while the horsemen, having <pb id="p.17"/>their bodies and weapons free and horses that were<note type="margin">B.C. 221</note> steady even in the deep pools, could fight either at close quarters or
								<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> long range. A great part of them perished in the stream; some the eddying current carried over to their enemies, where they were trampled down by
								<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> the elephants. The rearmost, who could retreat to their own bank more safely, were gathering from the various directions in which they had fled, when, before they could recover from so great a panic, Hannibal entered the stream in a fighting column, and driving them in confusion from the bank, laid waste their fields, and in a few days' time received the surrender of the
								<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Carpetani also. And now everything south of the Ebro, except Saguntum, was in the hands of the Carthaginians.</p> <p>
									<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
									<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With the Saguntines there was as yet no war,<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> but quarrels that might be a pretext for it were already being sown betwixt them and their neighbours, especially the Turdetani.<note>Not the important tribe in the S.W. part of the peninsula, but a lesser one, again mentioned as neighbour to the Saguntines at XXIV. lii. 11, and
										<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;there called Turduli &mdash;at XXVIII. xxxix. 8.</note> Now when the side of the Turdetani was espoused by the same man who had sowed the quarrel, and it was clearly seen that he was aiming not at arbitration but force, the Saguntines sent ambassadors to Rome, imploring help for a war that was now
									<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> indubitably imminent. The Roman consuls at that time were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempronius Longus.<note>These were the consuls of <date value="-218">218 B.C.</date>, but the siege of Saguntum took place in 219. Livy now returns to &mdash;and follows until he has finished the story of the siege in chap. xv. &sect; 1 &mdash;the source he had used for the opening chapters of this hook. Coelius &mdash;if he it was &mdash;so telescoped events as to make the attack on Saguntum follow immediately on the appointment of Hannibal, and the war with Rome begin in that same year. In chap. xv. Livy becomes aware of the discrepancy and endeavours to dispose of it.</note> After introducing the ambassadors into the senate, they had brought up the question of public policy, and the senators had voted to dispatch envoys to Spain, <pb id="p.19"/>to examine into the affairs of their
									<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> allies, to the end<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> that, if there appeared to be just cause, they might formally warn Hannibal to keep aloof from the Saguntines, the allies of the Roman People; after which they were to cross over into Africa, to Carthage, and
									<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> present the complaint of Rome's allies. This embassy had been voted but not yet sent off, when, sooner than all expectation, came the news that Saguntum was besieged. The case was
									<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> then referred anew to the senate. Some were for sending the consuls into Spain and Africa respectively and waging war by land and sea; others wanted to direct their
									<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> whole force against Spain and Hannibal; some there were who argued that so grave a quarrel should not be lightly entered on, and proposed to await the return
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> of the envoys out of Spain. This last opinion, which seemed the safest, carried the day, and the envoys, Publius Valerius Flaccus and Quintus Baebius Tamphilus, were sent off with the more dispatch. They were to go to Saguntum first, to Hannibal, and thence, if he would not cease hostilities, to Carthage, to demand the surrender of the general himself in satisfaction of the broken treaty.</p> <p>
										<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
										<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Romans were thus planning and deliberating, the siege of Saguntum was already being pressed with the greatest vigour.
										<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This city was much the wealthiest of those beyond the Ebro and was situated about a mile from the sea. Its inhabitants are said to have come originally from the island of Zacynthus,<note>Saguntum is only a Latinized form of <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> the name of a small island (now Zante) off the coast of Elis.</note> and to have included also a strain from the Ardeate Rutulians.<note>Ardea (the seat of King Turnus, according to Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> VII. 409 ff.) was the chief city of the Rutuli and had been a Roman colony since <date value="-442">442 B.C.</date></note>
										<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Be this as it may, they had attained quickly to their great prosperity, whether owing to the produce of the sea or the <pb id="p.21"/>land,<note>Polybius, III. xviii. 3, speaks of the great fertility of their territory, and under the empire Saguntum was famous for its export of earthenware.</note> to the growth of their population, or to the<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> integrity of their discipline, which caused
										<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> them to keep faith with their allies even to their own undoing.
										<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Crossing their borders with a hostile army Hannibal laid waste their country far and wide and advanced in three divisions against their city. There was an angle of the wall that gave on a valley more open and more level than the other ground about the town.
										<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Against this he determined to bring up pent-houses, that under their cover the battering-rams might be brought into contact with the walls.
										<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But though the ground at some distance from the wall was smooth enough for moving the pent-houses, the attempt succeeded very ill when it came to the final execution of it. There was a great overhanging tower, and the wall &mdash;as was natural in a suspected place &mdash;had been carried up to a greater height than elsewhere, and the pick of the fighting men having been stationed there, where the greatest danger threatened, offered a more strenuous resistance.
										<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At first they drove the assailants off with missiles and left no spot safe for their pioneers;
										<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> afterwards not only did their javelins dart from wall and tower, but they even had the hardihood to sally out against the pickets and earthworks of their enemies, and in these rough-and-tumble fights hardly more Saguntines fell than Phoenicians.
										<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But when Hannibal himself, who had somewhat incautiously ventured up under the wall, was severely wounded in the front of his thigh with a heavy javelin and sank to the ground, those about him fell into such confusion and dismay as almost to abandon their works and pent-houses.</p> <p>
											<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
											<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For the next few days, while the general's <pb id="p.23"/>hurt was healing, there was rather a blockade than<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> an assault; but though during this interval there was rest from combat, yet was there no slackening in the preparation of engines and defences.
											<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly the fighting broke out afresh more fiercely than before, and pent-houses began to be pushed forward and rams brought up at many points, though in some places the ground would hardly admit of them.
											<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Phoenician was lavishly equipped with men &mdash;he is credibly supposed to have had a hundred and fifty thousand under arms &mdash;but
											<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the townsmen, who, in order to guard and defend every quarter, had been divided into numerous companies, found their strength inadequate.
											<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so now the walls were being battered with rams and in many places had been severely shaken. One section, giving way continuously for some distance, had exposed the town: three towers in a row, together with the wall connecting them, had come down with a loud crash.
											<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Phoenicians believed that the town was taken with that breach, through which from either side men rushed to attack, as though the wall had protected both parties alike.
											<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was not at all like the mellays that commonly occur in sieges, where one side gets an opportunity, but regular battle lines had formed, as in an open field, between the ruins of the wall and the buildings of the city, which stood at some distance off.
											<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On this side hope, on that despair inspired courage. The Phoenicians believed the city to be theirs, if they put forth a little effort. The Saguntines opposed their bodies to defend their city, denuded of its walls, nor would one of them draw back his foot lest he admit an enemy to the spot which he had vacated.
											<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And the harder both sides fought and <pb id="p.25"/>the more they crowded in together, the greater was<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> the number of those wounded, for no missile fell without taking effect on shield or body.
											<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Saguntines had a javelin, called a <hi rend="italics">phalarica,</hi> with a shaft of fir, which was round except at the end whence the iron projected; this part, four-sided as in the <hi rend="italics">pilum,</hi> they wrapped with tow and smeared with pitch.
											<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Now the iron was three feet long, that it might be able to go through both shield and body. But what chiefly made it terrible, even if it stuck fast in the shield and did not penetrate the body, was this, that when it
											<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> had been lighted at the middle and so hurled, the flames were fanned to a fiercer heat by its very motion, and it forced the soldier to let go his shield, and left him unprotected against the blows that followed.</p> <p>

												<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the outcome of the struggle had long been doubtful, and the Saguntines, because they were holding out beyond their hopes, had gained new courage, while the Phoenician, because he had not conquered, was as good as beaten;
												<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> suddenly the townspeople set up a shout and thrust forth their enemies amongst the ruins of the wall, and routing them out from thence, confused and frightened, drove them back at last in full flight to their camp.</p> <p>In the meantime it was announced that ambassadors had come from Rome.
													<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hannibal sent men to the shore to meet them and say that it would not be safe for them to come to him through the armed bands of so many unruly tribes, and that he had no time for listening to embassies at so critical a juncture. It was clear that, if they were denied a hearing, they would at once proceed to <pb id="p.27"/>Carthage.
													<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore dispatched couriers before<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> them, with a letter for the leaders of the Barcine faction, so that they might prepare the minds of their adherents to prevent the opposing party from affording any satisfaction to the Roman People.</p> <p>
														<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
														<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly, save for being admitted and allowed a hearing, this mission also was idle and of no effect.
														<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hanno stood alone in pleading for the treaty against the views of the senate. There was a deep hush while he spoke, by reason of his personal authority, but he was listened to without approval. He adjured the senators in the name of the gods, vouchers for treaties and their witnesses, to provoke not a Roman along with the Saguntine war.
														<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had advised them and forewarned them not to send the offspring of Hamilcar to the army; neither the man's ghost nor his progeny was at rest, nor ever, so long as any of the lineage and name of Barca should survive, would the treaty with the Romans rest untroubled.
														<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>You have sent to your armies,</quote> he went on, <quote>as though heaping fuel on a fire, a youth who burns with lust for sovereign power and sees but one way to obtain it &mdash;if, by sowing seeds of war, he can raise up other wars and live girt round with arms and legions.
															<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> You have therefore fed these flames with which you are now ablaze. Your armies now invest Saguntum, which the treaty forbids them to approach: ere long the Roman legions will be investing Carthage, led by those very gods who helped them in the former war to avenge the broken treaty.
															<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Is it your enemy you know not, or yourselves, or the fortunes of both peoples? When <pb id="p.29"/>ambassadors came from allies on behalf of allies,<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> your worthy general would not admit them to his camp, but thrust aside the law of nations; nevertheless these men, being driven from a place where even an enemy's envoys are admitted, have come to you. They seek amends in accordance with a treaty. That the state may be void of offence, they demand the author of the wrong, the man on whom they charge the guilt.
															<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The more mildly they proceed, the more slowly they begin, the more obstinate, I fear, when they <hi rend="italics">have</hi> begun, will be their rage. Set Eryx and the Aegatian islands<note>Off these islands C. Lutatius Catulus won in <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date> the naval victory which decided the First Punic War (<hi rend="italics">Per.</hi> XIX.).</note> before your eyes, and all that you suffered by land and sea for four and twenty years.
															<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor was this boy your leader, but Hamilcar himself, the father, a second Mars, as his partisans will have it.<note>Hanno knows that most of his hearers are against him, and <hi rend="italics">isti</hi> (literally <quote>those men of yours</quote>) means <quote>those who guide your opinion,</quote> <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the friends of Hannibal.</note> But we could not keep our hands from Tarentum, that is, from Italy, as by treaty bound, even as now we cannot keep them from Saguntum.
															<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Gods therefore vanquished men, and that which had been verbally disputed &mdash;which people of the twain had broken the treaty &mdash; the outcome of the war, like an impartial judge, decided, and to those who had the right granted the victory.
															<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is Carthage against which Hannibal is now bringing up his pent-houses and towers; it is the walls of Carthage he is battering with his rams. Saguntum's walls &mdash;may my prophecy prove false! &mdash; will fall upon <hi rend="italics">our</hi> heads, and the war we have entered upon with the Saguntines we must carry on against the Romans.
															<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> 'Shall we then surrender Hannibal?' someone will ask. I know that my <pb id="p.31"/>influence is slight, because of my quarrel with his<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> father; but I rejoiced when Hamilcar perished, for this reason, that were he living, we should now be at war with Rome;
															<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and this young man, who, like a fury, now brandishes the torch of war, I loathe and abominate, and I hold, not only that he ought to be surrendered in expiation of the broken treaty, but that, if none demanded him, he ought to be deported to the farthest limits of land and sea &mdash;to be banished to a place whence neither name nor fame of his could reach us, nor he be able to vex the quiet of our state.
															<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> My opinion is this: we should send ambassadors at once to Rome, to give satisfaction to the senate; and others to announce to Hannibal that he must withdraw his army from Saguntum, and to hand over Hannibal himself to the Romans as the treaty requires; a third embassy I would send to make restitution to the Saguntines.</quote></p> <p>
																<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
																<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Hanno had concluded, not a single person found it necessary to oppose his arguments, so nearly unanimous was the senate in supporting Hannibal. They declared that Hanno had spoken more bitterly than Valerius Flaccus, the Roman envoy.
																<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They then gave their answer to the envoys, to the effect that the war had been begun by the Saguntines, not by Hannibal, and that the Roman People would be doing wrong if they preferred the Saguntines to their very ancient alliance with the Carthaginians.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While the Romans were wasting time in dispatching embassies, Hannibal had allowed his soldiers, exhausted as they were with fighting and constructing works, to rest for a few days, after posting outguards to look to the pent-houses and other engines. <pb id="p.33"/>Meanwhile he kindled their ardour, now by inciting<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> them to rage against their enemies, again by holding out hopes of rewards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when he made a speech proclaiming that the spoils of the captured city should go to the soldiers, they were so excited, one and all, that if the signal had been given instantly, it seemed as if no force could have withstood them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Saguntines, though they had had a rest from fighting, neither attacking nor being attacked for several days, had laboured incessantly, both day and night, to replace the wall where its collapse had exposed the town.</p> <p>The assault was now resumed, with far greater fury than before, and it was hard for the inhabitants to know, when shouts and cries were resounding on every hand, to what point they should first, or preferably, bring up supports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hannibal was present in person to urge on his men, where they were pushing up a movable tower that surpassed in height all the defences of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As soon as it had been brought up, and the catapults and <hi rend="italics">ballistae</hi><note>Engines for hurling darts and stones.</note> distributed through all its platforms had stripped the ramparts of defenders, Hannibal, believing that he now had his opportunity, sent about five hundred Africans with pickaxes to undermine the wall. This was no hard task, for the rubble had not been solidified with mortar, but filled in with mud, after an ancient mode of building.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It therefore fell for wider stretches than were actually hacked away, and through the breaches bands of armed men passed into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They even seized an elevation, and setting up catapults and <hi rend="italics">ballistae</hi> there, built a wall around it, so as to have within the town itself a stronghold that commanded it like a citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The <pb id="p.35"/>Saguntines too built a wall within the old one, to<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> protect that part of the city that was not yet taken. On both sides the soldiers worked and fought with the utmost energy; but the Saguntines, contracting their defences, were bringing their city day by day within a smaller compass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At the same time there was an increasing scarcity of everything, on account of the long blockade; and the prospect of help from without was growing less,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> since the Romans, their only hope, were so far away, and all the country round about was in the possession of their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Yet their drooping spirits were revived for a little while by the sudden departure of Hannibal for the territories of the Oretani and the Carpetani. These two nations, exasperated by a rigorous conscription, had seized the recruiting officers and thereby given rise to fears of a revolt, but were caught unprepared by Hannibal's celerity, and laid down the arms they had taken up.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the siege of Saguntum did not flag. Maharbal, the son of Himilco, whom Hannibal had left in charge, so bestirred himself that the absence of the general was felt neither by his countrymen nor by the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He fought a number of successful skirmishes, and with three battering-rams laid low a considerable portion of the wall, and on Hannibal's return, showed him the place all covered with the newly fallen ruins.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And so the troops were led at once against the citadel itself, and a fierce battle began, in which many on both sides were killed and a part of the citadel was taken.</p> <p>An all but hopeless attempt to arrange a peace was then made by two men, Alco, a Saguntine, and a Spaniard named Alorcus.
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Alco, thinking that <pb id="p.37"/>something might be effected by entreaties, went over to<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> Hannibal in the night, without the knowledge of the Sanguntines. But finding that tears were of no avail and that the terms obtainable were such as a wrathful conqueror would impose, he changed from pleader to deserter, and remained with the enemy, declaring that anybody who should treat for peace on those conditions would be put to death.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The conditions were as follows: they must make restitution to the Turdetani, and, delivering up all their gold and silver, quit their city with a single garment each and take up their abode where the Phoenician should direct them.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Alco asserted that the Saguntines would not accept such terms, Alorcus, affirming that where all else is conquered the heart is conquered too, undertook the negotiation of a peace. He was at that time a soldier in the service of Hannibal, but was officially recognized by the Saguntines as their friend and guest.<note>The stranger in an ancient city had no commercial or legal status but had to depend on the good offices of some citizen. Guest-friendship (<hi rend="italics">hospitium</hi>) was a species of permanent (and even hereditary) alliance entered into by two citizens of different states for purposes of mutual comfort and protection in commercial and other intercourse. When a city honoured a member of another state by formally conferring upon him the title of <hi rend="italics">hospes publicus,</hi> it gave him the right to entertainment at the public cost, and to buy and sell and bring actions in the courts.</note>
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Openly surrendering his weapon to the sentries, he passed the enemy's lines, and was conducted &mdash;by his own command &mdash;before the Saguntine general.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A crowd of all descriptions immediately flocked together there; but all save the senators were sent away, and Alorcus, being permitted to address them, spoke as follows:</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>If Alco, your own fellow citizen, after going to Hannibal to sue for peace, had brought back to you the terms of peace which Hannibal offers, this journey of mine would have been superfluous, <pb id="p.39"/>for I should have come to you neither as Hannibal's<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> spokesman nor yet as a deserter.
									<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But seeing that, whether through your fault or his own, he has stopped behind with your enemy &mdash;his own if his fears were feigned, yours if it is unsafe to bring you a true report &mdash;that you might not be ignorant that terms there are upon which you may enjoy both life and peace, I have come to you myself, having regard to the long-standing friendship which subsists between us.
									<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Moreover, that I say what I say for your sake and no other's, you may take this as proof: so long as you held your ground with your own forces, and expected to receive help from the Romans, I never mentioned peace to you;
									<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but now that you have no longer any hope from Rome, and neither your arms nor your fortifications are adequate to defend you, I bring you a peace more necessary than equitable.
									<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That this peace may be realized there is some ground for hoping only if, even as Hannibal proposes it in the spirit of a conqueror, so you shall hearken to it in the spirit of the conquered, and shall not consider as lost what is taken from you, since all things are the victor's, but consider whatever is left you as a gift.
									<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Your city, which he has in great part overthrown, and almost wholly captured, he takes from you: your lands he leaves you, and intends to designate a site whereon you may erect a new town.
									<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All your gold and silver, both public and private, he orders to be brought to him: your persons, with those of your wives and children, he preserves inviolate, if you are willing to go forth unarmed from Saguntum with two garments each.<note>Livy is not implying that Alorcus was in this detail exaggerating Hannibal's offer. The <quote>single garment</quote> of chap. xii. &sect; 5 was loosely put for <quote>a single suit of clothes,</quote> <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the inner and outer tunic which everybody wore.</note>
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These <pb id="p.41"/>terms a victorious enemy imposes on you; these<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> terms, albeit harsh and cruel, your fortune counsels you to accept. Indeed I am not without hope that when full control of everything shall have been granted him, he may remit somewhat of this severity;
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> but even this you ought, I think, rather to endure than to suffer yourselves to be massacred and your wives and children to be forcibly dragged away into captivity before your eyes, in accordance with the laws of war.</quote></p> <p>
										<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
										<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To hear this speech the populace had little by little crowded round, and the people's council had mingled with the senate, when on a sudden the leading men, withdrawing from the throng before an answer could be given, fetched all the gold and silver, both of state and private ownership, into the market-place, and casting it into a fire which they had hurriedly made up for this purpose, many threw themselves headlong into the same flames.
										<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The resulting panic and dismay had no sooner spread to all the city, than another loud noise and outcry were heard from the citadel. A tower that had long been battered had collapsed, and through the breach a cohort of Phoenicians had rushed in and signalled to the general that the city was denuded of its customary guards and sentinels.
										<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hannibal, deeming it no time to hesitate, when such an opportunity offered, attacked with all his strength and captured the city out of hand.
										<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had given orders that all the grown inhabitants be put to the sword &mdash;a cruel command, but found in the upshot to have been well-nigh inevitable; for who could be spared of those who either shut themselves up with their wives and children and burned the houses over <pb id="p.43"/>their own heads, or took arms and never gave over<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> fighting till they died?</p> <p>
											<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
											<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The captured town yielded enormous spoils. For although much property had been destroyed on purpose by its owners, and in the carnage rage had scarce made any distinction of years, and the captives had been given as booty to the soldiers, nevertheless
											<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> it is agreed that a large sum was realized from the sale of goods, and much valuable furniture and apparel sent to Carthage.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Some have recorded that Saguntum was taken in the eighth month from the beginning of the siege; that Hannibal then retired to New Carthage, into winter quarters; and then, after leaving New Carthage, arrived in the fifth month in Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If this is so, it cannot have been the case that Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius were the consuls to whom the Saguntine envoys were dispatched in the beginning of the siege, and who, in their own year of office, fought with Hannibal, the one at the river Ticinus, and both &mdash;a little later &mdash;at the Trebia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Either all these things took up somewhat less time, or Saguntum was not first besieged but finally captured in the outset of the year which had Cornelius and Sempronius as consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the battle at the Trebia cannot have been fought as late as the consulship of Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius; for Gaius Flaminius began his consulship at Ariminum, having been elected under the presidency of Tiberius Sempronius who was then consul, and had, after the battle at the Trebia, come to <pb id="p.45"/>Rome to hold the consular elections, and then<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> returned to the winter quarters of the army.<note>This paragraph is a footnote, in which Livy attempts to clear up the chronological muddle which he has got himself into by disregarding the clear statements of Polybius and following an inferior authority. According to Polybius, Hannibal was made general and attacked the Olcades in <date value="-221">221 B.C.</date> In 220 came the war with the Vaccaei and Carpetani. In 219 (consulship of M. Livius Salinator and L. Aemilius Paulus) came the siege of Saguntum, after which Hannibal put his army in winter quarters in New Carthage, and in 218 set forth on the march to Italy (Polybius, III. xiii, xvii, xxxiii).</note></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At almost the same time the ambassadors who had returned from Carthage brought back word to Rome that all was hostile in that quarter, and the fall of Saguntum was announced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so great was the grief of the senators, and their pity at the unmerited doom of their allies, and their shame at having failed to help them, and their wrath against the Carthaginians and fear for the safety of the commonwealth &mdash;as though the enemy were already at their gates &mdash;that, confounded with so many simultaneous emotions, they rather trembled than deliberated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For they felt that they had never encountered a fiercer or more warlike foe, and that Rome had never been so torpid and unwarlike. The Sardinians and Corsicans, the Histrians and Illyrians, had provoked but had hardly exercised the Roman arms;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> while against the Gauls there had been desultory fighting rather than real war.<note>The wars mentioned (and also a war with the Ligurians) occurred in the interval between the First and Second Punic Wars and were described in Book xx (see Summary).</note> But the Phoenician was an old and experienced enemy, who in the hardest kind of service amongst the Spanish tribes had for three and twenty years<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the interval between the First and Second Punic Wars, though the Carthaginian conquest of Spain had not actually begun so early as <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date></note> invariably got the victory;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he was accustomed to the keenest of commanders, was flushed with the conquest of a very wealthy city, and crossing the Ebro and drawing after him the many Spanish peoples which he <pb id="p.47"/>had enlisted, would be rousing up the Gallic tribes &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> always eager to unsheathe the sword &mdash;and the Romans would have to contend in war with all the world, in Italy and under the walls of Rome.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The fields of operation of the consuls had already been named: they were now commanded to draw lots for them. Cornelius obtained Spain, Sempronius Africa with Sicily.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Six legions were voted for that year, with such allied contingents as the consuls themselves should approve and as large a fleet as could be got ready. There were enrolled four and twenty thousand Roman foot-soldiers and eighteen hundred horsemen, and of the allies forty thousand foot-soldiers and four thousand four hundred horsemen.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Of ships there were launched two hundred and twenty quinqueremes, and twenty swift cruisers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The question was then laid before the people whether it were their will and pleasure that war be declared against the people of Carthage; and on their voting in the affirmative a supplication was held throughout the City and the gods were besought to grant a fair and prosperous outcome to the war which the Roman People had decreed.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The forces were divided between the consuls as follows: Sempronius received two legions &mdash;each numbering four thousand foot and three hundred horse &mdash;sixteen thousand foot of the allies, and eighteen hundred horse, together with a hundred and sixty warships and twelve swift cruisers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> With these forces for land and sea Tiberius Sempronius was dispatched to Sicily, that he might cross by that way into Africa, if the other consul were able to keep the Phoenicians out of Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Cornelius was given fewer troops, since Lucius Manlius, the praetor, <pb id="p.49"/>was also being sent into Gaul with a not<note type="margin">B.C. 219</note> inconsiderable army;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and of ships, in particular, he received a smaller number, namely, sixty quinqueremes, for they did not suppose that the enemy would come by sea or use that kind of warfare. He had two Roman legions with their proper complement of horse, and fourteen thousand infantry of the allies, with sixteen hundred horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The province of Gaul received two Roman legions and ten thousand foot of the allies, with a thousand allied and six hundred Roman horse. These troops were designed for the same service &mdash;the Punic War.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these arrangements had been made,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> in order that, before going to war, they might observe all the formalities, they dispatched into Africa an embassy consisting of certain older men, to wit, Quintus Fabius, Marcus Livius, Lucius Aemilius,<note>M. Livius and L. Aemilius were consuls in <date value="-219">219 B.C.</date>, and since they were now available to serve on an embassy, it is a fair inference that the embassy had not set out before the middle of March &mdash;then the beginning of the consular year &mdash;of 218 (<hi rend="italics">De Sanctis,</hi> p. 1.1).</note> Gaius Licinius, and Quintus Baebius, to demand of the Carthaginians whether Hannibal had attacked Saguntum with the sanction of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the state; and if, as seemed likely to be the case, they should avow the act and stand to it as their public policy, to declare war on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Carthaginian People. As soon as the Romans had come to Carthage and the senate had granted them an audience, Quintus Fabius asked only the one question contained in
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> his instructions. Then one of the Carthaginians replied: <quote>There was something headlong, Romans, even in your former embassy, when you demanded that we surrender Hannibal on the ground that he was laying siege to Saguntum on his own responsibility; <pb id="p.51"/>but your present embassy, though expressed thus far<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> more mildly, is in reality
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> more harsh. For on that occasion Hannibal was both accused and his surrender called for; at present you are trying to wring a confession from us, and, as though we had pleaded guilty, demand
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> instant satisfaction. But to me it would seem that you ought to ask, not whether Saguntum was besieged as the result of private or of public policy, but whether justly
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> or unjustly. For it belongs to us to enquire what our fellow citizen has done on our authority or his own, and to punish him; with you the only question we have to discuss is this, whether what he did was permissible under
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the treaty. Well then, since you wish that a distinction should be drawn between the things that generals do by direction of the state and the acts for which they are themselves responsible, let me remind you that we have a
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> treaty with you, which Gaius Lutatius, your consul, made, wherein, although the allies of both sides were protected, there was no provision made regarding the Saguntines, for as yet they were not
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> your allies. 'But,' you will say, 'in that treaty which was made with Hasdrubal, the Saguntines are expressly cared for.' To this I shall make no other answer than the one that I have learnt from you. For you denied that you were bound by the treaty which Gaius Lutatius, the consul, originally entered into with us, because it had been made without the senate's sanction or the people's command; accordingly a new treaty, having the approval of the state, was
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> entered into. Now, if you are not bound by your treaties, unless they are concluded at your own instance or command, no more could the <pb id="p.53"/>treaty of Hasdrubal, which he made without our<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> knowledge, be binding
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> upon us. Cease then to prate of Saguntum and the Ebro, and bring forth at last the thought with which your mind has long been
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> in travail!</quote> Then the Roman, gathering up his toga into a fold, said, <quote>We bring you here both war and peace; choose which you will!</quote> When he had said these words, they cried out with no less truculence that he might give them whichever
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> he liked; and on his shaking out the fold again, and announcing that he gave them war, they all replied that they accepted it, and in that same spirit in which they accepted it were resolved to wage it.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This straightforward demand and declaration of war seemed more in keeping with the dignity of the Roman People than to bandy words regarding the rights involved in treaties, especially at that moment, when Saguntum had been destroyed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Though for that matter, had it been proper to debate the question, what comparison could there be between Hasdrubal's treaty and the earlier treaty of Lutatius, which was altered?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For in the treaty of Lutatius it had been expressly added that it should be valid only if the people ratified it; but in Hasdrubal's treaty no such proviso had been made, and by the silence of so many years the treaty had during his lifetime been so sanctioned that even on its author's death no slightest change was made in it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And yet, even if the earlier treaty were adhered to, the Saguntines had been sufficiently protected by the provision made concerning the allies of both the parties; for there had been no specification of <quote>those who were then allies,</quote> nor exception of <quote>such as might <pb id="p.55"/>afterwards be received.</quote>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And since they were permitted<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> to take new allies, who would think it fair either that they should admit no one, however deserving, to their friendship, or that, having once taken people under their protection, they should not defend them &mdash;provided only that allies of the Carthaginians should not be tempted to desert them nor be made welcome if they left them voluntarily?</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The ambassadors, conformably to the instructions given them in Rome, crossed over from Carthage into Spain for the purpose of approaching the different states and winning them to an alliance, or at least detaching them from the Phoenicians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Bargusii were the first they visited, and being warmly welcomed by them, for men were wearying of the Punic sway,<note>The Bargusii, N. of the Ebro, were not as yet in the power of the Carthaginians, but were growing uneasy at the prospect of annexation (cf. chap. xxiii. &sect; 2).</note> they aroused in many nations south of the Ebro a desire to revolt.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From there they came to the Volciani, who gave them an answer that was carried all over Spain and turned all the other states against an alliance with the Romans.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For the eldest of them replied as follows in their council: <quote>With what face, Romans, can you ask us to prefer your friendship to the Carthaginian, when those who did so have been more cruelly betrayed by you, their allies, than destroyed by their enemy, the Phoenician? You must seek allies, in my opinion, only where the disaster of Saguntum is unknown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the Spanish peoples the ruins of Saguntum will constitute a warning, no less emphatic than deplorable, that none should trust to the honour or alliance of the Romans.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Being then bidden straightway to depart out of the borders of the Volciani, they received from that day forth <pb id="p.57"/>no kinder response from any Spanish council.<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> Accordingly, having traversed that country to no purpose, they passed over into Gaul.</p> <p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There they beheld a strange and terrifying spectacle, for the Gauls, as was customary with the race, came armed to their assembly.<note>At an earlier date the Romans, too, had come armed to their assembly
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;the centuriate comitia (I. xliv. 1).</note> When the envoys, boasting of the renown and valour of the Roman People and the extent of their dominion, requested the Gauls to deny the Phoenician a passage through their lands and cities, if he should attempt to carry the war into Italy,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> it is said that they burst out into such peals of laughter that the magistrates and elders could scarce reduce the younger men to order
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;so stupid and impudent a thing it seemed, to propose that the Gauls should not suffer the invaders to pass into Italy, but bring down the war on their own heads, and offer their own fields to be pillaged in place of other men's. When at last the uproar had been quelled, the Gauls made answer to the envoys that they owed the Romans no kindness nor the Carthaginians any grudge, to induce them to draw the sword in behalf of the former or against the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> latter; on the contrary,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> they heard that men of their own race were being driven from the land and even out of the borders of Italy by the Roman People, and were paying tribute and suffering every other
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> humiliation. In the rest of the Gallic councils their proposals and the replies they got were to substantially the same effect, nor did they hear a single word of a truly friendly or peaceable tenor until they reached
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Massilia.<note>Massilia (Marseilles), founded by Phocaeans about <date value="-600">600 B.C.</date>, had been, from the period of the Kings, a faithful ally of Rome.</note> Here they learned of all that had happened from their allies, who had made enquiries with faithful diligence. They reported that <pb id="p.59"/>Hannibal had been beforehand with the Romans<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> in gaining the good-will of the Gauls, but that even he would find them hardly tractable &mdash;so fierce and untamed was their nature &mdash;unless from time to time he should make use of gold, of which the race is very covetous, to secure the favour of their principal
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> men. So the envoys, having travelled through the nations of Spain and Gaul, returned to Rome, not long after the consuls had set out for their respective commands. They found the citizens all on tip-toe with expectation of the war, for the rumour persisted that the Phoenicians had already crossed the Ebro.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, after the capture of Saguntum,<note type="margin">B.C. 219-218</note> had withdrawn his army into winter quarters at New Carthage. There he learned what had been done in Rome and Carthage and what had been decreed, and that he was not only commander in the war, but the cause of it as well.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So, having divided or sold off what was left of the plunder, he thought best to defer his plans no longer, and, calling together the soldiers of Spanish blood, thus addressed them:
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>My allies, I doubt not that you yourselves perceive how, having conquered every tribe in Spain, we must either bring our campaigning to a close and disband our armies, or shift the seat of war to other countries.<note>Livy makes Hannibal speak with rhetorical exaggeration. The Spanish troops whom he is addressing have not conquered 'every tribe in Spain,' for they came themselves from tribes which had been for some years friendly and subject to the Carthaginians. He had not indeed conquered all the <hi rend="italics">hostile</hi> tribes, but only those lying south of the Ebro.</note>
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For these nations here will enjoy the blessings not merely of peace, but also of victory, only if we look to other nations for spoils and glory.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Since, therefore, you are on the eve of an expedition that will carry <pb id="p.61"/>you far afield, and it is uncertain when you will<note type="margin">B.C. 219-218</note> see again your homes and what there is dear to each of you, if any of you desires to visit his friends, I grant him furlough.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Be at hand, I charge you, with the first signs of spring, that with Heaven's good help we may begin a war that shall bring us vast renown and booty.</quote>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were very few who did not welcome the opportunity thus freely proffered of visiting their homes, for they were already homesick and looked forward to an even longer separation from their friends.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The full winter's rest between the labours already undergone and those that were presently to come gave them new strength and courage for a fresh encounter with every hardship.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Early in the spring they assembled in obedience to their orders.</p> <p>When Hannibal had reviewed the contingents<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> sent in by all the nations, he went to Gades<note>Gades (Cadiz) was a Tyrian colony and possessed a famous temple of Melkarth (whom the Romans identified with Hercules), the tutelary god of the mother city.</note> and discharged his vows to Hercules, binding himself with fresh ones, in case he should be successful in the remainder of his undertaking.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, with equal concern for attack and defence, lest while he should be himself advancing upon Italy by an overland march through Spain and Gaul, Africa might lie exposed and open to a Roman invasion on the side of Sicily, he resolved to garrison that country with a powerful force.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To supply its place he requisitioned troops for himself from Africa &mdash;lightarmed slingers chiefly &mdash;so that Africans might serve in Spain and Spaniards in Africa, and both be the better soldiers for being far from home, as though mutually pledged to loyalty.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thirteen thousand eight hundred and fifty targeteers<note>Like the Greek <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> these were light infantry whose defensive armour consisted of a small round shield covered with oxhide.</note> and eight <pb id="p.63"/>hundred and seventy Baliaric slingers,<note>The Baliares (Majorca and Minorca) furnished the most skilful slingers in the world. Livy says (XXVIII. xxxvii. 6) that no single individual of any other people was so superior in this art to his fellows as were all the Baliares to the rest of mankind. The ancients derived Baliares from <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> <quote>throw.</quote></note> with twelve<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> hundred horsemen drawn from many nations, he sent to Africa.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A part of these troops were to be a garrison for Carthage, a part to be distributed through the country. At the same time he directed that recruiting officers be sent out into the states,<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> of Africa.</note> and that four thousand picked men be brought to Carthage, to serve at once as defenders and as hostages.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And considering that neither must Spain be neglected, and so much the less since he was not unaware that Roman ambassadors had journeyed through it to seek the support of its leading men, he appointed it to be the charge of his brother Hasdrubal &mdash;an
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> active, energetic man &mdash;and secured it with troops, for the most part African. Of infantry there were eleven thousand eight hundred and fifty Africans, three hundred Ligurians, and five hundred Baliares.
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To these infantry forces he added the following units of cavalry: four hundred and fifty Libyphoenicians &mdash;a race of mixed Punic and African blood &mdash;and some eight hundred Numidians and Moors, who dwell near the ocean,<note>Mauretania corresponded to the present Fez and Morocco.</note> and a little company of three hundred Spanish Ilergetes. Finally, that no sort of land force might be lacking, there were twenty-one elephants.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He also assigned a fleet to Spain, for the protection of its seaboard, since it might be expected that the Romans would <pb id="p.65"/>again on this occasion employ that mode of warfare<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> in which they had been victorious. There were fifty quinqueremes, two quadriremes, and five triremes. But only thirty-two quinqueremes and the five triremes were equipped and manned with rowers.<note>In this enumeration of forces Livy follows Polybius (III. xxxiii. 9), who says that he found the numbers recorded by Hannibal himself on a bronze tablet which was set up on the Lacinian Promontory (near Crotona).</note></p> <p>From Gades Hannibal returned to New Carthage, to the winter quarters of his army.
									<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Setting out from thence, he marched along the coast, past the city of Onusa, to the Ebro.
									<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was there, as they tell, that he saw in his sleep a youth of godlike aspect, who declared that he was sent by Jupiter to lead him into Italy: let him follow, therefore, nor anywhere turn his eyes away from his guide.
									<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At first he was afraid and followed, neither looking to the right nor to the left, nor yet behind him; but presently wondering, with that curiosity to which all of us are prone, what it could be that he had been forbidden to look back upon, he was unable to command his eyes;
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> then he saw behind him a serpent of monstrous size, that moved along with vast destruction of trees and underbrush, and a storm-cloud coming after, with loud claps of thunder;
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and, on his asking what this prodigious portent was, he was told that it was the devastation of Italy: he was therefore to go on, nor enquire further, but suffer destiny to be wrapped in darkness.</p> <p>
										<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
										<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rejoicing at this vision, he led his troops across the Ebro in three columns, after sending agents ahead, to win over with presents the Gauls who dwelt in the region which the army had to cross, and to explore the passes of the Alps.
										<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He had ninety thousand foot and twelve thousand horse <pb id="p.67"/>when he crossed the Ebro. He now subdued the<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> Ilergetes, and the Bargusii and Ausetani, and also Lacetania, which lies at the foot of the Pyrenees. All this coast he put in charge of Hanno, that the passes connecting Spain and Gaul might be under his control.
										<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To garrison this district, he gave Hanno ten thousand foot and a thousand horse.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the army had entered the defiles which lead over the Pyrenees, and more definite rumours had spread amongst the barbarians that the war was to be with Rome, three thousand of the Carpetanian foot turned back. It was understood that they were influenced not so much by the war as by the long march and the impossibility of crossing the Alps.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To recall them or to detain them forcibly would have been hazardous, for it might have roused resentment in the savage bosoms of the others.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so Hannibal sent back to their homes above seven thousand more, whom he had perceived to be chafing at the service, pretending that he had also dismissed the Carpetani.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, in order that his troops might not become demoralized by delay and inaction, he crossed the Pyrenees with the remainder of his forces<note>Polybius (III. xxxv. 7) says that Hannibal now had fifty thousand foot and about nine thousand horse.</note> and pitched his camp by the town of Iliberri.<note>The modern Elne is near the site.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Gauls, though they heard that the war was aimed at Italy, nevertheless, because it was said that the Spaniards beyond the Pyrenees had been forcibly subjugated and strong garrisons imposed upon them, were driven by the fear of servitude to arm themselves, and several tribes assembled at Ruscino.<note>The name is reflected in the French Tour de Roussillon, near Perpignan.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When Hannibal was apprised of this, he was more <pb id="p.69"/>afraid of delay than of fighting, and dispatched<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> ambassadors to their chieftains to inform them that he wished to confer with them in person, and suggested that either they come nearer to Iliberri or that he would go forward to Ruscino, so that being close to one another they might meet more easily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He would be glad, he said, to receive them in his camp, nor would he hesitate to go to them. He had come into Gaul as a friend, not as an enemy, and would keep his sword sheathed, if the Gauls would let him, till he had entered Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus far his emissaries. But when the Gallic chieftains, moving up their camp at once near Iliberri, came, nothing loath, to the Phoenician, they were captivated by his gifts, and permitted the army to march unmolested through their borders and past the town of Ruscino.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Italy meanwhile nothing more was known than that Hannibal had crossed the Ebro &mdash;which was the news that Massiliot envoys brought to Rome &mdash;when, as though he had already crossed the Alps, the Boi, after rousing up the Insubres, revolted.<note>Livy has said nothing of any negotiations between Hannibal and the Boi, preferring, in his love of dramatic effect, to let us see this Gallic outbreak as it appeared to the Romans
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;like a bolt from the blue. See chap. xxix. &sect; 6.</note> To this they were incited not so much by their old animosity against the Roman People as by vexation at the recent establishment of colonies in Gallic territory, near the Po, at Placentia and
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Cremona.<note>These were of the type called Latin colonies. To each of them six thousand colonists had been assigned. They had hardly got settled when the Gauls broke out (Polybius, III. xl. 3-6).</note> Flying to arms they made an incursion into that very district, and spread such terror and confusion that not only the rural population, but the Roman commissioners themselves, who had come for the purpose of assigning lands, not trusting to the <pb id="p.71"/>walls of Placentia, fled to Mutina. (Their names<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> were Gaius Lutatius, Gaius Servilius, and Marcus Annius. There is no question about Lutatius: for Annius and Servilius, some annals have Manius Acilius and Gaius Herennius, others Publius Cornelius Asina and Gaius Papirius
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Maso. This, too, is uncertain, whether envoys sent to expostulate with the Boi were maltreated, or an attack was made upon the three commissioners as they were measuring off the
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> land.) Whilst they lay shut up in Mutina, the Gauls &mdash;who know nothing of the art of assaulting cities, and, besides, are very indolent in regard to siege-works, and were now sitting idly down before the walls without attempting them
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> &mdash;feigned a readiness to treat for peace; and their leaders having invited the Romans to send out spokesmen to confer with them, they seized these envoys, in violation not only of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> law of nations, but also of a pledge which they had given for this time, and declared that they would not let them go unless their own hostages were restored to them.<note>Apparently the Gauls left hostages with the Romans when they arranged for the Romans to send representatives to talk things over with them in the Gallic camp.</note> When word arrived of this affair of the envoys, and Mutina and its garrison were in danger, Lucius Manlius, the praetor, blazing with resentment, set out for Mutina with his army in loose marching
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> order.<note>Neither Polybius nor Livy tells us where Manlius was when the news reached him. Weissenborn-Mueller think he was at Placentia, engaged in strengthening the new fortifications.</note> In those days the road led through a forest, as the country was not, for the most part, under cultivation, and Manlius, advancing without reconnaissance, plunged into an ambush, and after sustaining heavy losses, managed with difficulty to get through into the open
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> fields. There he entrenched <pb id="p.73"/>a camp, and since the Gauls lacked heart to assail it,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the soldiers recovered their spirits, though it was no secret that as many as five hundred men had
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> fallen. Then they began their march again, nor, so long as the column advanced through open country, was the enemy to be seen; but when they had once more got into the woods, the Gauls attacked
						<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> their rear, and throwing the whole column into terror and confusion, slew seven hundred soldiers and carried off six ensigns.<note>This second attack &mdash;Polybius records but the one &mdash;is suspiciously like the first. Livy, or Livy's immediate source, may unconsciously have made two episodes out of slightly different accounts of the same affair.</note> The alarming onsets of the Gauls and the panic of the Romans ended when they got clear of the trackless
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> woods and thickets. Thereafter, marching across open ground, the Romans had no difficulty in protecting their column, and hastened to Tannetum, a village lying near the Po, where by means of temporary fortifications and
						<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> supplies got in by the river, and with the help also of the Brixian Gauls, they defended themselves against the enemy, whose numbers were increasing daily.<note>Tannetum (now Tanneto) was really about ten miles south of the Po, on the Via Aemilia Lepida. If <hi rend="italics">commeatibus fluminis</hi> is correctly translated, we may suppose (1) that Livy thought Tannetum was much nearer the Po, or (2) that he has confused Brixia (Brescia) with Brixellum (Bresciello), which is nearly north of Tanneto and close to the Po, and might have served as an <hi rend="italics">entrep&ocirc;t</hi> for supplies sent down from Placentia. The statement in chap. lv. &sect; 4 that the Cenomani (whose capital was Brixia) were the only Gallic tribe that was loyal to Rome favours (1).</note></p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the news of this sudden insurrection was brought to Rome, and the Fathers learnt that the Punic War was augmented by a war with the Gauls, they commanded Gaius Atilius, the praetor, to take one Roman legion and five thousand of the allies &mdash;a
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> force which the consul<note>P. Cornelius Scipio.</note> had just levied &mdash;and proceed to the relief of Manlius. Atilius reached Tannetum without any fighting, for the enemy had retired in alarm.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><pb id="p.75"/><p>Publius Cornelius, too, after enrolling a new legion<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> in place of that which had been sent with the praetor, set out from the City with sixty ships of war, and coasting Etruria and the mountainous country of Liguria and the Salui, arrived at Massilia, and went into camp at the nearest mouth of the Rhone &mdash;for
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the river discharges itself into the sea by several<note>Polybius (XXXIV. x. 5) says two, Pliny (<hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. iv. 33) three, and Strabo (IV. i. 8) cites Timaeus as authority for the number five.</note> &mdash;hardly believing, even then, that Hannibal could have crossed the Pyrenees.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But when he found that Hannibal was actually planning how to cross the Rhone, being uncertain where he should encounter him, and his soldiers not having as yet fully recovered from the tossing of the sea, he sent out a chosen band of three hundred cavalry, with Massiliot guides and Gallic auxiliaries,<note>Polybius says that Scipio <quote>sent out three hundred of his bravest cavalry, giving them as guides and supports certain Celts who were in the service of the Massiliots as mercenaries</quote> (Paton's translation).</note> to make, while he was waiting, a thorough reconnaissance, and have a look at the enemy from a safe distance.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Hannibal, having pacified the others through fear or bribery, had now reached the territory of a powerful nation called the Volcae.<note>It is usually held &mdash;with Napoleon &mdash;that Hannibal crossed the Rhone above the confluence with the Durance. The arguments of those who think that the crossing was just above the Delta have been recently restated by Spencer Wilkinson, <hi rend="italics">Hannibal's March Through the Alps,</hi> pp. 14-17.</note> They inhabit both banks of the Rhone, but doubting their ability to keep the Phoenician from the western bank, they had brought nearly all their people over the Rhone, so as to have the river for a bulwark, and were holding the eastern bank
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> with arms. The rest of the dwellers by the river, and such of the Volcae themselves as had clung to their homes, were enticed by Hannibal's gifts to assemble large boats from every quarter and to fashion new ones; and indeed <pb id="p.77"/>they themselves were eager to have the army set<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> across as soon as possible and to relieve their district of the burden of so huge a horde of men. So they brought together a vast number of boats, and of canoes roughly fashioned for local traffic, and made new ones by hollowing out
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> single trees. The Gauls took the lead in this, but the soldiers presently fell to work themselves, when they found the timber plentiful and the
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> labour light. They were unshapely troughs, but the men could make them quickly, and their one concern was to get something that would float and hold a cargo, in which they might ferry themselves and their belongings over.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Everything was now in readiness for the crossing, which, however, was menaced by the enemy on the other side, who covered the whole bank with their horse and foot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In order to draw them off, Hannibal ordered Hanno, the son of Bomilcar, to set out in the first watch of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the night with a part of the troops, chiefly Spaniards,<note>The Spaniards were preferred for this duty because of their skill in swimming rivers, as we see at &sect; 5 (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> chap. xlvii. &sect; 5). The method here employed was still in vogue amongst them in Caesar's time (<hi rend="italics">Bell. Civ.</hi> I. xlviii. 7).</note> and, making a march of one day up the stream, to take the first opportunity of crossing it, with the greatest secrecy, and fetch a compass with his column, so that, when the time came, he might assail the enemy in the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Gauls who had been appointed to be his guides informed him that some five-and-twenty miles upstream the river flowed round a little island, and being wider where it divided, and therefore shallower, afforded a passage. There they quickly felled some trees and constructed rafts to transport the men and horses and other burdens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Spaniards without <pb id="p.79"/>more ado stuffed their clothes into skins,<note>The skins of sheep and goats, such as are still used to hold wine. They could either be inflated and used merely as a kind of life-belt, or could be made to serve at the same time as kit bags.</note> and placing<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> their bucklers on top of these and supporting themselves by means of them, swam across. The rest of the force, too, got over, by means of the rafts which they had made, and went into camp near the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They were tired by the night march and their strenuous exertions, but their commander allowed them but one day to rest, being intent on carrying out the stratagem at the proper time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Resuming their march on the following day they sent up a smoke-signal from an elevated place, to show that they had got over the river and were not far off. When Hannibal saw this, he gave the order to cross, so as not to miss the favourable moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The infantry had their skiffs all ready and equipped, while the cavalry had large boats, for the most part, on account of their horses. The large boats were sent across higher up the stream, to take the force of the current, and provided smooth water for the skiffs that crossed below them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A good part of the horses swam and were towed by their halters from the sterns of the boats, except those which they had saddled and bridled and put on board, that their riders might have them ready for instant use on landing.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Gauls rushed to meet them on the bank, with all sorts of yells and their customary songs, clashing their shields together above their heads and brandishing darts in their
						<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> right hands, despite the menace of so great a multitude of vessels coming against them and the loud roaring of the river and the confused hallooing of the boatmen and the sailors, as they strove to force their way athwart the current or shouted encouragement to their fellows <pb id="p.81"/>from the further bank.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the tribesmen were already<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> somewhat daunted by the tumult which confronted them, when a still more appalling clamour arose in the rear, where Hanno had captured their camp. He was soon on the scene himself, and a twofold terror hemmed them in, as that mighty force of armed men came out upon the shore and the unlooked-for line of battle closed in from behind.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the Gauls had attempted charges in both directions and found themselves repulsed, they broke through where the way seemed least beset, and fled in confusion to their several villages. Hannibal brought over at leisure the rest of his forces, and giving himself no more concern over Gallic outbreaks, pitched his camp.</p> <p>I believe that there were various plans for transporting the elephants; at all events the tradition varies as to how it was accomplished.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some say that the elephants were first assembled on the bank, and then the keeper of the fiercest of them provoked the beast and fled into the water; as he swam off, the elephant pursued him and drew the herd in his train; and though they were afraid of the deep water, yet as soon as each of them got out of his depth, the current itself swept him over to the other bank.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is, however, more generally believed that they were carried across on rafts; this method, as it would be the safer, if the thing were to be done, so, in view of its accomplishment, is more probably the one employed.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A raft, two hundred feet long and fifty feet wide, was thrust out from the shore into the stream, and, after being moored to the bank above by a number of stout hawsers, so as not to be carried down the current, was covered with earth, <pb id="p.83"/>like a bridge, in order that the beasts might boldly<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> venture upon it, as on solid ground.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A second raft, of equal width and a hundred feet long, and fit for crossing the river, was coupled to the first. Then the elephants, with the females leading, were driven out over the stationary raft, as over a road; and after they had passed on to the smaller raft adjoining it, the ropes by which this had been loosely attached were cast off and it was towed across by some rowboats to the eastern bank.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After landing the first contingent in this fashion, they returned and fetched the others over.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The elephants exhibited no signs of fear so long as they were being driven along as though on a connected bridge; they first became frightened when the raft was cast loose from the other and was carried out into mid-channel.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The crowding together which resulted, as those on the outside shrank back from the water, gave rise to a slight panic, till terror itself, as they looked at the water all about them, made them quiet.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some, in their frenzy, even fell overboard; but, steadied by their very weight, threw off their riders, and feeling their way to the shallow places, got out upon the land.<note>Polybius, who perhaps believed, as did Pliny (<hi rend="italics">N. H.</hi> VIII. 28), that elephants could not swim, says that those that went overboard were saved by the length of their trunks, which they kept above the surface, and, breathing so, passed through the water, for the most part on their feet (III. xlvii. 12). Livy seems to have thought of them as swimming.</note></p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst the elephants were being got across, Hannibal had dispatched five hundred Numidian horsemen in the direction of the Roman camp, to find out where the enemy were and in what force, and what they meant to do.
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This body fell in with the three hundred Roman horsemen, sent out, as was mentioned before, from the mouth of the Rhone.
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The battle that followed was more hotly fought than the size of the contending forces would suggest, for besides the many who were <pb id="p.85"/>wounded, the numbers of the slain were about equal<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> on both sides, and only the dismay and panic of the Numidians gave the victory to the Romans, who were by that time fairly exhausted. The victors lost about a hundred and forty, not all Romans but some of them Gauls; the vanquished about two hundred.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was at once the beginning of the war and an omen that promised the Romans success in the final outcome, though their victory would be by no means without bloodshed and would only come after a doubtful struggle.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the participants in this affair had returned to their respective generals, it was impossible for Scipio to adopt any settled plan, except to frame his own measures to meet the strategy and movements of the enemy;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> while Hannibal, uncertain whether to march on, as he had begun, to Italy, or give battle to the first Roman army that had come in his way, was diverted from an immediate trial of strength by the arrival of Boian envoys, with their chief Magalus. These assured him that they would guide his march and share its perils, and urged him to avoid a battle and to keep his forces whole and unimpaired for the invasion of Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The rank and file were fearful of the enemy &mdash;for their memory of the former war was not yet erased &mdash;but more fearful of the interminable march over the Alps, an undertaking which rumour made appalling, at any rate to the inexperienced.</p> <p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly Hannibal, having settled in his own mind to go forward and advance on Italy, called the soldiers together and worked on their feelings with alternate chiding and encouragement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He marvelled, he said, what sudden terror had <pb id="p.87"/>invaded breasts that had ever been dauntless. For<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> these many years they had been victorious in war, nor had they quitted Spain until all the tribes and territories which lay between two distant seas were in the power of the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, indignant that the Roman People should demand that whoever had laid siege to Saguntum be surrendered up to them, as though to expiate a felony, they had crossed the Ebro, in order to wipe out the Roman name and liberate the world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The march had not then seemed long to any of them, though they meant to advance from the setting to the rising sun;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but now, when they could see that they had measured off the greater part of it;<note>Polybius (III. xxxix) estimates the distance covered by Hannibal as follows: New Carthage to the Ebro 2600 stades (the stade is roughly a furlong); the Ebro to Emporium 1600; Emporium to Narbo 600; Narbo to the passage of the Rhone 1600; the passage of the Rhone to the foot of the pass over the Alps 1400; the foot of the pass to the valley of the Po 1200.</note> when they had made their way, through the fiercest tribes, over the Pyrenees; when they had crossed the Rhone &mdash;that mighty river &mdash;in the teeth of so many thousand Gauls, overcoming, too, the violence of the stream itself; when the Alps, the other side of which was in Italy, were in full sight;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> &mdash;were they halting now, as though exhausted, at the very gates of their enemies?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What else did they think that the Alps were but high mountains? They might fancy them higher than the ranges of the Pyrenees; but surely no lands touched the skies or were impassable to man. The Alps indeed were inhabited, were tilled, produced and supported living beings; their defiles were practicable for armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those very ambassadors whom they beheld had not crossed the Alps in the air on wings. Even the ancestors of these men had not been natives of Italy, but had lived there as foreign settlers, and had often crossed these very Alps in <pb id="p.89"/>great companies, with their children and their wives,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> in the manner of emigrants.<note>See v. xxxiv-xxxv. Livy places the earliest Gallic immigration in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For armed soldiers, taking nothing with them but the instruments of war, what could be impassable or insurmountable? To capture Saguntum, what dangers or what hardships had they not endured for eight long months?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now that Rome, the capital of the world,<note>This expression is a strange anachronism in the mouth of Hannibal; but Livy thinks of Hannibal as realizing &mdash;and so perhaps he may have done &mdash;that the struggle now beginning would determine whether Rome or Carthage should rule the world.</note> was their objective, could anything seem so painful or so difficult as to delay
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> their enterprise? Had Gauls once captured that which the Phoenician despaired of approaching? Then let them yield in spirit and manhood to a race which they had so often vanquished in the course of the last few days, or look to end their march in the field<note>The Campus Martius lay outside the Servian wall, between the Capitoline, Quirinal, and Pincian Hills and the Tiber.</note> that lay between the Tiber and the walls of Rome.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After encouraging them with this exhortation, he bade them refresh themselves and make ready for the march.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Setting out the following day he advanced up the Rhone towards the interior of Gaul, not that it was the more direct way to the Alps, but believing that the farther he retired from the sea, the less likely he was to fall in with the Romans,
						<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> with whom he had no mind to fight a battle until he should arrive in Italy. The fourth day's march brought him to the Island.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There the rivers Isara and Rhone, rushing down from different Alps, unite their waters, after enclosing a considerable territory, and the Island is the name which has been given to the plains lying between them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Near by is the country of the Allobroges, a tribe, even at <pb id="p.91"/>that early day, inferior to no Gallic tribe in wealth<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> or reputation. Just then it was a prey to discord.<note>The tribe in question was not the Allobroges, according to Polybius, III. xlix., but afforded the Carthaginians protection against the Allobroges.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two brothers were disputing the sovereignty. The elder, Braneus by name, who had held sway before, was being driven out by a faction of juniors headed by the younger brother, whose right was less but his might greater.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This quarrel having very opportunely been referred to Hannibal for settlement, who thus became arbiter of the kingdom, he espoused the sentiments of the senate and the leading men and restored the sovereign power to the elder.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In requital of this service he was assisted with provisions and supplies of every sort, particularly clothing, which the notorious cold of the Alps made it necessary to provide.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Having settled the contentions of the Allobroges, Hannibal was now ready for the Alps; but instead of marching directly towards them, he turned to the left,<note>A turn to the left is unintelligible at this point in the march, and must be explained as due to a duplication of the march up the Rhone mentioned in &sect; 2.</note> to the country of the Tricastini, and thence proceeded through the outer borders of the territory of the Vocontii to the Tricorii, by a road which nowhere presented any difficulties, until he came to the Druentia.<note>Neither the Durance nor any of these tribes is mentioned by Polybius. But Polybius disliked to encumber his narrative with outlandish geographical names that would mean nothing to his readers, and they are less likely to be arbitrary embellishments
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> &mdash;on the part either of Livy or his source &mdash;than authentic details drawn from a source or sources common to Livy and Polybius and omitted by Polybius for the reason given. (The same may be said of the name of the Gallic prince in &sect; 6.) If we assume that Hannibal ascended the Is&egrave;re-Drac to the Druentia and thence crossed the Gen&egrave;vre, he would have touched the territories of these tribes, and there would be no great difficulty in reconciling the account in Livy with that in Polybius (see <hi rend="italics">De Sanctis,</hi> p. 69).</note> This, too, is an Alpine river and by far the most difficult of all the rivers of Gaul
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> to <pb id="p.93"/>cross; for, though it brings down a vast volume of<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> water, it does not admit of navigation, since, not being confined within any banks, but flowing at once in several channels, not always the same, it is ever forming new shallows and new pools &mdash;a fact which makes it dangerous for foot-passengers as well &mdash;besides which it rolls down jagged stones and affords no sure or stable footing to one who
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> enters it. And at that time, as it happened, it was swollen with rains, and the crossing took place amidst the wildest tumult, for the men &mdash;besides their other difficulties &mdash;were confused by their own excitement and bewildered outcries.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Cornelius the consul, some three days after Hannibal had left the bank of the Rhone, marched in fighting order to the enemy's camp, intending to offer battle without delay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But finding the works deserted, and perceiving that he could not readily overtake the enemy, who had got so long a start of him, he returned to the sea, where he had left his ships, thinking that he would thus be more safely and easily enabled to confront Hannibal as he descended from the Alps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Still, that he might not leave Spain stripped of Roman defenders &mdash;for the lot had assigned it to him as his province &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> sent Gnaeus Scipio, his brother, with the chief part of his troops, to deal with Hasdrubal, with the object not merely of protecting the allies and of winning over new ones, but also of driving Hasdrubal out of Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He himself, with extremely scanty forces, sailed back to Genoa,<note>At chap. xxxix. &sect; 3 Livy agrees with Polybius in naming Pisa as Scipio's port of debarkation, forgetting that he has here named Genoa.</note> proposing to safeguard Italy with the army which lay in the valley of the Po.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Hannibal, leaving the Druentia, and advancing for the most part through a champaign country, <pb id="p.95"/>reached the Alps without being molested by the<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> Gauls who inhabited those regions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, though report, which is wont to exaggerate uncertain dangers, had already taught them what to expect, still, the near view of the lofty mountains, with their snows almost merging in the sky; the shapeless hovels perched on crags; the frost-bitten flocks and beasts of burden; the shaggy, unkempt men; animals and inanimate objects alike stiff with cold, and all more dreadful to look upon than words can tell, renewed their consternation.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As their column began to mount the first slopes, mountaineers were discovered posted on the heights above, who, had they lain concealed in hidden valleys, might have sprung out suddenly and attacked them with great rout and slaughter. Hannibal gave the command to halt, and sent forward some Gauls to reconnoitre.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When informed by them that there was no getting by that way, he encamped in the most extensive valley to be found in a wilderness of rocks and precipices.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then employed these same Gauls, whose speech and customs did not differ greatly from those of the mountaineers, to mingle in their councils, and in this way learned that his enemies guarded the pass only by day, and at night dispersed, every man to his own home. As soon as it was light, he advanced up the hills, as though lie hoped to rush the defile by an open attack in the daytime.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then having spent the day in feigning a purpose other than his real one, he entrenched a camp on the spot where he had halted.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But no sooner did he perceive that the mountaineers had dispersed from the heights and relaxed their vigilance, than, leaving for show more fires than the <pb id="p.97"/>numbers of those who remained in camp demanded;<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> leaving, too, the baggage and the cavalry and a great part of the infantry, he put himself at the head of some light-armed soldiers &mdash;all
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> his bravest men &mdash;and, marching swiftly to the head of the defile, occupied those very heights which the enemy had held.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With the ensuing dawn the Carthaginians broke camp and the remainder of their army began to move.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The natives, on a signal being given, were already coming in from their fastnesses to occupy their customary post, when they suddenly perceived that some of their enemies were in possession of the heights and threatened them from above, and that others were marching through the pass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both facts presenting themselves at the same time to their eyes and minds kept them for a moment rooted to the spot. Then, when they saw the helter-skelter in the pass and the column becoming embarrassed by its own confusion, the horses especially being frightened
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and unmanageable, they thought that whatever they could add themselves to the consternation of the troops would be sufficient to destroy them, and rushed down from the cliffs on either side, over trails and trackless ground alike, with all the ease of habit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then indeed the Phoenicians had to contend at one and the same time against their foes and the difficulties of the ground, and the struggle amongst themselves, as each endeavoured to outstrip the rest in escaping from the danger, was greater than the struggle with the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The horses occasioned the greatest peril to the column. Terrified by the discordant yells, which the woods and ravines redoubled with their echoes, they quaked <pb id="p.99"/>with fear; and if they happened to be hit or<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> wounded, were so maddened that they made enormous havoc not only of men but of every sort of baggage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Indeed the crowding in the pass, which was steep and precipitous on both sides, caused many &mdash;some of them armed men &mdash;to be flung down to a great depth; but when beasts of burden with their packs went hurtling down, it was just like the crash of falling walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Dreadful as these sights were, still Hannibal halted for a little while and held back his men, so as not to augment the terror and confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then, when he saw that the column was being broken in two, and there was danger lest he might have got his army over to no avail, if it were stripped of its baggage, he charged down from the higher ground and routed the enemy by the very impetus of the attack, though he added to the disorder amongst his own troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But the flurry thus occasioned quickly subsided, as soon as the roads were cleared by the flight of the mountaineers; and the whole army was presently brought over the pass, not only without molestation but almost in silence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hannibal then seized a stronghold which was the chief place in that region, together with the outlying hamlets, and with the captured food and flocks supported his troops for three days. And in those three days, being hindered neither by the natives, who had been utterly cowed at the outset, nor very greatly by the nature of the country, he covered a good deal of ground.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They came next to another canton, thickly settled for a mountain district. There, not by open fighting, but by his own devices, trickery and deception, Hannibal was all but circumvented.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.101"/>The elder headmen of the strongholds waited on<note type="margin">B.C.218</note> him, as a deputation, and said that, taught by other men's misfortunes &mdash;a useful warning &mdash;they preferred to experience the friendship of the Phoenicians rather than their might;
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> they were ready, therefore, to carry out his orders, and they requested him to accept provisions and guides and also hostages as a guarantee of good faith.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal, neither blindly trusting nor yet repulsing them, lest, being spurned, they might become openly hostile, returned a friendly answer, accepted the proffered hostages, and used the supplies, which they had brought down, themselves, to the road. But he drew up his column, before following their guides, by no means as though for a march through a friendly country.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The van was made up of elephants and cavalry; he himself, with the main strength of the infantry, came next, looking warily about him and watching everything.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When they had got to a narrow place, which was overhung on one side by a ridge, the tribesmen rose up on every quarter from their ambush and assailed them, front and rear, fighting hand to hand and at long range, and rolling down huge boulders on the marching troops.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The rear-guard bore the brunt of the attack, and as the infantry faced about to meet it, it was very evident that if the column had not been strengthened at that point, it must have suffered a great disaster in this pass.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Even so, they were in the utmost peril and came near destruction. For while Hannibal was hesitating to send his division<note>By <hi rend="italics">agmen</hi> Livy here means the second (and larger) part of the column, under Hannibal's immediate command.</note> down into the defile, since he had no troops left to secure the rear of the infantry, as he himself <pb id="p.103"/>secured that of the horse, the
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> mountaineers rushed<note type="margin">B.C. 21</note> in on his flank, and breaking through the column, established themselves in the road, so that Hannibal spent one night without cavalry or baggage.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day, since by now the barbarians were attacking with less vigour, his forces were re-united and surmounted the pass; and though they suffered some casualties, still they lost more baggage animals than men.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From this point on the mountaineers appeared in smaller numbers, and, more in the manner of brigandage than warfare, attacked sometimes the van, sometimes the rear, whenever the ground afforded an advantage, or the invaders, pushing on too far ahead or lagging behind, gave opportunity.
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The elephants could be induced to move but very slowly along the steep and narrow trails; but wherever they went they made the column safe from its enemies, who were unaccustomed to the beasts and afraid of venturing too near them.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>On the ninth day they arrived at the summit of the Alps, having come for the most part over trackless wastes and by roundabout routes, owing either to the dishonesty of their guides, or &mdash;when they would not trust the guides &mdash;to their blindly entering some valley, guessing at the way. For two days they lay encamped on the summit.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The soldiers, worn with toil and fighting, were permitted to rest; and a number of baggage animals which had fallen among the rocks made their way to the camp by following the tracks of the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Exhausted and discouraged as the soldiers were by many hardships, a snow-storm &mdash;for the constellation of the Pleiades was now setting<note>The morning setting of the Pleiades occurred on October 26.</note> &mdash;threw them into a great fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <pb id="p.105"/>The ground was everywhere covered deep with snow<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> when at dawn they began to march, and as the column moved slowly on, dejection and despair were to be read in every countenance.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then Hannibal, who had gone on before the standards, made the army halt on a certain promontory which commanded an extensive prospect, and pointing out Italy to them, and just under the Alps the plains about the Po, he told them that they were now scaling the ramparts not only of Italy, but of Rome itself; the rest of the way would be level or downhill;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and after one, or, at the most, two battles, they would have in their hands and in their power the citadel and capital of Italy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The column now began to make some progress, and even the enemy had ceased to annoy them, except to make a stealthy raid, as occasion offered. But the way was much more difficult than the ascent had been, as indeed the slope of the Alps on the Italian
				<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> side is in general more precipitous in proportion as it is shorter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For practically every road was steep, narrow, and treacherous, so that neither could they keep from slipping, nor could those who had been thrown a little off their balance retain their footing, but came down, one on top of the other, and the beasts on top of the men.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They then came to a much narrower cliff, and with rocks so perpendicular that it was difficult for an unencumbered soldier to manage the descent, though he felt his way and clung with his hands to the bushes and roots that projected here and there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The place had been precipitous before, and a recent landslip had carried it away to the depth of a good thousand feet.<note>In Polybius (III. liv. 7) the landslip carries away a stretch of road more than a stade and a half (about a thousand feet) <hi rend="italics">long.</hi> Livy got the idea that the thousand feet represented the distance from the top to the bottom of the slip.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There the cavalry <pb id="p.107"/>came to a halt, as though they had reached the end<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> of the road, and as Hannibal was wondering what it could be that held the column back, word was brought to him that the cliff was impassable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Going then to inspect the place himself, he thought that there was nothing for it but to lead the army round, over trackless and untrodden steeps, however circuitous the detour might be.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But that way proved to be insuperable; for above the old, untouched snow lay a fresh deposit of moderate depth, through which, as it was soft and not very deep, the men in front found it easy to advance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but when it had been trampled down by the feet of so many men and beasts, the rest had to make their way over the bare ice beneath and the slush of the melting snow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then came a terrible struggle on the slippery surface, for it afforded them no foothold, while the downward slope made their feet the more quickly slide from under them; so that whether they tried to pull themselves up with their hands, or used their knees, these supports themselves would slip, and down they would come again! Neither were there any stems or roots about, by which a man could pull himself up with foot or hand &mdash;only smooth ice and thawing snow, on which they were continually rolling.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the baggage animals, as they went over the snow, would sometimes even cut into the lowest crust, and pitching forward and striking out with their hoofs, as they struggled to rise, would break clean through it, so that numbers of them were caught fast, as if entrapped, in the hard, deep-frozen snow.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At last, when men and beasts had been worn out to no avail, they encamped upon the ridge, <pb id="p.109"/>after having, with the utmost difficulty, cleared<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> enough ground even for this purpose, so much snow were they obliged to dig out and remove.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The soldiers were then set to work to construct a road across the cliff-their only possible way. Since they had to cut through the rock, they felled some huge trees that grew near at hand, and lopping off their branches, made an enormous pile of logs. This they set on fire, as soon as the wind blew fresh enough to make it burn, and pouring vinegar over the glowing rocks, caused them to crumble.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After thus heating the crag with fire, they opened a way in it with iron tools, and relieved the steepness of the slope with zigzags of an easy gradient, so that not only the baggage animals but even the elephants could be led down.<note>This famous story has provoked much ridicule, but in Livy's defence may be noted, (1) the well-known disintegrating effect on certain kinds of stone of heat followed by a douche of cold water; (2) the belief entertained in ancient times, and as late as the sixteenth century, that vinegar helped to make stones friable; (3) the likelihood that Hannibal had at least a few skins of sour wine in his baggage-train (some have held that a vast quantity would have been required, but it must be remembered that Livy may have conceived of the <hi rend="italics">width</hi> of the landslip as only a few rods; see last note). In any case those who regard the vinegar story as fiction must not fasten the fiction on Livy, if, as I think, we may discern an allusion to it in Varro's Menippean Satires (<hi rend="italics">Sesculixes,</hi> frag. 25, p. 237, of the Buecheler-Heraeus edition: alteram viam deformasse Carneaden virtutis e cupis acris aceti), and it was probably an old and popular tradition long before the time of Varro, who died in <date value="-27">27 B.C.</date> For recent discussion of the story see the article by Evan T. Sage in <hi rend="italics">C. W.</hi> 16 (1922-1923) 73-76, and notes of modern instances by other contributors to the same volume.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Four days were consumed at the cliff, and the animals nearly perished of starvation; for the mountain tops are all practically bare, and such grass as does grow is buried under snow.<note>Polybius (III. Iv. 7) says that the pack-animals and horses were sent over the road after one day's work had been done, and turned out to pasture, but that three days were employed in making it sufficiently wide for the elephants.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lower down one comes to valleys and sunny slopes and rivulets, and near them woods, and places that begin to be fitter for man's habitation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There the beasts were turned out to graze, and the men, exhausted with toiling at the road, were allowed to rest. Thence they descended in three days' time <pb id="p.111"/>into the plain, through a region now that was less<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> forbidding, as was the character of its inhabitants.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the chief features of the march to Italy, which they accomplished five months after leaving New Carthage &mdash;as certain authorities state &mdash;having crossed the Alps in fifteen days.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The strength of Hannibal's forces on his entering Italy is a point on which historians are by no means agreed. Those who put the figures highest give him a hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse; the lowest estimate is twenty thousand foot and six thousand horse.<note>So Polybius (III. lvi. 4), who says that these numbers were given by Hannibal himself in an inscription at Lacinium.</note>
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Lucius Cincius Alimentus,<note>Praetor in Sicily, <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> He and Fabius Pictor were contemporaries and were Livy's oldest sources.</note> who says that he was taken prisoner by Hannibal, would be our weightiest authority, did he not confuse the reckoning by adding in Gauls and Ligurians: including these, he says that Hannibal brought eighty thousand foot and ten thousand horse &mdash;but
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> it is more probable, and certain historians so hold, that these people joined his standard in Italy; he says, moreover, that he had learned from Hannibal's own lips that after crossing the Rhone he lost thirty-six thousand men and a vast number of horses and other animals.<note>Polybius (iii. Iv. 5) says that Hannibal left the Rhone with thirty-eight thousand infantry and eight thousand cavalry, and lost more than half his troops crossing the passes.</note>
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Taurine Gauls were the first people he encountered on descending into Italy.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Since all are agreed on this point,<note>It is a moot question whether Polybius shared this view.</note> I am the more astonished at the difference of opinion in regard to his route over the Alps, and that it should be commonly held that he crossed by the Poenine Pass<note>The Great St. Bernard.</note> and that from this circumstance that ridge of the Alps derived its name &mdash;and
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that Coelius should state that he crossed by the ridge of Cremo;<note>Perhaps the Little St. Bernard.</note> for <pb id="p.113"/>both these passes would have brought him down,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> not amongst the Taurini but through the Salassi Montani to the Libuan Gauls.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Neither is it probable that these routes to Gaul<note>Livy means Cisalpine Gaul; he is writing from Hannibal's standpoint.</note> were open at that time; those leading to the Poenine Pass, at any rate, would have been blocked by tribes of half-German stock.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nor for that matter &mdash;if anyone happens to consider this point of consequence &mdash;do the Seduni Veragri, who inhabit those mountains, know of their having been named from any passage of the Phoenicians (or Poeni) but from that deity whose sanctuary is established on their very summit and whom the mountaineers call Poeninus.<note>Coins and votive offerings have been discovered there, and the remains of the little temple of the god, who was apparently the Juppiter Poeninus of certain extant inscriptions.</note></p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quite opportunely for the opening of the campaign, the Taurini, the nearest tribe, had begun a war against the Insubres. But Hannibal was unable to put an army in the field to aid the Insubres, as the soldiers while convalescing felt more keenly than ever the distress arising from the hardships they had undergone;
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for rest coming after toil, plenty after want, comfort after filth and wet, produced all manner of disorders in their squalid and well-nigh brutalized bodies.
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was the reason why the consul Publius Cornelius, who had come by sea to Pisa, though the army which he received from Manlius and Atilius was made up of raw recruits, still quaking from their recent defeats, yet marched in all haste towards the Po, that he might join battle with an enemy not yet restored to vigour.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when the consul reached Placentia, Hannibal <pb id="p.115"/>had already broken camp and taken the capital city<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> of the Taurini by assault, because they would not freely come into his friendship.
								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the other hand, he would have brought the Gauls who dwell along the Po to join him, not alone from fear but even of their own free choice, had not the consul taken them by surprise, appearing unexpectedly whilst they were looking about them for a pretext to revolt.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hannibal, too, moved forward from the Taurini, being persuaded that the Gauls, uncertain which side they had best adhere to, would attach themselves to those who were on the spot.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The armies were now almost within sight of each other, and the opposing generals, though as yet they did not know one another well, had yet each been imbued with a kind of admiration for his antagonist.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For Hannibal's name had been very renowned amongst the Romans, even before the destruction of Saguntum, and Scipio was a man of mark in the eyes of Hannibal, from the mere fact of his having been selected, in preference to any other, to command against himself.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Each had increased the other's good opinion &mdash;Scipio, because, though left behind in Gaul, he had confronted Hannibal at his crossing over into Italy; Hannibal by the audacity with which he had conceived and executed his passage of the Alps.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Scipio, however, was the first to cross the Po. He brought his army up to the river Ticinus, and in order to put heart into the men before leading them out to fight, harangued them after the following fashion:</p> <p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Soldiers, if I were leading into battle the army that I had under me in Gaul, I should have <pb id="p.117"/>deemed it unnecessary to address you.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For what<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> point would there have been in exhorting either those horsemen who at the river Rhone had signally defeated the horsemen of the enemy, or those legions with which I pursued this very enemy in his flight, and by the confession implied in his withdrawal and avoidance of a battle, gained a virtual victory?
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As it is, since that army, enrolled for service in Spain, is campaigning there under my auspices with my brother Gnaeus Scipio, where the senate and the Roman People desired that it should serve, and I myself, that you might
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> have a consul for your leader against Hannibal and the Phoenicians, have of my own choice undertaken the present conflict, it is right that your new commander should say a word or two to his new soldiers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>"That you may not be ignorant what manner of war it is, or what your enemies are, you are to fight, my men, with those whom you defeated in the former war, on land and sea; with those from whom you exacted tribute for twenty years; with those from whom you wrested Sicily and Sardinia, which you now hold as the spoils of war.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> You and they will therefore enter the present struggle with such spirits as usually attend the victors and the vanquished. Nor are they now going to fight because they dare, but because they must;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> unless you think that those who avoided battle when their strength was unimpaired would, now that they have lost two-thirds of their infantry and cavalry in the passage of the Alps, have become more hopeful!
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But, you will say, their numbers indeed are small, but their courage and vigour are so great that scarce any force could withstand their might and power. Nay, not so!
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They <pb id="p.119"/>are but the semblance, the shadows of men, wasted<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> away with hunger and cold, with filth and squalor; bruised and crippled amongst the rocks and cliffs; moreover, their limbs are frost-bitten, their muscles stiffened by the snow, their bodies numb with cold, their arms shattered and broken, their horses lame and feeble.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That is the cavalry, that the infantry with which you are to fight; you have no enemy &mdash;only the last relics of an enemy! And I fear nothing more than this, that when you have fought, it may seem to have been the Alps that conquered Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But perhaps it was right that the gods themselves, without any human aid, should begin and decide a war with a general and a people who break their treaties; and that we, whose injury was second to that of the gods, should add the finishing stroke to a war already so begun and so decided.</p> <p>

						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In a cavalry engagement &mdash;for this was the arm with which I was given the opportunity of fighting &mdash;I put the enemy to rout: his infantry column, marching hastily off as if in flight, I could not overtake by land; returning therefore to my ships I accomplished with all <pb id="p.121"/>possible expedition so circuitous a voyage and march,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> and am come to confront this redoubtable enemy almost at the very foot of the Alps.

						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I would willingly make trial whether the earth has suddenly produced in the last twenty years<note>The First Punic War had ended in <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date></note> another breed of Carthaginians, or whether they are the same who fought at the Aegatian islands and whom you suffered to depart from Eryx at a rating of eighteen denarii a head;

						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Were he not maddened by the crime he committed at Saguntum, he would surely have regard, if not for his conquered country, yet at least for his house and his father and the treaties written by the hand of Hamilcar, who, under the orders of our consul, withdrew his garrison from Eryx;
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> who submitted with rage and anguish to the heavy terms imposed upon the beaten Carthaginians; who agreed, on withdrawing from Sicily, to pay tribute to the Roman People.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so I could wish you, soldiers, to fight not only with that courage with which you are wont to fight against other enemies, but with a kind of resentful rage, as if you saw your slaves all at once take up arms against you.

						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But we gave them the quarter they besought of us; we lifted the siege and let them go; we made peace with them when we had conquered them; and thereafter, when they were hard pressed by the war in Africa, we regarded them as under our protection.

						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And I would that your honour only and not your very existence were in jeopardy: you have got to fight not for the ownership of Sicily and Sardinia, which were formerly in dispute, but for Italy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There is no second army at our back to stop the enemy, in case we fail to beat him, nor are there other Alps to obstruct his advance while we make ready new defences.

						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Let each and every one of you consider that his arms protect, not his own person, but his wife and little children; nor let him be concerned for his family alone, but remember that ours are the hands to which the senate and the Roman People are now looking, and that even as our might and valour shall prove to be,

							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal thought it well to encourage his soldiers by an object lesson before haranguing them. He therefore caused the army to gather in a circle for the spectacle, and setting in the midst some captive mountaineers with fetters on them, gave the order to throw some Gallic weapons down at their feet, and bade an interpreter enquire if any were willing to fight for life or death, on condition of <pb id="p.125"/>being granted freedom, if victorious, and presented<note type="margin">B.C.218</note> with a horse and arms.

								<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having thus, by the exhibition of several pairs, worked on the passions of his troops, he dismissed them. Then, convening an assembly, he addressed them &mdash;so it is said &mdash;in the following strain: "If that spirit which but now was roused in you by the example of the plight of others shall presently be yours, when you consider your own prospects, then, soldiers, the victory is ours.
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For that was no mere spectacle, but a kind of picture, as it were, of your own condition.

								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Here, soldiers, you must conquer or die, where for the first time you have faced the enemy. And the same Fortune which has laid upon you the <pb id="p.127"/>necessity of fighting holds forth the promise of such<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> prizes, in the event of victory, that men are wont to ask not even the immortal gods for greater.

							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and the Phoenician, whilst his enemies were engaged in fortification, sent Maharbal with a squadron of Numidians, numbering five hundred horse, to ravage the fields belonging to the allies of the Roman People, with orders to spare the Gauls as much as possible and tempt their leaders to desert.
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the completion of the bridge, the Roman army marched over into the country of the Insubres, and took up a position five miles from Victumulae.
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was there that Hannibal had his camp, who, quickly recalling Maharbal and his cavalry, when he saw that a battle was imminent, called his troops together &mdash;for he never felt that he had done enough in the way of preparing and cheering the men &mdash;and held out definite rewards to them to fight for;
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he would give them land, he said, in Italy, Africa, or Spain, as each might choose, tax-free to the recipient and to his children; those who had rather have money than land he would content with silver; if any of the allies desired to become citizens of Carthage, he would give them the opportunity;

								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the Roman side there was far less alacrity, for, besides other things, they were also frightened by some recent portents:
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> a wolf had entered the camp and after rending those whom it met, had itself escaped unharmed; and a swarm of bees had settled in a tree that hung over the consul's tent.
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After averting these omens,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> having by sacrifice to the gods averted the evil portended by these omens.</note> Scipio set out with his cavalry and light-armed darters to reconnoitre at close hand the enemy's camp and the size and character of his forces, and encountered Hannibal, who had likewise come out with his cavalry to explore the surrounding country.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Neither party descried the other at first; afterwards an increasingly thick cloud of dust, that rose with the advance of so many men and horses, gave them notice that their enemies were approaching. Both bodies halted and began to make ready for battle.
								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.137"/>Scipio stationed his darters and Gallic horse in front,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> holding in reserve the Romans and the best of the allies; Hannibal put the cavalry who rode with bridles in the centre, and made his wings strong with Numidians. Hardly had the battle-cry been raised, when the darters fled through their supports to the second line.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then followed a cavalry fight of which the issue was for a time in doubt; but by and by the horses became excited by the presence of the foot-soldiers who were mingled with them, and many riders lost their seats or dismounted on seeing their fellows in distress, and the battle was now fought chiefly on foot; until the Numidians, who were posted on the flanks, rode round in a little circuit and showed themselves on the rear.
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So alarming a sight filled the Romans with dismay, and, to add to their fear, the consul was wounded and was only saved from danger by the intervention of his son, who was just reaching manhood.
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This is the youth who will have the glory of finishing this war, and be surnamed Africanus, from his famous victory over Hannibal and the Phoenicians.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> However, the rout was chiefly amongst the darters, the first to be charged by the Numidians: the cavalry rallied, and receiving the consul into their midst, and shielding him not only with their arms but with their persons also, brought him back to camp without panic or confusion at any point in their retreat. (The credit for saving the consul's life is given by Coelius to a Ligurian slave.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I should prefer, for my own part, that the story about his son were the true one, and this is the version which most authorities have handed down and tradition has established.<note>Polybius, who had the story from Laelius, the bosom friend of the younger Africanus, is among those who make Scipio the hero of this anecdote (x. iii. 2).

									<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the first battle fought with<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> Hannibal, in which it was clearly seen that the Phoenician was superior in cavalry and that consequently open plains, like those between the Po and the Alps, were ill-suited to the Romans for campaigning.
									<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, the next night Scipio gave his men the order to pack up without making any noise, and quitting his camp on the Ticinus, marched swiftly to the Po, intending to use the bridge of boats which he had thrown across the river and had not yet broken up, in order to set his army over without confusion or interruption by the enemy.
									<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were at Placentia before Hannibal was well aware that they were gone from the Ticinus; nevertheless some six hundred men, who were lingering on the northern bank and taking their time about casting off the raft, fell into Hannibal's hands. He was not able to cross the bridge, for when the end was cast off, the whole raft swung down stream with the current.<note>Polybius (III. lxvi) makes Hannibal pursue Scipio only as far as the Ticinus (where Polybius places the episode of the six hundred), then turn back and march W. along the Po two days, till he found a place where he could bridge it. See Map 2, <hi rend="italics">Operations on the Po.</hi></note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Coelius states that Mago with the cavalry and the Spanish foot immediately swam the river, and that Hannibal himself led his army across the Po by an upper ford, after placing the elephants in a line to break the current of the river.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Those who are acquainted with the Po will hardly credit this account;<note>One of the very few places where Livy implies a firsthand acquaintance with the scene of events described.</note> for, in the first place, it is unlikely that the horsemen could have breasted so strong a current without the loss of arms or horses, even if all the Spaniards had swum over on inflated skins, and in the second place it would have needed a circuitous march of many days to reach fords on the Po by which an army encumbered with baggage could get across.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.141"/><p>Those writers seem to me more worthy of belief<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> who relate that in two days' search a pace was scarcely found where the river could be spanned by a bridge of boats; by this the cavalry and light Spanish infantry were sent forward under Mago.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While Hannibal, who had lingered on the northern bank to give a hearing to some Gallic embassies, was bringing over the heavy infantry, Mago and his horsemen advanced a day's march from the crossing of the river towards Placentia and the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A few days later, Hannibal went into camp behind entrenchments, six miles from the town, and on the following day drew up his troops in sight of the enemy and offered battle.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next night there was a bloody affray in the Roman camp, occasioned by some Gallic auxiliaries, though the confusion was greater than the loss of life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some two thousand foot-soldiers and two hundred horsemen cut down the guards doing duty at the gates and fled to Hannibal, who received them with fair words, and after encouraging them to hope for great rewards, sent them off to their several states to solicit the support of their countrymen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Scipio apprehended that this bloodshed would prove to be a signal for the defection of all the Gauls, and that they would fly to arms, as if maddened by the contagion of this crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly, though still troubled with his wound, he marched silently away in the fourth watch of the next night to the river Trebia, and encamped on higher ground, where hills made it more difficult for cavalry to operate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was less successful than he had been on the Ticinus in eluding the observation of Hannibal, who sent after him first the Numidians and then all his <pb id="p.143"/>cavalry, and would have thrown the rearguard at<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> least into disorder, had not the Numidians, in their greed for booty, turned aside to plunder the camp which the Romans had abandoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Whilst they frittered away the time there, rummaging in every nook and cranny without finding anything that really repaid them for the loss of time, they let their enemies slip through their fingers. The Romans had already passed the Trebia and were marking out their camp, when the Numidians caught sight of them and cut down a few loiterers whom they intercepted on the hither side of the stream.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Scipio could no longer bear the pain occasioned by the jolting of his wound in travelling, and besides he judged it best to wait for the arrival of his colleague, who was already recalled &mdash;so he had heard &mdash;from Sicily. He therefore chose what seemed to be the safest place near the river for a permanent camp, and proceeded to entrench it.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Hannibal, too, went into camp not far away. Elated as he was at the victory of his horse, he was no less worried by the dearth of food, which increased from day to day, as he advanced through hostile territory without having anywhere arranged beforehand for supplies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the village of Clastidium the Romans had got together a great quantity of corn. Thither Hannibal dispatched some soldiers, who were making preparations to assault the place, when hopes were held out of its betrayal. The price was not a large one: Dasius of Brundisium, who was in command of the garrison, accepted a bribe of four hundred gold pieces, and turned Clastidium over to Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This served the Phoenicians as a granary, while they lay encamped on <pb id="p.145"/>the Trebia. The surrendered garrison were spared,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> as Hannibal wished to gain at the very outset a reputation for clemency.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though the war on land had come to a standstill at the Trebia, engagements had in the meantime been fought by land and sea off Sicily and the islands near the Italian coast, not only by Sempronius the consul, but even before his coming thither.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Twenty quinqueremes with a thousand men at arms had been sent by the Carthaginians to lay waste the coast of Italy; nine of them reached Liparae and eight the Isle of Vulcan;<note>This island, south of Lirara, and known also as Thermissa,<foreign lang="greek">,</foreign>and Hiera, is now called Volcano.</note> three the current diverted from their course into the Straits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These last were sighted by the people of Messana, and Hiero, king of the Syracusans, who happened to be in Messana at the time, waiting for the Roman consul, dispatched twelve ships, which captured the enemy's ships without a struggle and brought them into the harbour of Messana.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was learned from the prisoners that, besides the fleet of twenty galleys to which they themselves belonged &mdash;which had sailed for Italy &mdash;five and thirty other quinqueremes were on the way to Sicily to rouse up the old allies;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the seizure of Lilybaeum was their prime object; but they supposed that the same storm by which they had themselves been scattered had struck this fleet as well and had driven it out of its course to the Aegatian Islands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king wrote a full account of these rumours, just as they had come to him, to Marcus Aemilius, the praetor,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> who was in command in Sicily, and warned him to garrison Lilybaeum strongly. The praetor at once sent out his lieutenants and tribunes to the cities round about, and urged his people to be on their guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Above all, Lilybaeum <pb id="p.147"/>was kept in a state of readiness for war, an edict<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> having been published directing the naval allies to bring to their ships cooked rations for ten days, so that, on the signal being given, there might be nothing to delay their embarkation. All along the coast men were sent to keep a look-out from the watch-towers for the coming of the enemy's fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so, notwithstanding that the Carthaginians had delayed their sailing on purpose that they might come up to Lilybaeum in the dark, they were nevertheless perceived, because there was a moon all night and they bore down under a spread of canvas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The signal was at once displayed from the watchtowers, and in the town the call to arms was sounded and the ships were manned; some of the troops were at once on the walls or guarding the gates, some on the ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And the Carthaginians, seeing that they should have to do with men who were not unprepared, stood off from the harbour until dawn and employed the time in taking down their masts and sails and putting the fleet in fighting trim.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the day broke, they withdrew into the open sea, to give room for the battle and to allow their enemy's ships a ready egress from the harbour. Nor did the Romans shun the encounter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They remembered the victories that had been won in that same vicinity, and relied on the numbers and the bravery of their men. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					Once at sea, the Romans wanted to join battle and match their strength against the enemy's at close quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Phoenicians, on the contrary, preferred to man&oelig;uvre; to conduct the affair by strategy, not by force, and to make it a contest <pb id="p.149"/>rather of ships than of men or arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For although<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> their fleet was well equipped with rowers, they were short of fighting men; and when a ship was grappled, the men-at-arms in her were greatly outnumbered by their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Perceiving this, the Romans derived a fresh access of courage from their numbers, and the other side were correspondingly disheartened by their fewness. Seven Punic ships were instantly cut out and captured, and the rest took to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were seventeen hundred soldiers and sailors on the captured ships, including three Carthaginian nobles. The Roman fleet returned intact into the harbour: one ship only had been rammed, and even this was brought safely in.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After this engagement, but before the people in Messana had got wind of it, the consul Tiberius Sempronius came to that city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As he was entering the straits, King Hiero put out to meet him, with his fleet in fighting order, and passing over from the royal galley to the praetorian,<note>So the flagship was called, from the old use of <hi rend="italics">praetor</hi> in the sense of <quote>commander</quote>; cf. praetorian camp, praetorian guard. The consuls were at first called praetors (III. Iv. 12).</note> congratulated Sempronius on having arrived in safety with his army and his ships, and prayed that he might have a safe and successful passage to Sicily.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then described conditions in the island and the attempts made by the Carthaginians, and promised that with the same spirit with which, in
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> his youth, he had helped the Roman People in the former war he would help them now, as an old man, and would furnish corn and clothing gratis to the legions of the consul and the naval allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He added that Lilybaeum and the cities of the coast were in great danger, and that some of them would welcome a revolution.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In view of these things, the consul saw fit to sail without delay for Lilybaeum, and the king attended him with <pb id="p.151"/>the royal fleet. On the voyage they learned of the<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> action that had been fought near that city, and the defeat and capture of the enemy's ships.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From Lilybaeum the consul dismissed King Hiero and his fleet, and leaving the praetor to protect the coast of Sicily, set sail for the island of Melita,<note>Malta.</note> which was held by the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On his arrival, Hamilcar, Gisgo's son, the commandant of the garrison, surrendered himself and nearly two thousand soldiers, together with the town and island. From Melita Sempronius returned in a few days to Lilybaeum, and consul and praetor sold into slavery the prisoners they had made, with the exception of those who were distinguished by noble birth. When the consul judged that Sicily was in no danger from that quarter,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Africa. Livy has omitted to mention the fact, recorded by Coelius (quoted by the grammarian Charisius, II. p. 203 K), that Sempronius even sent a swift galley to spy out a good landing-place for a Roman army on the coast of Africa.</note> he crossed over to the Isles of Vulcan, where it was rumoured that a Punic fleet was lying; but no single enemy was discovered near those islands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had already, as it happened, sailed across to ravage the Italian
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> coast, and after pillaging the country about Vibo, were even threatening the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul was returning again to Sicily when tidings reached him of the enemy's raid on the lands of Vibo, and a letter was delivered to him from the senate, apprising him of Hannibal's descent into Italy and bidding him go to the assistance of his colleague at the earliest possible moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Beset with many cares at once, he immediately embarked his army and dispatched it through the Adriatic to Ariminum; to Sextus Pomponius, his lieutenant, he assigned five and twenty ships of war, with the task of defending the territory of Vibo and the coast of Italy; the fleet under Marcus Aemilius the praetor he increased to fifty sail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He himself, <pb id="p.153"/>after settling the affairs of Sicily, took ten ships, and<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> skirting the Italian coast, arrived at Ariminum. Thence he marched with his army to the Trebia and effected a junction with his colleague.<note>This important sketch of affairs in Sicily (chapters xlixli) is drawn from a source which cannot be identified. De Sanctis (p 186) thinks that the condensed and unrhetorical character of the style excludes its attribution to Coelius; neither Fabius nor Cincius is likely to have been so impartial in giving credit to the allies, like Hiero, and we know of no Greek writer who would have treated minor incidents with such particularity. He conjectures that the unknown writer may have been Eumachus of Naples (who wrote in Greek of the war with Hannibal) or some other Italian or Sicilian historian.</note></p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now that both the consuls and all the forces which the Romans could muster were opposing Hannibal, it was obvious enough either that the troops there under arms were able to defend Rome's empire or that her case was hopeless.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nevertheless one of the consuls, disheartened by a single cavalry engagement and weak from his wound, preferred to postpone the decision. The other, unwearied and therefore the more impetuous, would put up with no delay.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The country between the Trebia and the Po was in those days inhabited by Gauls, who in this struggle of two mighty peoples maintained a neutral attitude and plainly intended to court the good-will of the victor.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This policy was agreeable enough to the Romans, if only the Gauls made no disturbance, but was far from acceptable to Hannibal, who declared repeatedly that he had come on the invitation of the Gauls, to set them free.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In his resentment at this state of affairs, and in order at the same time to sustain his troops with plunder, he ordered two thousand foot and a thousand horse &mdash;chiefly Numidians but with a sprinkling of Gauls &mdash;to
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> waste the entire country-side, field after field, right up to the banks of the Po. The helpless Gauls, who had been undecided until then, were compelled to turn from the authors of their wrongs to those who might avenge them; and, sending envoys <pb id="p.155"/>to the consuls, besought the Romans to come to the<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> aid of a land that was suffering for its inhabitants' too great loyalty to Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Cornelius liked neither the occasion nor the time for fighting, and regarded the Gauls with suspicion, both because of many acts of perfidy, and especially &mdash;even though time had obliterated those ancient grievances &mdash;because of the recent treachery of the Boi.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Sempronius, on the contrary, held that the strongest bond for keeping the allies to their obligations was the defence of those who should first stand in need of help.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the present occasion, while his colleague hesitated, Sempronius sent his cavalry, interspersed with about a thousand foot-soldiers, armed with darts, to protect the Gallic lands beyond the Trebia.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Falling unexpectedly upon the enemy, who were scattered and disorganized &mdash;most of them laden too with spoils &mdash;they drove them with great slaughter in a terror-stricken rout to the very outposts of the Carthaginian camp. Thence the enemy poured out in numbers and repulsed the Romans, in their turn; but reserves came up and restored the day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thereafter the fortune of the battle shifted, as pursuit was followed by retreat; and though in the end the opposing armies were on even terms, still the enemy had lost more men and the Romans got the credit of a victory.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But to no one did the victory seem greater or more unequivocal than to Sempronius the consul; he was beside himself with joy that with that arm of the service with which the other consul had been beaten, he himself had been successful.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He declared that the spirits of the men were restored and renewed, and that no one but his colleague desired <pb id="p.157"/>to put off the struggle; Cornelius, he said, was sick<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> in spirit rather than in body, and the recollection of his wound made him dread a battle and its missiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But they must not droop and languish along with a sick man. Why indeed should they further postpone the conflict, or waste time? What third consul, what other army were they waiting for?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Carthaginians were encamped in Italy and almost within sight of Rome. Their object was, not to get back Sicily and Sardinia, taken from them after their defeat, nor to cross the Ebro and occupy northern Spain, but to expel the Romans from the land of their fathers and from their native soil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>How would our fathers groan,</quote> he cried, <quote>that were wont to wage war about the walls of Carthage, could they see us, their offspring, two consuls and two consular armies, cowering within our camp in the heart of Italy; and the Phoenician in full sway over all the territory between the Alps and the Apennines!</quote> Thus he ran on, as he sat by the bed of his sick colleague; thus he argued in the praetorium,<note><hi rend="italics">praetorium</hi> here means the open space in front of the general's tent, not (as often) the tent itself Sempronius meant that the soldiers should know his sentiments, but did not quite go the length of declaring them in a formal harangue.</note> almost as if haranguing the troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His impatience was increased, too, by the near approach of the elections, lest the war go over to the term of the new consuls and he lose the opportunity of gaining all the glory for himself, while his colleague was laid up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly, despite the unavailing protests of Cornelius, he commanded the soldiers to make ready for an early battle.</p> <p>Hannibal, since he saw what was best for the enemy, hardly dared to hope that the consuls would take any rash or ill-considered step; but knowing, as he did &mdash;by hearsay first and afterwards by experience &mdash;that
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> one of them was of a fiery and <pb id="p.159"/>reckless disposition, and believing that the late successful<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> brush with the Carthaginian raiders would have made him still more headstrong, he was fairly confident that the good fortune of a general engagement was at hand.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was therefore his one concern to let slip no opportunity for bringing this about, while the soldiers of the enemy still lacked experience, while the abler of their generals was incapacitated by his wound, while the courage of the Gauls was up &mdash;since
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> he knew that their vast multitude would follow the less willingly, the farther they were drawn from home.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For these and similar reasons he hoped that a battle would soon be fought, and was eager, should there be any hesitation, to force it on. And so, when his Gallic scouts &mdash;who were safer for gathering the information that he wanted because there were men of that nation in both camps &mdash;had reported that the Romans were prepared to fight, the Phoenician began to look about for a place in which to lay an ambush.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Between the two camps was a water-course, shut in by very high banks on either side and overgrown all round with marsh-grass and the underbrush and brambles with which uncultivated land is usually clothed. When Hannibal, riding over the ground himself, saw that this place afforded sufficient cover even for cavalry, he said to his brother Mago, <quote>This will be the place for you to hold.
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Choose out a hundred men from all the infantry and a hundred from the cavalry, and come with them to my quarters at the first watch. It is time now to sup and rest.</quote> With that he broke up the council. In a little while Mago presented himself with his picked men.
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>I see the stoutest of my men,</quote> said <pb id="p.161"/>Hannibal, <quote>but that your numbers too may be strong to<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> match your bravery, choose, each of you, from the squadrons and the maniples, nine others like yourselves. Mago will point out to you the spot where you are to lie in ambush; you have an enemy who is blind to these stratagems.</quote>
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mago and his thousand horse and thousand foot being thus dispatched, Hannibal ordered the Numidian cavalry to cross the Trebia at dawn, and riding up to the enemy's gates and discharging missiles against his outposts, to lure him into battle; and then, when the fight was on, to give ground insensibly and draw him across the river. Such were the orders of the Numidians.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The other officers, both of cavalry and of infantry, were instructed to make their men have breakfast, and then, armed and with horses saddled, to await the signal.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>On the flurry caused by the Numidians, Sempronius, confident where cavalry was concerned, first led out all of this part of his forces; then six thousand of the infantry; and finally all the rest of his troops. He had fully made up his mind beforehand and was eager for the battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It chanced to be the time of year when the days are shortest, and it was snowing in the region between the Alps and the Apennines, and the proximity of rivers and marshes intensified the bitter cold.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Moreover, men and horses had been turned out in haste, without stopping for food or doing anything to guard against becoming chilled; there was no warmth in them, and the nearer they approached the atmosphere of the river the sharper grew the cold wind in their faces.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But when, in pursuit of the fleeing Numidians, they entered the water &mdash;swollen breast-high with the <pb id="p.163"/>rain that had fallen in the night &mdash;or at any rate<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> when they got out upon the further bank, then indeed their bodies were all so benumbed that they could hardly hold their weapons; and at the same time they were fainting with fatigue, and, as the day wore on, with hunger as well.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal's soldiers had in the meantime made fires before their tents; in each company they had been served with oil to supple their joints, and had breakfasted at leisure. When, therefore, they were told that the enemy had crossed the river, they were eager both in mind and body, as they armed and went out to battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In front of the standards Hannibal placed the Baliares, light-armed troops numbering about eight thousand, and behind these his heavy infantry, tile strength and flower of his army; the wings he formed of ten thousand horse, and, dividing the elephants, stationed them outside the wings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul's troopers were scattered in pursuit of the Numidians, when suddenly the latter made a stand and took them unawares; whereupon he called them back and posted them on either flank of the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were eighteen thousand Romans and twenty thousand allies of the Latin name, besides the auxiliaries of the Cenomani, the only Gallic tribe that continued loyal. These were the contending forces.</p> <p>The Baliares began the battle, but those light-armed troops, finding the legions too strong to cope with, were quickly withdrawn and sent to the wings.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This man&oelig;uvre at once caused the Roman cavalry acute distress; for they numbered but four thousand, and, tired as they were, would scarce have been able to hold out any longer against the enemy's ten <pb id="p.165"/>thousand cavalry alone, who were most of them<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> fresh;
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and now they were overwhelmed, as it were with a cloud of missiles, by the Baliares.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Besides this, the elephants, looming large on the outer extremities of the wings, gave rise to such a panic, particularly among the horses, not only by their strange appearance, but also by their unfamiliar smell, as to bring about a general flight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As for the infantry, they were fairly matched in courage, but not in strength, which was unimpaired in the case of the Phoenicians, who had refreshed themselves shortly before entering the battle, while the Romans were faint with fasting and fatigue, and were stiff and numb with cold. Yet their courage would have enabled them to resist, had they fought against infantry alone.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the Baliares, having put the cavalry to flight, were raining missiles on their flanks; the elephants had now charged the centre of the line; and Mago and his Numidians, as soon as the Roman army had passed their ambuscade without observing it, started up in their rear, and caused the wildest panic and confusion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nevertheless, amidst all these evils, the line held for a time unshaken, and even &mdash;what no one had dared to hope for &mdash;against the elephants.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Skirmishers, expressly posted to deal with the beasts, would throw darts at them and make them turn away, and then pursuing them would strike them under the tail, where the skin is softest and it is possible to wound them.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In their terror they were now on the point of charging their own people, when Hannibal gave orders to drive them from the centre to the extreme left wing, against the Gallic auxiliaries. Here they immediately caused a decided stampede, and the <pb id="p.167"/>Romans experienced a fresh alarm when they saw B.C. 218 their auxiliaries routed.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And so, hemmed in as they now were on every side, about ten thousand men, when they found it impossible to escape at any other point, forced a passage, with great slaughter of their enemies, through the Carthaginian centre, which was composed of Gallic auxiliaries, and being cut off by the river
							<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> from returning to their camp and so blinded by the rain that they could not well discern where to help their comrades, took the shortest way to Placentia.<note>Livy appears to have thought of Placentia as west of the Trebia, which the ten thousand were therefore not now obliged to cross, though Scipio and the garrison were (&sect; 8).</note> After that sundry groups broke out at various points.
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Those who headed for the river were either drowned in its eddies, or, while they hesitated to enter it, were overtaken by the enemy;
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but those who scattered over the countryside in flight made their way by following the tracks of the retreating column, to Placentia; others, venturing, in their terror of the enemy, to attempt the river, got across, and reached the camp.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The mingled rain and snow and the intolerable sharpness of the cold brought death to many men and beasts of burden and to almost all the elephants.<note>At chap. lviii. &sect; 11 Livy speaks of the loss of <hi rend="italics">seven</hi> of the elephants which survived the Trebia. According to</note>
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Phoenicians pursued their enemies no further than to the river Trebia, and got back to camp so benumbed and chilled as hardly to feel the joy of victory. Consequently, when, in the night that followed, the garrison of the camp, and such soldiers without arms
							<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> for the most part-as had survived the rout, were crossing the Trebia on rafts, they either heard nothing, owing to the noise made by the rain, or being unable, for weariness and wounds, to bestir themselves, pretended not to hear; and unmolested Polybius (II. lxxiv, 11), all but <hi rend="italics">one</hi> perished from the effects of the rain and snow that followed the battle.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <pb id="p.169"/>by the enemy Scipio led his army in silence to B.C. 218 Placentia, and thence-after crossing the Po-to Cremona, so that that one town might not be overburdened with furnishing winter quarters for two armies.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To Rome the news of this disaster brought such consternation that people looked for the immediate appearance of the hostile army before their very City, and knew not which way to turn for any hope or help in defending their gates and walls against its onset.<note>The descriptions of the terror occasioned in Rome by news of the defeat and of the journey of Sempronius are not found in Polybius and are very likely drawn from Coelius Antipater.</note>
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When one consul had been defeated on the Ticinus, the other had been summoned back from Sicily; but now that two consuls and two consular armies had been beaten, what other generals, what other legions had they to call upon?
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the midst of this alarm the consul Sempronius arrived. He had made his way, taking tremendous risks, through the enemy's cavalry &mdash;which was widely dispersed in quest of booty &mdash;relying more on audacity than calculation or the prospect of eluding his enemies, or of resisting, should he be unable to elude them.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The election of consuls was the one crying need of the hour. This Sempronius accomplished and returned forthwith to his winter quarters.
								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The choice had fallen on Gnaeus Servilius and &mdash;for the second time &mdash;on Gaius Flaminius.</p> <p>For the rest, the Romans were given no peace even in their winter quarters. The Numidian cavalry ranged far and wide, and any ground that was too rough for them was covered by the Celtiberians and Lusitani.
									<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The result was the cutting off of all supplies from every quarter, save such as were brought up the Po in ships. Their magazine, which was near Placentia, was elaborately fortified <pb id="p.171"/>and strongly garrisoned. This place Hannibal hoped<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> to capture by assault, and set out thither with his cavalry and light infantry.
									<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He had counted mainly on the concealment of his movements for their effectiveness; but his night attack failed to catch the sentries off their guard, and the defenders at once set up so loud an outcry that it was heard even in Placentia. And so at break of day the consul was on the spot with his cavalry, having ordered the legions to follow him in fighting column.
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Meanwhile, a cavalry engagement took place, in which Hannibal was wounded and withdrew from the fight, and
									<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the enemy were so alarmed by this that the post was successfully defended.
									<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After this Hannibal, when he had rested only a few days and his wound was scarce healed over, set out to attack Victumulae. This had been a Roman magazine in the Gallic war, and having then been fortified had since attracted numerous settlers from the various peoples dwelling in the neighbourhood;
									<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and just then the fear of raids had caused large numbers to flock in from the countryside.
									<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Such was the character of the population, which, fired by the story of the stout defence of the fortress near Placentia, flew to arms and went out to meet Hannibal. More like marching columns than embattled armies they encountered each other in the road; and since on one side there was only an undisciplined rabble, and on the other a general who relied upon his soldiers, and soldiers who confided in their general, some thirty-five thousand men were routed by a very few.
									<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The next day they surrendered and received a garrison within their walls. Being commanded to give up their weapons they complied: whereupon a <pb id="p.173"/>signal was suddenly given to the victors to sack the<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> town, as if they had taken it by storm.
									<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Nor was any cruelty omitted which historians generally deem worth noting on such an occasion; but every species of lust and outrage and inhuman insolence was visited upon the wretched inhabitants. Such were Hannibal's winter expeditions.</p> <p>
										<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
										<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For no long time thereafter, while the cold<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> was still unbearable, he allowed his men to rest, and on the first doubtful
										<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> signs of spring broke up his winter quarters and marched towards Etruria, with the object of drawing that nation also to his standards, either by force or with their own consent, as he had done with the Gauls and the Ligurians.
										<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In attempting to cross the Apennines he was assailed by a storm so terrible as almost to surpass the horrors of the Alps. With the wind and rain blowing full in their faces, at first &mdash;because they must either have dropped their arms or else, if they struggled against it, be caught by the hurricane and hurled to the ground &mdash;they
										<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> halted; then, when it actually stopped their breath and would not allow them to respire, they turned their backs on the gale and for a time huddled together on the ground.
										<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now the heavens resounded with a frightful tumult, and between the terrific crashes the lightning flashed.
										<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Deafened and blinded, they were all stunned with fear. At length the downpour ceased, but the wind only blew the more furiously, and there seemed to be nothing to do but to pitch camp on the very spot where they had been caught.
										<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This, however, was but a fresh beginning of their troubles, for they could neither spread nor set up a tent, nor, once set up, would it stay in place, for the wind rent <pb id="p.175"/>everything to shreds and swept it away;
										<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and when<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> presently the moisture taken up by the wind had been congealed over the cold mountain ridges, it descended in such a storm of sleet that the men let go of everything and threw themselves on their faces on the ground, overwhelmed by their shelters rather than protected by them;
										<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and the cold that ensued was so severe that when anyone sought to rise and lift himself from out that pitiful heap of men and beasts, for a long time he would be unable, because his sinews were so stiff and tense that he could hardly bend his joints.
										<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Afterwards, when at last by exerting themselves they had recovered the power of motion and regained their courage, and had begun here and there to kindle fires, each, in his helplessness, applied to someone else for help.
										<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For two days they remained on that spot as if beleaguered. Many men and many horses perished, and seven of the elephants that had survived the battle on the Trebia.</p> <p>
											<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
											<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Descending from the Apennines, Hannibal turned back once more towards Placentia, and after marching about ten miles went into camp. The next day he advanced against the enemy with twelve thousand foot and five thousand horse.
											<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor did the consul Sempronius, who had now returned from Rome, decline the combat. That day there were only three miles between the two encampments. On the following day they fought, with great spirit and with shifting fortunes.
											<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the first encounter the Romans had so far the best of it that not only were they victorious in the battle, but they pursued the beaten enemy to his camp, and were soon attacking the camp itself.
											<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hannibal stationed <pb id="p.177"/>a few defenders on the rampart and at the gates<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> and received the rest in a crowded throng within the enclosure, where he bade them watch intently for the signal to sally forth.
											<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was now about the ninth hour of the day,<note>Approximately three o'clock in the afternoon.</note> when the Roman general, who had worn out his men to no avail and saw no prospect of capturing the camp, bade sound the recall.
											<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Hannibal heard this and perceived that the fighting had grown lax and that the enemy had retired from his rampart, he suddenly sent his cavalry against them from the right and left and rushed out himself with the strength of his infantry from the centre of the camp.
											<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Seldom has there been a fiercer battle or one more notable for the losses on both sides than this would have been, had the light permitted it to be prolonged; but darkness put an end to a conflict which had been begun with the greatest ardour.
											<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fury of the combatants was consequently greater than the carnage, and as the battle was practically a drawn one, so were the losses equal when the opposing forces separated.
											<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On neither side had more than six hundred of the infantry fallen or half as many of the cavalry; but the loss of the Romans was out of proportion to the number slain, for it included several knights, five tribunes of the soldiers, and three praefects of the allies.
											<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After this engagement Hannibal retired into Liguria and Sempronius to Luca. The Ligurians had ambushed and made prisoners of two Roman quaestors, Gaius Fulvius and Lucius Lucretius, with two tribunes of the soldiers and five members of the equestrian order &mdash;mostly sons of senators. These men they handed over to Hannibal on his coming among them, as a <pb id="p.179"/>further earnest of their peaceful and friendly<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> disposition towards him.<note>For the events recorded in this chapter Livy is thought to have drawn upon some late and worthless annalist. That the Romans should have been able, so soon after their discomfiture on the Trebia, to hold their own in open battle &mdash; and a battle too where cavalry cut so large a figure &mdash;is improbable, to say the least. Polybius says nothing of any such operations, nor of the march to Luca, which contradicts Livy's own statement, at chap. lxiii. &sect; 1, that the army of Sempronius wintered at Placentia (see also chap. lxiii. &sect; 15). The whole question is discussed by De Sanctis, pp. 186 f. Cf. too the notes in Weissenborn-Mueller- Rossbach.</note></p> <p>

												<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst these things were going on in Italy,<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, who had been sent out to Spain with a fleet and an army, had
												<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> set sail from the mouth of the Rhone and passing the Pyrenees had put into Emporiae.
												<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Landing his army there and beginning with the Laeetani, he had brought all that coast, as far as the river Ebro, under Roman sway, partly by renewing old alliances and partly by forming new ones.
												<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The reputation which he there acquired for clemency and justice availed not only with the maritime tribes, but also with the more warlike clans inhabiting the interior and the mountainous parts; so that he was able not only to establish peaceful relations but even to conclude a military alliance with them, and several strong cohorts of auxiliaries were raised there.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>North of the Ebro Hanno was the Carthaginian commander, for Hannibal had left him there to defend that region. Feeling, therefore, that something ought to be done, before everything was lost to Carthage, he pitched his camp in sight of the enemy and offered battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman general saw no reason to put off the engagement; he knew that he must fight with Hanno and Hasdrubal, and chose rather to deal with them separately than both at once. Neither was the battle very difficult to win.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Six thousand of the enemy were killed and <pb id="p.181"/>two thousand captured, together with the garrison<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> of the camp &mdash;for this too was attacked and taken. The general himself and several chieftains were made prisoners, and Cissis, a town which stood near the camp, was carried by assault.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The plunder of the town yielded objects of little worth &mdash;household belongings of barbarians and slaves of no great price &mdash;but the camp made the soldiers rich;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> for in it they found not only the valuables of the army that they had just defeated, but also those of the army that was now serving under Hannibal in Italy, for the men had left nearly all their treasures behind when they crossed the Pyrenees, so as not to burden themselves with heavy baggage on the march.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hasdrubal had not yet received definite tidings of this disaster when he crossed the Ebro with eight thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry, as though to confront the Romans at their first arrival; but on learning of the catastrophe at Cissis and the loss of the camp, he turned and marched in the direction of the sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Not far from Tarraco<note>Later (under Augustus) made the capital of the Roman province of Tarraconensis. There are still in existence remains of Iberian walls and of the Roman citadel, circus, amphitheatre, and water-system.</note> he came upon the soldiers of the fleet and the naval allies, who were dispersed and wandering over the country-side, with the carelessness which usually attends success; and sending out his cavalry in all directions he drove them, with much slaughter and more confusion, to their ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But not venturing to tarry longer in that region, lest Scipio should be down upon him, he retreated across the Ebro.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Scipio, hearing of these new enemies, did indeed march thither with all speed; but after punishing a few of the ships' captains, he left a garrison of moderate size in Tarraco and returned with the <pb id="p.183"/>fleet to Emporiae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No sooner was he gone than<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> Hasdrubal appeared, and inciting the Ilergetes, who had given Scipio hostages, to revolt, he used the young men of this very tribe to lay waste the fields of the allies who were faithful to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But this having roused Scipio from his winter quarters, he retreated again and abandoned all the territory north of the Ebro. Scipio invaded the country of the Ilergetes &mdash;left thus in the lurch by the instigator of their revolt &mdash;with fire and sword, and driving them all into the city of Atanagrus,<note>Site unknown: perhaps not far from Ilerda (Lerida) on the Sicoris.</note> the capital of that nation, laid siege to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Within a few days he had exacted more hostages of them than before, and mulcting them also in a sum of money, had received them under his authority and rule.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence he marched against the Ausetani, near the Ebro, who were likewise allies of the Phoenicians; and besieging their city, laid an ambush for the Lacetani, as they were bringing assistance to their neighbours, and fell upon them in the night, not far from the city, when they would have entered it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The slain amounted to about twelve thousand; almost all the others lost their arms, and scattering over the fields in all directions, fled to their homes. As for the besieged, nothing could have saved them but a winter that was most unfavourable to the besiegers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The blockade lasted thirty days, during which time the snow rarely lay less than four feet deep, and so completely had it covered the mantlets and pent-houses of the Romans that this alone was sufficient to protect them from the firebrands that were several times discharged upon them by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Finally, when their chief Amusicus had fled and taken refuge with Hasdrubal, <pb id="p.185"/>they made terms and surrendered, agreeing to pay<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> twenty talents of silver. The Romans returned to Tarraco and went into winter quarters.<note>Polybius knows nothing of the events recounted in &sect;&sect; 5-11, but makes Scipio retire for the winter to Emporiae and Hasdrubal to Tarraco, at the conclusion of the campaign described by Livy in &sect;&sect; 1-4. The source which Livy used for the latter part of the chapter was perhaps a Greek writer whose account of Hasdrubal's offensive was so different from that of Polybius that Livy thought that they related to two distinct campaigns. It is possible that Livy's immediate source in &sect;&sect; 5-11 was Coelius and that the discomfiture of the Lacetani is an embellishment of the story due to the latter's patriotic inventiveness.

						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Rome or near it many prodigies occurred that winter, or &mdash;as often happens when men's thoughts are once turned upon religion &mdash;many were reported and too easily credited. Some of these portents were: that a free-born infant of six months had cried <quote>Triumph!</quote>
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in the provision market; that in the cattle market an ox had climbed,
						<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> of its own accord, to the third storey of a house and then, alarmed by the outcry of the occupants, had thrown itself down;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that phantom ships had been seen gleaming in the sky; that the temple of Hope, in the provision market, had been struck by lightning; that in Lanuvium a slain victim had stirred, and a raven had flown down into Juno's temple and alighted on her very couch; that in the district of Amiternum, in many places, apparitions of men in shining raiment had appeared in the distance, but had not drawn near to anyone;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that in the Picentian country there had been a shower of pebbles; that at Caere the lots had shrunk;<note>The lots were inscribed on little wooden or bronze tablets; they are also associated with Praeneste, Falerii, and Patavium.</note> that in Gaul a wolf had snatched a sentry's sword from its scabbard and run off with it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the other prodigies the decemviri were commanded to consult the Books,<note>The Sibylline Books were wont to be consulted (but only on the express command of the senate) as to the meaning and proper expiation of portents.</note> but for <pb id="p.187"/>the shower of pebbles in the Picentian country a<note type="margin">B.C. 218</note> nine days' sacrifice was proclaimed. They then set about the expiation of the other portents, and in this virtually all the citizens bore a part.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> First of all, the city was purified, and major victims were offered up to the designated gods;
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> a gift of gold weighing forty pounds was carried to Lanuvium for Juno, and a bronze statue was dedicated to Juno, by the matrons, on the Aventine; a <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> was ordered at Caere, where the lots had shrunk; and a supplication was ordered to be made to Fortune on Mount Algidus;
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> in Rome, too, a <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> was specially appointed for Juventas, and a supplication at the temple of Hercules, and later the entire people was commanded to observe this rite at all the <hi rend="italics">pulvinaria;</hi><note>A <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> (for the first one in <date value="-399">399 B.C.</date> see I. xiii. 6) was a banquet tendered to the gods, at which their images were placed on couches (<hi rend="italics">pulvinaria</hi>). Juventas is here associated with Hercules, as was Hebe in Greece.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> also five major victims were slain in honour of the Genius of the Roman People; and Gaius Atilius Serranus the praetor was ordered to make a vow, <quote>if the commonwealth should abide for ten years in its present state.</quote>
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The making of these vows and expiations, as prescribed by the Sibylline Books, went far to alleviate men's anxiety concerning their relations with the gods.</p> <p>

							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Of the consuls designate, Flaminius, to<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> whom the legions wintering at Placentia had been assigned by lot, dispatched an edict and a letter to the consul, commanding that these troops should be ready in the camp at Ariminum on the Ides of March.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was here, in his province, that he designed to enter on the consulship, for he remembered his former controversies with the senators, which he had waged when a tribune of the plebs,<note>In the year <date value="-232">232 B.C.</date> he had carried a law in the Comitia Tributa providing that certain Picentine and Gallic lands should be divided among the poorer citizens.</note> and later as consul &mdash;in the first place about his <pb id="p.189"/>consulship, which they tried to annul, and again<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> concerning his triumph.<note>In <date value="-223">223 B.C.</date> the senate commanded the consuls Furius and Flaminius, who had marched against the Insubrian Gauls, to return to Rome and resign their magistracies on the ground that unfavourable auguries had been reported. But Flaminius refused to return, fought and won a battle, and triumphed in the face of senatorial opposition
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> &mdash;by virtue of a decree of the people.</note> He was also hated by the senators on account of an unprecedented law which Quintus Claudius the tribune of the plebs had introduced, despite the opposition of the senate, with the backing of Gaius Flaminius alone of all that body, providing that no senator or senator's son should own a sea-going ship of more than three hundred amphoras burden<note>The amphora &mdash;a wine-jar with two handles &mdash;was standardized as a liquid measure roughly equal to six gallons. In our terminology such a vessel would be described as of about seven tons burden.</note> &mdash;this was reckoned to be sufficient to transport the crops from one's fields, and all money-making was held unseemly
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> in a senator. The measure, which was vehemently opposed, had been productive of great resentment on the part of the nobles against Flaminius, who had advocated its enactment; but had procured for him the favour of the plebs and afterwards
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> a second consulship. Believing, therefore, that his enemies would falsify the auspices and make use of the Latin Festival<note>The new consuls were required to fix the date of the Feriae Latinae, at the first session of the senate after their entering upon office, and they might not take the field for the summer's campaign before they had duly presided over the sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris, which was the essential feature of the celebration.</note> and other means of hindering a consul, to detain him in the City, he pretended that he had to take a journey, and departing, as a private citizen, slipped away secretly
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> to his province. This behaviour, when the truth came out, aroused fresh indignation in the breasts of the already hostile senators: Gaius Flaminius, they said, was waging war not only with the senate, but this time with
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the immortal gods. He had formerly been made consul without the confirmation of the auspices, and, though both gods and men had sought to recall him from the very battle-line, he <pb id="p.191"/>had not obeyed; now, conscious of having spurned<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> them, he had fled the Capitol and the vows that were regularly undertaken, that he might not, on the day of entering upon his office, approach the temple of
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Jupiter Optimus Maximus; that he might not see and consult the senate, which hated him and which he alone of all men hated; that he might not proclaim the Latin Festival and offer the accustomed sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris on
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Alban Mount; that he might not, after receiving auspices, go up to the Capitol to make his vows, and thence proceed, in the general's cloak<note>The <hi rend="italics">paludamentum,</hi> typifying military imperium, might be assumed by the consul on leaving the City, the <hi rend="italics">toga</hi> <hi rend="italics">praetexta,</hi> white with a purple border, was worn by the consul while in Rome.</note> and accompanied by lictors, to his province; like some camp-follower, without insignia and without lictors, he had set out in secret and by stealth, precisely as though
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> going into exile; he thought, forsooth, that it was more in keeping with the dignity of his high command to begin his magistracy in Ariminum than in Rome &mdash;to assume the purple-bordered toga<note>The <hi rend="italics">paludamentum,</hi> typifying military imperium, might be assumed by the consul on leaving the City, the <hi rend="italics">toga</hi> <hi rend="italics">praetexta,</hi> white with a purple border, was worn by the consul while in Rome.</note> in an inn than in the presence of
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> his household gods! With one accord they voted to recall him and drag him back and compel him to discharge in person all his obligations to gods and men, before he went to his army
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and his province. On this commission &mdash;for commissioners they resolved to dispatch &mdash;Quintus Terentius and Marcus Antistius set forth, but moved Flaminius no more than the letter sent him by the senate had moved him in
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> his former consulship. A few days later he entered on his magistracy, and as he was offering up a calf, it escaped &mdash;after being struck &mdash;out of the hands of those who would have sacrificed it, and spattered many of the bystanders
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> with its blood. The dismay and confusion <pb id="p.193"/>were even greater among those who stood farther B..217 off and knew not what was occasioning the panic. By most people it was regarded as an omen

			<p>IN this book is described the beginning of the Second
				Punic War, and how Hannibal, the general of the
				Phoenicians, crossed the river Ebro in violation of the
				treaty. Besieging Saguntum, a city belonging to allies
				of the Roman People, he captured it in the eighth
				month. These injuries led to the dispatch of ambassadors to the Carthaginians, to complain. On their
				refusing satisfaction, war was declared against Carthage.
				Hannibal, after surmounting the passes of the Pyrenees,
				traversed Gaul&mdash;having routed the Volcae, who had
				attempted to stop him&mdash;and arrived at the Alps. After
				a troublesome passage of these mountains, in the course
				of which he also defeated in several battles the Gallic
				mountaineers, when they blocked his way, he descended
				into Italy and routed the Romans in a cavalry battle
				near the river Ticinus. In this battle Publius Cornelius
				Scipio was wounded and was saved by his son, who
				later received the name of Africanus. Again a Roman
				army was routed near the river Trebia. After this
				Hannibal crossed the Apennines, with great distress to
				his soldiers, because of violent storms. In Spain Gnaeus
				Cornelius Scipio fought successfully against the Phoenicians and captured the enemy's general, Mago.<note>This name is a mistake (found also in Orosius, IV. xiv. 9) for Hanno (chap. Ix. &sect; 4).</note> </p></div1>

				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SPRING was now drawing on, and accordingly<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> Hannibal moved out of his winter encampment. He had tried before this to cross the Apennines, but had failed because of the intolerable cold.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And the delay had been attended with the greatest danger and anxiety; for when the Gauls, whom the hope of spoil and pillage had excited to revolt, perceived that instead of harrying and plundering the fields of others, their own lands were the seat of war and were burdened with the winter quarters of both armies, they turned their hatred back again from the Romans upon Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But though their leaders laid many a plot against him, their treachery to one another saved him, for they gave him information of these conspiracies with the same inconstancy with which they had conspired. Moreover, changing now his dress and now his headgear,<note>Polybius says that <quote>he had a number of wigs made, dyed to suit the appearance of persons differing widely in age, and kept constantly changing them, and at the same time also dressing in a style suited to the wig, so that not only those who had seen him but for a moment, but even his familiars, found difficulty in recognizing him</quote> (iii. xxxviii, Paton's Trans.). Livy prefers ambiguity to the use of a technical or undignified word.</note> he protected himself against their plots by the uncertainty which this gave rise to.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Still, the fear of such plots was another reason for quitting his winter quarters early.</p> <p>About the same time, on the Ides of March, Gnaeus Servilius entered on his consulship at Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On his then referring the state of the nation to the senate for discussion, their anger at Gaius Flaminius <pb id="p.201"/>was renewed. They had chosen two consuls, they said,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> but had only one; for what proper authority or right of auspices did Flaminius possess?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Magistrates, they urged, carried with them this prerogative when they set out from home &mdash;from their own and the nation's hearth &mdash;after celebrating the Latin Festival, sacrificing on the Alban Mount and duly offering up their vows on the Capitol;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but a private citizen could neither take the auspices with him, nor, if he had left Rome without them, receive them new from the beginning on foreign soil.<note>The enemies of Flaminius argued that he was not, in fact, a consul, for, though elected to that office, he had not been duly inaugurated in Rome, but had left the City before taking the auspices. It would not be possible for him to repair the omission in camp, since even a consul who had set out after receiving the auspices was required, in case it was afterwards discovered that there had been some flaw in them, to return to Rome and renew them there, and it followed, a <hi rend="italics">fortiori,</hi> that no one could take them in the first instance- <hi rend="italics">nova atque integra-anywhere</hi> else.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Men's fears were augmented by the prodigies reported simultaneously from many places: that in Sicily the javelins of several soldiers had taken fire, and that in Sardinia, as a horseman was making the round of the night-watch, the same thing had happened to the truncheon which he held in his hand; that many fires had blazed up on the shore; that two shields had sweated blood; that certain soldiers had been struck with lightning; that the sun's disk had seemed to be contracted;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that glowing stones had fallen from the sky at Praeneste; that at Arpi bucklers had appeared in the sky and the sun had seemed to be fighting with the moon; that at Capena two moons had risen in the daytime;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that the waters of Caere had flowed mixed with blood, and that bloodstains had appeared in the water that trickled from the spring of Hercules itself; that at Antium, when some men were reaping, bloody ears of corn had fallen into their basket; that at Falerii the sky had seemed to be rent as it were with a great fissure; and through the opening a bright light had shone;
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and that lots<note>See note on p. 185.</note> had shrunk <pb id="p.203"/>and that one had fallen out without being touched,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> on which was written, <quote><hi rend="italics">Mavors</hi><note>The archaic form of Mars.</note> brandishes his spear;</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that in Rome, about the same time, the statue of Mars on the Appian Way and the images of the wolves had sweated; that at Capua there had been the appearance of a sky on fire and of a moon that fell in the midst of a shower of rain.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Afterwards less memorable prodigies were also given credence: that certain folk had found their goats to have got woolly fleeces; that a hen had changed into a cock and a cock into a hen.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>When the consul had laid these reports before the senate exactly as they had come to him and had introduced into the House the men who vouched for their truth, he consulted the Fathers regarding their religious import.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It was voted that these prodigies should be expiated, in part with greater, in part with lesser victims, and that a supplication should be held for three days at all the couches of the gods;
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> as for the rest, when the decemvirs should have inspected the Books, such rites were to be observed as they should declare, in accordance with the sacred verses,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Greek hexameters of the Sibylline Books, of which the <hi rend="italics">decemviri sacris faciundis</hi> were custodians and interpreters.</note> to be pleasing to the gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Being so admonished by the decemvirs, they decreed that the first gift should be made to Jupiter, a golden thunderbolt weighing fifty pounds; and that Juno and Minerva should be given offerings of silver;
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> that Juno Regina on the Aventine and Juno Sospita at Lanuvium should receive a sacrifice of greater victims, and that the matrons, each contributing as much as she could afford, should make up a sum of money and carry it as a gift to Juno Regina on the Aventine and there celebrate a <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi><note>See note on p. 186.</note> ; and that even the very freed-women <pb id="p.205"/>should contribute money, in proportion to their<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> abilities, for an offering to Feronia.<note>Feronia was an old Etruscan deity, whose cult was brought to Rome from Capena. A goddess of springs and groves, she was also the traditional patroness of freedwomen.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> These measures being taken, the decemvirs sacrificed at Ardea in the market-place with the greater victims. Finally-the month was now December &mdash;victims were slain at the temple of Saturn in Rome and a <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> was ordered-this time senators administered the rite<note>It was usually carried out by the decemvirs mentioned in &sect; 7.</note> &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> a public feast, and throughout the City for a day and a night <quote>Saturnalia</quote> was cried, and the people were bidden to keep that day as a holiday and observe it in perpetuity.<note>The Saturnalia had been established as an annual festival in connexion with the dedication of the temple of Saturn on December 19th, <date value="-497">497 B.C.</date> (I. xxi 2). Now the public feast was added to the former rites, and in course of time the festival was prolonged for several days.</note></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consul was occupied at Rome in appeasing the gods and levying troops, Hannibal, who had left his winter quarters, heard that Flaminius, the other consul, had already arrived at Arretium;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and so, though another route, longer, to be sure, but less difficult, was pointed out to him, he took the shorter, though the marshes, which the river Arno had lately flooded to an unusual extent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He ordered the Spaniards and the Africans and all the flower of his veteran army, taking their own baggage with them so as not to want the necessities of life wherever they might be forced to halt, to march in the van; the Gauls to follow them and form the centre of the column; and the cavalry to fall in behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mago and the Numidian light horse were to bring up the rear, their principal duty being to keep the Gauls in order, in case they should weary of the long and <pb id="p.207"/>painful march &mdash;for the race is ill adapted to such<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> hardships &mdash;and attempt to steal away or refuse to go forward.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Those in front only asked that their guides lead on before. Through deep and well-nigh bottomless quagmires left by the flood, almost engulfed in the mud into which they plunged, they nevertheless followed on after their standards.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the Gauls could neither keep from falling when they slipped, nor regain their footing, once they had plunged into a hole; the flesh was neither sustained by the spirit nor the spirit by hope. Some could hardly drag their tired limbs along; others, their courage yielding once for all to their weariness, dropped down and died amongst the baggage-animals, for these too were lying all about.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What distressed them most of all was the want of sleep, which they had now endured for four days and three nights.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And since everything was under water and they could find no dry spot on which to stretch their weary bodies, they would pile their packs in the flood and lie down on these;

			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Hannibal himself, whose eyes were suffering in the first place from the trying spring weather, alternating betwixt hot and cold, rode upon the sole surviving elephant, that he might be higher above the water.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But lack of sleep, damp nights, and the air of the marshes affected his head, and since he had neither place nor time for employing remedies, he lost the sight of one of his eyes.</p> <pb id="p.209"/><p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many men and beasts had perished miserably,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> when at last he got out from the marshes, and pitching his camp on the first dry ground available, ascertained from scouts whom he had sent on ahead that the Roman army lay around the walls of Arretium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then went to work with all possible diligence to learn the plans and temper of the consul, the lie of the land and the roads, his resources for provisioning the army &mdash;everything, in short, which it was important to find out.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The district was one of the most fertile in Italy, for the Etruscan plains between Faesulae and Arretium abound in corn and flocks and all sorts of provisions. The consul had been proud and headstrong since his former consulship,<note>When, in defiance of the senate, he had refused to abdicate his command because of an alleged flaw in his election, and had conquered the Insubres and triumphed in virtue of a popular decree (<date value="-223">223 B.C.</date>). See Summary of Book XIX, and xxi. Ixiii. 2.</note> and lacked all proper reverence, not only for the laws and for the senate's majesty, but even for the gods.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This native rashness had been nourished by the success which Fortune had bestowed on him in political and military enterprises.<note>Livy has in mind the passage of an agrarian law in <date value="-232">232 B.C.</date>, the continuation of the Via Flaminia to Ariminum, the erection of the Circus Flaminius, and the victory over the Insubres.</note> It was therefore sufficiently apparent that, seeking no counsel, either divine or human, he would manage everything with recklessness and headlong haste; but to make him incline the more towards his characteristic faults, the Phoenician planned to provoke and exasperate him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Leaving the enemy therefore on his left,<note>See Map 4.</note> and looking out for an
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> opportunity to ambush him, he proceeded to lay waste the heart of Etruria and exhibited to the consul from afar all the havoc that fire and sword could possibly effect.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Flaminius, even had his enemy sat still, was not <pb id="p.211"/>the man to have sat still himself; but now, when<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> he saw the farms of the allies being harried and pillaged almost under his own eyes, he felt it as a personal disgrace that the Phoenician should be roaming through the midst of Italy, and marching, with no one to dispute his passage, to assault the very walls of Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In the council of war the rest were all for safe in preference to showy measures: he should wait, they said, for his colleague to come up, in order that they might unite their forces and conduct the war with a common policy and resolution;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> meantime, he should employ his cavalry and skirmishers to check the enemy's widespread, unrestricted pillaging.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Enraged by this advice, Flaminius flung out of the council, and having given the signal at once for marching and for fighting, exclaimed, <quote>Ay, truly! Let us sit still under the walls of Arretium, for here are our native city and our household gods; let Hannibal slip through our fingers and ravage Italy, and, laying waste and burning everything, march clear to Rome; and let us not move from this spot, till the Fathers, as once they summoned Camillus from Veii, shall summon Gaius Flaminius from Arretium.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Uttering these scornful words he bade pluck up the standards quickly, and vaulted upon his horse, when suddenly the charger stumbled, and unseating the consul threw him over his head. The dismay which this occasioned in all who were present,
				<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> as an evil omen for beginning the campaign, was intensified on its being reported that, although the standard-bearer was exerting all his might, the standard could not be pulled up.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Rounding upon <pb id="p.213"/>the messenger the consul cried, <quote>Do you bring me<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> a dispatch too from the senate, forbidding me to fight? Go, tell them to <hi rend="italics">dig</hi> the standard out, if their hands are too numb with fear to <hi rend="italics">pull</hi> it up!</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The column then began to advance, though the higher officers, besides disapproving of the consul's plan, were terrified by the double prodigy. The soldiers, most of them, rejoiced in the temerity of their commander: their hopes ran high: the grounds for hoping they did not scrutinize.</p> <p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal laid waste the land between the city of Cortona and Lake Trasumennus with every circumstance of cruelty known to war, in order the more to whet his enemy's anger and prompt him to avenge the sufferings of his allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And now he had reached a spot designed by nature for an ambuscade, where Trasumennus approaches closest to the mountains of Cortona. Between them is nothing but a very narrow track, as though room had been left expressly for this purpose; the ground then widens into a little plain; beyond this the hills rise steeply.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At this point he laid out a camp in the open, for himself and his African and Spanish troops only; the Baliares and the rest of his light-armed forces he led round behind the mountains; the cavalry he stationed near the entrance to the defile, where some hillocks formed a convenient screen for them, so that when the Romans should have entered the pass, they might block the road, and trap the entire army between the lake and the mountains.</p> <p>Flaminius had reached the lake at sunset; the next morning, without reconnoitring, and scarcely waiting for broad daylight, he passed through the <pb id="p.215"/>defile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As the column began to spread out on the<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> more open ground, they caught sight of those enemies only who were right in front of them; the ambush in their rear and that above them they failed to perceive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Phoenician had now gained his object, the Romans were hemmed in between the mountains and the lake and their escape cut off by his own troops, when he made the signal for all his forces to attack at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As they charged down, each at the nearest point, their onset was all the more sudden and unforeseen inasmuch as the mist from the lake lay less thickly on the heights than on the plain, and the attacking columns had been clearly visible to one another from the various hills and had therefore delivered their charge at more nearly the same instant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From the shouting that arose on every side the Romans learned, before they could clearly see, that they were surrounded; and they were already engaged on their front and flank before they could properly form up or get out their arms and draw their swords.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amidst the general consternation the consul himself displayed &mdash;if allowance be made for the terrifying circumstances &mdash;considerable coolness.<note>Polybius (III. lxxxiv. 6) says that Flaminius was in <quote>the utmost dismay and dejection</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">.</foreign>)Livy's description of the battle agrees in the main with that of Polybius; the praise of Flaminius may perhaps be derived from Coelius Antipater. See J. Janssen in <hi rend="italics">Mnemosyne,</hi> 54 (1926), 189-194.</note> He brought such order as time and place permitted out of the confusion in the ranks, where the men were all turning different ways to face the various shouts; and wherever he could go and make himself heard, he tried to encourage them and bade them stand and fight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their position, he said, was one from which vows and supplications to the gods could not extricate them, but only their own brave exertions: it was the sword that opened a way through embattled enemies, and the less men <pb id="p.217"/>feared, the less, in general, was their danger.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> the din and confusion were so great that neither advice nor orders could be heard, and so far were the men from knowing their proper standards companies and places, that they had hardly enough spirit to arm and prepare themselves to fight, and some were borne down while more encumbered than protected by their armour.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Indeed the fog was so thick that ears were of more use than eyes, and the groans of the wounded, the sound of blows on body or armour and the mingled shouts and screams of assailants and assailed made them turn and gaze, now this way and now that.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some, as they sought to escape, were swept into a crowd of combatants and held there; others, trying to get back into the fight, were turned aside by a throng of fugitives.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When attempts to break through had resulted everywhere in failure and they found themselves shut in on the flanks by the mountains and the lake, and in front and rear by the enemy; when it became apparent that their only hope of safety lay in their right arms and their swords; then every man became his own commander and urged himself to action, and the battle began all over again.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was no ordered battle, with the troops marshalled in triple line, nor did the vanguard fight before the standards and the rest of the army behind them, neither did each soldier keep to his proper legion cohort and maniple:
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> it was chance that grouped them, and every man's own valour assigned him his post in van or rear; and such was the frenzy of their eagerness and so absorbed were they in fighting, that an earthquake, violent enough to overthrow large portions of many of the towns of <pb id="p.219"/>Italy, turn swift streams from their courses, carry<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> the sea up into rivers, and bring down mountains with great landslides, was not even felt by any of the combatants.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The conflict lasted for about three hours, and was bitterly contested at every point; but nowhere did it rage so fiercely as about the consul.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was attended by the bravest of his soldiers and stoutly lent a hand himself, wherever he saw the Romans hard pressed and in dire straits.
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His arms made him conspicuous, and the enemy attacked and his own people defended him with the greatest fury, until an Insubrian horseman, named Ducarius, who recognized the consul also by his face, cried out to his countrymen, <quote>Behold the man who massacred our legions and laid waste our fields and our city! Now will I offer him up as a sacrifice to the shades of our fellow citizens so foully slain!</quote>
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then clapping spurs to his horse, he dashed through the very thick of his enemies, and first cutting down the armour-bearer, who had thrown himself in the way of his onset, transfixed the consul with his spear, but could not despoil him, for the veterans<note>The <hi rend="italics">triarii</hi> were, properly speaking, the soldiers of the third line. These would be veterans, and Livy uses the word in that general sense here. As he has told us (chap. v. &sect; 7), the army had no time to form into the usual three lines (<hi rend="italics">hastati, principes, triarii).</hi></note> interposed their shields and kept him off.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A great part of the Romans now began to run; neither lake nor mountains could any longer check the panic; defiles and precipices were all alike to them, as they rushed blindly to escape, and arms and men came down pell-mell together.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Many, having no room to flee, waded out into the shallow water at the margin of the lake, and kept on till only their heads and shoulders were above the <pb id="p.221"/>surface.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some were driven by their unreasoning<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> panic even to attempt escape by swimming; but this was an endless, desperate undertaking, and either their hearts failed them and they sank in the deep water, or else, exhausted to no purpose, they struggled back with difficulty to the shoals, and were cut down on every hand by the horsemen, who rode into the water after them.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Some six thousand of those in the van made a valiant thrust through the enemy that barred their way, and got out of the defile without knowing anything of what was going on behind them. Taking up their stand on some rising ground, whence they could only hear the shouting and the clash of arms, they could neither know nor make out, for the murk, which way the victory was going.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was not until the battle was decided, that the mist dissolved with the growing heat of the sun and revealed the day, when the clear light on hill and plain showed that all was lost and the Roman army shamefully discomfited.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And so, lest they should be seen afar and the enemy's cavalry be sent against them, they hurriedly pulled up their standards and marched off as fast as they could go.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the following day, when besides their other misfortunes they were threatened also with the extremity of hunger, Maharbal &mdash;who with all the cavalry had overtaken them in the night &mdash;pledged his word that if they delivered up their arms, he would let them go, with a single garment each, and they surrendered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This pledge Hannibal observed with true Punic reverence and threw them all into chains.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the famous battle of Trasumennus, <pb id="p.223"/>a disaster memorable as few others have been in<note type="margin">B.C.217</note> Roman history.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fifteen thousand Romans were killed on the field; ten thousand, scattered in flight over all Etruria, made their way by different roads to the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Two thousand five hundred of the enemy fell in the battle and many perished subsequently of their wounds. Some writers multiply the losses on both sides: I myself, besides that I would not idly exaggerate anything &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> vice to which historians are in general all too prone &mdash;have taken Fabius,<note>Fabius Pictor, who wrote annals in Greek, was used by Polybius, as well as by Livy.</note> who lived at the time of this war, as my authority, in preference to any other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hannibal dismissed scot-free the prisoners of the Latin name and gave the Romans into captivity. Having issued orders that the bodies of his own dead should be sorted out from the heaps of their enemies and buried, he would have given the body of Flaminius burial also, but though he-caused it to be searched for with great diligence, he could not find it.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>At Rome the first tidings of this defeat brought the citizens into the Forum in a frightened and tumultuous throng, while the matrons wandered about the streets and demanded of all they met what sudden disaster had been reported and how it was going with the army.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And when the crowd, like some vast public assembly, turned to the Comitium and the senate-house and called for the magistrates, at last, as the sun was almost going down, Marcus Pomponius, the praetor, said, <quote><hi rend="italics">A</hi> great battle has been fought, and we were beaten.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And although they learned nothing more definite from him, still they picked up a rumour here and a rumour there, and returning to their homes brought word that the <pb id="p.225"/>consul and a great part of his soldiers had been<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> slain:
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that only a few survived, either dispersed as fugitives throughout Etruria or taken prisoners by the enemy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The vicissitudes of the defeated army were no more various than the apprehensions which preyed upon the minds of those whose relatives had served under Gaius Flaminius, the consul. They were ignorant of how those dear to each of them were faring, nor did anyone really know what to hope or fear.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On the next and on several succeeding days the City gates were thronged with a crowd in which the women almost outnumbered the men, waiting for some kinsman, or for news of him. Surrounding anybody who came along, they plied him with questions, nor could they tear themselves away &mdash;especially from those they were acquainted with &mdash;until they had enquired into every detail.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Very different were the expressions you would have noted in their countenances, according as the tidings they received were glad or sorrowful, when they moved away from their informants and returned to their homes, surrounded by friends, congratulating or consoling them.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The women especially exhibited extremes of joy and grief; one, on suddenly meeting her son safe and sound at the very gate, expired, they say, in his embrace; another, whose son had been falsely reported dead, sat sorrowing at home, and no sooner beheld him entering the house, than she died of excessive joy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For some days the praetors kept the senate in session in the Curia, from sunrise until sunset, deliberating with what possible commander or what forces they could withstand the victorious Phoenicians.</p> <pb id="p.227"/><p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They had not yet fully determined what to<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> do, when, lo! another disaster was reported, for which they were quite unprepared. Four thousand horse under the propraetor Gaius Centenius had been sent by the Consul Servilius to join his colleague; but on hearing of the battle at Trasumennus they had turned aside into Umbria, and had there fallen into the hands of Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The news of this affair affected people variously: some, whose thoughts were taken up with a greater sorrow, regarded this fresh loss of the cavalry as trivial in comparison with their former losses;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> others refused to judge of the misfortune as an isolated fact, but held that, just as when a man was sick, any disorder, however slight, was felt more than a worse one would be
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> by a healthy man, so now, when the state was sick and suffering, any untoward occurrence should be gauged not by its intrinsic importance but by the enfeebled condition of the commonwealth, which could endure no aggravation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And so the citizens had recourse to a remedy that had now for a long time neither been employed nor needed &mdash;the creation of a dictator. And because the consul, who alone was supposed to possess the power to nominate one, was absent, and because it was no easy matter, when Italy was beset with Punic arms, to get a courier or a letter through to him, they did what had never been done until that day, and created a dictator by popular election.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their choice fell on Quintus Fabius Maximus, and Marcus Minucius Rufus they made master of the horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To them the senate entrusted the task of strengthening the walls and towers of the City, of disposing its defences as to them seemed good, and <pb id="p.229"/>of breaking down the bridges over the rivers:<note>The Anio and the Tiber.</note> <note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> they would have to fight for their City and their homes, since they had not been able to save Italy.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal marched straight on through Umbria as far as Spoletium.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But when, after systematically ravaging the country, he attempted to storm the town, he was repulsed with heavy losses; and conjecturing from the strength of a single colony which he had unsuccessfully attacked how vast an undertaking the City of Rome would be, he turned aside into the Picentine territory, a land
						<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> not only abounding in all kinds of produce, but filled with livestock, which his greedy and impoverished men gathered in from far and wide.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He remained in camp there for some days, while his soldiers recovered from the marches they had made in wintry weather and through swamps, and from the battle, which, however successful its outcome, had been no light or easy adventure.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After allowing sufficient rest to his soldiers, who delighted more in booty and rapine than in quiet and repose, he resumed his march and laid waste the Praetutian and Hadrian fields, and after these the lands of the Marsi, Marrucini and Paeligni, and the nearest part of Apulia, in the vicinity of Arpi and Luceria.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Gnaeus Servilius, the consul, had engaged in skirmishes with the Gauls and had taken one insignificant town by assault, when he learned of the destruction of his colleague and the army, and being now alarmed for the safety of the capital, lest he should be absent in the very crisis of its peril, set out for Rome.<note>Servilius, on marching south with his consular army, left in northern Italy the forces originally destined to hold the Gauls in check.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Quintus Fabius Maximus, dictator now for the <pb id="p.231"/>second time,<note>Fabius had been named dictator (probably in one of the years 221 to 219), to preside over the elections, but there had been no military dictator since Aulus Atilius Calatinus in 249.</note> convened the senate on the day he<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> entered upon his office. Taking up first the question of religion, he convinced the Fathers that the consul Flaminius had erred more through his neglect of the ceremonies and the auspices than through his recklessness and ignorance;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and asserting that they ought to enquire of the gods themselves how the displeasure of the gods might be appeased, prevailed with them to do what is rarely done except when dreadful prodigies have been announced, and order the decemvirs to consult the Sibylline books.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the decemvirs had inspected the Books of Fate, they reported to the Fathers that the vow which had been made to Mars on account of this war<note>This vow is not mentioned at XXI. xvii. 4 or lxii. 10.</note> had not been duly performed, and must be performed afresh and on an ampler scale;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that great games must be vowed to Jupiter, and temples to Venus Erycina and to Mens<note>The Romans prayed to Mens (or Mens Bona) for good sense and modesty (<foreign lang="greek">,</foreign>)qualities which had been conspicuously lacking in the conduct of Flaminius. The context here (Venus of Eryx, Sibylline books), together with coins of Paestum representing a goddess shown by the legend to be Bona Mens, and many inscriptions from Magna Graecia attesting the existence of priestly officials called <hi rend="italics">magistri Mentis Bonae,</hi> points clearly to a Greek origin for the cult, which is several times alluded to by Roman authors(Cicero, Propertius, Ovid, Persius). The two shrines stood close together on the Capitol (xxx. xxx. 16). See Wissowa, p. 313 f.</note> ; and finally that a supplication and <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> must be celebrated in honour of the gods, and a Sacred Spring be vowed, if they proved victorious and the state remained as it had been before the outbreak of hostilities.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The senate, seeing that Fabius would be occupied with the conduct of the war, commanded Marcus Aemilius the praetor, as the college of pontifices had recommended, to see that all these measures were promptly put into effect.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the senate had passed these resolutions, the praetor consulted the college, and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, the Pontifex Maximus, gave his opinion that first of all a popular vote must <pb id="p.233"/>be taken about the Sacred Spring; for it could<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> not be vowed without the authorization of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The question was put to them in this form: <quote>Do you will and so order that these things be done in the manner following? If the Republic of the Roman People, the Quirites, shall be preserved for the next five years<note>The <hi rend="italics">ver sacrum</hi> was not actually celebrated until <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date>, and a flaw in the ceremonies necessitated a repetition in the following year (xxxiv. lxiv. 1-3).</note> &mdash;as I would wish it preserved &mdash;in
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> these wars, to wit, the war of the Roman People with the People of Carthage and the wars with the Gauls on this side of the Alps, let the Roman People, the Quirites, offer up in indefeasible sacrifice to Jupiter what the spring shall have produced of swine, sheep, goats and cattle &mdash;which shall not have been consecrated to some other deity &mdash;beginning with the day which the senate and the People shall have designated.<note>The period appointed was March 1st to April 30th (<hi rend="italics">ibid.).</hi></note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Let him who shall make a sacrifice do so at such time and by such rite as shall seem good to him; in what manner soever he does it, let it be accounted duly done.

			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>For the same cause great games were vowed, to cost three hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three and a third bronze asses,<note>These were probably libral <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> (of a pound each) and not the reduced <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of one <hi rend="italics">uncia</hi> (ounce) each which Pliny says were coined this year (<hi rend="italics">Q.

When the vows had been duly pronounced, a supplication was decreed, and was performed not only by the urban population, with their wives and children, but by such country folk besides, as, having some fortune of their own, were beginning to feel concern for
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Commonwealth. A <hi rend="italics">lectisternium</hi> was then celebrated during three days under the supervision of the decemvirs who had charge of sacrifices. Six couches were displayed: one for Jupiter and Juno, a second for Neptune and Minerva, a third for Mars and Venus, a fourth for Apollo and Diana, a fifth for Vulcan and Vesta, a sixth for Mercury
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and Ceres.<note>The twelve great Olympian gods, arranged in pairs as with the Greeks, here make their appearance together for the first time in Roman history.</note> The temples were then vowed &mdash;that to Venus Erycina by Quintus Fabius Maximus the dictator, because the Books of Fate had given out that he whose authority in the state was paramount should make the vow; and the temple to Mens by the praetor Titus Otacilius.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Religious duties being thus acquitted, the <pb id="p.237"/>dictator turned to affairs of war and state, and<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> called upon the senate to decide with what and how many legions the victorious enemy should be faced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was voted that he should take over the army of Gnaeus Servilius, the consul; that he should enroll, besides, from the citizens and the allies, as many horsemen and foot-soldiers as seemed good to him; and with regard to all other questions should act as he deemed conducive to the welfare of the state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Fabius announced that he should add two legions to the army that Servilius had commanded. These legions he enlisted, through his master of the horse, and commanded them to assemble at Tibur on a given day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He also issued an edict that those who dwelt in unfortified towns and hamlets should remove to places of safety; and that all the inhabitants of that district where Hannibal was likely to be marching should abandon their farms, first burning the buildings and destroying the crops, that there might be no supplies for him of any kind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He himself went out by the Flaminian way to meet the consul and his army, and when, close to the Tiber near Ocriculum, he came in sight of the column and saw the consul riding towards him at the head of his cavalry, he dispatched an orderly to bid the consul appear before the dictator without lictors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul obeyed, and their meeting vividly impressed the greatness of the dictatorship on citizens and allies, who had now, with the lapse of years, almost forgotten that supreme authority. Just then a dispatch was delivered from the City, announcing that ships of burden with supplies from Ostia for the army in Spain had been captured by the Punic <pb id="p.239"/>fleet off the port of Cosa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly, the consul<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> was ordered to set out at once for Ostia and, manning such ships as were at Rome or Ostia with soldiers and naval allies,<note>The <hi rend="italics">socii navales</hi> served as rowers.</note> to pursue the enemy's fleet and protect the coasts of Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A vast number of men had been enrolled in Rome; even freedmen who had children and were of military age had taken the oath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Of this urban levy those who were less than thirty-five years old were sent on board the ships; the others were left to garrison the City.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The dictator, after taking over the consul's army from Fulvius Flaccus, his lieutenant, marched through the Sabine country to Tibur, where he had given the new levies notice to assemble on a certain day.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From Tibur he marched to Praeneste, and striking across the country came out into the Latin Way, and then, reconnoitring the roads with the utmost circumspection, advanced in the direction of the enemy, though resolved nowhere to commit himself to fortune, except in so far as necessity might compel him.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On the day when Fabius first encamped in sight of the enemy, not far from Arpi, the Phoenician promptly led out his forces into line and offered battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when he perceived that all was quiet on the other side, and could hear no sounds of commotion in their camp, he went back to his quarters, exclaiming scornfully that the boasted martial spirit of the Romans was broken at last, that the war was fought and won, that they had openly bade valour and renown farewell;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but in the silence of his heart he was troubled by the thought that he would have a general to deal with by no means <pb id="p.241"/>like Flaminius or Sempronius, since the Romans,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> schooled by their misfortunes, had now at last sought out a leader to match Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The prudence of the dictator was indeed an immediate source of worry to him, but, possessing as yet no experience of his firmness, he began to provoke and try his temper by frequent shifting of his camp and by pillaging the lands of the allies before his very eyes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Now he would march off rapidly and disappear; and now would lie in wait at some turn of the road, in hopes to cut the Romans off when they had descended on to level ground.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Fabius kept leading his troops along the heights, at a moderate distance from the enemy, so as neither to lose touch nor yet come to blows with him. He would keep his men in camp, except for such necessary duties as obliged their leaving it; when they went out for wood and fodder, they were neither few in number nor dispersed;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> a corps of cavalry and skirmishers drawn up and ready for sudden onsets made everything safe for his own men and dangerous for the scattered pillagers of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He refused to stake all on a general engagement, and yet by means of little skirmishes, undertaken from a safe position and with a place of refuge close at hand, he at length accustomed his soldiers, disheartened by their former defeats, to be less diffident of their own courage and good fortune.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>But even Hannibal was not more vexed by these prudent measures than was the master of the horse, who was only withheld from plunging the nation into ruin by his subordinate authority. Violent and hasty in his opinions and of unbridled tongue, he <pb id="p.243"/>spoke of Fabius &mdash;at first in the hearing of a few, but<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> after a time quite openly to everybody &mdash;not
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> as deliberate but as slothful, not as cautious but as timid, inventing faults that neighboured on his virtues; and exalted himself by disparaging his superior &mdash;an infamous practice, which has grown in favour from the all too great prosperity of many who have followed it.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, leaving the Hirpini, crossed over into Samnium,<note>By Samnium Livy here means the territory of the Caudini lying to the north of the Hirpini. Both tribes, as well as the Frentani and the Pentri, had belonged to the old Samnite League.</note> laid waste the lands of Beneventum, and captured the city of Telesia. He even deliberately sought to vex the Roman general, for he hoped that by so often insulting and distressing his allies he might anger him and induce him to come down and fight on equal terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Amongst the numerous allies of Italian stock who had been made prisoners by Hannibal at Trasumennus and afterwards released were three Campanian knights, whom he had even then enticed with gifts and promises to procure for him the goodwill of their countrymen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These men now informed him that if he would bring his army into Campania the opportunity would be afforded him of taking Capua. It was a weighty undertaking for such men to enter into, and Hannibal hesitated, now trusting and again distrusting them, but in the end they persuaded him to march from Samnium into Campania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He warned them again and again to confirm their words with deeds, and dismissed them with orders to come back to him with more people, including some of their leading men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then ordered his guide to conduct him to the territory of Casinum, for he had been told by those who knew the country that if he occupied that pass he could keep the Romans from marching to the aid of their <pb id="p.245"/>allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the difficulty experienced by<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> Carthaginians in pronouncing Latin names caused the guide to understand <hi rend="italics">Casilinum</hi> instead of <hi rend="italics">Casinum;</hi> and quitting the proper road he led him down through the districts of Allifae, Caiatia and Cales into the Plain of Stella.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There Hannibal, looking round on the mountains and rivers that enclosed the plain, called up the guide and asked him where in the world he was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And only when the guide had answered that he should lodge that night in Casilinum, did he perceive at last how the man had blundered, and that Casinum lay far off in another direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whereupon he scourged the guide, and, to terrify the others, crucified him, and going into camp behind entrenchments, dispatched Maharbal with the cavalry to ravage the Falernian countryside. The devastation extended even to the Baths of Sinuessa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Numidians wrought great havoc and spread dismay and terror more widely still;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> yet this terror, even though all the country blazed with war, did not cause the allies to waver in their loyalty, assuredly because the rule under which they were governed was just and temperate, nor did they refuse &mdash;and that is the only guarantee of loyalty &mdash;to yield obedience to their betters.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But when Hannibal had encamped by the river Volturnus, and the fairest district in all Italy was in flames, and the smoke went curling up from burning farm-houses, while Fabius continued to march along the ridges of Mount Massicus, there was almost a new outburst of sedition.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the disaffected had kept quiet for several days, believing that the army, which had been moving more rapidly than usual, was hastening to preserve Campania <pb id="p.247"/>from devastation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when they reached the<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> farthest extremity<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the western extremity.</note> of the range, and saw the enemy down below them setting fire to the farms of the Falernian district and the colony of Sinuessa, and yet no word was uttered about fighting, Minucius cried, <quote>Are we come here as to a spectacle, that we may gratify our eyes with the slaughter of our friends and the burning of their homes?
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If nothing else can awaken us to a sense of shame, do we feel none when we behold these fellow citizens of ours whom our fathers sent as colonists to Sinuessa to secure this frontier from the Samnite enemy?
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is not our Samnite neighbours who are wasting it now, but Phoenician invaders, who have been suffered to come all this way, from the farthest, limits of the world, by our delays and slothfulness. So greatly, alas!
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> do we degenerate from our fathers that we behold overrun with enemies and in the possession of Numidians and Moors that coast past which <hi rend="italics">they</hi> could not see the Punic navies cruising without feeling that their empire was disgraced.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When, a little while ago, Saguntum was besieged, we appealed indignantly, not to men only, but to treaties and to the gods; but now that Hannibal is scaling the walls of a Roman colony, we look on with indifference.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The smoke from burning farm-houses and fields comes into our eyes and mouths; our ears are ringing with the lamentations of our allies, who invoke our aid more often than that of Heaven; and here we are, leading our army &mdash;like a flock of sheep &mdash;through summer pastures and by devious mountain trails, and hiding ourselves in clouds and forests.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If Marcus Furius had tried to recover Rome from the Gauls by wandering thus over <pb id="p.249"/>mountain heights and passes, even as this new<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> Camillus, this wonderful dictator to whom we have turned in our distress, is planning to recover Italy from Hannibal, the Gauls would be in Rome to-day; and I fear that if we linger thus, our fathers will so often have preserved it only for Hannibal and the Phoenicians.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But that brave man and true Roman, on the day that the news was brought to Veii of his being appointed dictator, by command of the people in pursuance of a senatorial resolution &mdash;though
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Janiculum was high enough for him to have sat there and enjoyed a prospect of the enemy &mdash;came down into the plain, and on that very day, in the midst of the City &mdash;where now the Gallic Pyres<note>A place in Rome where the Gauls &mdash;so tradition said &mdash; had piled up and turned the bodies of those who died of a pestilence which had broken out among them while they were beleaguering the Capitol (v. xlviii. 3).</note> are &mdash;and again on the following day, this side of Gabii, cut the legions of the Gauls to
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> pieces. What! When, many years later, at the Caudine Forks, our Samnite foe had sent us under the yoke,<note>For the story of this famous episode see IX. i-xv.</note> was it, pray, by scouring the heights of Samnium, or by pressing Luceria hard and laying siege to it, and by challenging the victorious enemy, that Lucius Papirius Cursor struck off the yoke from Roman necks and imposed it on the

What else was it than swiftness that gave the victory, not long since,<note>The victory of Lutatius off the Aegatian Islands had been won twenty-four years before (Summary of Book xx ).</note> to Gaius Lutatius, who bore down upon the enemy's fleet, laden deep with stores and hampered with its own munitions and equipment, on the day after he
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> sighted it? It is folly to think that a war can be won by sitting still or making vows; you must arm and go down into the field, and do battle, man to man! Rome's greatness has come from daring and <pb id="p.251"/>from doing; not from these sluggish policies that<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> timid folk
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> term cautious.</quote> When Minucius held forth in this fashion, like a general encouraging his troops, a crowd of tribunes and Roman knights would gather round him, and his fiery words even reached the ears of the common soldiers; and if the election of their general had rested with the men, they showed unmistakably that Minucius would have been preferred to Fabius.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But Fabius, watching his own men no less carefully than the enemy, proved first that it was not in <hi rend="italics">them</hi> to overcome his resolution. Though he knew full well that his policy of waiting was in bad repute, not only in his camp but by this time in Rome as well, he held doggedly to the same line of conduct and dragged out the remainder of the summer;
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> so that Hannibal, disappointed in his hopes of the battle which he had made every effort to bring on, was now looking round for a place to winter in; for the country where he was, though a land of plenty for the time being, could not support him permanently, being taken up with orchards and vineyards, and planted everywhere with agreeable rather than necessary fruits.
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Fabius was informed of this by his scouts. Feeling certain that Hannibal would leave the Falernian district, by the same passes through which he had entered it, he posted a fair-sized garrison on Mount Callicula and another in Casilinum.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> (The river Volturnus runs through this town, which marks the boundary between the Falernian district and Campania). The main army he led back by the same ridges, after sending on Lucius Hostilius Mancinus with four hundred cavalry of the allies to reconnoitre.
								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <pb id="p.253"/>Mancinus was one of the crowd of young officers<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> who often listened to the blustering speeches of the master of the horse. He advanced at first as if making a reconnaissance, with the object of observing the enemy from a safe distance.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But when he saw the Numidians roaming about through the villages, and had even seized the opportunity to cut off a few of them, his heart was suddenly filled with the lust of combat, and he forgot the instructions
								<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> of the dictator, who had bade him proceed as far as was compatible with safety, and retire before the enemy should see him.
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Numidians, first one troop and then another, by charging and then retreating, drew him on almost to their very camp and wore out his horses and his men. Then Carthalo, the commander of all the enemy's cavalry, swooped down upon the Romans at a gallop, and routing them before he had got within a javelin-throw, pursued them as they fled for nearly five miles at one stretch.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As soon as Mancinus perceived that the enemy would not give over the pursuit, and that he could not hope
								<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> to get away, he rallied his men and led them back into the fight, though overmatched in every particular.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly, he himself and the best of his troopers were surrounded and slain, and the rest in a scattered flight made their way first to Cales, and thence, by well-nigh impassable trails, to the dictator.</p> <p>It happened that on that day Minucius had joined Fabius. He had been sent to secure the pass which contracts above Tarracina into a narrow gorge close to the sea,<note>This was the pass of Lautulae, mentioned at VII. xxxix. 7.</note> to prevent the Phoenician from taking <pb id="p.255"/>the Appian Way from Sinuessa into Roman territory.<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note>
									<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Combining their forces, the dictator and the master of the horse camped on the road where Hannibal was going to march.</p> <p>
										<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
										<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The enemy was two miles away. Next day the Phoenicians were on the march, filling the road which lay between the two camps.
										<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans had formed up just under their rampart and had clearly the advantage of position.<note>Polybius (III. xcii. 11) says that Fabius had encamped <quote>on a hill, in front of the pass and overlooking it.</quote></note> None the less did Hannibal advance with his light infantry and cavalry, to provoke them into fighting. At one point after another the Phoenicians attacked, dashing up and then retreating. The Roman line stood firm.
										<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The battle was long drawn out and was more to the liking of the dictator than of Hannibal. Two hundred fell on the Roman side, and eight hundred of the enemy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hannibal now seemed to be hemmed in, the road to Casilinum being blocked. The Romans had Capua and Samnium at their backs and all their wealthy allies to furnish them with provisions; but the Phoenicians faced the prospect of passing the winter between the cliffs of Formiae and the sands and marshes of Liternum, and amid tangled forests.<note>Weissenborn understands the reference to be to the Silva Gallinaria, now Pineta di Castel Volturno, in the neighbourhood of Liternum.</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hannibal did not fail to perceive that his own strategy was being turned against him. Accordingly, since he could not get out by way of Casilinum, but must take to the mountains and cross the ridge of Callicula, fearing lest the Romans should assail his troops as they were marching through the gorges, he
				<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> resolved to approach the mountains under cover of darkness in the forepart of the night, after first contriving a terrifying exhibition, to cheat the enemy's eyes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Preparations <pb id="p.257"/>for the ruse were made as follows. Pine-knots,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> collected from all the country round, and bundles of twigs and dry branches were tied to the horns of cattle, of which &mdash;counting those that were broken in and those that were not &mdash;they possessed, among their other rustic spoils, a considerable number.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of these, they got together about two thousand head, and Hasdrubal was commissioned to drive this herd in the night, with their horns ablaze, on to the mountains, and particularly &mdash;if it should be feasible &mdash;above the pass held by the enemy.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the dusk of evening the Carthaginians broke camp in silence, driving on the cattle a little way before the standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they reached the foothills and the narrow roads, the signal was immediately given to set fire to the horns and drive the herd up the mountain. And their very-fear, as the flames at once shot up from their heads, and the heat, that soon penetrated to the quick at the base of their horns, made the cattle as wild as though they had gone crazy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As they suddenly rushed this way and that, all the bushes far and near seemed to be burning, as if the woods and mountains had been set on fire; and when they shook their heads, they only fanned the blaze and made it: look as if men were running about in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the troops who had been posted to hold the pass caught sight of certain-fires on the mountain-tops above them, they thought that they were surrounded and forsook their station. Where the fewest flames were <pb id="p.259"/>flashing &mdash;for this seemed the safest way &mdash;they made<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> for the summits of the ridges, but nevertheless fell in with some of the cattle which had strayed from their herds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And at first, when they saw them afar, breathing fire, as they supposed, they were dazed by the wonder of it, and stood stock still;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but afterwards, perceiving it to be a trick devised by men, they concluded that it was an ambush and took to their heels in greater confusion than before. They also ran into some light-armed soldiers of the enemy; the darkness, however, by equalizing their fears, kept both sides there till daylight without either beginning the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the meanwhile Hannibal had conveyed his entire army through the pass &mdash; surprising some of his enemies in the pass itself &mdash;and had pitched his camp in the district of Allifae.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Fabius heard the din, but believing it to be an ambush, and disliking, in any case, to fight at night, kept his men within their works. At break of day there was a battle under the ridge.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The- Romans had cut off the light-armed troops of the enemy from the others, and possessing some superiority in numbers, would easily have overpowered them, had it not been for the arrival of a cohort of Spaniards, which Hannibal had sent back expressly to forestall them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These troops were more used to mountains, and better suited to skirmishing amid rocks and crags, and being more agile and more lightly armed, they had no difficulty &mdash;thanks to the nature of the fighting &mdash;in getting the better of an enemy whose heavy armour and stationary tactics were adapted to level ground.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thus the struggle had been far from equal, when they parted and made off for their respective camps.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hardly any <pb id="p.261"/>of the Spaniards had been hurt, but the Romans had<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> lost a considerable number of their men.</p> <p>Fabius, too, broke camp, and marching through the pass established himself in a lofty and naturally strong position above Allifae.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hannibal now feigned a movement upon Rome by way of Samnium, and marched back right to the land of the Paeligni, pillaging as he went. Fabius led his troops along the ridges between the enemy's army and the City, neither shunning his foe nor coming to grips with him.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From the Paelignian country the Phoenician turned, and marched back towards Apulia till he came to Gereonium, a town which its own inhabitants had abandoned in their alarm at the collapse of a part of its walls.<note>Polybins (iii. c.) knows nothing of this story, but says that Hannibal took the place, which he calls <foreign lang="greek">Gerou/nion,</foreign> by siege, and Livy himself, in chap. xxiii. &sect; 9, is inconsistent with his statement here.</note>
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The dictator encamped in the country about Larinum, and being summoned thence to Rome on religious business, commanded, counselled, and all but entreated the master of the horse to put more trust in prudence than in fortune, and rather to imitate his strategy than that of Sempronius and Flaminius.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He was not to suppose, said Fabius, that nothing had been accomplished, because almost the whole summer had been tediously spent in baffling the enemy;. physicians too sometimes found rest more efficacious than motion and activity;,
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> it was no small matter to have ceased to be defeated by an enemy who had so often been victorious, and to have breathed again after a series of disasters. When he had thus fore-warned the master of the horse &mdash;but all in vain &mdash;he set out for Rome.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the summer in which these operations were carried on, war was also begun <pb id="p.263"/>in Spain by land and sea.
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the number of ships,<note type="margin">B.C.217</note> all rigged and fitted out, which Hasdrubal had taken over from his brother he added ten, and entrusted the fleet of forty sail to Himilco;<note>These numbers do not exactly agree with those given at xxi. xxii. 4.</note>
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and then, setting out from Carthage,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> New Carthage, the modern Cartagena.</note> he made his ships keep near the land and led his army along the shore, prepared to do battle with whatever part of their forces tile Romans might bring against him.
								<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When Gnaeus Scipio learned that the enemy had left his winter quarters, he was minded at first to do the same; but on second thoughts concluded not to risk a battle on land, in view of the enormous number of auxiliaries with which rumour credited the Carthaginian, and embarking some of his best troops, went out to meet the enemy with a fleet of five and thirty ships.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>On the second day out of Tarraco he came to an anchorage ten miles from the mouth of the river Ebro. Thence he dispatched two Massiliot scouting vessels, who reported that the Punic fleet was lying in the mouth of the river and their camp established on the bank.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Accordingly, in order to take them off their guard and unprepared, while at the same time spreading a universal panic, he weighed anchor and proceeded towards the enemy. The Spaniards have numerous towers built on heights, which they use both as watch-towers and also for protection against pirates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From one of these the hostile ships were first descried, and on a signal being made to Hasdrubal, the alarm broke out on land and in the camp before it reached the sea and the ships; for no one had yet heard the beat of the oars or other nautical sounds, nor had the promontories yet disclosed the fleet to view, when suddenly <pb id="p.265"/>one galloper-after another, sent off by Hasdrubal,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> dashed up to the sailors, who were strolling about the beach or resting in their tents and thinking of nothing so little as of the enemy or of fighting on that day, and bade them board their ships in haste and arm themselves, for the Roman fleet was even then close to the harbour.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These orders the gallopers who had been sent out carried
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> far and wide, and presently Hasdrubal himself appeared on the scene with his entire army, and all was noise and confusion as the rowers and soldiers rushed down together to their ships, as though their object were rather to flee the shore than to enter battle.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Hardly were they all on board, when some cast off the hawsers<note>The <hi rend="italics">orae</hi> were cables by which the stern of the vessel was made fast to the shore while the prow was held in position by anchors.</note> and swung out on to their anchors, and others &mdash;that nothing might detain them &mdash;cut the anchor cables, and, in the hurry and excessive haste with which everything was done, the soldiers' gear interfered with the sailors in the performance of their tasks, and the confusion of the sailors kept the soldiers from taking and fitting on their armour.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>By this time the Romans were not only drawing near, but had already formed their ships in order of battle. The result was that the Phoenicians were dismayed alike by the enemy's attack and by their own confusion, and after making rather a pretence of fighting than actually engaging, turned about and ran for it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With a line so extended &mdash;and many ships came up at the same time &mdash;they were quite unable to get into the river's mouth against the current, but rowed in anywhere to the land; and getting ashore, some through shoals and others on a dry beach, some with their arms and some <pb id="p.267"/>without, they fled to the battle-line of their friends,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> which was drawn up along the shore. Two, however, of the Punic ships had been taken in the first attack and four had been sunk.<note>Polybius says that they lost two ships with their crews, and the oars and marines of four others (in. xcvi. 4).</note></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Romans, although the land was in the possession of the enemy, whose line of battle could be seen extending all along the shore, continued without the slightest hesitation to press their pursuit of the terror-stricken fleet, and, attaching cables to the stern of every vessel which had neither broken its prow on the beach nor grounded
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> its keel in the shoals, they towed it out to sea, until they had captured some twenty-five of the forty ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor was this the most brilliant feature of the victory, but the fact that the Romans in one easy battle had made themselves the masters of all that coast.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So they spread their sails for Onusa, where they disembarked and stormed and sacked the city, and thence laid a course
				<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> for Carthage, and after devastating all the country round about, ended by setting fire even to the buildings that adjoined the walls and gates.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the fleet &mdash;heavy-laden now with plunder &mdash;sailed to Longuntica,<note>Longuntica, otherwise unknown, was probably not far from New Carthage, for the Spartarius Campus (so named from a kind of rush-grass, still called esparto, which was used for twisting into rope) lay inland from the latter town (see Strabo, II. iv. 9, p. 160; and Pliny, <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi>XIX. xxx.).</note> where they found a great quantity of esparto-grass, which Hasdrubal had got together for the use of his ships. Of this they took what they needed and burned all the rest.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And they not only cruised along the mainland, but crossed over to the island of Ebusus.<note>Ebusus is the Phoenician name for either of the two islands usually known by their Greek name Pityusae &mdash;both names signifying pine-clad. Here the larger of the two is meant.</note> <pb id="p.269"/>There they endeavoured strenuously for two days,<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> but without success, to capture the chief city of the
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> island. And when they saw that their hopes were vain and their time was being wasted, they
				<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> betook themselves to pillaging the country-side, and after sacking and burning several villages, returned to their ships with more booty than they had collected from the mainland. Here envoys from the Baliaric islands came to Scipio to sue for peace.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The fleet now put about and returned to the northern part of the province, and thither flocked ambassadors from all the communities on this side of the Ebro and even from many places in farthest Spain; but the communities that gave hostages and really came under the rule and government of Rome were more than a hundred and
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> twenty. Feeling, therefore, sufficiently strong on land, as well as on the sea, the Roman general advanced as far as the pass of
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Castulo.<note>Now Cazlona. The pass led through the Sierra Morena, north of the city, which was famous for the silver and lead mines in its neighbourhood. Castulo enjoyed a close alliance with the Carthaginians and one of its daughters became the wife of Hannibal. In <date value="-214">214 B.C.</date> it revolted to the Romans, but by 211 was again in the hands of the Carthaginians (xxiv. xii. 7; xxvi. xx. 6).</note> Hasdrubal retired into Lusitania, nearer the ocean.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It looked as if the rest of the summer would be undisturbed, and so it would have been as far as the Phoenicians were concerned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But, besides that the Spaniards themselves are constitutionally restless and eager for change, no sooner had the Romans withdrawn from the pass to the seacoast, than Mandonius and Indibilis &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> latter had formerly been a chieftain of the Ilergetes &mdash;roused up their countrymen and invaded the peaceful territories of Rome's allies, on a marauding expedition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.271"/>To oppose them Scipio dispatched a tribune of<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> the soldiers with light-armed auxiliaries. They easily routed the enemy &mdash;a mere hastily-organized militia &mdash;slaying a thousand of them, making some prisoners, and disarming the greater part.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nevertheless, this outbreak induced Hasdrubal, who was retreating towards the ocean, to turn back and cross the Ebro, for the purpose of protecting his allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Phoenicians were in camp in the country of the Ilergavonenses, the Romans near Nova Classis,<note>Perhaps identical with <hi rend="italics">ad Novas</hi> mentioned in the <hi rend="italics">Itinerarium Antonini</hi> as between Ilerda and Tarraco.</note> when tidings came which gave at once a new turn to the campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Celtiberians, who had sent their leading men to treat with the Romans and had given hostages, incited by a message from Scipio, rose up in arms and invaded the Carthaginian province with a powerful army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They captured three towns by assault, and afterwards twice engaged successfully in battle with Hasdrubal himself, slaying some fifteen thousand of their enemies, and taking four thousand prisoners, with many military standards.<note>The mention of captured standards points to Valerius Antias as Livy's source, for similar references occur in no less than five of the extant fragments.</note></p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the position of affairs in Spain when Publius Scipio came into the province.<note>Scipio had been appointed when consul (<date value="-218">218 B.C.</date>) to take command of the Roman forces destined for Spain (XXX. lx. 1 and Polyb. III. xcvii. 2).</note> The senate had prolonged his command after the consulship and had sent him out with thirty<note>Polybius says twenty (<hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi>).</note> men-ofwar and eight thousand soldiers and a great convoy of supplies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This fleet, which the number of cargo-vessels swelled to an enormous size, caused great rejoicing amongst the Romans and their allies, when it was made out in the offing and standing in dropped anchor in the harbour of Tarraco.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There <pb id="p.273"/>Scipio disembarked his troops and set out to join<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> his brother; and from that time forward they carried on the war with perfect harmony of temper and of purpose.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly, while the Carthaginians were taken up with the Celtiberian campaign, they lost no time in crossing the Ebro, and seeing nothing of any enemy, marched directly on Saguntum,<note>The town had not, apparently, been completely razed, as Alorcus had informed the Saguntines that it would be (XXI. xiii. 6).</note> where it was said that hostages from all over Spain were being guarded in the citadel by a small garrison, to whose keeping they had been consigned by Hannibal.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was this pledge alone that checked the inclination of all the Spanish states to ally themselves with Rome, for fear that the blood of their own children might expiate the guilt of their defection.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From this constraint Spain was released by the machinations &mdash;more clever than honest &mdash;of one man. Abelux was his name, and he was a noble Spaniard of Saguntum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Loyal hitherto to the Phoenicians, he had now &mdash;as barbarians are for the most part prone to do &mdash; altered his allegiance with the alteration in their fortunes. But reflecting that a deserter who went over to the enemy without betraying to them something of great moment was but a single worthless and dishonoured individual, he proposed to benefit his new allies to the utmost extent of his ability.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And considering everything that fortune could put into his power, he inclined for choice to deliver up the hostages, believing that this was the one thing that would most effectively secure for the Romans the friendship of the Spanish leaders.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But since he knew that the men guarding the hostages would do nothing without the orders of <pb id="p.275"/>Bostar, the governor, he
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> artfully approached Bostar<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> himself, who was encamped outside the city, on the very shore, to preclude the approach of the Romans from that quarter. Taking him on one side, he explained the situation, as though the other had no knowledge of it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Fear, he said, had until then kept the Spaniards down, because the Romans were a long way off; now the Roman camp was on this side of the Ebro, a sure stronghold and asylum for any who wished a change; those, accordingly, who were not bound by fear must be secured by kindness and generosity.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When Bostar asked in amazement what this gift could be that should suddenly be of so great value, <quote>Send back the hostages to their homes,</quote> said Abelux.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <quote>That will at once be grateful personally to their parents, who are the people of most consequence in their own states, and to their tribes in general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Everyone wishes to be trusted: confide in people, and almost always you confirm their confidence in you. The task of restoring the hostages to their homes I request for myself, that I may work, as well as counsel, for the furtherance of my plan, and to an act that is gracious in itself lend such added grace as I am able.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Once he had brought Bostar round &mdash;for his wits were not as sharp as those of most Phoenicians &mdash;he departed secretly by night for the enemy's outposts, and encountering certain Spanish auxiliaries, who conducted him to Scipio, disclosed his plan, and when he had given pledges and received them, and had agreed upon a time and place for turning over the hostages, returned to Saguntum.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The following day he spent with Bostar, receiving <pb id="p.277"/>instructions how to carry out the enterprise, and<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> left him with the understanding that he was to go at night, in order to elude the enemy's sentinels.
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> At the hour agreed on with the Romans he wakened the boys' custodians, and led them all, as if unwittingly, into the trap prepared by his own treachery. They were then conducted to the Roman camp.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The remainder of the plan for the restoration of the hostages to their friends was carried out, through the agency of Abelux, exactly as he and Bostar had agreed, and everything was done as it would have been if he had been acting in the name of the Carthaginians.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>The gratitude which the Romans won under such circumstances was much greater than the Carthaginians would have enjoyed. For the Carthaginians had been found to be harsh and arrogant in the hour of their prosperity, and their gentleness might have appeared as the result of misfortune and timidity; but the Romans on first coming thither &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> till then they were unknown &mdash;had begun with an act of clemency and liberality, and Abelux was held to have shown discernment, and not without reason to have changed his friends.
				<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> The Spaniards were therefore all with one accord intending to revolt, and would have drawn the sword at once, if winter had not intervened and compelled both Romans and Carthaginians to retire to their quarters.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the course of events in Spain in the second summer of the Punic war. In Italy meanwhile the defeated Romans had been afforded a little breathing space by Fabius's wise policy of holding back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This policy, though it occasioned <pb id="p.279"/>Hannibal no small anxiety &mdash;for he saw that the<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> Romans had finally chosen a military leader who waged war as reason and not as blind chance dictated &mdash;yet
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> incurred the scorn of Fabius's fellow citizens, both soldiers and civilians, especially when his absence had been followed, thanks to the rashness of the master of the horse, by a battle which may truthfully be characterized as having ended with more rejoicing than success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Two things, moreover, increased the dictator's unpopularity. One was a crafty ruse of Hannibal's. Some deserters having pointed out to him the dictator's farm, he razed to the ground all the buildings in its neighbourhood, but ordered that this one place should be preserved from fire and sword and every kind of hostile violence, in order that it might appear that Fabius was in this way being rewarded for some secret compact.<note>So Coriolanus had spared the farms of the patricians in order to make bad blood between them and the plebeians (II. xxxix. 6).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The other was something that he did himself, which, though perhaps open to criticism in the first place &mdash;because he had not waited for the authorization of the senate &mdash;redounded in the upshot, and in no uncertain manner, greatly to his fame.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In exchanging prisoners the Roman and Phoenician generals had followed the example set in the first Punic war and had agreed that the side which recovered more men than it restored should pay for each two pounds and a half of silver.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans recovered two hundred and forty-seven more than the Phoenicians, but the senate, though the matter was often discussed, was slow in voting the money owing for them, on the ground that the dictator had not consulted them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> till finally Fabius sent his son Quintus to Rome to sell the farm which the enemy had spared, <pb id="p.281"/>and discharged the nation's obligation at his own<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> expense.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Hannibal lay encamped under the walls of Gereonium, where he had left a few buildings standing, to serve as granaries, when he captured and burned the city.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> From there he would send two-thirds of his army to gather corn; the other third, ready to march, he kept at the post under his own command, with the twofold object of protecting the camp and of guarding lest any attack be made upon his foragers.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman army was at that time in the neighbourhood of Larinum. Minucius, the master of the horse, was in command, for the dictator, as has been said before, had departed for the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The camp had been established on a high hill in a position of security, but was now brought down to level ground; and more vigorous measures were being discussed &mdash;in keeping with the temper of the general &mdash;for attacking the enemy's scattered foragers, or his camp, which was left but lightly garrisoned.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Hannibal saw well enough that the change in leaders had brought a change in strategy, and that the Romans were likely to be more bold than prudent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But though the enemy was close at hand, he himself did something that would almost seem incredible, and sent out a third part of his troops to forage, retaining two-thirds in his camp;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> then he brought the camp itself up nearer the enemy, about two miles away from Gereonium, to a hill in full sight of the Romans, that they might know that he was watching to protect his foragers, if they should be at all molested.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then observed <pb id="p.283"/>a hill even nearer the Romans and threatening their<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> very camp; but since, if he should attempt to take it openly by daylight, the Romans, who had a shorter way to go, would doubtless get ahead of him, he sent some Numidians secretly in the night, and they seized the hill.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were holding the place next day, when the Romans, despising their scanty numbers, dislodged them and transferred their own camp thither.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was now, at all events, but a very little space between rampart and rampart, and this the Romans had pretty well covered with their troops, which they had drawn up in line of battle. At the same time they had sent out their cavalry and skirmishers from the side of the camp which was farthest from the enemy,<note>By the <hi rend="italics">Porta Decumana.</hi></note> and these had fallen upon the scattered foragers, whom they routed with great slaughter.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Still, Hannibal did not dare to fight a battle, for his forces were so small that he was hardly able to defend his camp, if the Romans should assault it, and he now began
				<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> to wage war by the arts of Fabius, inaction and delay, and had withdrawn his troops to their former camp, which lay under the walls of Gereonium.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Some writers relate that there was even a regular pitched battle, in which the Phoenicians were driven from the field at the first encounter and pursued all the way to their camp, from which they sallied and quickly dismayed the Romans in their turn; but that Numerius Decimius the Samnite then came up and restored the day.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They say that Decimius, who was the person of most consequence both for family and fortune, not only in his own town of Bovianum but in all Samnium, was on his way to <pb id="p.285"/>the camp, by the dictator's order, at the head of<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> eight thousand foot and five hundred horse, when, appearing on Hannibal's rear, he was mistaken by both armies for reinforcements coming up with Quintus Fabius from Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Hannibal, fearing some trap as well, drew back his men, and the Romans, pressing forward and assisted by the Samnites, carried, that same day, two redoubts.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Six thousand of the enemy were slain and fully five thousand Romans. Nevertheless, though the losses had been so nearly equal, a foolish tale was carried to Rome of an extraordinary victory, with a letter from the master of the horse that was more foolish still.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These events were the occasion of many speeches both in the senate and in the popular assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The citizens rejoiced, and only the dictator refused to credit either rumour or dispatch, and declared that even though the story were all true, he feared success more than adversity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Marcus Metilius, tribune of the plebs, cried out that this was past all bearing: not only had the dictator prevented a successful engagement being fought while he was present, but
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> he even objected now that the victory was won, and persisted in drawing out the war and wasting time, in order the longer to remain in office, and to continue, both at Rome and in the army, in sole possession of authority; for one of the consuls had fallen in battle, and the other &mdash;under
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the pretext of pursuing the Punic fleet &mdash;had been sent a great way off from Italy; the two praetors were employed in Sicily and Sardinia, neither of which required a praetor at this time;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and Marcus Minucius, the master of the horse, that he might not see the enemy or <pb id="p.287"/>carry out any military operation, had been kept<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> almost a prisoner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus it had actually come to pass that not only Samnium &mdash;whose territories, as though they lay beyond the Ebro, had already been surrendered to the Phoenicians &mdash;but Campania, and the districts both of Cales and Falerii had been utterly laid waste; while the dictator sat still at Casilinum and used the legions of the Roman People to protect his own estate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The army &mdash; eager as it was to fight &mdash;and the master of the horse had virtually been cooped up and confined within the rampart; and their swords, as though they had been captured enemies, had been taken from them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At last, when the dictator had gone away, they had come out from behind their works, as if released from a blockade, and had routed and put to flight their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For all these reasons, if their ancient spirit had still animated the Roman plebs, he would boldly have proposed the abrogation of Quintus Fabius's command; as it was, he should move the adoption of a moderate measure, to wit, the elevation of the master of the horse to a footing of equality with the dictator.<note>Livy appears not to have believed that Minucius was made a dictator. But <hi rend="italics">C.I.L.,</hi> I. 1503 = Dessau, <hi rend="italics">Inscriptiones</hi> <hi rend="italics">Latinae Selectae,</hi> 11 (Hercolei | sacrum | M. Minuci. C.f. | dictator vov|| it), is ascribed by Mommsen to our Minucius, and Polybius (II. ciii. 4) says unequivocally that <quote>two dictators were actually appointed for the same field of action.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Yet, even so, they must not let Fabius rejoin his army till he had first installed a consul in the place of Gaius Flaminius.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The dictator refrained from making speeches to the people, in a cause that was far from popular. Even the senate listened coldly when he spoke in high terms of the enemy, and charging the reverses of the past two years to the rashness and
				<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> ignorance of the Roman generals, declared that the master of the horse must answer to him for having fought against his orders.
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> If his authority and <pb id="p.289"/>strategy should be paramount, he would soon let<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> people know that with a good commander fortune was of little moment; that mind and reason were in control;
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> and that to have preserved the army in its hour of danger, yet without disgrace,<note>This is possibly a sneer at Scipio, who after the Trebia took refuge with his beaten army behind the walls of Placentia and Cremona. In <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date>, Fabius's distrust of the Scipios was to take the form of bitter opposition to the son's project for invading Africa (XXVIII. xl.-xliii. and xxIx. xix.).</note> was more glorious than to have slain many thousands of the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> After making several speeches to this purport, yet without effect, and presiding over the election of Marcus Atilius Regulus<note>He had been consul before, in <date value="-227">227 B.C.</date></note> to the consulship, that he might not take a personal part in the dispute about the command, on the day preceding the bringing forward of the resolution he left by night for the army.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>When at break of day the plebs assembled in their council, though at heart they were inclined to dislike the dictator and to favour the master of the horse, yet they wanted sufficient courage to come forward and advocate a course which most of them approved, so that the motion, despite its exceeding popularity, lacked support.
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> One man alone was found to urge the passage of the bill. This was Gaius Terentius Varro, praetor of the year before, whose antecedents were not merely base but even sordid.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It is said that his father had been a butcher, who peddled his wares himself, and that he had employed this very son about the menial tasks associated with that calling.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The young man had no sooner inherited from his father the money gained in this kind of occupation than he felt encouraged to hope for a more liberal career, and resolved to enter public life;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and by declaiming on behalf of ignoble men and causes against the property and reputation of persons of the better sort achieved first notoriety <pb id="p.291"/>and then office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had held the quaestorship and<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> both aedileships &mdash;plebeian and curule &mdash;and finally even the praetorship. He now ventured to aspire to the consulship, and with considerable shrewdness sought to capture the favour of the populace by
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> exploiting their animosity against the dictator, with the result that he alone reaped all the popularity growing out of the plebiscite.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Everyone, whether in Rome or with the army, whether friend or foe, looked on the passing of this bill as an insult to the dictator &mdash;everyone,
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that is, but the dictator himself, who with the same unruffled spirit with which he had borne the slanders uttered against him before the multitude by his adversaries now bore the injustice of the infuriated people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While still on the way he received a dispatch from the senate about the equal division of command, but fairly confident that though the authority of the commanders had been equalized, their abilities had not, he returned to the army with a spirit that neither fellow citizens nor enemies could daunt.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As for Minucius, success and the favour of the crowd had already made him well-nigh insufferable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But now, at all events, he cast away all modesty and moderation and boasted of his triumph not only over Hannibal but over Quintus Fabius as well:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that wonderful leader, to whom his countrymen had turned in their distress as a match for Hannibal, had by vote of the people been reduced to a level &mdash;the superior with his subordinate, the dictator with his master of the horse; and this action, to which history could afford no parallel, had been taken in that very state in which masters <pb id="p.293"/>of the horse had been used to tremble and shudder<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> at the rods and axes of the dictator; so conspicuous had been his own success and courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He would therefore follow up his good fortune, if the dictator persisted in that dilatory and inactive course which gods and men had united in condemning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, on the day of his first meeting with Quintus Fabius, he said that the very first thing to be settled was the manner in which they should exercise the joint command:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he himself thought that the best way would be for each to have supreme command and authority either every other day,<note>So in the campaign of Cannae (<date value="-216">216 B.C.</date>), Varro and Paulus commanded on alternate days. In the present instance, however, Polybius III. (ciii. 7) says that it was Fabius who proposed the alternation, and that Minucius preferred that the army be divided.</note> or, if longer periods seemed preferable, for equally apportioned times, to the end that he
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> might be a match for the enemy not only in strategy but in numbers also, if he should meet with a favourable opportunity for fighting.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>This proposal by no means suited Quintus Fabius, for he saw that everything which his rash colleague should have got control of would be controlled by Fortune: he had been made, he said, to share the supreme command with another, not deprived of it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> he would therefore never voluntarily relinquish that share which he possessed of the power to guide the campaign prudently; he would not divide with Minucius the times or days of commanding, but would divide the army, and in accordance with his own plans would save what he could, since he was not permitted to save everything.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In this way he brought about a division of the legions, such as was customary between consuls. The first and fourth fell to Minucius, the second and third to Fabius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In like manner they divided equally the cavalry and auxiliaries, both allies and Latins. The master of <pb id="p.295"/>the horse chose that their camps, too, should be<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> separated.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All this caused Hannibal a twofold joy, for, fully acquainted as he was with whatever went on amongst his enemies both from much information brought in by deserters and from the discoveries of his own spies, he reckoned on entrapping
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the uncontrolled rashness of Minucius after his own fashion, while he saw that the sagacity of Fabius had been deprived of half its strength.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was a hill between the camp of Minucius and that of the Phoenicians, and it was certain that he who occupied it would place his enemy in a rather bad position.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This Hannibal was desirous not so much of capturing without a struggle &mdash;though this would have been worth while &mdash;as of using to bring on a battle with Minucius, who would sally forth, as he well knew, to oppose him.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It appeared at first sight that none of the ground between could be used for an ambush, since it not only had nothing on it in the shape of trees, but was nowhere so much as screened with brambles. But in fact it was formed by nature for covering an ambuscade &mdash;all the more because in a bare valley no such trap could be suspected &mdash;for in its windings there were hollow cliffs, so large that some of them would hold two hundred soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In these lurking-places Hannibal concealed five thousand foot and horse &mdash;as many in each as could readily lie in wait there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Lest, however, the movement of anyone who might carelessly step out or the glint of arms should
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> betray the ruse, in a valley so bare and open, he dispatched a small party at dawn to seize the hill already mentioned and draw off the enemy's attention.</p> <pb id="p.297"/><p>The Romans no sooner descried them than they<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> laughed at their small numbers, and everybody asked to be assigned the duty of dislodging the Carthaginians and capturing the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their general himself, as fatuous and rash as anyone, called the men to arms and railed at the enemy with idle threats.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> First he ordered out the light infantry; then he sent the cavalry off in a solid column; finally, when he saw that the enemy too were bringing up supports, he set forth with his legions in battle array. Hannibal likewise, as the struggle waxed hotter and his men were sore bested, sent in reinforcement after
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> reinforcement, horse and foot, till he now had a regular army in the field, and both sides were engaged with all their forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman light infantry, as they were advancing from the lower ground on to the height which the enemy had already occupied, was the first to suffer a repulse, and as they were driven downhill, caused a panic among the cavalry, which was coming up behind them, and fled to the standards of the legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These alone maintained their line undaunted, when all the rest were in full flight, and it looked as if, had the battle been a regular front-to-front engagement, they would have proved fully equal to their enemy &mdash;so encouraged had they been by the successful action a few days before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But the men in ambush, suddenly springing out and charging them on both flanks and in the rear, worked such havoc and alarm that not one of them had any courage left for fighting or any hope in flight.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>There it is,</quote> said Fabius, when first the cries of the frightened soldiers were heard, and <pb id="p.299"/>then the confusion in the distant battle-line became<note type="margin">B.C.217</note> discernible; <quote>misfortune has not overtaken rashness more quickly than I feared.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Though made equal to Fabius in authority, he finds Hannibal his superior, both in courage and in fortune. But another time will do for upbraiding and resentment; for the present, march out from your trenches, and let us wrest from the enemy his victory and from our fellow citizens a confession of their blunder.</quote></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>By this time large numbers of the Romans had either been slain or were casting about for a way to escape,
				<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> when suddenly Fabius and his army appeared, as though they had come down from heaven to help them; and before they got within a javelin's range or struck a blow, had checked both the headlong flight of the Romans and the reckless fury of the enemy's attack.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Those who had quitted their ranks and dispersed this way and that came running up on every side to the unbroken line; those who had retreated in a body faced about to meet the enemy and, forming a circle, at first slowly retreated, but presently, being more compactly drawn together, stood their ground.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And now the beaten army and the fresh one had pretty much united into a single line and were ready to advance against the enemy, when Hannibal sounded the recall, declaring openly that he had beaten Minucius, but that Fabius had beaten him.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the troops had got back to their camps, towards the close of a day of such varied fortune, Minucius called his men together and thus addressed them: <quote>Soldiers, I have often heard that the best man is he who can himself advise us what is <pb id="p.301"/>profitable;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the next best he who listens to good advice;<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> but that he who can neither counsel well nor obey: another has the meanest capacity of all.<note>A sentiment borrowed from the <hi rend="italics">Works and Days</hi> of Hesiod, who says (293 ff.): That man is altogether best who considers all things himself and marks what will be better afterwards and at the end; and he, again, is good who listens to a good adviser; but whoever neither thinks for himself nor keeps in mind what another tells him, he is an unprofitable man (Evelyn White's Trans. in <hi rend="italics">L. C. L.</hi>).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Since to us the first rank of intelligence and capacity has been denied, let us hold fast to the second or middle state, and while we are learning to command, make up our minds to obey a man of wisdom.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Let us join our camp to that of Fabius; and when we have brought our standards to his tent, and I have given him the name of 'Father' &mdash;as
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> befits his goodness to us and his great position &mdash;you, soldiers, will salute as 'patrons'<note>The soldiers of Fabius, by preventing the Carthaginians from capturing the soldiers of Minucius, have preserved their liberty, as the <hi rend="italics">patronus</hi> guarded the liberty of his client.</note> those whose hands and swords just now protected you; and, if nothing else, this day shall at least have conferred on us the, glory of possessing thankful hearts.</quote></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The moment the signal was given, the order to pack was shouted round.<note><hi rend="italics">vasa colliqere</hi> means literally <quote>to collect one's traps,</quote> hence <quote>to prepare to march.</quote></note> Setting forth they marched in column to the dictator's camp, to the astonishment of Fabius himself and all who were about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they had planted their ensigns before the tribunal,<note>A platform in front of the general's tent.</note> the master of the horse advanced in front of the rest and called upon Fabius by the name of Father, and his entire army saluted the soldiers who had gathered round them as their patrons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Minucius said, <quote>To my parents, Dictator, with whom I have just made you equal in name, which is all that speech can do, I owe only my life; to <pb id="p.303"/>you I owe not merely my own safety but the safety<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> of all of these.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accordingly I am the first to reject and repeal that plebiscite which has been more onerous to me than honourable, and to place myself again under your command and auspices and restore to you these standards and these legions; and may good fortune come of it to you and to me and to these your armies, to the preserved and the preserver.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lay aside, I pray, your just resentment, and bid me retain my post of master of the horse and these their own proper companies and ranks.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then hands were clasped, and the assembly being dismissed, the soldiers were kindly and hospitably entertained, alike by friends and strangers, and a day which a little earlier had been very gloomy and almost accurst was turned into one of rejoicing.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In Rome, when the report of this affair came in, and was later confirmed by letters not only from both commanders, but from the soldiers generally in both armies, all men joined in lauding Maximus to the skies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With Hannibal and the hostile Phoenicians his renown was equally great; then for the first time they realized that they were fighting with Romans and in Italy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For during the past two years<note>The battle on the Ticinus had been fought in the autumn of <date value="-218">218 B.C.</date>, and it was now late in the year 217, but the war had already lasted through two <hi rend="italics">campaigns.</hi></note> they had so despised the Roman generals and soldiers that they could hardly believe that they were at war with the same nation as that of which they had heard such terrifying stories from their fathers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And Hannibal is said to have remarked, as he was returning from the field, that at last that cloud which had long been hovering about the mountain-tops had broken in a storm of rain.</p> <pb id="p.305"/><p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these things were happening in<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> Italy, Gnaeus Servilius Geminus the consul, with a fleet of a hundred and twenty ships, sailed round Sardinia and Corsica, and after taking hostages from both, bore away for Africa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Before descending on the mainland, he plundered the island of Menix; and after accepting ten talents of silver, which the people of Cercina gave him,<note>Menix (or Meninx) and Cercina were in the Lesser Syrtis. The former was supposed to have been the land of the lotus-eaters. (The modern names are Djerba and Kerkenna.)</note> to induce him not to burn and pillage their territory also, he sailed in to the coast of Africa and disembarked his troops.<note>Polybius (II. xcvi. 13) mentions the ransom of Cercina, and speaks of the capture not of Menix but of Cossyrus (a little island to the E. of Carthage). He says nothing of the landing in Africa.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Soldiers and naval allies went off to pillage the country-side and dispersed as freely as if they were plundering desert islands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And so they quickly fell into an ambush, and losing contact with each other, and knowing nothing of the country, were set upon by large bands of their enemies, who knew it well, and driven back to their ships in a bloody and disgraceful rout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fully a thousand men were lost, including the quaestor, Tiberius Sempronius Blaesus. Moorings were cast off in a hurry, and the fleet, leaving the shore behind it lined with enemies, stood away for Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At Lilybaeum it was handed over to the praetor Titus Otacilius, to be conducted by his lieutenant, Publius Cincius, back to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul himself proceeded overland through Sicily to the straits, where he crossed into Italy, in obedience to a dispatch from Quintus Fabius. The dictator had sent for Servilius, and for Marcus Atilius his colleague, to take over his armies, for his six months' tenure of authority was drawing to a close.</p> 
			<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><pb id="p.307"/><p>Nearly all the annalists state that Fabius was<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> dictator in his campaign against Hannibal; Coelius even writes that he was the first to be created dictator by the people.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But Coelius and the rest forget that only the consul Gnaeus Servilius, who was then far away in his province of Gaul,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in Northern Italy, in the neighbourhood of Ariminum.</note> had the right of naming a dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was because the nation, appalled by their great disaster, could not put up with so long a delay that resort was had to the popular election of an <hi rend="italics">acting</hi> dictator.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thereafter the general's successes and his great renown, and the additions which his descendants made to the inscription which accompanies his portrait,<note>In this inscription the expression <hi rend="italics">II dictator</hi> (as in the <hi rend="italics">Fasti</hi>) or <hi rend="italics">bis dictator</hi> (as in the <hi rend="italics">Elogium</hi> of Fabius, <hi rend="italics">C.

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls &mdash;Atilius taking over the army of Fabius and Geminus Servilius that of Minucius &mdash;constructed a winter camp betimes, and carried on the war for the rest of the autumn with the greatest harmony, on the lines laid down by Fabius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As often as Hannibal went out to forage, they were sure to appear, at one place or another, harassing his march and cutting off the stragglers: a general engagement, which the enemy sought with all the arts at his command, they declined to risk;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and Hannibal was driven to such extremity of want, that if he had not thought that his departure would <pb id="p.309"/>necessarily look like flight, he would have gone back<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> into Gaul. For he had given up all hope of supporting his army in those regions, if the next consuls should make use of the same strategy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Winter had already brought the fighting about Gereonium to a standstill, when envoys from Neapolis arrived in Rome.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Bringing forty massive golden bowls into the senate-house, they delivered themselves to this effect: that they knew that the treasury of the Roman People was becoming exhausted by the war, and since it was being waged no less in behalf of the cities and lands of the allies than for the capital and citadel of Italy &mdash;the City of Rome &mdash;and
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for its empire, the Neapolitans had deemed it right to employ the gold which their ancestors had bequeathed them, whether for the adornment of their temples or as a subsidy in time of need, to assist the Roman People;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> had they thought themselves capable of helping with their persons, they would have offered these with the same heartiness; it would gratify them if the Roman senators and people would look on all the possessions of the Neapolitans as their own, and consider
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> that their gift deserved a willing acceptance, as being greater and of more account in respect of the friendliness and good-will of the givers than in actual value.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The envoys received a vote of thanks for this generosity and thoughtfulness, and the bowl of least weight was accepted.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about this time a Carthaginian spy who for two years had eluded capture was caught in Rome, and after his hands had been cut off, was allowed to go; and five and twenty slaves were crucified, on the charge of having conspired in the <pb id="p.311"/>Campus Martius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The informer was rewarded with<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> freedom and twenty thousand sesterces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Ambassadors were dispatched to Philip,<note>Philip V., with whom the Romans were to fight the first two Macedonian wars of 216-<date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> and 200-<date value="-197">197 B.C.</date></note> King of the Macedonians, to demand the person of Demetrius of Pharus,<note>Demetrius of Pharus (an island off the coast of Illyria) had (in <date value="-229">229 B.C.</date>) treacherously surrendered to the Romans the island Corcyra, of which the Illyrian queen Teuta had made him governor. Rewarded for this service with the governorship of a number of islands, he was guilty of plundering Roman allies, and Aemilius Paulus led an expedition against him which resulted (in 219) in his defeat and exile.</note> who, beaten in war, had fled to him for refuge;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and others to expostulate with the Ligurians, because they had aided the Phoenician with supplies and men, and at the same time to observe at close range what was going on amongst the Boi and the Insubres.<note>In view of the revolt recorded in xxi. xxv.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Ambassadors were likewise sent to King Pineus<note>Whom the Romans had placed on the Illyrian throne in <date value="-228">228 B.C.</date> after their defeat of Teuta.</note> in Illyria, to demand a tribute which was overdue, or, in case he wished the time extended, to take hostages.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So far were the Romans, though bearing upon their shoulders the burden of a mighty war, from permitting any concern of theirs to escape them, in however remote a part of the world it lay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were troubled, too, that the contract for the temple of Concord, which the praetor Lucius Manlius had vowed two years before in Gaul, during the mutiny of the soldiers,<note>Livy says nothing of this mutiny, which probably occurred (notwithstanding the phrase <hi rend="italics">biennio ante</hi>) in connexion with the events related in XXI. xxv.</note> had hitherto not been let.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly the city praetor, Marcus Aemilius, appointed for the purpose two commissioners, Gaius Pupius and Caeso Quinctius Flamininus, who arranged to have the temple built on the Citadel.<note>One of the two summits of the Capitoline, the other being the Capitol, where stood the temple of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. The temple of Concord, dedicated in 216 (XXIII. xxi. 7), must not be confounded with the temple of the same goddess situated at the N.W. corner of the Forum &mdash;the ruins of which may still be seen &mdash;which was first erected in 367 by Camillus on the passing of the Licinian Laws........</note></p> <pb id="p.313"/><p>The same praetor, acting on instructions from the<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> senate, wrote to the consuls, requesting that, if it seemed good to them, one of them would come to Rome to hold an election of consuls, and promising to appoint the comitia for the day which they
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> should designate. To this the consuls answered that they could not withdraw from the presence of the enemy without detriment to
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the republic; it would therefore be better that the election be conducted by an interrex than that one of the consuls be called away from the seat
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> of war. To the senators it seemed preferable that the consuls should appoint a dictator to preside at the election. They appointed Lucius Veturius Philo, who named Marcus Pomponius Matho master of
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the horse. There was a flaw in their appointment and they were commanded on the fourteenth day to resign their magistracy, whereupon the state reverted to an interregnum.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The authority of the consuls was extended for a year. To be interrex the Fathers named Gaius Claudius Cento, the son of Appius, and after him Publius Cornelius Asina. The latter conducted an election, which was marked by a bitter struggle between patricians and plebeians.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Gaius Terentius Varro had endeared himself to the plebeians &mdash;the class to which he himself belonged &mdash;by invectives against the leading men and the usual tricks of the demagogue. The blow he had struck at the influence and dictatorial authority of Fabius brought him the glory which is won by defaming others, and the rabble was now striving to raise him to the consulship, while the patricians opposed the attempt with all their might, lest men should acquire the custom of assailing them <pb id="p.315"/>as a means of rising to their level.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quintus Baebius B.C. 217 Herennius, a tribune of the plebs and kinsman of Gaius Terentius, railed not only at the senate but at the augurs too, because they had forbidden the dictator to accomplish the election, and by placing them in an unfavourable light, strengthened the candidacy of his friend.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The nobles, he said, had been seeking war for many years, and it was they who had brought Hannibal into Italy. It was their machinations, too, that were spinning out the war, when it might be brought to a victorious conclusion.<note>The absurdity of this allegation is evident as soon as one recalls the bitter opposition to Fabius and his policy on the part of a large section of the senate (see Dimsdale's note).</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That four legions if united were able to hold their own in a general engagement had been shown in a successful battle fought by Marcus Minucius, when Fabius was absent.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Notwithstanding this, two legions had just been exposed to be massacred by the enemy and subsequently rescued from the massacre, to the end that the names of Father and Patron might be conferred on one who had kept the Romans from conquering before keeping them from being conquered.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After that the consuls had employed the arts of Fabius to prolong the war, when they were able to have ended it.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The nobles had all made a compact to this effect; nor would his hearers see an end of the war until they had elected a true plebeian, a new man,<note><hi rend="italics">A novus hormo</hi> was one who, like Cicero, attained, first of his family, to curule office. Such a man and his descendants were thereafter reckoned as nobles.</note> to the consulship; for the plebeian nobles had already been admitted to the same rites as the others and had begun to look down on the plebs from the moment when they themselves had ceased to be looked down on by the patricians.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Who could fail to see that their end and purpose in resorting to an interregnum had been to keep the election in the hands of the <pb id="p.317"/>patricians?
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To this end both consuls had remained<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> with their army in the field; to this end, later on, because a dictator had been named, against their wishes, for the purpose of holding an election, they had succeeded in having the augurs declare that there had been a flaw in his appointment.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They had therefore the interregnum they desired. But at least one consulship belonged to the Roman plebs; and the people meant to keep it free, and bestow it on him who would rather win an early victory than remain long in command.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the plebs had been inflamed by these harangues, though there were three patrician candidates, Publius Cornelius Merenda, Lucius Manlius Volso, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> and two plebeians of families which had already been ennobled, namely, Gaius Atilius Serranus and Quintus Aelius Paetus, of whom one was a pontifex, the other an augur, Gaius Terentius was the only consul elected, and the assembly called to choose a colleague for him was therefore under his control.<note>The magistrate who presided at the elections was naturally in a position to influence the voters by his attitude towards the various candidates.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The nobles, finding that Varro's competitors had not been able to command the necessary strength, thereupon obliged Lucius Aemilius Paulus to stand, though he held out long and earnestly against their importunity. He had been consul together with Marcus Livius, and the condemnation of his colleague &mdash;from which he had not himself escaped unscathed &mdash;had embittered him against the plebs.<note>L. Aemilius Paulus and M. Livius Salinator were consuls in <date value="-219">219 B.C.</date> On the expiration of their term of office, Livius was tried and convicted by the people (XXVII. xxxiv. 3) for peculation in connexion with the war against Demetrius of Pharus (<hi rend="italics">De viris illustr.</hi> 50), or unfair division of the spoil (Frontinus, <hi rend="italics">Strategemata,</hi>iv. i. 45). In <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> he and his colleague in the consulship, Gaius Nero, defeated Hasdrubal near Sena Gallica, at the river Metaurus (XXVII. xl.-xlix.).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the next election day <pb id="p.319"/>all those who had been Varro's rivals withdrew their<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> names, the consul was given Paulus, rather as a competent opponent than as a colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The election of praetors then took place, and Marcus Pomponius Matho and Publius Furius Philus were chosen. To Philus the lot assigned the urban praetorship, for administering justice in Rome;<note>Sc. between litigants both of whom were citizens.</note> to Pomponius the jurisdiction in suits between Roman citizens and foreigners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two additional praetors were elected, Marcus Claudius Marcellus for Sicily, and Lucius Postumius Albinus for Gaul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These were all elected in their absence, and not one of them, except Terentius the consul, received a magistracy which he had not already filled before, a number of stout-hearted, active men being passed over because it seemed unwise at such a juncture to give any man an office to which he was new.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The armies also were augmented. But how large were the additions of infantry and cavalry I should hardly venture to declare with any certainty &mdash;so greatly do historians differ in regard to the numbers and kinds of troops.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some say that ten thousand new soldiers were enlisted as replacements; others that four new legions were enrolled, so that they took the field with eight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some assert that the legions were also increased in the numbers of their infantry and cavalry, and that each received an additional thousand foot and a hundred horse, bringing up the total of every one to five thousand <pb id="p.321"/>foot and three hundred horse;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and that double the<note type="margin">B.C. 217</note> number of horse and an equal number of foot were furnished by the allies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> One thing is not disputed &mdash;that they proceeded with more energy and enthusiasm than in former years, because the dictator had given them ground for hoping that they would be able to defeat the enemy.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Before, however, the new legions marched out<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> from the City, the decemvirs were instructed to consult the Sacred Books, on account of a general alarm occasioned by strange portents.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For a shower of stones had been reported as having fallen at Rome on the Aventine, and about the same time at Aricia; in the Sabine country the images of the gods, and at Caere the waters that flowed from the hot spring had been drenched with blood &mdash;a
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> prodigy all the more alarming from its having occurred so often;<note>Cf. chap. i. &sect; 10. Aelian (<hi rend="italics">Vacrica Historia,</hi> xii. 67) and Diodorus (XVII. 10) allude to the story that the fountain of Dirce ran with blood just before the destruction of Thebes by Alexander.</note> and in the arched way which used to lead to the Campus Martius some men had been struck by lightning and killed. These prodigies were expiated as the Books directed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Ambassadors came from Paestum, bringing golden bowls to Rome. They were thanked, as the Neapolitans had been, but the gold was not accepted.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time a fleet came in to Ostia from King Hiero with a great store of supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His envoys were introduced into the senate, where they told how the news of the destruction of Gaius Flaminius the consul and his army had so grieved the King that no disaster to himself or his own kingdom could have distressed him more.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accordingly, though well aware that the greatness of the Roman People was almost more astonishing in adversity than in prosperity, he had nevertheless sent <pb id="p.323"/>them all those things with which good and faithful<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> allies were wont to assist their friends in time of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> war, and he earnestly besought the Conscript Fathers not to refuse them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the first place, for the omen's sake, they were bringing a golden Victory, weighing two hundred and twenty pounds, which they begged the Romans to accept and keep, and to regard it as their own for ever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had also brought three hundred thousand measures<note>The <hi rend="italics">modius</hi> was about equivalent to our peck.</note> of wheat and two hundred thousand of barley, that there might be no failure of provision; and whatever additional quantity were needed they stood ready to convey to any place which the senate might designate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For heavy foot and horse, the King knew that the Roman People employed none but Romans and Latins;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but amongst the light-armed auxiliaries, he had seen in the camps of the Romans even foreigners; he had therefore sent a thousand archers and slingers, a force well adapted to cope with Moors and Baliares and other tribes that fought with missiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To these gifts they added a piece of advice, that the praetor, namely, who might be assigned to Sicily should sail over with his fleet to Africa, so that the enemy, too, might have war on their own soil, whereby they would experience less freedom in dispatching aid to Hannibal.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The senate, in replying to the royal emissaries, said that Hiero was a good man and a rare ally, who from the time when he became a friend of the Roman People had maintained an unswerving loyalty, and always and in every place had given generous assistance to the Roman cause. For this the Romans were grateful, as in duty bound.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As for the gold, other states as well had proffered it, but the Roman <pb id="p.325"/>People, though thankful for the kind intention, had<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> not accepted it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the Victory and her omen they did accept; and to that goddess they dedicated and assigned the Capitol, the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, to be her seat. Established in that citadel of Rome she would be gracious and propitious, faithful and steadfast, to the Roman People.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The slingers and archers and the corn were turned over to the consuls. Twenty-five quinqueremes were added to the fleet of fifty ships that was under the command of Titus Otacilius in Sicily, and permission was given him, if he deemed it advantageous to the state, to sail across to Africa.</p> <p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they had finished with the levy, the consuls waited a few days for the soldiers from the allies and the Latins to come in.
				<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> An oath was then administered to the soldiers by their tribunes &mdash; which was a thing that they had never done before.
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For until that day there had only been the general oath<note>Like the one mentioned in chap. xi. &sect; 8 of the year before, or in III. xx. 3, of <date value="-460">460 B.C.</date></note> to assemble at the bidding of the consuls and not depart without their orders; then, after assembling, they would exchange a voluntary pledge amongst themselves &mdash;the cavalrymen in their decuries and the infantry in their centuries &mdash;that
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> they would not abandon their ranks for flight or fear, but only to take up or seek a weapon, either to smite an enemy or to save a fellow citizen.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This voluntary agreement amongst the men themselves was replaced by an oath administered formally by the tribunes.</p> <pb id="p.327"/><p>Before the troops marched from the City, the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> consul Varro uttered many truculent harangues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He declared that the war had been brought into Italy by the nobles, and would not cease to prey upon the nation's vitals, if they had many generals like Fabius; but that he himself would put an end to it on the day when he came within sight of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His colleague Paulus spoke but once, on the day before he left the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> His words were more truthful than agreeable to the people; but he said nothing harsh against Varro, except this: that he marvelled &mdash;and indeed how should he not? &mdash;that a general, who before he knew either his own or the enemy's army or the lie of the land or the character of the country, was already certain, ere he had yet laid aside the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> dress of a civilian, what measures he must adopt when in the field &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> marvelled that such a general should even be able to predict the very day on which he would be giving battle to the enemy!

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He hoped that what was done with care and caution would turn out for the best: rashness was not only foolish but had hitherto been unfortunate as well It was quite apparently his own intention to choose a safe course rather than a hasty one;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> and, to confirm him in this resolution, Quintus Fabius Maximus is said to have addressed him, on his setting out, to this effect: &mdash;</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"If either, Lucius Aemilius, you had, as I should prefer, a colleague like yourself, or if you were like your colleague, my words would be superfluous.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For, as two good consuls, even if I held my <pb id="p.329"/>peace, you would act in all respects in accordance<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> with the public interest and your own loyalty; and, as bad ones, you would neither take my words into your ears nor my advice into your hearts.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As it is, when I see what your colleague is like and what you are like, it is to you alone that I must address myself: though I perceive that you will be a good man and good citizen to little purpose, if the state is lame on the other side and evil counsels enjoy the same rights and the same authority as good.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For you err, Lucius Paulus, if you suppose that your struggle will be less with Gaius Terentius than with Hannibal. I am not sure that you may not find the one more dangerous as an opponent than the other as an enemy, and that with your enemy you will have to contend only in battle; with your opponent, everywhere and at all times.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Against Hannibal and his legions you will have your cavalry and infantry to fight for you: when Varro takes the field, it will be to attack you with your own soldiers.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>"For the very omen's sake, I would not have you remember Gaius Flaminius! Yet Flaminius only began to rave when he had been made consul and was in his province and had joined his army; whereas Varro was mad before he sought the consulship, as he was thereafter during his canvass, and is now as consul, before he has ever beheld his camp or the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And if a man can rouse such gusts of passion even now, by bragging of battles and of stricken fields among civilians, what think you he will do when surrounded by armed youths, where words are translated instantly into deeds?
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And yet, if he fights at once, as he declares that he intends to do, either I know nothing of military science, of the <pb id="p.331"/>nature of this war, and of our enemy, or another<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> place will be more notorious than Trasumennus for our overthrow.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>"It is no time to boast, when I am speaking to one man, and for my part I had rather go too far in despising than in seeking reputation; but the simple truth is that the only way of conducting a war with Hannibal is the way in which I have conducted it;
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and not only the event &mdash;that schoolmaster of fools &mdash;teaches us this, but the same reasoning which held good then will hold unchanged, so long as circumstances remain the same.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It is in Italy, our home-land, that we are fighting; everywhere about us are fellow citizens and friends;

				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Hannibal, on the contrary, is in an alien and hostile country, where all his surroundings are inimical and threatening, far from home and native city; for him there is no peace, on either land or sea; no cities receive him, no walls protect him; nowhere does he see aught that he can call his own; he subsists on the plunder of each day; he has barely a third of that army which he led across the Ebro;
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> more have perished by starvation than by the sword, and the few that are left have no longer any food.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Can you doubt then that if we sit still we must gain the victory over one who is growing weaker every day and is destitute of provisions, of replacements, and of money?
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> How long, before Gereonium,<note>See chap. xxiii. &sect; 9.

					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> For your own soldiers will desire the same thing as the soldiers of the enemy; Varro, the Roman consul, will long for the same thing as Hannibal, the Phoenician commander-in-chief. Single-handed you will have to thwart two generals. But thwart them you will, if you stand out with sufficient firmness against rumours and men's idle talk, if neither the foolish applause bestowed upon your colleague nor your own unmerited disgrace shall move you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Truth, they say, is all too frequently eclipsed but never extinguished. He who scorns false glory shall possess the true.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Let them call you timid, instead of cautious; slow, instead of circumspect; unwarlike, instead of experienced soldier. I had rather a wise enemy should fear you than foolish fellow citizens should praise you. He who dares all things will earn Hannibal's contempt; he who does nothing rashly will inspire him with fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Yet I do not urge that you do nothing, but that reason and not fortune should be your guide. Be master always of yourself and all that is yours; be armed and watchful; be not wanting when opportunity presents itself to you, neither present an opportunity to your enemy.

						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In reply to this the consul spoke in no very cheerful strain, admitting rather that what Fabius said was true than that it was easy of <pb id="p.335"/>accomplishment.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The dictator had found his master of the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> horse intolerable: what power or influence then would a consul have over a turbulent and headstrong colleague?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In his former consulship he had escaped badly burnt from the flames of popular resentment; he hoped that everything would turn out for the best; but if any misfortune should befall, he would sooner expose his life to the swords of the enemy than to the suffrages of his angry fellow citizens.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Immediately after this conference they say that Paulus set out, escorted by the foremost senators: the plebeian consul was escorted by his own friends, the plebeians &mdash;in point of numbers the more imposing throng, though it contained no persons of distinction.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When they got to the camp, the new forces were united with the old and the camp was divided into two, with the new and smaller one nearer Hannibal, while the greater part of the army and all the choicest troops were in the old one.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Of the consuls of the year before, Marcus Atilius pleaded the excuse of age and was sent back to Rome; Geminus Servilius was put in command of the smaller camp, having under him a Roman legion and two thousand infantry and cavalry of the allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Hannibal, though lie perceived that the forces of his enemies were augmented by a half, was nevertheless greatly rejoiced at the coming of the consuls.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For not only were the spoils exhausted on which his men had subsisted from day to day, but there was not even any district left for them to spoil; for when it appeared that the farms were no longer safe, the corn had everywhere been carried into the walled towns, and in consequence there was barely grain <pb id="p.337"/>enough left &mdash;as
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> was afterwards discovered &mdash;to last<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> ten days, and the Spaniards, for want of food, had made ready to desert, if the Romans had only waited till the time was ripe.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But even Fortune furnished material to the recklessness and over-hasty temper of the consul.<note>Obviously Varro is meant, but it is rather odd that he should not be specified. Weissenborn thinks it likely that with this paragraph Livy began to draw from another source and did not notice the indefiniteness of the word <hi rend="italics">consulis</hi> in the resulting context.</note> The repulse of a foraging party had led to a general mellay, which came about from the soldiers rushing forward to attack the enemy, rather than from any plan or orders on the part of the generals; and in this the Phoenicians by no means held their own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About seventeen hundred of them were slain and not more than a hundred of Romans and allies. But the consul Paulus, who was in command that day &mdash;for they commanded on alternate days &mdash;was
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> fearful of an ambuscade and checked the victors in their headlong pursuit, despite the angry remonstrances of Varro, who cried out that they had let the enemy slip through their hands and that they might have brought the war to a conclusion if they had not relaxed their efforts.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hannibal was not greatly disconcerted by this reverse; indeed he rejoiced that the hook should have been baited, as it were, for the rashness of the more impetuous consul, and especially for that of the new soldiers.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All the circumstances of his enemies were as familiar to him as his own: that their generals were unlike each other and were at loggerheads, and that nearly two-thirds of their army consisted of recruits.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Believing, therefore, that place and time were favourable for a ruse, he left his camp full of every sort of public and of private riches, and putting himself at the head of his troops, who carried nothing but their weapons, marched over the nearest <pb id="p.339"/>ridge, drew up the
				<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> infantry in ambush on the left,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> and the cavalry on the right, and made the baggage-train pass through the valley between, intending to fall upon
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the enemy whilst they were preoccupied and encumbered with the pillage of the camp, which would seem to them to have been deserted by its owners.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He left a large number of fires burning, as though he had sought by means of this illusory appearance of an encampment to hold the consuls to their positions &mdash;as he had cheated Fabius the year before &mdash;till he could gain as long a start as possible in his retreat.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When day came, first the fact that the outposts had been withdrawn, and afterwards &mdash;as they came nearer &mdash;the unwonted silence filled the Romans with amazement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, as it became quite evident that there was no one in the camp, there was a rush of men to the headquarters of the consuls, announcing that the enemy had retreated in such trepidation as to quit the camp without striking their tents, and had even left a great number of fires burning to conceal their flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Next they began to clamour for the order to advance and to pursue the enemy and plunder the camp without delay, and one of the consuls behaved like a member of the mob of soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Paulus kept insisting on the need for watchfulness and circumspection, and finally, when there was no other way in which he could withstand the mutiny and the leader of the mutiny, he sent the praefect Marius Statilius with a troop of Lucanian horse to reconnoitre.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Riding up to the gates, Statilius commanded the others to wait outside the trenches, and himself with two horsemen entered the camp. After making a <pb id="p.341"/>thorough and careful examination he reported that<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> there was undoubtedly some treachery afoot.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fires, he said, had been left on the side of the camp that faced the Romans; the tents were open and all kinds of valuables were left exposed to view; here and there he had seen silver carelessly flung down in the lanes,<note>sc. between the rows of tents.</note> as if to tempt a pillager.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The report, which had been made with the purpose of checking the soldiers' greed, only inflamed it, and they began to shout that if the signal were not given, they would go without any leaders. But there was no lack of a leader; for Varro at once gave the command to start.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Paulus himself wished to delay; and when the sacred fowls had refused their sanction,<note>A Roman general took with him on his campaign a <hi rend="italics">pullarius</hi> &mdash;keeper of the sacred chickens &mdash;who reported favourable or unfavourable omens, according to the eagerness with which the fowls fed. See VI. xli. 8, VIII. xxx. 2.</note> he gave orders to notify his colleague, who was just setting forth with the standards from
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the gate. Varro was greatly vexed at this, but the recent disaster of Flaminius and the memorable defeat at sea of the consul Claudius, in the first Punic War<note>P. Claudius Pulcher disregarded the warning of the sacred fowls and was defeated off Drepanum in <date value="-249">249 B.C.</date> (Summary of Book XIX.)</note> made him fearful of offending the
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> heavenly powers. On that day, it might almost be said, the very gods put off, but did not prevent, the calamity that impended over the Romans: for it chanced that when the consul ordered the standards back into the camp and the soldiers were refusing to obey him, two slaves appeared on the scene, one belonging to a Formian, the other to a Sidicinian knight. They had been captured by the Numidians, along with other foragers, in the consulship of Servilius and Atilius, and on that day had escaped back to
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> their masters. Being conducted to the <pb id="p.343"/>consuls, they stated that Hannibal's entire army was<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> lying in ambush just over the
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> nearest hills. Their opportune arrival restored the authority of the consuls, when one of them, by running after popularity, and by unprincipled indulgence, had impaired their prestige &mdash;beginning with his own &mdash;amongst the soldiers.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal, perceiving that the Romans, although they had acted ill-advisedly, had not proceeded to the extremity of rashness, returned to the camp, his stratagem having been detected and rendered idle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There, however, the scarcity of corn forbade his remaining many days, and new plans were daily forming, not only amongst the soldiers, the mingled offscourings of every race on earth, but even in the mind of the general himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For when the men, with murmurs at first and afterwards with loud clamours, demanded their arrears of pay, and complained at first of the scarcity of corn, and finally of being starved; and when the report went round that the mercenaries &mdash;particularly those of Spanish blood &mdash;had resolved on going over to the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> they say that even Hannibal himself had thoughts of abandoning all his infantry and saving himself and his cavalry by escaping into Gaul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Such being the projects that were entertained in camp and such the temper of his soldiers, he decided to move from his present quarters to Apulia,<note>According to Polybius (III. cvii. ff.), Servilius, consul in 217, was still in command of the army before Gereonium when Hannibal marched south and seized the citadel of Cannae, which the Romans had been using as a granary. On receiving the disquieting news of this serious loss, Servilius sent to Rome and asked for instructions. The senate decided to give battle, and sent the new consuls to the front to take command. The engagement at Cannae was fought seven days after the Romans had set out to follow Hannibal.</note> where the climate was warmer and in consequence of this the harvest earlier; at the same time it would be the more difficult, the greater their distance from the enemy, for those of his followers who <pb id="p.345"/>were fickle to desert.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He set out in the night,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> after making up some fires, as before, and leaving a few tents standing where they would be seen, so that the Romans might be withheld from following him through fear of an ambush, as before.<note>Weissenborn suggests the possibility that the repetition of this stratagem in Livy's narrative may be due to a combination of different versions occurring respectively in Coelius Antipater and in Valerius Antias. The whole passage (chap. xl.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> &mdash;chap. xliii.) is discussed by De Sanctis, III. 2, p. 59.90, who regards the story of the two camps at Gereonium as a repetition of the situation on the Aufidus (chap. xliv. &sect; 1). The scarcity of provisions attributed to Hannibal was invented, he thinks, in order to make it appear the less excusable in the Romans to have accepted battle. The new skirmish at Gereonium is a repetition of the one to which Polybius refers as taking place fifty stades from Cannae. Finally, the stratagem of the abandoned camp is ridiculous and absurd, for the Romans had only to occupy it with a couple of legions and Hannibal would have found it very difficult to recover, and even if Aemilius had chosen to allow Hannibal to return to his camp, he would have deserved a court-martial if he had not first destroyed the tents and levelled the camp and filled the trenches. De Sanctis thinks that the whole episode is characteristic of Valerius Antias.</note></p> <p>But when the same Lucanian, Statilius, had made a thorough reconnaissance beyond the camp and on the other side of the mountains, and had reported seeing the enemy on the march a long way off, then the question of pursuing him began to be
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> debated. The consuls were each of the same mind as they had always been; but Varro had the support of almost everybody, Paulus of none except Servilius, the consul of the year
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> before. The will of the majority prevailed, and they set forward, under the urge of destiny, to make Cannae famous for the calamity which there befell the
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Romans. This was the village near which Hannibal had pitched his camp,<note>Livy forgets to point out that Hannibal later crossed the river and encamped on the western side (Map 7).</note> with his back to the Volturnus,<note>This was the Eurus of the Greeks (Seneca, <hi rend="italics">Nat. Quaest.</hi> v. xvi. 4), now called Scirocco. The Latin name is from Mt. Voltur in Apulia, S.W. of Cannae.</note> a wind that brings clouds of dust over the drought-parched
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> plains. Such a disposition was very convenient for the camp itself and bound to be particularly salutary when the troops formed up for battle, facing in the opposite direction, with <pb id="p.347"/>the wind blowing only on their backs, and ready to<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> fight with enemies half-blinded by the dust driven into their faces.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls, after making a sufficient reconnaissance of the roads, followed the Phoenicians until they came to Cannae, where, having the enemy in view, they divided their forces, as they had done before, and fortified two camps, at about the same distance from one another as at Gereonium.<note>At chap. xl. &sect; 5 we were not told how far apart the camps were, but only that the smaller one was nearer Hannibal than the larger one.</note>
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The river Aufidus, flowing past both their camps, was readily accessible to water-carriers at such spots as were convenient for each, though not without fighting;
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it was, however, from the smaller camp, which was situated across the Aufidus,<note>Neither Livy nor Polybius (III. cx.) states explicitly that the larger camp of the Romans was on the left, or western bank, but that such was the fact may fairly be inferred from Livy's <hi rend="italics">trans Aufidum</hi> (&sect; 3) and Polybius's <foreign lang="greek">pe/ran, a)po\ diaba/sews pro\s ta\s a)natola/s</foreign> (III. cx. 10), both of which phrases are used of the smaller camp, and such is the view of Professor Kromayer. (See map.)</note> that the Romans could fetch water more freely, since the enemy had no troops posted on the further bank.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hannibal had conceived a hope that the consuls would give him an opportunity of fighting in a place that was formed by nature for a cavalry action, in which arm he was invincible. He therefore drew out his men in battle array and ordered the Numidians to make a sally and provoke the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This caused the camp of the Romans to be once more the scene of strife amongst the soldiers and dissension between the consuls. Paulus cast in Varro's teeth the recklessness of Sempronius and Flaminius;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Varro retorted that Fabius was a specious example for timid and slothful generals, and called on gods and men to witness that it was through no fault of his that Hannibal had by now acquired as it were a <pb id="p.349"/>prescriptive right to Italy, for he was kept in fetters<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> by his colleague, and the soldiers, enraged as they were and eager to fight, were deprived of swords and arms.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Paulus rejoined that if anything untoward should befall the legions, recklessly abandoned to an ill-advised and rash engagement, he would himself be guiltless of all blame, but would share in all the consequences; let Varro, he said, see to it, that where tongues were bold and ready, hands &mdash;when it came to fighting &mdash;were no less so.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they wasted time, rather quarrelling than consulting, Hannibal withdrew the rest of his troops, whom he had kept in line till far on in the day,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> into his camp, and sent the Numidians across the river to attack the men from the smaller Roman camp who were fetching water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had hardly come out upon the other bank when their shouts and tumult sent that unorganized rabble flying, and they rode on till they came to the party that was stationed in front of the rampart, and almost to the very gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So wholly outrageous, however, did it seem that by now even a Roman camp should be terrorized by irregular auxiliaries, that only one thing kept the Romans from crossing the river forthwith and giving battle &mdash;the fact that Paulus happened then to be in command.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The next morning, therefore, Varro, whom the lot had made commander for that day, hung out the signal, without saying a word of the matter to his colleague, and, making his troops fall in, led them over the river. Paulus followed him, for he could more easily disapprove the plan than deprive it of his help.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Once across, they joined to their own the <pb id="p.351"/>forces which they had kept in the smaller camp,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> and marshalled their battle-line as follows: on the right wing &mdash;the one nearer the river &mdash;they placed the Roman cavalry, and next them the Roman foot;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the left wing had on the outside the cavalry of the allies; and nearer the centre, in contact with the Roman legions, the infantry of the allies. The slingers and other light-armed auxiliaries were formed up in front.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls had charge of the wings, Terentius of the left, Aemilius of the right; and Geminus Servilius was entrusted with the centre.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal crossed the river at break of day, after sending ahead of him the Baliares and the other light-armed troops, and posted each corps in line of battle, in the order in which he had brought it over.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Gallic and Spanish horse were next the river, on the left wing, facing the Roman cavalry;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the right wing was assigned to the Numidian horse; the centre was composed of infantry, so arranged as to have the Africans at both ends, and between them Gauls and Spaniards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Africans might have passed for an array of Romans, equipped as they were with arms captured partly at the Trebia but mostly at Lake Trasumennus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Gauls and the Spaniards had shields of almost the same shape; their swords were different in use and in appearance, those of the Gauls being very long and pointless, whilst the Spaniards, who attacked as a rule more by thrusting than by striking, had pointed ones that were short and handy.<note>The Romans adopted this sword for their legionaries. It was provided with two sharp edges for cutting as well as with a point, and had a strong, firm blade (Polybius VI. xxiii. 7).</note> These tribes were more terrifying to look on than the others, because of the size of their bodies and the display they made of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Gauls <pb id="p.353"/>were naked from the navel up; the Spaniards had<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> formed up wearing crimson-bordered linen tunics that shone with a dazzling whiteness. The total number of the infantry who then took their place in line was forty thousand, of the cavalry ten thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The generals commanding on the wings were Hasdrubal on the left, Maharbal on the right; Hannibal himself, with his brother Mago, had the centre.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The sun &mdash;whether they had so placed themselves on purpose or stood as they did by accident &mdash;was, very conveniently for both sides, on their flanks, the Romans looking south, the Phoenicians north.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A wind &mdash;which those who live in those parts call Volturnus &mdash;beginning to blow against the Romans carried clouds of dust right into their faces and prevented them from seeing anything.<note>Note the repetition &mdash;apparently unconscious &mdash;of what was said at chap. xliii. &sect; 10.</note></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With a shout the auxiliaries rushed forward and the battle began between the light-armed troops. Then the Gallic and Spanish horse which formed the left wing engaged with the Roman right in a combat very unlike a cavalry action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For they had to charge front to front, there being no room to move out round the flank, for the river shut them in on one side and the ranks of infantry on the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both parties pushed straight ahead, and as the horses came to a standstill, packed together in the throng, the riders began to grapple with their enemies and drag them from their seats. They were fighting on foot now, for the most part; but sharp though the struggle was, it was soon over, and the defeated Roman cavalry turned and fled.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Towards the end of the cavalry engagement the <pb id="p.355"/>infantry got into action. At first they were evenly<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> matched in strength and courage, as long as the Gauls and Spaniards maintained their ranks;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but at last the Romans, by prolonged and frequent efforts, pushing forward with an even front and a dense line,<note>Polybius says (III. cxv. 6) that <quote>they had crowded up from the wings to the centre, where the fighting was going on.</quote> Consequently their line was much <hi rend="italics">deeper</hi> than that of their adversaries.</note> drove in the wedge-like formation<note>This is called by Polybius (III. cxiii. 8) <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> <quote>a crescent-shaped convexity.</quote> Kromayer rightly insists that this expression must not be taken literally, and understands it of a formation in echelon (see Schlachten-Atlas I., columns 23 and 26, and his map reproduced as No. 7 in this volume.)</note> which projected from the enemy's line, for it was too thin to be strong;
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and then, as the Gauls and Spaniards gave way and fell back in confusion, pressed forward and without once stopping forced their way through the crowd of fleeing, panic-stricken foes, till they reached first the centre<note><hi rend="italics">in mediam aciem</hi> is a puzzling phrase, as it ought to mean the same thing as the projecting wedge which constituted the Carthaginian centre. But the Romans had already driven in this wedge. Livy perhaps means that the Romans have now reached a point where they are level with the two flanks (consisting of Africans) and midway between them.</note> and ultimately &mdash;for they met with no resistance &mdash;the African supports.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These had been used to form the two wings, which had been drawn back, while the centre, where the Gauls and Spaniards had been stationed, projected somewhat. When this wedge was first driven back so far as to straighten the front, and then, continuing to yield, even left a hollow in the centre, the Africans had already begun a flanking movement on either side, and as the Romans rushed incautiously in between, they
				<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> enveloped them, and presently, extending their wings, crescent-wise, even closed in on their rear.<note>Polybius (III. cxv. 9) gives a somewhat different account of this man&oelig;uvre. According to him the Africans
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> &mdash;who must have been drawn up in a line so deep as to be more like a column &mdash;merely <hi rend="italics">faced</hi> inward, as the Romans pursued the fleeing Gauls and Spaniards, and charged them on both flanks.</note> From this moment the Romans, who had gained one battle to no purpose, gave over the <pb id="p.357"/>pursuit and slaughter of the Gauls and Spaniards and<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> began a new fight with
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the Africans. In this they were at a twofold disadvantage: they were shut in, while their enemies ranged on every side of them; they were tired, and faced troops that were fresh and strong.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By this time the Roman left, where the cavalry of the allies had taken position facing the Numidians, was also engaged, though the fighting was at first but sluggish. It began with a Punic ruse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About five hundred Numidians, who, in addition to their customary arms and missiles, carried swords concealed under their corslets, pretended to desert.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Riding over from their own side, with their bucklers at their backs, they suddenly dismounted and threw down bucklers and javelins at the feet of their enemies. Being received into the midst of their ranks they were conducted to the rear and ordered to fall in behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And while the battle was getting under way at every point, they kept quite still; but no sooner were the minds and eyes of all absorbed in the struggle, than they snatched up the shields which lay strewn about everywhere amongst the heaps of slain, and assailing the Romans from behind and striking at their backs and hamstrings, effected a great slaughter and a terror and confusion that were even greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And now in one place there was a panic rout and in another an obstinate though hopeless struggle,<note>The <quote>panic rout</quote> was on the Roman left (the Roman right had already been annihilated), the <quote>obstinate though hopeless struggle</quote> at the centre.</note> when Hasdrubal, who commanded in that part of the field, withdrew the Numidians from the centre &mdash;since they fought but half-heartedly against men who met them face to face &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> dispatching them in pursuit of the scattered fugitives, sent in the Spanish and Gallic cavalry to help the <pb id="p.359"/>Africans, who were now almost exhausted, though<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> more with slaying than with fighting.<note>The Numidians (both the five hundred and the main body of them) after routing the Roman left had presumably swung round to attack the Roman centre, when Hasdrubal withdrew them from the battle to use them as pursuit troops, replacing them with the cavalry originally posted on the Punic left, which after defeating the Roman cavalry (chap. xlvii. &sect;&sect; 1-3) had presumably ridden round the Roman centre and joined the Numidians. The episode of the five hundred (not mentioned by Polybius) is perhaps derived from the account of Coelius Antipater. Appian (VII. iv. 22) describes the ruse as being executed by five hundred Celtiberians (foot-soldiers in the Punic centre).</note></p> <p>

Here <hi rend="italics">Parte altera</hi> is the centre &mdash;where Livy thinks of Paulus as having taken over the command from Servilius.</note> Paulus, although he had received a severe wound from a sling at
						<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the very outset of the battle, nevertheless repeatedly opposed himself to Hannibal,<note>That is, the Punic centre.</note> with his men in close formation, and at several points restored the
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> fight. He was guarded by Roman cavalry, who finally let their horses go, as the consul was growing too weak even to control his horse. At this Hannibal, being told by someone that the consul had ordered his troopers to dismount, is said to have exclaimed: <quote>How much better if he had handed them over to me in
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> fetters!</quote><note>An ironical intimation that, since the consul's order amounted to depriving his troopers of any hope of escape, he might as well have surrendered them at once and saved Hannibal all further trouble.</note> The dismounted horsemen fought as men no longer doubting that the enemy must be
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> victorious. They were beaten, but chose rather to die where they stood than to run away; and the victors, angry that their victory was thus delayed, cut them down, when they could not rout them. But they routed them at last, when only a few were left, exhausted with fighting and with
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> wounds. The survivors were now all dispersed, and those who could attempted to regain their horses and escape.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Gnaeus Lentulus, a tribune of the soldiers, as he rode by on his horse, caught sight of the consul sitting on a stone and covered with
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> blood. <quote>Lucius <pb id="p.361"/>Aemilius,</quote> he cried, <quote>on whom the gods ought to look<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> down in mercy, as the only man without guilt in this day's disaster, take this horse, while you have still a little strength remaining and I can attend you and raise you up and guard
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> you. Make not this battle calamitous by a consul's death; even without that there are tears and grief enough.</quote></p> <p>To this the consul answered, <quote>All honour, Cornelius, to your
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> manhood! But waste not in unavailing pity the little time you have to escape the enemy. Go, and tell the senators in public session to fortify the City of Rome and garrison it strongly before the victorious enemy draws near: in private say to Quintus Fabius that Lucius Aemilius has lived till this hour and now dies remembering his
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> precepts. As for me, let me breathe my last in the midst of my slaughtered soldiers, lest either for a second time I be brought to trial after being consul,<note>Chap. xxxv. &sect; 3.</note> or else stand forth the accuser of my colleague, blaming another in defence of my own
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> innocence.</quote> While they were speaking, there came up with them first a crowd of fleeing Romans, and then the enemy, who overwhelmed the consul, without knowing who he was, beneath a rain of
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> missiles. Lentulus, thanks to his horse, escaped in the confusion. The rout was now everywhere complete. Seven thousand men escaped into the smaller camp, ten thousand into the larger, and about two thousand into the village of Cannae
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> itself. These last were immediately cut off by Carthalo and his cavalry, for the village was not fortified. The other consul, whether by accident <pb id="p.363"/>or by design, had not joined any throng of fugitives,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> but fled to Venusia with some fifty
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> horsemen.</p> <p>It is said that forty-five thousand five hundred foot and two thousand seven hundred horse were slain, in an almost equal proportion of citizens and
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> allies.<note>The other ancient accounts give the numbers as follows: Eutropius (III. 10) 40,000 foot and 3500 horse; Appian (VII. iv. 25) and Livy himself in three speeches (chap. lix. &sect; 5; chap. lx. &sect; 14 and xxv. vi. 13) as well as Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">Fab.</hi> 16), 50,000 men; Quintilian (VIII. vi. 26), 60,000 men; Polybius (III. cxvii. 4), 70,000.</note> In the number were the quaestors of both consuls, Lucius Atilius and Lucius Furius Bibaculus, and twenty-nine military tribunes,<note>There would have been forty-eight when the battle began (six for each legion), assuming that there were eight legions, as some of Livy's authorities held (chap. xxxvii. &sect; 2).</note> some of consular rank, some of praetorian or aedilician &mdash;amongst others are mentioned Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Marcus Minucius, who had been master of the horse in the preceding years and consul several years before<note><date value="-221">221 B.C.</date></note>

							<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> legions. The prisoners taken in this battle are said to have numbered three thousand foot-soldiers and fifteen hundred horsemen.</p> <p>
								<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
								<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the battle of Cannae, a calamity as memorable as that suffered at the Allia, and though less grave in its results &mdash;because
								<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the enemy failed to follow up his victory &mdash;yet for the slaughter of the army even more grievous and disgraceful.
								<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For <pb id="p.365"/>the flight at the Allia, though it betrayed the City,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> saved the army: at Cannae the consul who fled was accompanied by a scant fifty men; the other, dying, had well-nigh the entire army with him.</p> <p>In the two Roman camps the crowd was half-armed and destitute of leaders. The men in the larger camp sent a messenger bidding those in the smaller one come over to them in the night, while the enemy, exhausted by the fighting and by the feasting that had followed on
									<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> their triumph, were sunk in sleep: they would then set out in one body for Canusium.
									<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This plan some were for totally rejecting. Why, they asked, did not those who summoned them come themselves to the smaller camp, where they could just as well effect a junction? Clearly because the ground between was covered with enemies and they preferred to expose to such danger the persons of others rather than their own. Some were not so much displeased with the plan as wanting in resolution.
									<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then said the military tribune Publius Sempronius Tuditanus: "So you had rather be captured by the greediest and most cruel of foes, and be appraised at so much a head by those who ask, 'Are you a Roman citizen or a Latin ally?' in order that from the insults and misery you suffer, the other may win distinction?<note>An allusion to the story told in chap. vii. &sect; 5.

									<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> 'Not so!' each man will answer, if you are indeed fellow citizens of Lucius Aemilius the consul, who preferred an honourable death to life with ignominy, and of all those heroes who lie in heaps around him!
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But before daylight surprises us and the enemy blocks our way in greater force, let us break out through these men that are clamouring in disorder and confusion at our gates.
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With a <pb id="p.367"/>sword and a stout heart a man may pass through<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> enemies, be they never so thick. In close formation<note><hi rend="italics">cuneus</hi> (literally <quote>wedge</quote>) is a technical term sometimes used to designate a body of men drawn up in fighting column, in order, as here, to force a way through the enemy's lines (Caesar, <hi rend="italics">B.G.</hi> VI. xl. 2).</note> you may scatter this loose and unorganized force as though there were nothing in your way.

									<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> These things the conquered did rather from the urge of such courage as each derived from his own nature or from chance than in consequence of their own deliberation or any man's authority.</p> <p>
										<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
										<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hannibal's officers crowded round him with congratulations on his victory. The others all advised him, now that he had brought so great a war to a conclusion, to repose himself and to allow his weary soldiers to repose for the remainder of that day and the following night.
										<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But Maharbal, the commander of the cavalry, held that no time should be lost. <quote>Nay,</quote> he cried, <quote>that you may realize what has been accomplished by this battle, in five days you shall banquet in the Capitol! <pb id="p.369"/>Follow after; I will precede you with the cavalry,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> that the Romans may know that you are there before they know that you are coming!</quote>
										<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To Hannibal the idea was too joyous and too vast for his mind at once to grasp it. And so, while praising Maharbal's goodwill, he declared that he must have time to deliberate regarding his advice.
										<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then said Maharbal, <quote>In very truth the gods bestow not on the same man all their gifts; you know how to gain a victory, Hannibal: you know not how to use one.</quote> That day's delay is generally believed to have saved the City and the empire.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The morning after, as soon as it was light, they pressed forward to collect the spoil and to gaze on a carnage that was ghastly even to enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There lay those thousands upon thousands of Romans, foot and horse indiscriminately mingled, as chance had brought them together in the battle or the rout. Here and there amidst the slain there started up a gory figure whose wounds had begun to throb with the chill of dawn, and was cut down by his enemies;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> some were discovered lying there alive, with thighs and tendons slashed,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> cut down from behind as they fled. Cf.

				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Others were found with their heads buried in holes dug in the ground. They had apparently made these pits for themselves, and heaping the dirt over their faces shut off their breath.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But what most drew the attention of all beholders was a Numidian who was dragged out alive from under <pb id="p.371"/>a dead Roman, but with mutilated nose and ears;<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> for the Roman, unable to hold a weapon in his hands, had expired in a frenzy of rage, while rending the other with his teeth.<note>cf. Dante's Ugolino, <hi rend="italics">Inferno,</hi> xxxii.</note></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After spending a good part of the day in gathering spoils, Hannibal proceeded to attack the smaller camp. The first thing that he did was to throw up an entrenchment which cut them off from the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But they were all so tired out from fighting and lack of sleep, as well as from wounds, that they surrendered even sooner than he had expected. The terms agreed upon were as follows: they were to give up their arms and horses; the ransom was fixed at three hundred chariot-pieces for every Roman, two hundred for every ally, and one hundred for every slave;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> on the payment of this price they were to go free, with a single garment each.<note>The chariot-pieces were silver <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> stamped with a Jupiter in a four-horse chariot. This money was used not only by the Romans, who coined it, but by their allies, who had been denied the right to coin silver since <date value="-268">268 B.C.</date> The ransom of the citizen would be roughly equivalent in weight of silver to $50 or &pound;10.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They then received their enemies into the camp and were all placed in custody, citizens being separated from allies. During the delay there, those in the larger camp who possessed sufficient strength and courage, amounting to four thousand foot and two hundred horse, had escaped, some in a body, others scattering &mdash;no less safely &mdash;over the country-side, and reached Canusium. The camp itself the wounded and timorous surrendered to the enemy on the same terms as the other.<note>Polybius (III. cxvii.) gives a very different story. According to him ten thousand Romans were left in camp when the battle was fought, with orders to attack the camp of Hannibal. Hannibal, however, had left a garrison in his own camp and they held the Romans at bay, till Hannibal, having now gained the battle, came up and rescued them, killing two thousand of the Romans and afterwards making the rest of them prisoners.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It yielded enormous spoils, and except for <pb id="p.373"/>the horses and men and such silver as there was &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> which was mostly on the harness of the horses, for they then used very little plate, especially when in the field &mdash;the rest of the booty was all given up to pillage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then commanded the bodies of his dead to be brought into one place for burial. It is said that they numbered about eight thousand of his bravest men. Some historians state that the Roman consul, too, was sought out and given burial.<note>For similar legends of Hannibal's generosity see XXV. xvii. 4, XXVII. xxviii. 1. and chap. vii. &sect; 5 of this book.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Those who escaped to Canusium were aided by an Apulian woman of birth and fortune named Busa. The townspeople had merely afforded them the protection of the walls and shelter, but she provided them with corn, clothing, and money for the way, in return for which munificence she was afterwards, on the conclusion of the war, voted honours by the senate.<note>Valerius Maximus (IV. viii. 2) says that the woman supplied about ten thousand Romans with food without wrecking her fortune. The name Busa is Oscan.</note></p> <p>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now though there were four tribunes of the soldiers on the ground &mdash;Quintus Fabius Maximus of the first legion, whose father had been dictator the year before, Lucius
				<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Publicius Bibulus and Publius Cornelius Scipio of the second legion, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who had very recently been aedile, of the third legion &mdash;the
				<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> supreme command was by unanimous consent made over to Publius Scipio, the merest youth,<note>He was about nineteen years old (XXI. xlvi. 7 and Polybius x. iii. 4).</note> and to Appius Claudius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These two were considering the general situation, in company with a few others, when Publius Furius Philus, the son of an ex-consul, came in and told them that they were idly entertaining a lost hope; the state was already given over and mourned as dead;
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> some of the young <pb id="p.375"/>nobles, of whom Marcus Caecilius Metellus was the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> chief, were looking to the sea and ships, proposing to abandon Italy and flee for refuge to some king.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These evil tidings, dreadful in themselves and coming as a new distress on the top of so many disasters, stunned those who heard them with a dull amazement. But when they would have called a council to talk the matter over, young Scipio, the predestined leader in this war, declared that it was no matter for taking counsel:
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> they must be bold and act, not deliberate, in the face of this great evil; let them take arms and go with him at once, as many as wished to save the state;
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> no camp was so truly the camp of the enemy as one where such thoughts were rife.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He proceeded, with only a few followers, to the quarters of Metellus, where he found a gathering of the young men of whom he had been informed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Raising his sword over their heads, as they sat in consultation, <quote>I solemnly swear,</quote> he said, <quote>that even as I myself shall not desert the republic of the Roman People, so likewise shall I suffer no other Roman citizen to do so;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> if I wittingly speak false, may Jupiter Optimus Maximus utterly destroy me, my house, my family, and my estate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Marcus Caecilius, I call on you and the others who are present to swear after these terms, and if any refuse to swear, let him know that against him this sword is drawn.</quote>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Quaking as though they beheld the victorious Hannibal, all took the oath, and delivered themselves into the custody of Scipio.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was happening at Canusium, about four thousand five hundred horse and foot, who had scattered over the country-side in flight, <pb id="p.377"/>made their way to Venusia, to the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> All<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> these the inhabitants distributed amongst various families where they might be kindly received and cared for, and bestowed on each horseman a toga and a tunic and twenty-five chariot-pieces, and on each foot-soldier ten pieces, together with arms, where they were needed.<note>From Polybius VI. xix. 12 we learn that the cavalryman received pay at the rate of a denarius <hi rend="italics">per diem,</hi> and the infantryman one-third as much. It appears then that the present given to the soldiers
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> &mdash;if the toga and tunic of the cavalryman be reckoned in &mdash;amounted to about one month's pay. (The toga was then worn even by soldiers when in garrison or in winter quarters.)</note> In all other matters, too, they dealt hospitably by them, both as a town and as individuals, in their zeal that the People of Venusia should not lag behind a Canusian woman in friendly offices.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But the great multitude was beginning to be too heavy a burden upon
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Busa &mdash;and indeed there were now as many as ten thousand men<note>month's pay. (The toga was then worn even by soldiers when in garrison or in winter quarters.)</note> &mdash;and Appius and Scipio, when they learned that the other consul was alive, immediately dispatched a messenger to let him know what forces of infantry and cavalry they had with them, and at the same time to enquire whether he desired the army to be brought to Venusia or remain
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> at Canusium. Varro transferred his own troops to Canusium; and they now had something resembling a consular army, and might look to defend themselves against the enemy, behind walls, at all events, if not in
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the field.</p> <p>But at Rome it was reported that not even these pitiful remnants of citizens and allies survived, but that the army with its two consuls was clean destroyed and all their forces
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> blotted out. Never, save when the City had been captured, was there such terror and confusion within the walls of Rome. I shall therefore confess myself unequal to the task, <pb id="p.379"/>nor attempt a narrative where the fullest description<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> would fall short of the truth. The year before a consul and his army had been lost at Trasumennus, and now it was not merely one blow following another, but a calamity many times as great that
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> was reported; two consuls and two consular armies had been lost, and there was no longer any Roman camp, or general, or soldier; Hannibal was master of Apulia, Samnium, and well-nigh the whole
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of Italy. Surely there was no other people that would not have been overwhelmed by a disaster of such
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> vast proportions. Would you compare the disaster off the Aegatian islands, which the Carthaginians suffered in the sea-fight, by which their spirit was so broken that they relinquished Sicily and Sardinia and suffered themselves to become tax-payers and tributaries? or the defeat in Africa to which this very Hannibal afterwards succumbed? In no single aspect are they to be compared with this calamity, except that they were endured with less of fortitude.</p> <p>
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Publius Furius Philus and Marcus Pomponius, the praetors, called the senate together in the Curia Hostilia, to consult about the defence of Rome;
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for they made no doubt that the enemy, after wiping out their armies, would be advancing to besiege the City, which was all that remained to do to end the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when, amid dangers at once so immense and so incalculable, they failed to think of even any tolerable plan of action, and were deafened with the cries and lamentations of the women, both the living and the dead &mdash;in the lack as yet of any announcement &mdash;being
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> indiscriminately mourned in almost every house, then Quintus Fabius Maximus urged that light-armed horsemen be sent out along the Appian <pb id="p.381"/>and Latin ways, and questioning those they met &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> for some there would surely be who had dispersed and made off in the rout &mdash;bring back word of the fortunes of the consuls and the armies, and if the immortal gods, taking pity on the empire, had spared any remnant of the Roman name, where those forces were;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> whither Hannibal had gone after the battle, what his plans were, what he was doing and was likely to do.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To discover and ascertain these facts was a task, he said, for active youths; what the Fathers themselves must do, since there were not magistrates enough, was this: quell the panic and confusion in the City; keep the matrons off the streets and compel them each to abide in her own home;
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> restrain families from lamentation; procure silence throughout the City; see that bearers of any news were brought before the praetors &mdash;every man must wait at home for tidings that concerned himself;
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> &mdash;and, besides this, post sentries at the gates, to keep anyone from leaving the City, and make the people rest all hope of safety on the safety of Rome and of its walls. When the tumult had died down, then the Fathers must be convened again and consider how to defend the City.</p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After they had all voted for this proposal without debate, and the throng had been cleared out of the Forum by the magistrates, and the Fathers had dispersed in various directions to still the uproar, then at last came a dispatch from Gaius Terentius the consul, announcing that the consul Lucius Aemilius and his army had been destroyed;
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that he himself was at Canusium, collecting &mdash;as though after a storm at sea &mdash;the wreckage of that great disaster; that he had about ten thousand men, not organised <pb id="p.383"/>or assigned to companies;
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that the Phoenician was<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> sitting down at Cannae, haggling over the ransom of his prisoners and over the rest of the booty, exhibiting neither the spirit of a conqueror nor the behaviour of a great commander.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Announcement was then made from house to house of the losses they had each sustained, and the entire City was so filled with lamentation that the annual rite of Ceres was allowed to lapse, since it may not be performed by mourners, nor was there at that time a single matron who was not bereaved.
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Accordingly, lest for this same reason other public or private rites might be neglected, the senate decreed that mourning should be limited to thirty days.<note>The Cerealia, the chief festival in honour of Ceres, took place on April 19th. The reference in the text must be to another, otherwise unknown, festival, as the battle of Cannae was fought on August 2nd.</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But when the confusion in the City had subsided and the Fathers had been summoned back to the senate-house, another dispatch was brought in from Sicily, from the propraetor Titus Otacilius.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He reported that Hiero's kingdom was being laid waste by a Punic fleet, and that when he would have responded to Hiero's appeal for help, he had got news of another fleet, that was standing off the Aegatian islands, all ready and equipped, so that when the Phoenicians should perceive that he had turned his back on them to go to the rescue of the Syracusan coast, they might instantly descend on Lilybaeum and the rest of the Roman province.

Of these one had been buried alive, as the custom is, near the Colline Gate, and the other had killed herself.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Cantilius, a secretary to the pontiffs &mdash;one
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> of those who are now called the lesser pontiffs &mdash;had been guilty with Floronia, and the Pontifex Maximus had him scourged in the Comitium so severely that he died under the blows.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since in the midst of so many misfortunes this pollution<note>Not the death of Cantilius, but the Vestals' violation of their vows.</note> was, as happens at such times, converted into a portent, the decemvirs were commanded to consult the Books, and Quintus Fabius Pictor<note>This was the annalist, who wrote a history of Rome in Greek.</note> was
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> dispatched to Delphi, to enquire of the oracle with what prayers and supplications they might propitiate the gods, and what would be the end of all their calamities.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the meantime, by the direction of the Books of Fate, some unusual sacrifices were offered; amongst others a Gaulish <pb id="p.387"/>man and woman and a Greek man and woman were<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> buried alive in the Cattle Market, in a place walled in with stone, which even before this time had been defiled with human victims, a sacrifice wholly alien to the Roman spirit.<note>Livy means that the sacrifice, prescribed by the Greek Sibylline Books, was a Greek and not a Roman rite. The earlier instance referred to in the text was in <date value="-228">228 B.C.</date> (Zonaras VIII. xix.).</note></p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Deeming that the gods had now been sufficiently appeased, Marcus Claudius Marcellus sent fifteen hundred soldiers whom he had under him, enrolled for service with the fleet, from Ostia to Rome, to defend the City; and sending before him to Teanum Sidicinum the naval legion (to wit, the third<note>In chap. liii. &sect; 2 the <quote>third</quote> legion is one of those which fought at Cannae. Possibly the naval legions were separately numbered, or (more probably) there had now been a new numbering of all the legions.</note> ) under its tribunes, handed over the fleet to his colleague Publius Furius Philus and a few days later hastened by forced marches to Canusium.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate then authorized the appointment of a dictator and Marcus Junius [Pera] was named to that office, with Tiberius Sempronius as master of the horse.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Proclaiming a levy they enlisted the young men over seventeen and some who still wore the purple-bordered dress of boyhood. Of these they made up four legions and a thousand horse. They also sent men to the allies and the Latins to take over their soldiers, as by treaty provided.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They gave orders that armour, weapons and other equipment should be made ready, and took down from the temples and porticoes the ancient spoils of enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The levy wore a strange appearance, for, owing to <pb id="p.389"/>the scarcity of free men and the need of the hour,<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> they bought, with money from the treasury, eight thousand young and stalwart slaves and armed them, first asking each if he were willing to serve.
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They preferred these slaves for soldiers, though they might have redeemed the prisoners of war at less expense.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For Hannibal, after his great victory at Cannae, had been more concerned with the projects of a conqueror than with those of one who was still waging war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Mustering the prisoners and dividing them into two groups, he addressed a few kindly words to the allies and dismissed them without ransom, as he had done previously at the Trebia and Lake Trasumennus. He then called up the Romans also and spoke to them with a mildness he had never shown before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was waging, he said, no war of extermination with them, but was contending for honour and dominion. His forerunners had yielded to the valour of the Romans, and he was striving to compel them in their turn to yield to his own good fortune and valour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He would therefore give them an opportunity to redeem the prisoners, and would fix their ransom at five hundred chariot-pieces for each horseman, three hundred for each foot-soldier, and a hundred for each slave.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Although this was a rather large addition to the ransom which the horsemen had agreed to on surrendering, they joyfully accepted any terms of treaty.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was resolved that the prisoners should themselves elect ten representatives to go to the senate in Rome; nor did Hannibal take any other pledge of their good faith than their oath that they would return.
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Carthalo, a Carthaginian noble, was sent with them, so that, if he should see that the <pb id="p.391"/>Romans inclined to peace, he might offer terms.<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The envoys had just left the camp when one of them, a fellow of thoroughly un-Roman character, returned to it &mdash;as if he had forgotten something &mdash;in order to free himself from his oath, and before dark had caught up with his companions.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the news reached Rome that they were coming, a lictor was sent to meet Carthalo on the way and warn him in the name of the Dictator to depart before nightfall out of Roman territory.</p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As for the envoys of the prisoners, the dictator admitted them into the senate, where their leader spoke as follows: <quote>Marcus Junius and Conscript Fathers, none of us is unaware that no state ever held prisoners of war in less esteem than ours.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But, unless we overrate our cause, there have never been men who came into the power of the enemy less deserving than ourselves of your neglect.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For we did not yield up our swords through fear on the field of battle, but standing on the heaped bodies of the slain prolonged the combat almost until nightfall and then retired to our camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The rest of the day and the succeeding night, though exhausted with fighting and with wounds, we defended the stockade.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the following day, surrounded by a victorious army and cut off from water, having no longer any hope of breaking through the throng of enemies, and thinking it no disgrace that when fifty thousand of our troops had been cut down, some few Roman soldiers should survive the battle of Cannae, we finally stipulated
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> for a price at which we might be ransomed, and delivered to the enemy the arms in which there was no longer any help.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even our ancestors &mdash;so we had heard &mdash;redeemed <pb id="p.393"/>themselves from the Gauls with gold; and your<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> fathers, despite their fierce opposition to terms of peace, sent envoys to Tarentum to ransom prisoners.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And yet neither the battle with the Gauls at the Allia nor that with Pyrrhus at Heraclea owed its unhappy fame so much to carnage as to craven flight. At Cannae the plains are covered with heaps of Roman corpses, and if we survive, it is only because our enemies' swords were dulled and their strength spent with slaughtering.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There are some of us, too, who were never even in the battle, but were left to guard the camp, and on its surrender passed into the enemy's hands.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Think not that I envy the good luck or circumstances of any fellow citizen or fellow soldier,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in one of the contingents of allies &mdash;the distinction is not between civilian and soldier, but between citizen soldier and allied soldier.</note> nor would I raise myself by thrusting another down; but &mdash;unless there be a prize for fleetness of foot and running &mdash;it is not those who, without weapons for the most part and fleeing from the fight, never stopped until they reached Venusia or Canusium that can justly set themselves above us or boast that they are better defenders of the state than
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> we. Both in them and in us you shall have good and valiant soldiers; but we shall be even more eager than they to defend our country, since we shall owe to your kindness our redemption and our restoration to that country. You are levying soldiers of every age and condition; I hear that eight thousand slaves are being
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> armed. Our number is not less than that, and our ransom would be no more costly than their purchase; I make no comparison between our worth and theirs, for that would be to insult the name of
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <pb id="p.395"/>Roman. One other point I would suggest, as meriting<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> consideration, when you deliberate about this matter, Conscript Fathers: if haply you should incline to deal harshly by us &mdash;which we do not in the least deserve &mdash;to what enemy would you be leaving us? To a Pyrrhus, pray, who treated his prisoners like
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> guests? or to a barbarian and Phoenician, of whom it can hardly be determined whether his avarice or cruelty be
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> greater? If you could behold the fetters, the squalor, the degradation of your fellow-citizens, assuredly the sight would move you no less profoundly than if, on the other hand, you saw your legions lying slaughtered on the fields of Cannae. One thing you can see &mdash;the distress and tears of our kinsmen who are standing at the entrance of the Curia awaiting your
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> decision. When these people are in such suspense and agony for us and for those who are absent, what think you the men themselves must feel whose life and liberty are hanging in the balance? If Hannibal &mdash;Heaven help
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> me! &mdash; should himself be pleased, against his nature, to show us mercy, we should nevertheless deem life a worthless boon, if we had seemed to you unworthy of being ransomed. There once came back to Rome some prisoners whom Pyrrhus had allowed to go scot-free; but they came back in company with envoys, the first men of the state, whom you had sent to ransom
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> them. Am I to come back to my country as a citizen not reckoned to be worth three hundred pieces? Every man, Conscript Fathers, has his own way of
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> thinking. I know that my life and person are in jeopardy; but I am troubled more by the danger to my honour &mdash;lest we depart under your <pb id="p.397"/>condemnation and rebuff; for the world will never<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> believe that you were niggardly about the cost.</quote></p> <p>
							<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
							<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as he had finished speaking, the throng in the Comitium began to utter doleful cries, and holding out their hands to the Curia besought the senators to give them back their sons, their brothers, and their kinsmen.
							<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Even the women had been driven by their fear and destitute condition to mingle in the Forum with the crowd of men.<note>The Comitium was an open area next to the Curia. Here stood the male relatives of the prisoners, and on the outskirts of the crowd (in the Forum, which lay just beyond the Comitium and sometimes, as in this sentence, is thought of as including it) their wives and mothers. The children were not admitted even to the Forum, as Livy implies when in the foregoing sentence in the text he omits the word <hi rend="italics">patres.</hi></note> The senate was cleared of strangers and the debate began.
							<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Opinions differed. Some were for ransoming the prisoners at the public cost; others would have no money disbursed by the state, but would not prohibit ransoming at the expense of individuals, and to such as might not
							<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> have the money in hand proposed to grant loans from the treasury, guarding the people against loss by taking sureties and mortgages.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then Titus Manlius Torquatus, a man of an old-fashioned and, as it seemed to many, a too harsh austerity, was called upon for his opinion and spoke as follows:</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><quote>If, in pleading the cause of those who are in the hands of our enemies, their representatives had been content to ask that they be ransomed, I should have said my say in a few words, without reflecting upon any of them; for what else need I have done than warn you to hold fast to the tradition of our fathers and teach a lesson necessary for military discipline?
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But as it is, since they have almost boasted of having surrendered to the enemy, and have held that they are to be preferred not only to those who were captured by the enemy in battle, but also to those who made their way to Venusia and Canusium, and <pb id="p.399"/>even to the consul, Gaius Terentius himself, I will<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> not permit you to be ignorant, Conscript Fathers, of any part of their conduct there.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And I wish that what I am going to say to you I might say at Canusium in the presence of the army itself, the most competent witness to any man's cowardice or valour, or that Sempronius, at least, were with us here, whose leadership if yonder men had followed, they would to-day be soldiers in a Roman camp, not prisoners in the hands of our enemies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But when the enemy, worn out with fighting, and rejoicing in their victory, had themselves for the most part gone back to their own camp and left the night free for a sally; though seven thousand armed men could have forced their way even through a close array of foes, they neither attempted to do this of themselves, nor yet were willing to follow another.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> During almost all that night Publius Sempronius Tuditanus ceased not to admonish and exhort them to let him lead them, while only a few of their enemies were near the camp, while everything was hushed and still, while the darkness might afford a cover for their enterprise. Before daylight, he declared, they could reach a place of safety among the towns of the allies.
				<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If he had said what, within the recollection of our grandsires, Publius Decius, tribune of the soldiers, said in Samnium; or what Marcus Calpurnius Flamma said, when we ourselves were young men, in the former Punic war, to three hundred volunteers whom he was leading to take a hill that rose in the very midst of the enemy: 'Soldiers, let us die, and by our death set free the beleaguered legions' &mdash;if
				<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Publius Sempronius had said <hi rend="italics">this,</hi> I should have deemed you no true men, to say nothing of Romans, <pb id="p.401"/>if none had come forward to share so brave an exploit.<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But instead he points out to you a road that leads to safety as surely as to fame. He proposes to restore you to your country, to your parents, to your wives and children. You lack even the spirit to be saved! What would you do then if your country called on you to die?
				<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Fifty thousand fellow Romans and allies lay slaughtered round you that very day. If so many brave examples could not move you, nothing ever will. If that dreadful carnage has not made life cheap, none ever will. Long for your country, whilst you are free and unattainted. Nay, rather, long for it whilst it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> your country, whilst you are reckoned with its citizens.
				<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Too late now is your longing; you have forfeited your status, lost your civic rights, been made slaves of the Carthaginians. Do you think to return, for ransom, to that condition which you forfeited by cowardice and turpitude?
				<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> You would not listen to Publius Sempronius, your fellow citizen, when he bade you arm and follow him; but you listened to Hannibal a little later, when he bade you betray the camp and surrender your arms. But why do I charge these men with cowardice when I could bring against them a charge of crime?
				<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For not only did they refuse to follow a man who gave them good advice, but they tried to thwart and hinder him; and those heroic men were forced to draw their swords and thrust the cowards from their path. Aye, Publius Sempronius must needs break through a band of Roman citizens before he could break through their enemies: Can their country wish to recover such citizens as these?
				<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> If the others had resembled these, she would possess to-day no single citizen of all those who fought at Cannae. Out of <pb id="p.403"/>seven thousand soldiers, six hundred were sufficiently<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> courageous to force their way through and return to their country, free and armed.
				<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Nor did these six hundred encounter any opposition from the enemy; how safe then, think you, would have been their march, if they had amounted almost to two legions?
				<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> You would have to-day under arms at Canusium, Conscript Fathers, twenty thousand brave and loyal men. But how can these men now be good and loyal citizens &mdash;for they themselves would hardly claim to be brave?
				<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Unless we are to believe that they helped their comrades to sally out, when in fact they tried to prevent the sally; or that they grudge not those men both the safety and the renown their courage has earned them, knowing, as they do, that fear and cowardice are the cause of their own disgraceful servitude. They had a good chance of escaping in the silence of the night, but preferred to hide in their tents and await both the day and the enemy.
				<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> But perhaps, though they lacked the courage to sally forth, they had courage enough for a valiant defence of the camp? Perhaps they were besieged for several days and nights, and protected the rampart with their swords, and themselves with the rampart?
				<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> and finally, after suffering the last extremities, when every support of life gave out and their strength was so impaired with hunger that they could now no longer hold up their shields, they were overcome by the necessities of human nature and not by arms?
				<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Nay, the sun was up when the enemy approached the rampart, and the day was not two hours old when, without once putting their fortune to the test of battle, they surrendered both their arms and their persons. Such, mark you, were <pb id="p.405"/>the exploits these men performed during two days.<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note>
				<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> When they ought to have stood fast in the line and fought, they fled to their tents; when they ought to have fought for their stockade, they surrendered the camp, worthless alike in the field and behind entrenchments.
				<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> And you would have us ransom you? When it is time to sally from your camp, you hesitate and stop there; when it is needful that you stop and defend it with your swords, you hand over camp and swords and your own bodies to the enemy!
				<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> No, Conscript Fathers, I would no more vote for ransoming these men than I would for giving those others up to Hannibal, who forced their way from the camp through the midst of enemies, and, by exerting the utmost valour, gave themselves back to their country.</quote></p> <p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the speech of Manlius, though most of the senators, too, had relatives amongst the prisoners, yet, besides the example of a state which had shown from of old the scantiest consideration for
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> prisoners of war, they were also moved by the greatness of the sum required, not wishing either to exhaust the treasury, on which they had already made a heavy draft to purchase slaves and arm them for service, or to furnish Hannibal with money<note>But the senate could not keep Hannibal from making money out of his prisoners. When the senate would not ransom them, he sold them into slavery, and Polybius (see Livy XXXIV. 1. 6) told how, in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date>, at the request of Flamininus, the Greek states bought up and liberated a great number of Roman prisoners who had been purchased from Hannibal. No less than twelve hundred were freed by the Achaeans alone, at a cost to their state of one hundred talents. Valerius Maximus (v. ii. 6), puts the whole number at two thousand, and doubtless thousands more had died in the course of twenty-two years.</note> &mdash;the one thing of which he was rumoured to stand most in need.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the stern reply, that the prisoners would not be ransomed, had gone forth, <pb id="p.407"/>and fresh sorrow had been added to the old, at the<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> loss of so many of their fellow-citizens, the crowd attended the envoys to the gate with many tears and lamentations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> One of them departed to his home, pretending to have freed himself from his oath when he deceitfully returned to the enemy's camp. As soon as this became known and was reported to the senators, they voted unanimously to arrest him and appointed guards to conduct him back to Hannibal.</p> 
			<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There is also another accounts<note>This seems to be a fusion of the account preserved by Appian (<hi rend="italics">Hann.</hi> 28), where the number of envoys is given as three, with the commoner version of the story, which speaks of ten. The combination may have been made by the C. Acilius who wrote a history in Greek in which he told of the battle of Cannae (Cicero, <hi rend="italics">De Officiis</hi> III. 115), and is perhaps the man whose name is given by the MSS. of the Summary of Book LIII. as c. iulius (cf. Schanz-Hosius, <hi rend="italics">R&ouml;mische Literaturgeschichte,</hi> I.4, p. 177).</note> of the prisoners of war: that ten envoys came at first, and that the senate, after hesitating whether or no to admit them to the City, admitted them, with the proviso that they should have no hearing.
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Later, on their delaying longer than anybody had anticipated, three additional envoys came, namely Lucius Scribonius and Gaius Calpurnius and Lucius Manlius; then at last a motion was made in the senate by a kinsman of Scribonius, who was tribune of plebs,<note>This was probably the L. Scribonius Libo mentioned at XXIII. xxi. 6.</note> that the prisoners be ransomed, but the motion was defeated;
				<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the three new envoys now returned to Hannibal, but the original ten remained in Rome, alleging that they had freed themselves of their obligation by going back to Hannibal's camp, after starting on their journey, under the pretext of reviewing the prisoners' names.
				<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A proposal to surrender them was hotly debated in the senate and was lost by only a few votes.
				<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> However, under the next censors the ten were so overwhelmed with every species of reprobation and disgrace that some of them killed themselves forthwith, and the rest <pb id="p.409"/>during all the remainder of their lives avoided not<note type="margin">B.C. 216</note> only the Forum, but, one might almost say, the light of day and the public streets.
				<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is more amazing that the authorities should be so divergent than easy to make out the truth.</p> <p>For the rest, how greatly this disaster exceeded those that had gone before is plain from this: the loyalty of the allies, which had held firm until the day of Cannae, now began to waver, assuredly for no other reason than because they had lost all hope of the empire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Now these are the peoples that revolted: the Campanians, the Atellani, the Calatini, the Hirpini, a part of the Apulians, all the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> Samnites but the Pentri, all the Bruttii, the Lucanians, and besides these the Uzentini and almost all the Greeks on the coast, the Tarentines, the Metapontines, the Crotoniates and the Locri, together with all the Cisalpine Gauls.<note>This list includes all the peoples of Italy who revolted at one time or another during the war with Hannibal.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Yet these disasters and the falling away of the allies could not induce the Romans anywhere to mention peace, either before the consul came to Rome or after his coming had turned men's thoughts anew to the calamity which they had suffered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> In that very hour there was such courage in the hearts of the citizens that when the consul was returning from that defeat for which he himself had been chiefly responsible, a crowd of all sorts and conditions went out to meet him on the way, and gave him thanks because he had not despaired of the state;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> whereas, had he been the commander of the Carthaginians, there was no punishment he would not have been compelled to suffer.<note>An allusion to the alleged Carthaginian custom of crucifying incompetent generals.

			<p>HANNIBAL, losing sleep continuously in the marshes,
				went blind in one eye, and reached Etruria after marching
				through the swamps for four days and three nights without repose. Gaius Flaminius the consul, a headstrong
				man, set out, against the warning of the auspices, after
				digging out the military standards which they had been
				unable to pull up, and after the horse which he had
				mounted had thrown him over its head; and, entrapped
				by Hannibal in an ambush at Lake Thrasymennus, was
				slain and his army cut to pieces. Six thousand men who
				had broken through the enemy's lines were thrown into
				chains through Hannibal's perfidy, notwithstanding the
				pledge which Atherbal<note>See note on text.</note> had given them. While the Romans were mourning at the tidings which had come
				of this calamity, two mothers died of joy on recovering
				the sons whom they had given up for lost. Because of
				this defeat a Sacred Spring was vowed, by the direction
				of the Sibylline Books.</p>
			<p>When, after that, Quintus Fabius Maximus, who had
				been sent out as dictator to oppose Hannibal, was loath
				to meet him in the open field, for he would not trust his
				soldiers, who had been cowed by these defeats, in a
				battle with an enemy emboldened by his victories;
				and was satisfied merely to thwart the efforts of Hannibal, by blocking his way; Marcus Minucius, the master
				of the horse, a rash and headstrong man, charging the
				dictator with sluggishness and timidity persuaded the
				people to decree that his own authority should be equal
				to that of the dictator. But, the army being divided
				between them, Minucius gave battle in an unfavourable
				position, and his legions were in great peril, when Fabius
				Maximus came up with his army and saved him. Won
				over by this generosity, he joined his camp to that of
				<pb id="p.413"/>
				Fabius, and, saluting him as his father, bade his army do
				the same.</p>
			<p>Hannibal, after laying waste Campania, was penned in
				by Fabius between the town of Casilinum and Mount
				Callicula. Binding twigs about the horns of oxen and
				setting them on fire, he frightened off the detachment of
				Romans stationed on Callicula, and so marched over the
				pass. It was Hannibal, too, who spared the farm of
				Quintus Fabius Maximus the dictator, when burning all
				that country-side, in order to make him suspected of
				being a traitor.</p>
			<p>Aemilius Paulus and Terentius Varro then became
				consuls and commanded the army which fought disastrously with Hannibal at Cannae. There were slain in that
				battle forty-five thousand Romans, including the consul
				Paulus, and ninety senators, and thirty others who had
				been consuls or praetors or aediles. After that some
				young nobles were plotting, in their despair, to abandon
				Italy, when Publius Cornelius Scipio, a tribune of the
				soldiers, who was later surnamed Africanus, held his drawn
				sword over the heads of the conspirators and vowing that
				he would treat as a public enemy whoever should not
				swear at his dictation, compelled them all to bind themselves with an oath not to abandon Italy.</p>
			<p>There were so few soldiers that they armed eight
				thousand slaves. They were given an opportunity of
				ransoming the prisoners, but did not ransom them.</p>
			<p>The book also describes the panic and grief in the City,
				and the operations, conducted more successfully, in Spain.
				The Vestals Opimia and Florentia were convicted of
