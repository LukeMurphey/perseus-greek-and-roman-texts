					<p>I regret&mdash;though I have good ancient precedent&mdash;
						that my first volume must begin with an explanation
						which is at the same time a warning and an apology.
						There is at the present no critical edition of the
						Fourth Decade. Only a beginning has been made in
						the investigation of such questions as the interrelationships of the minor MSS. or their relations to <hi rend="italics">B,</hi> or the
						history and character of the lost MSS. like M which
						were used by sixteenth-century scholars. All this
						must precede a sound critical text. The situation
						offers an unusual temptation to conjecture and an
						unusual opportunity, in the absence of precise and complete information about the manuscripts, to introduce
						subjective changes. Scholars have shown commendable restraint, and I trust that I have at least done no
						harm to the text.</p>
					<p>We may judge the state of our text by the proper
						nouns it contains. There are few proper names in
						this volume which are printed as they appear in the
						manuscripts; few on which the manuscripts generally
						agree. In this respect our text is due mainly to
						Sigonius, who employed the various forms in which
						the names are found in Livy and external aids to
						recover the correct names. I have not sought either
						consistency or completeness in recording these facts,
						but content myself with a few specimens and a general
						reference to Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller for further details.
						<pb n="x"/>
						It must be granted that not a few local and personal
						names are still uncertain.</p>
					<p>A critical edition, based on new collations of all the
						manuscripts and on studies of their interrelations,
						was not to be thought of under existing conditions.
						I have therefore made use of the best and most convenient text, that of the latest Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller
						printing (Teubner, 1930). The critical notes are
						drawn entirely from secondary sources, such as the
						same edition, without personal examination of the
						MSS. I have, however, introduced changes of three
						kinds: (1) I have restored some readings of <hi rend="italics">B,</hi> and,
						less frequently, of <hi rend="italics">M,</hi> without remark. Variations
						from the Weissenborn-M&uuml;ller text, if not reported,
						are of this type, and I have not taken advantage of
						this to include conjectures of my own; (2) I have
						sometimes replaced conjectures with readings of <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign>;
						these are reported; (3) I have re-punctuated the text
						to secure a higher degree of conformity with Anglo-
						Saxon practice.</p>
					<p>With the exception of proper nouns, already
						mentioned, and of certain minor differences (I suspect
						that in some of these <hi rend="italics">B</hi> has been misread), I have tried
						in the critical notes to indicate all readings which lack
						the authority of <hi rend="italics">B</hi> or <hi rend="italics">M,</hi> that is, all readings derived
						from <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> or from conjecture. This seems to me
						especially important when we consider the probable
						relationship of <hi rend="italics">B</hi> <foreign lang="greek">s.</foreign> It will be seen that the contribution of <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> to the text is large. I have no doubt that
						<hi rend="italics">B</hi> is more frequently right than we now recognize,
						and I shall at least have provided the information
						now available regarding the manuscripts. I may add
						that my own contribution to the textual criticism of
						Livy is negative: I have not replaced readings of <hi rend="italics">B</hi>
						<pb n="xi"/>
						with those even of <foreign lang="greek">s</foreign> without trying to find an explanation of the text of <hi rend="italics">B.</hi></p>
					<p>The foundation of the text of the Fourth Decade
						is <hi rend="italics">B</hi> (Bambergensis <hi rend="italics">M,</hi> IV. 9, s. 11), which is a direct
						and faithful descendant of F (Bambergensis Q, IV. 27,
						Theol. 99), an uncial fragment containing parts of
						Books XXXIII, XXXV and XXXIX; from <hi rend="italics">F</hi> was
						derived also, through a lost intermediate, the codex
						Spirensis, and from another copy of the same intermediate, the minor MSS. (<foreign lang="greek">s</foreign>). A codex Moguntinus,
						not descended from <hi rend="italics">F,</hi> and assigned to the ninth
						century, was used in sixteenth-century editions,
						notably the Moguntina of 1518 and the Frobenianae
						of 1531 and 1535. An additional fifth-century fragment, containing a small part of Book XXXIV, and
						representing a different tradition, has been found in
						Rome (Vaticanus Lat. 10696). The beginning of a
						textual criticism of these MSS. was made by Traube
						(see the Bibliography; there is a stemma on p. 27),
						but relatively little has been done on the manuscripts,
						and the details of the interrelations are still uncertain.</p>
					<p>I need hardly say that I have tried in the translation
						to preserve Livy's meaning and as much of his stylistic
						quality as my own limitations and the differences in
						our idiom will permit. Livy was no statesman nor
						civil servant, and he did not always understand the
						institutions he was describing; he was no soldier, and
						the semi-technical language of his sources he did not
						always understand. In this respect I have been
						perhaps unfaithful to my task, for I have used at times
						a soldier's language to describe a soldier's actions,
						and while searching for the appropriate words I fear
						I have been more exact than Livy was. I have
						generally Latinized non-Latin proper nouns, except
						<pb n="xii"/>
						in those cases where the Greek forms are more
						familiar, such as <quote>Delos</quote>; Italian place-names are
						modern Italian or ancient Latin, and it would be
						mere pedantry to write anything but <quote>Rome</quote> and
						<quote>Athens.</quote></p>
					<p>The narrative of the Fourth Decade is not always
						easy to follow. Livy did not understand it himself
						at every point, and his ignorance of foreign geography
						and local topography caused confusion in his descriptions; his lack of acquaintance with warfare made it
						hard for him to visualize battle scenes; his sources
						were not always in agreement, and Livy had no
						efficient protection in the form of tests for credibility.
						The artistic form which he selected was an additional
						handicap, for he had to transpose into annalistic form,
						modified, of course, by geographical, rhetorical and
						logical forces, events described by different men,
						following different chronological systems, all different
						from the calendar of Livy's own time. I have tried
						to furnish clues to his sequences, and these clues have
						been furnished mainly by Polybius, whom I believe
						to have been Livy's principal source.</p>
					<p>The maps have been prepared for this Volume by
						Mr. Joseph A. Foster of the Department of Classics
						of the University of Pittsburgh. It has been our
						intention to show on them those sites mentioned by
						Livy which can be located with reasonable accuracy
						and to omit other geographical and topographical
						details. The map of Cynoscephalae is adapted from
						the plan in Kromayer (<hi rend="italics">Antike Schlachtfelder in
							Griechenland,</hi> II, Karte 4, Berlin, 1907), and my
						gratitude is due the publisher, the Weidmannsche
						Buchhandlung, for permitting its use.</p>
					<p>In the preparation of the Index I have enjoyed the
						<pb n="xiii"/>
						competent assistance of two former students, Dr.
						Mildred Daschbach, of Immaculata Seminary, Washington, D.C., and Dr. Eugene W. Miller, of Thiel
						College, Greenville, Pa. To them I express my
						thanks, and I acquit them of all responsibility for
						imperfections: part of them are my fault, part
						Livy's.</p>
					<p>I have paid relatively little attention to the
						troublesome question of Livy's sources, so violently
						debated since the time of Niebuhr. The numerous
						papers which belong to this controversy impress me
						as admirable in purpose and method, but, to judge
						from the contradictory character of their conclusions,
						somewhat futile in result. Livy's use of Polybius,
						especially for affairs in the East, seems to be universally accepted; I should be inclined to believe
						that Livy used Polybius freely in other parts of the
						text as well. The manner and extent of Polybius'
						use of Roman sources are likewise debatable. Livy's
						use of earlier Roman annalists may be assumed,
						although we can be less sure of details. I have not
						tried to reproduce the attempts of scholars to trace
						particular sections to particular annalists: their
						results seem from their inconsistency to be too
						precarious to warrant my adoption of any one scheme.
						The inquirer will find in the Bibliography below
						mention of some of the most important discussions,
						all of which contain additional references. To these
						should be added the standard histories which deal
						with the Second Macedonian War and the standard
						histories of Latin literature. All supplement the
						brief Bibliography which I give.</p>
					<p>Probably, as an indication of my own point of view,
						I should state briefly my judgment of Livy and his
						<pb n="xiv"/>
						work. I share with most scholars, I think, the belief
						that Livy is greater as a literary artist than as an
						historian. I believe further that Livy could have
						taken more pains than he did to learn and to state
						what happened: he had, I am sure, more tests of
						relative credibility than he employed. I recognize
						too that he sometimes obscured the truth behind a
						curtain of rhetoric. Yet even in his desire to reflect
						glory upon Rome or upon individuals whom he
						respected and admired, I cannot find signs of
						deliberate manipulation of facts to permit more
						favourable inferences. And finally&mdash;and this is
						purely subjective&mdash;I seem to see in him a growing
						dissatisfaction with the Romans, a growing feeling
						that even in the second century Roman character was
						degenerating, and that even their most distinguished
						men were at times petty, self-centred, and more
						considerate of their own advancement than of the
						good of Rome. He was appalled, as he says at the
						beginning of this volume, by the size of the task that
						remained, and, I think, saddened by the character of
						the events he had still to describe. It was not easy
						to translate, and it was not easy to compose, this
						narrative and to remain an optimist regarding Rome.</p>
					<p>I would conclude with an expression of my deep
						gratitude to the Editors and Publishers of the Loeb
						Classical Library for their unchanging helpfulness.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>Introductory note</head>
					<p>It is impossible to follow the narrative of the
						Macedonian Wars without some understanding of the
						political situation in the East, and equally impossible
						to describe that situation in a manner both brief and
						truthful.</p>
					<p>The empire of Alexander had broken up into three
						major divisions, the parent kingdom of Macedonia,
						the Seleucid empire, and the kingdom of the Ptolemies. Macedonia had lost much of Greece in the
						century after Alexander, and Philip V, its ruler at
						this time, was trying desperately to regain it. The
						Seleucid ruler was Antiochus III, who controlled
						Syria and much of the interior of Asia Minor. Moreover, in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> the death of Ptolemy Philopator and
						the accession of the young Ptolemy Epiphanes gave
						Philip and Antiochus the opportunity to make a
						treaty dividing his territory between them. The
						third division, the kingdom of the Ptolemies, included
						Egypt and certain coastal cities in Asia Minor.</p>
					<p>In addition, there were, in Asia, the republic of
						Rhodes and the kingdom of Pergamum. Rhodes was
						small but respected and influential. Its commercial
						interests caused it to prefer peace to war, but its
						sympathies were Greek and democratic. Pergamum
						was small but rich and powerful.</p>
					<p>Greece was controlled by four major powers: the
						young republic of Athens; the Aetolian League in
						central Greece; the Achaean League in the Peloponnesus; and the cities garrisoned by Philip or in
						<pb n="xviii"/>
						sympathy with him. The peace of the Peloponnesus
						was constantly menaced by tyrants, especially in
						Sparta, and the cumbersome federal organization of
						the Achaean League was powerless to control them,
						especially since Corinth was in Macedonian hands.
						There were, furthermore, pro-Macedonian and anti-
						Macedonian factions in almost all the cities, and
						changes in political control, and so in international
						relations, were frequent.</p>
					<p>This confusion is now increased by the intervention
						of Rome. The Second Macedonian War, with which
						this volume is mainly concerned, was fought in the
						council-chamber quite as effectively as on the battlefield. Yet Rome's policy was by no means obvious
						to her, and her motives for engaging in the war were
						uncertain even to the Romans who made the decision.
						They were just beginning to feel the charm of classical
						Greek culture, but their traditional policy of isolation
						drew them away. Their generals and statesmen were
						inexperienced in the diplomatic subtleties of the
						older world. The Greeks welcomed their military
						assistance, yet resented their presence in Greece as
						an independent power.</p>
					<p>It may seem clear to us that Rome had only two
						courses of action open to her: to allow the eastern
						states to destroy one another without interference,
						or to assume complete control of the eastern Mediterranean. Yet Rome could not see the situation so
						simply, and if she seems to have no clearly conceived
						policy, we should attribute the fact to her sudden
						precipitation into eastern politics, to her inexperience
						in foreign relations of this kind, to her physical and
						spiritual exhaustion after the war with Hannibal, and
						to her national tradition.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For while it is not at all fitting that one who has ventured to promise to write the whole history of Rome should grow wearied in dealing with the single portions of so great a task, nevertheless, when I reflect that sixty-three years &mdash;the space between the outbreak of the First and the end of the Second Punic War<note>The dates of the events referred to are, respectively, <date value="-267">267 B.C.</date> and <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>, by Livy's reckoning, or, according to the usual chronology (which is retained in the marginal dates), <date value="-264">264 B.C.</date> and <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date></note> &mdash;have
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> filled as many books<note>Books I-XV contained the narrative of the earlier period; Books XVI-XXX covered the First and Second Punic Wars.</note> for me as were required for the four hundred and
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> eighty-seven years from the founding of the city to the consulship of Appius Claudius (who began the first war with the Carthaginians), already I see in my mind's eye that, like men who, attracted by the shallow water near the shore, wade out into the sea, I am being
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> carried on, whatever progress I make, into depths more vast and, as it were, into the abyss, and that the task almost waxes greater <pb id="p.5"/>which, as I finished each of the earlier portions,<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> seemed to be growing smaller.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Punic peace was followed by the Macedonian war, which, although in no wise comparable as regards its danger, or the prowess of the leader,<note>Philip V, king of the Macedonians, was not to be compared with the Carthaginian Hannibal.</note> or the strength of the military forces employed, yet, because of the fame of Macedonia's ancient kings<note>Livy thinks especially of Philip II, founder of Macedonian power, and of Alexander the Great, who had conquered an empire greater than that of Carthage.</note> and the ancient glory of the nation and the vast extent of its empire, in which
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> it had at one time gained by its arms dominion over large portions of Europe and the greater part of Asia, was almost more celebrated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now the war with Philip,<note>Philip V had come to the Macedonian throne in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date> at the age of 17, and had continued the aggressive policy of his regent, Antigonus. As an ally of the Achaean League, the Macedonians had fought a successful war against the Aetolian League (see Introductory Note), and in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date> concluded an alliance with Hannibal by a treaty of which Polybius (VII. xix) preserves some clauses. Meanwhile Philip was pursuing an ambitious policy towards Athens and other Greek states. By <date value="-214">214 B.C.</date>, Rome seems to have recognized that something like a <quote>state of war</quote> existed (XXIV. xl. 1), but in this passage Livy dates the actual hostilities from <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>, when Rome made a treaty with Philip's old enemies, the Aetolians (XXVI. xxiv. 10). Philip's treaty of peace with the Aetolians is dated <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> by Livy (XXIX. xii. 1), but we may perhaps explain his <quote>three years</quote> on the assumption that it was not ratified until the next year, Livy's chronology is often confused, as a result of unskilful handling of annalistic sources. The so-called Second Macedonian War, the account of which begins here, was practically ended by the battle of Cynoscephalae in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. vi-x; Polyb. XVIII. xx-xxvii), but lasted diplomatically until <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xxxii). Thereafter Philip pursued a policy of alternating friendship and hostility towards Rome until his death in <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date></note> begun about ten years before this time, had some time before been laid aside for a period of three years, the Aetolians being the cause of the truce as they had been of the beginning of hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then later the Romans, being at last unoccupied by any war, as a result of the peace with Carthage, and being indignant with Philip both because of the treacherous peace which he had concluded with the Aetolians<note>See the preceding note for the peace of <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date>, which might seem due to the treachery of the Aetolians rather than of Philip. Rome was so occupied by the war against Hannibal that the Aetolians had to bear all the burden of keeping up the war against Philip. The failure of the Romans to aid them is frequently mentioned in the diplomatic conferences of the next years.</note> and the other allies in that region, and because of <pb id="p.7"/>the military assistance and money which he had<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> recently<note>Livy (XXX. xxvi. 3) reports the rumour that troops had been sent to Hannibal, and in XXX. xxxiii. 5 lists Macedonians among his allies.

				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the same time, ambassadors both from King Attalus of Pergamum and from the Rhodians arrived in Rome and brought word that the cities of Asia also were being stirred up to discontent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To these embassies the senate replied that they would look into the matter, and the whole question of the Macedonian war was referred to the consuls<note>They were Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Aelius Paetus.</note> who were then in the provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Meanwhile three ambassadors, Gaius Claudius Nero, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, were sent to King Ptolemy<note>Ptolemy Epiphanes, now nine years old and on the throne for the past four years.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> critical time, when even allies nearer home had revolted, he had remained loyal, and to ask that if the Romans, compelled by their wrongs, should declare war on Philip, he should preserve his ancient attitude toward the Roman people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At about the same time the consul, Publius Aelius, who was in Gaul, having learned that before his arrival the Boi had been raiding the fields of the allies,<note>Many of the tribes of Cisalpine Gaul had joined Hannibal (XXI. xxv. 2, etc.), and the subjugation of the region had begun anew.</note> enrolled an emergency force of two legions, to deal with this uprising, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> adding to them four cohorts from his own army, he ordered Gaius Ampius, <pb id="p.9"/>the commander of the allied forces, to take this<note type="margin">B.C. 201</note> improvised force and with it to invade the territory of the Boi, marching by way of Umbria, through the district known as the <hi rend="italics">tribus Sapinia.</hi><note>A local name for a district south of Ravenna. <hi rend="italics">Sapinia</hi> is not the name of one of the Roman political divisions known as tribes.</note> Aelius himself led his forces thither by the open road over the mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ampius, after entering the enemy's country, at first conducted raids with considerable success and without losses; then, choosing, near the fortified town of Mutilum, a camp-site suitable for reaping the crops &mdash;for the grain was now ripe &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> set out without reconnoitring the neighbourhood or establishing sufficiently strong posts of armed men to protect the unarmed parties who were intent upon the work, and, when the Gauls made an unexpected attack, he and his foragers were surrounded. Thereupon terror and panic laid hold even of those who were under arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> About seven thousand men, scattered through the grain-fields, were killed, among them Gaius Ampius himself, the officer in command; the rest were driven by terror into the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thence, on the next night, there being no one definitely in command, the soldiers by general consent abandoned most of their possessions, and travelling through well-nigh impassable forests rejoined the consul.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the five hundred and fifty-first year from B.. 200 the founding of the city, in the consulship of Publius Sulpicius Galba and Gaius Aurelius, war was declared against King Philip, a few months after peace had been granted to the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the Ides<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> March 15, on which date, after <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date>, the new magistrates assumed office.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> magistrates were inaugurated at that period, the consul Publius Sulpicius first of all offered a motion, which the senate passed, that the consuls should perform a sacrifice of full-grown victims to whatever gods should seem best to them, and should at the same time make this prayer:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>Whatever the senate and the Roman people shall resolve for the common good and with reference to beginning a new war, may this decision turn out well and happily for the Roman people, the allies, and the Latin name;</quote><note>Used collectively for the Latin colonies, privileged self-governing communities, which furnished complete military units to Rome.</note> that after the sacrifice and prayer they should lay before the senate the question of the public weal and of the provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In these days two things <pb id="p.17"/>occurred opportunely for arousing popular sentiment<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> in favour of the war: the arrival of the dispatches from the commissioner Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Laevinus the propraetor, and the coming of a new embassy from the Athenians, which brought word that the king was approaching
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> their borders and that in a short time not only their farms but Athens itself would be in his power unless there should be some assistance from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the consuls had reported that the sacrifices had been duly performed and that the gods had given approval to their prayers, that the soothsayers had given answer that the entrails were propitious and portended an extension of territory, victory, and a triumph, then the letters of Valerius and Aurelius were read and the Athenian embassy given audience.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate next decreed that the allies should be thanked because, though long harassed, they had not been led even by fear of siege to break their faith;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> with regard to sending aid, it was the senate's intention to answer their appeal when the consuls had been allotted their provinces and that consul to whom the province of Macedonia had fallen had proposed to the people a declaration of war upon Philip, King of the Macedonians.<note>While the senate at this time practically controlled the government at Rome, the formal act of declaring war required affirmative action by the <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata,</hi> the ancient assembly organized along military lines by Servius Tullius. The senate's selection of Macedonia as a consular province, although Rome had no jurisdiction over that territory, indicated clearly its intention to aid the Athenians against Philip, but it lacked the authority to begin the war on its own initiative. The details of the procedure in the assembly are given in the following sections.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Macedonia was assigned by lot to Publius Sulpicius as his province, and he submitted to the popular assembly the question whether they wished and ordered that war be declared upon King Philip and the Macedonians over whom he ruled, on account of the injuries he had inflicted and the war he had made on the allies of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> To the other consul, Aurelius, the province of Italy <pb id="p.19"/>was assigned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Next the praetors<note>The praetorship had been established in <date value="-366">366 B.C.</date>; a second praetor was added in <date value="-242">242 B.C.</date> (Per. XIX), and two more in <date value="-227">227 B.C.</date> (XXII. xxxv. 5). One of them, the <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus</hi> (see note to iv. 1 above), tried cases in which only Roman citizens were involved; a second was frequently assigned to to preside over cases between citizens and aliens (<hi rend="italics">praetor peregrinus</hi>); the rest were given the less important territorial provinces.</note> received their<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> assignments, Gaius Sergius Plautus the praetorship of the city, Quintus Fulvius Gillo the governorship of Sicily, while Bruttium fell to Quintus Minucius Rufus and Gaul to Lucius Furius Purpurio. The motion regarding the Macedonian war was defeated at the first meeting of the assembly by the votes of almost all the centuries.<note>The <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata</hi> consisted of units of (theoretically) one hundred men each, each century having one vote.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This action was taken spontaneously by men who were worn out by a war of long duration and great severity, so weary were they of hardships and perils; furthermore, Quintus Baebius, the tribune of the plebs, pursuing the once-usual course<note>The tribunate was originally created to provide protection for the plebeians against aristocratic injustice. The tribunes, however, had gradually been converted into agents of the aristocracy, since the senate learned that their power could be used against, as well as for, the commons. Baebius has resumed the original policy of opposition to and obstruction of senatorial measures.</note> of attacking the Fathers, had taunted them with sowing the seeds of war upon war, that the common people might never enjoy peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate was annoyed at this; the tribune was assailed with abuse in the senate, and each member independently urged the consul to summon the assembly again to consider the motion, to upbraid the people for its supineness, and to make clear what danger and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> disgrace such postponement of the war would cause.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul therefore, at the meeting in the Campus Martius,<note>The <hi rend="italics">comitia centuriata</hi> had once been practically identical with the army, and since the holding of the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> (cf. the note on iii. 2) was forbidden within the <hi rend="italics">pomerium,</hi> or religious limits of the city, this assembly met outside those limits, in the plain formed by the swing of the Tiber river to the right.</note> calling an informal meeting<note>The <hi rend="italics">comitia</hi> voted, but did not debate. If there was to be discussion &mdash;in any case only those spoke who were invited to do so by the presiding officer &mdash;it took place in an informal <hi rend="italics">contio</hi> held prior to the meeting of the formal <hi rend="italics">comitia.</hi> The membership and place of meeting of a <hi rend="italics">contio</hi> were identical with those of the <hi rend="italics">comitia</hi> which it preceded.</note> <pb id="p.21"/>before he put the question to the centuries,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> spoke<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> thus: <quote>It seems to me, citizens, that you do not realize that the question before you is not whether you will have peace or war &mdash;for Philip will not leave that matter open for your decision, seeing that he is preparing a mighty war on land and sea &mdash;but whether you are to send your legions across to Macedonia or meet the enemy
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> in Italy. What a difference that makes, if you never knew before, you found out at least in the recent Punic war. For who doubts that if, when the Saguntines were besieged and were invoking our protection, we had promptly sent aid to them, as our fathers did to the Mamertines,<note>These Italian mercenaries in Sicily appealed for aid to Rome against Syracuse and her Carthaginian supporters. The First Punic War was the result of Rome's decision to assist them (Per. XVI; Polyb. I. vii. ff.).</note> we should have diverted the whole war to Spain, whereas by our delay we admitted it to Italy, with infinite losses
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> to ourselves? Nor is there any doubt in the case of this same Philip, when he had already bargained with Hannibal, through ambassadors and by means of letters, to invade Italy, that when we sent Laevinus with a fleet to begin an offensive campaign against him, we kept him
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> in Macedonia. And that which we did then, when we had Hannibal fighting in Italy, do we hesitate to do now, when Hannibal has been driven out and the
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Carthaginians conquered? Let us permit the king by the capture of Athens, as we permitted Hannibal by the capture of Saguntum, to see how slow we are
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to act: not in five months, as when Hannibal came from Saguntum, but in five days after he sets sail from Corinth, Philip will arrive
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> in Italy! You need not compare Philip with Hannibal nor the Macedonians with the Carthaginians; you will compare him at least with Pyrrhus.<note>Cf. the notes on i. 6 and iii. 6 above.</note> Compare, did I say? How great is the superiority, <pb id="p.23"/>man to man or nation
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> to nation! Epirus<note>Epirus, in north-western Greece and adjacent to Macedonia, was the home of Pyrrhus.</note> has always<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> been and is to-day a mere appendage to the Macedonian empire. Philip has under his control the whole of the Peloponnesus and Argos itself, famed not so much in ancient story as for the death
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of Pyrrhus.<note>The ancient city of Argos is less important, to Sulpicius, for the traditions that gathered around it than for the reason that Pyrrhus met his death in a street-fight there about <date value="-272">272 B.C.</date></note> Now compare our situation: How much more prosperous was Italy, how much greater her resources; her leaders alive, so many armies intact, which the Punic war later destroyed. Yet when Pyrrhus attacked he shattered her at a blow and came a conqueror almost to the gates
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> of Rome!<note>For rhetorical effect Sulpicius magnifies somewhat the importance of Pyrrhus's early victories and neglects to mention the final Roman victory. Pyrrhus did defeat the Romans in several battles and did win the support of the Greek south of Italy.</note> Not only the Tarentines and that part of the Italian coast which men call' Greater Greece,' so that one would expect them to have followed the Greek language and name, but the Lucanian, the Bruttian, the Samnite revolted
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> from us. Do you think that these peoples will remain quiet and steadfast if Philip invades Italy? 'Yes,' you say, ' for they did in the later Punic war.' Never will these peoples fail to revolt unless there is no enemy at hand for them
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> to join. If you had been reluctant to invade Africa, you would have Hannibal and the Carthaginians fighting in Italy to-day. Let Macedonia, not Italy, have war; let it be the enemy's farms and cities that are laid waste with fire and sword. We have already learned from experience that our arms are more fortunate and powerful abroad than
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> at home. Go to vote, then, with the blessing of the gods, and ratify what the senate
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> has proposed. It is not the consul alone who supports this opinion before you: the immortal gods themselves favour it, for when I offered sacrifice and prayer that this war should turn out successfully for <pb id="p.25"/>me, the senate and for you, for the allies and the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Latin confederacy, and for our fleets and armies, they gave all favourable and propitious signs.</quote></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech they were dismissed to vote and ordered the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A three-day period of supplication was then declared by the consuls on the authorization of the senate, and the gods were implored at all their seats,<note>At the <hi rend="italics">lectisternium,</hi> or feast of the gods, the images of the divinities were placed upon gaily-decorated couches (<hi rend="italics">pulvinaria</hi>) and served with food: cf. XXII. i. 15, etc.</note> that this war which the people had declared upon Philip might succeed and prosper.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The fetials<note>Members of a college of priests whose especial concern was the proper performance of the prescribed formalities involved in a declaration of war or the conclusion of a treaty.</note> were consulted by the consul whether they would direct that the declaration of war against King Philip be delivered to him in person, or whether it was sufficient to announce it at the first fortified post in his territory. The fetials replied that in whichever way he acted he would act correctly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul was permitted by the Fathers to send anyone he chose, other than a senator, to declare war upon the king. They then took up the question of armies for the consuls and praetors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls were authorized to enrol two legions each and to discharge the veterans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sulpicius, to whom had been assigned the command in a new and important war, was allowed to enlist volunteers, as he could, from the army brought back from Africa by Publius Scipio, but was permitted to enrol no veteran against his will.<note>This restriction was apparently disregarded; cf. XXXII. iii. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To each of the praetors, Lucius Furius Purpurio and Quintus Minucius Rufus, the consuls were to give five thousand allies of the Latin confederacy, and with these garrisons they were to guard their provinces of Gaul and Bruttium respectively.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Quintus Fulvius Gillo likewise was authorized to draft soldiers from <pb id="p.27"/>the army which Publius Aelius had commanded as<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> consul, choosing those who had been in the ranks for the shortest periods, until he too had made up the number of five thousand of the allies and the Latin confederacy; this force was to garrison the province of Sicily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The command of Marcus Valerius Falto, who, as praetor, had held the province of Campania the year before, was extended for a year, so that, as propraetor, he should cross to Sardinia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> he too was to enlist, from the army there, five thousand of the allies and the Latin confederacy, choosing those who had served for the shortest periods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consuls were authorized to enrol two city legions as well, to be sent wherever need arose, since many tribes of Italy had been affected by the contagion of the Punic war and were in a restless state. Thus Rome proposed to use six legions that year.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the midst of the preparations for the war, ambassadors arrived from King Ptolemy, to say that the Athenians had asked the king's aid against Philip,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but that, although they were allies in common, the king would send no fleet or army to Greece to defend or attack anyone without the authorization of the Roman people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> he would either remain quiet at home, if the Romans planned to defend their allies, or permit the Romans to stay at home, if they preferred, and himself send such forces as could easily defend Athens against Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate thanked the king, saying that it was the intention of the Roman people to defend its allies; if need of anything for this war arose, they would inform the king, knowing that the resources of his kingdom were firm and trustworthy supports of the republic. Gifts of five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each were then presented to the ambassadors by order of the senate.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><pb id="p.29"/>
				<p>While the consuls were levying troops and preparing<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> what was needful for the war, the state, ever concerned with religion, especially at the outset of new wars, having held thanksgivings and offered prayers at all the seats
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> of the gods, that nothing might be left undone which had ever been done before, ordered the consul to whom the province of Macedonia had been assigned to vow games and a gift to Jupiter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A delay in the matter of this public vow was caused by Licinius the pontifex maximus, who said that a vow for an indefinite sum was not allowable; that a specific sum<note>The point which Licinius makes becomes clear when we recall the scrupulous exactness with which the Romans satisfied all their obligations to the gods. Licinius is responsible for the precision and propriety of the language used in the vow, and he fears that if the Romans make a vague and indefinite promise the gods will make a vague and indefinite response. Whatever the intention may have been, a vow of this sort inevitably assumes, to the outsider, the aspect of a bargain.</note> should be vowed, because this money could not be used for war, but should be set aside at once and not mixed with other moneys; if this happened, he said, the vow could not be fulfilled in strict conformity to its terms. Although the consul was moved both by the argument and its author, he was nevertheless directed to appeal to the college<note>The pontiffs as a body had final jurisdiction as interpreters of the <hi rend="italics">ius divinum,</hi> or body of ordinances controlling the relations of men to gods.</note> of priests, to learn whether a vow for an indeterminate sum could properly be undertaken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The pontiffs replied that it was possible and even more correct.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul, at the dictation of the pontifex maximus, recited his vow in the language formerly used in connection with the quinquennial games,<note>When the <hi rend="italics">ludi Romani</hi> (cf. the note on iv. 5 above) became annual, special attention was devoted to those occurring every fifth year.</note> with the exception that he promised games and a gift of an amount to be determined by the senate at the time the vow was paid.<note>These games were held in <date value="-194">194 B.C.</date>: cf. XXXIV. xliv. 6.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The great games had been vowed eight times before for definite sums; this was the first vow for an indefinite amount.<note>These statements cannot be verified.</note></p> <pb id="p.31"/>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the thoughts of all were concentrated<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> on the Macedonian war and fearful of nothing less at the moment, news came of an uprising in Gaul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Insubres, the Cenomani, and the Boi had roused the Celines, the Ilvates and the other Ligustini, and these tribes, under the leadership of Hamilcar the Carthaginian, who had remained in that region, a survivor of Hasdrubal's army, had attacked Placentia.<note>The Latin colonies of Placentia and Cremona, in the valley of the Po, had been established in <date value="-218">218 B.C.</date> to aid in subjugating and holding Cisalpine Gaul.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After plundering the city and burning most of it in their fury, they had left barely two thousand men alive among the flames and ruins, and then had crossed the Po and gone to destroy Cremona.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The news of the disaster to the neighbouring city gave the colonists time to close the gates and man the walls, so that, in spite of these measures, a siege began before the town was assaulted and before they could send messengers to the Roman praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Lucius Furius Purpurio was then governor of the province, and had discharged the rest of his army by order of the senate, retaining only five thousand of the allies and the Latin confederacy; with these troops he was encamped in the vicinity of Ariminum, in the part of the province nearest Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He thereupon sent a message to the senate, telling in what confusion the province was: one of the two colonies which had escaped the mighty storm of the Punic war had been captured and sacked by the enemy, the other was besieged;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> his own army would be too weak to assist the colonists in their need, unless the senate wishes to deliver five thousand allies to be butchered by forty thousand enemies &mdash;for so many were in arms &mdash;and the minds of the enemy, already puffed up by the destruction of a Roman colony, to be further encouraged by the slaughter of so many of his own men.</p> <pb id="p.33"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When this news came, the senate voted that<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Gaius Aurelius the consul should order that the army, for which he had
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> designated a date on which to assemble in Etruria, should come together the same day at Ariminum, and that either Aurelius himself, if the interests of the state permitted, should set out to suppress the Gallic revolt, or else he should notify
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the praetor that when the legions from Etruria joined him he should send in their stead five thousand of the allies, to serve as a temporary garrison for Etruria, and that he himself should march to raise the siege of the colony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate also voted that ambassadors be sent to Africa on a mission to Carthage and likewise to Masinissa in Numidia.<note>Masinissa, king of the Massylii, had fought against the Romans in Spain, but had been won over by Africanus and had served effectively in the last campaigns of the war. His dominions were enlarged by the peace treaty (XXX. xliv. 12). His friendship with the Scipios and his vigour in extreme old age made him a familiar figure in Latin literature.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their message to the Carthaginians was that their fellow-citizen Hamilcar, left in Gaul &mdash;it was not certainly known whether he was from Hasdrubal's earlier army or the later expedition of Mago<note>The two brothers of Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Mago, had invaded Italy in <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> and <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXVII. xxxix. 2 ff.; XXVIII. xlvi. 7 ff.). Cf. x. 2 above.</note> &mdash;was
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> making war contrary to the treaty and had raised armies of Gauls and Ligures against the Roman people; if they wanted peace they should recall him and surrender him to the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At the same time they were ordered to give notice that the Roman deserters had not all been restored to them, but that, according to report, many of them were openly living at Carthage; these were to be sought out and arrested, for return to Rome according to the treaty. Such was their mission to Carthage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As to Masinissa, they were ordered to congratulate him because he had not only recovered his ancestral possessions but had also <pb id="p.35"/>enlarged them by the addition of the most prosperous<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> part of the territory of Syphax.<note>Syphax, king of Numidia, had been a Roman ally but had gone over to Carthage and expelled Masinissa from his own kingdom. He died a prisoner in Italy, just before or just after Scipio's triumph (XXX. xlv. 4-5), leaving the remnants of his kingdom to Vermina.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were also to say that war with King Philip had been begun, because he had sent aid to Carthage;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> because he had, by attacking the allies of the Roman people when Italy was being consumed by the flames of war, compelled the dispatch of fleets and armies to Greece, and, by dividing their forces, had been a chief cause of postponing the invasion of Africa. They were to ask that Masinissa send assistance in the form of Numidian cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Ample gifts &mdash;vases of gold and silver, a purple toga, a tunic adorned with palms, an ivory sceptre, a robe of state and a curule chair &mdash;were given them to be presented to the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The ambassadors were directed to promise him that if he pointed out anything he needed to strengthen and enlarge his kingdom, the Roman people would make every effort to secure it for him, in recognition of his services to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At this time ambassadors to the senate came also from Vermina, the son of Syphax, who sought to make excuses for his mistakes, which were due to his youth, and placing all the blame for them on the bad faith of the Carthaginians:
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Masinissa, they said, had become a friend to the Roman people after having been their enemy; so Vermina too would strive earnestly not to be outdone by Masinissa or anyone else in services to the Roman people; they asked that he be named king and ally and friend by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The senators replied to the ambassadors that his father Syphax, once an ally and friend, had suddenly and without cause become an enemy of the Roman people; that Vermina himself had spent the beginnings of his youth in harassing the Romans in war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Therefore he should seek peace from the <pb id="p.37"/>Roman people before asking for recognition as king<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> and ally and friend, the honour of which titles the Roman people usually conferred in return for conspicuous services towards themselves on the part of kings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Roman ambassadors, they said, would soon be in Africa, whom the senate would instruct to offer terms of peace to Vermina, who was to leave full discretion thereon to the Roman people; if he wished anything added to, taken from, or modified in, these terms, he should make a new request to the senate. The ambassadors sent to Africa with these instructions were Gaius Terentius Varro, Spurius Lucretius and Gnaeus Octavius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> One quinquereme was assigned to each.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A letter from Quintus Minucius, the praetor in charge of the province of Bruttium, was then read in the senate: money had been stealthily removed at night from the treasure-house of Persephone at Locri, nor were there any clues as to the perpetrators of the crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate was indignant that such sacrileges should continue to be committed, and that even the case of Pleminius,<note>Pleminius, while in command of the garrison at Locri in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>, had plundered this same temple, and had been severely punished. The story of his sacrilege and its penalty was related in XXIX. xviii-xxii incl.</note> so recent an example of crime and its punishment, did not deter criminals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul Gaius Aurelius was directed to communicate to the praetor in Bruttium the senate's desire that the plundering of the treasury should be investigated in the manner adopted by the praetor Marcus Pomponius<note>Pomponius, as governor of Sicily, had investigated the charges against Pleminius: cf. the preceding note.</note> three years before; that any money discovered be restored; that if there was any shortage, it should be made up, and that, if he saw fit, expiatory sacrifices should be performed as the priests had prescribed in the previous case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The concern to atone for the violation of this temple was increased by the prodigies which were reported in <pb id="p.39"/>numerous parts of the country at the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Lucania, flames in the sky were reported; at Privernum, the sun shone red throughout the day in clear weather; at Lanuvium, in the temple of Juno Sospita, a mighty noise was heard during the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Further, dread forms of animals were reported in several places: among the Sabines, a child of uncertain sex was born, while another was found whose sex, at the age of sixteen, could not be determined. At Frusino there was born a lamb with a pig's head, at Sinuessa a pig with a man's head, on the public land in Lucania, a colt with five feet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All these disgusting and monstrous creatures seemed to be signs that nature was confusing species; but beyond all else the hermaphrodites caused terror, and they were ordered to be carried out to sea, as had been done with a similar monstrosity not long before in the consulship of Gaius Claudius and Marcus Livius.<note>Consuls in <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> (XXVII. xxxvii. 6).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nevertheless, the decemvirs<note>A special college of priests entrusted with the guardianship and consultation of the ancient Sibylline Books, which were frequently appealed to for advice under circumstances like these.</note> were ordered to consult the Books regarding the portent. They, as a result of the investigation, ordered the same rites that had been performed when such a prodigy had appeared before. In addition, they directed that a hymn be sung throughout the city by thrice nine maidens, and that an offering be made to Queen Juno.<note>The number three has, as often, a ritualistic significance. Juno is propitiated as a goddess concerned with birth.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Gaius Aurelius the consul saw to the performance of these rites in accordance with the answer of the decemvirs. The hymn, composed in the memory of our fathers by Livius, was on this occasion written by Publius Licinius Tegula.<note>Livius Andronicus, whose name stands at the head of the chronological list of Latin writers, wrote the earlier hymn referred to here (cf.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> XXVII. xxxvii. 7, 13, where Livy names the poet and criticizes his style). The Licinius here named may be the same as the Licinius Imbrex who is said by Gellius (

				<p>XIII. When all these scruples had been allayed &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> for the sacrilege at Locri had been investigated by Quintus Minucius and the money replaced in the treasury out of the property of the guilty &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the consuls were on the point of leaving for their provinces, many private citizens, to whom was due this year the third payment on
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the loans made in the consulship of Marcus Valerius and Marcus Claudius,<note>These citizens, in <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> (XXVI. xxxvi. 8), loaned money to the state for the prosecution of the war with Hannibal, although from Livy's account they gave rather than loaned the money. In <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xvi. 1) an arrangement was made for repayment in three biennial instalments, the third of which would be due in <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date> Nevertheless, a final payment (perhaps to those who did not accept the arrangement described in sects. 6-9 below) was made in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (XXXIII. xlii. 2).</note> appealed to the senate because the consuls had declared that, since the treasury hardly sufficed for the new war, which was to be waged with a great fleet and large armies, there was no money at their command with which to make the payment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate could not resist their complaints: If the state wished to use for the Macedonian war, the petitioners argued, the money loaned for the Punic war, since one conflict followed hard upon another, what else would be the result than the confiscation of their property in return for an act of generosity, as if it had been a crime?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Since the request of these citizens was reasonable, and since nevertheless the state could
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> not repay the loan, the senate took an action which was midway between justice and expediency, namely, that, since many of the creditors said that there was much land for sale, to purchase which cash was needed, the opportunity should be given them to receive public land lying within the fiftieth milestone;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the consuls were to appraise this land and to impose an annual rental of one <hi rend="italics">as</hi> per <hi rend="italics">iugerum</hi><note>Since the value of the <hi rend="italics">as</hi> was about two cents, or one penny, and the <hi rend="italics">iugerum</hi> was about three-fifths of an acre, the rental was purely nominal and was imposed to prevent the transfer of the title to this land to the individual; this permitted the later optional settlement described below.</note> by way of attesting that this was public land;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> consequently, if anyone, when the state should be in funds, <pb id="p.43"/>should prefer money to the land, he could restore the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> land to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The creditors gladly accepted this offer, and the land was called <quote>trientabulum</quote> because it was allotted in discharge of one-third of the debts.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thereupon Publius Sulpicius, after the announcement of the vows on the Capitoline, left the city with his lictors in uniform,<note>One might expect <hi rend="italics">paludatus cum lictoribus;</hi> I have however retained the reading of the MSS.: cf. XLI. x. 5; 7; 13; XLV. xxxix. 11 (in the first of these Gronovius conjectured <hi rend="italics">paludatus sine lictoribus</hi>), in which the same phrase occurs.</note> arrived

His policy threatened both Pergamum and Rhodes (cf. the Introductory Note) and brought them into the war.</note> and was now trying his strength in naval battles with the Rhodians and Attalus, in neither case with conspicuous success;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> however, his spirits were kept up, partly by his naturally impetuous disposition, partly by a treaty<note>Cf. Polyb. III. ii. 8. The death of Ptolemy Philopator (cf. the note on ii. 3 above) gave Philip and Antiochus their apparent opportunity to expand at the expense of the boy Epiphanes. The treaty was probably made in <date value="-203">203 B.C.</date></note> which he had concluded with Antiochus, king of Syria, according to which the wealth of Egypt, which both coveted when they heard of the death of King Ptolemy, was soon to be divided between them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><pb id="p.45"/>
				<p>Now the Athenians<note>Livy here summarizes briefly and somewhat inaccurately the events leading up to Roman intervention in the east. In <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date>, in consequence of the treaty mentioned in sect. 5 above, Philip had begun operations against the Egyptian possessions in Thrace, northern Asia Minor, and the Cyclades. This brought him into conflict with Pergamum, already allied with Athens, and with Rhodes. At the approach of winter he had withdrawn to Europe, after a campaign somewhat more successful than Livy's account intimates. Athens was not immediately involved in this war, but was embroiled with Philip in the manner described in the following sections. The alignment is then: Philip and the Aetolian League <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Athens, Pergamum, Rhodes, Rome. Antiochus, allied with both Rome and Philip, was not involved directly, nor was Ptolemy, allied with Rome, although Philip's attack on his possessions precipitated the war.</note> had undertaken the war<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> against Philip for no sufficient reason, since they retained nothing of their ancient greatness except their spirit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two young men from Acarnania,<note>Acarnania, in the north-west, was a part of the Aetolian League.</note> during the celebration of the mysteries at Eleusis, though not initiated, had entered the temple of Ceres, ignorant that they were committing a sacrilege, and merely following the crowd.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Their words easily betrayed them, since they asked foolish questions, and though it was clear that they had come in openly and by mistake they were put to death as if they had committed some heinous crime.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Acarnanians reported this revolting and unfriendly act to Philip, and prevailed upon him to send them Macedonian aid and permit them to attack Athens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This army at first laid waste Attica with fire and sword and returned to Acarnania laden with every kind of booty. This was the original provocation; later regular war was declared and waged by decree of the state after formal notification.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Now when King Attalus and the Rhodians had arrived at Aegina in pursuit of Philip, who was retiring to Macedonia, Attalus crossed to Piraeus to renew and confirm his alliance with the Athenians.<note>See, for this alliance, XXIX. xii. 14.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The whole body of citizens,<note>Polybius (XVI. xxv. 5) similarly describes this scene.</note> with their wives and <pb id="p.47"/>children, poured out to meet him; the priests in their<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> vestments and the very gods, so to speak, starting up from their thrones, welcomed him as he entered the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The citizens were at once summoned to an assembly, that the king might declare publicly what he desired;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> then it seemed more consonant with his dignity that he should write his message, on whatever matters he pleased, than deliver it in person and be embarrassed by his own recital of his services to the state or by the extravagant applause and eulogies of the crowd, which would overwhelm his modesty with its uncontrolled adulation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The letter which was sent and read to the assembly contained, first, a review of his acts of generosity towards Athens;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> second, an account of the campaigns he had carried on against Philip, and, lastly, an exhortation to undertake the war against Philip while they had him, the Rhodians, and now particularly the Romans also as allies; in vain, later on, if they now hesitated, would they seek to grasp the opportunity they had let slip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Rhodian envoys were next heard, whose recent display of good-will had consisted in sending back four Athenian war-vessels which had, not long before, been captured by the Macedonians and recovered.<note>This is not confirmed by other testimony.</note> So by a roar of voices war was declared on Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Extravagant honours were conferred first upon Attalus and then upon the Rhodians as well. At this time occurs the first mention of the tribe which they called <quote>Attalis,</quote> to be added to the ten old tribes.<note>Livy's statement, if properly understood, is correct so far as it goes, but might be misleading unless supplemented by the facts which have been ascertained in recent years from the evidence furnished by the Attic inscriptions. The original ten tribes of Clisthenes were increased to twelve in 307/6 by the creation of Antigonas and Demetrias and to thirteen by the creation of Ptolemais between 229/8 and 222/1 (probably in 224/3 or 226/5). But in the early part of 201/0 Antigonis and Demetrias had been abolished, leaving eleven tribes. This number was therefore increased to twelve when Attalis was added in the latter part of 201/0. I owe this exact statement to the kindness of Mr. Sterling Dow, who refers to W. S. Ferguson, <hi rend="italics">Hellenistic Athens</hi> and W. B. Dinsmoor, <hi rend="italics">The Archons of Athens.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The people of <pb id="p.49"/>Rhodes, moreover, was presented with a golden crown, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the symbol of valour, and the Athenian citizenship was given the Rhodians, just as they had previously granted the same distinction to the Athenians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After this Attalus rejoined his fleet at Aegina; the Rhodians went back from Aegina to Cia, thence to Rhodes by way of the islands, receiving into their alliance all of them but Andros, Paros and Cythnos, which were held by Macedonian garrisons. Attalus was kept idle for some time in Aegina, by sending messengers to Aetolia<note>There was an alliance between Pergamum and the Aetolians: cf. XXVII. xxix. 10.</note> and waiting for ambassadors from there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But he could not induce them to declare war, since they felt satisfaction at the composition &mdash;however
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> accomplished &mdash;of their difficulties with Philip;<note>See note on i. 8 above.</note> and Attalus and the Rhodians, although, if they had pressed their campaign against Philip, they might have won the fair fame of having liberated Greece, by permitting him to cross again to the Hellespont and to increase his
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> army by the occupation of strongholds in Thrace, protracted the war and left to the Romans the glory of conducting and finishing it.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip displayed a spirit that more befitted a king.<note>At this point Livy begins the narrative of Philip's campaign of <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date> against the possessions of Ptolemy in Thrace (sects. 3-4) and the Thracian Chersonesus, to the north-west of the Hellespont (sects. 5 ff.). These events precede the arrival of the Romans in Greece (xiv. 2 above).</note> Though he had not withstood Attalus and the Rhodians, he was unterrified even by the threatening war with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sending Philocles, one of his prefects, with two thousand infantry and two hundred horse to harry the Athenian country, and entrusting a fleet to Heraclides, that
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> he might proceed to Maronea, he himself set out by land to that place with two thousand light-armed infantry <pb id="p.51"/>and two hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And Maronea, indeed, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> he took at the first assault; Aenus then, after great labour in besieging it, he finally captured through the treachery of Callimedes, the prefect of Ptolemy. Next he occupied other fortresses, Cypsela, Doriscus, and Serrheum. Proceeding thence toward the Chersonesus, he received in voluntary submission Elaeus and Alopeconnesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Callipolis too and Madytus were surrendered, and some unimportant strongholds. The people of Abydus,<note>See xiv. 4 above and the note.</note> not even admitting his ambassadors, closed their gates against the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This siege delayed Philip a long time, and the people could have been quickly relieved of the siege if Attalus and the Rhodians had not delayed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Attalus sent only three hundred soldiers for the garrison, the Rhodians one quadrireme from the fleet, although it was lying off Tenedos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Later, the city being by that time scarce able to resist the siege, when Attalus in person arrived there, he gave only the hope of aid from near by, but did not help the allies by either land or sea.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The citizens of Abydus<note>Livy seems to have borrowed the following account from Polybius (XVI. xxx &mdash;xxxiv).</note> at first, placing their artillery along the walls, not only on land denied approach to the assaulting parties, but rendered the anchorage of the fleet dangerous to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> enemy; later, when part of the rampart had been laid in ruins, and, in addition, mines had been driven almost to the inner wall which had been hastily constructed, they sent ambassadors to the king regarding terms of surrender for the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> city. They proposed, however, that they be allowed to send away the Rhodian quadrireme with the naval allies, and the garrison of Attalus, and that they be permitted to leave the city with one garment
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> each. <pb id="p.53"/>When Philip answered them that there would<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> no peace without their unconditional surrender, the message when reported kindled such passion, arising from anger and despair together, that, imitating
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the madness of the Saguntines, they ordered all the matrons to be shut up in the temple of Diana, the free-born boys and maidens and even the young babes with their nurses in the gymnasium, the gold and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> silver to be collected in the market-place and the valuable garments to be placed on the Rhodian and Cyzicene ships which were in the harbour, the priests and victims to be brought and the altars erected for
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> sacrifice. Then they chose certain men who, when they saw their soldiers slaughtered as they fought before the ruined wall, were forthwith to slay their wives and children, throw into the sea all the gold, silver and garments which
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> were in the ships, and set fire to the public and private buildings in every possible place. This crime they bound themselves by oath to commit, while the priests dictated to them the formula of
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> execration.<note>Such a formula invoked a curse upon anyone who failed to carry out whatever order had been given.</note> The soldiers then swore that no one would leave the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> battle-line alive except as victor, and they, mindful of the gods, fought so courageously that, when night was about to end the battle, the king was the first to retire from the field, in fear of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> madness. The chiefs, to whom the more cruel part in the crime had been assigned, when they saw only a few surviving the battle, and these exhausted by wounds and weariness, at daybreak sent the priests, wearing their fillets, to surrender the city to Philip.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the surrender, Marcus Aemilius, the youngest of the three ambassadors<note>See ii. 3 above.</note> who had been sent to Alexandria, hearing of the siege of <pb id="p.55"/>Abydus, came to Philip with the consent of his<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> colleagues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He protested against the attack on Attalus and the Rhodians, and because Philip was at that very moment besieging Abydus, and when the king replied that Attalus and the Rhodians had made an unprovoked attack upon him, Aemilius asked, <quote>Did the people of Abydus also take up arms against you, unprovoked?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This speech seemed to the king, who was unused to hearing the truth, too arrogant for delivery in the royal presence. <quote>Your age,</quote> he replied, <quote>your good looks,<note>See the similar dialogue quoted by Polybius (XVI. xxxiv. 5); Polybius adds that Aemilius was the handsomest man of his time.</note> and, above all, the Roman name, make you too arrogant.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I should myself prefer first that you remember the treaties and keep the peace with me; but if you attack me in war, you will find that I too have the resolution to make both the kingdom and the name of Macedonia no less renowned than those of Rome.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Thus dismissing the envoy,<note>According to Justin (XXX. iii. 3-4), the ambassadors carried instructions to Antiochus and Philip to keep their hands off Egypt, and Aemilius was designated to act as a quasi- guardian to the young Ptolemy. For the alliance between Egypt and Rome see XXVII. iv. 10. Livy has abridged his account of the embassy's activities, but it should be remembered that the embassy left Rome before the declaration of war upon Philip.</note> Philip took possession of all the gold, silver, and other accumulated treasure, but lost all the human booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For such madness laid hold of the people that all at once, thinking that those who had fallen in the fight had met death from treachery, each reproaching another's perjury, and especially that of the priests, who had delivered alive to the enemy those whom they had consecrated to death, they hastily ran to kill their wives and children and then themselves sought death by every path.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king, astounded by this frenzy, checked the assaults of his soldiers and announced that he would give the <pb id="p.57"/>Abydenians three days in which to die.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In this time<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the conquered did themselves more violence than they would have suffered from their enraged conquerors, and no living man fell into Philip's hands save those whom chains or some other constraint forbade to die. Philip, leaving a garrison at Abydus, returned to his kingdom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When, as Hannibal's destruction of Saguntum had aroused the Romans to war against him, so now the slaughter of the people of Abydus had roused them against Philip, word came that the Roman consul was already in Epirus and had sent his army to Apollonia and his fleet to Corcyra to winter.<note>Livy here abandons Polybius and returns to his usual sources, the works of one or more annalists. Since the military year, which began when conditions permitted active operations, the civil year, which began on March 15, and the calendar year did not coincide, Livy has a good deal of difficulty in adjusting his material to his plan of composition. The events related in chaps. xv-xviii preceded Sulpicius' arrival in the east (xiv. 2 above), and we are now ready for his campaign. But since he reached Greece only in time to go into winter quarters, Livy turns aside to narrate events in Rome in the later months of <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date></note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the meantime, the ambassadors who had been sent to Africa had been informed by the Carthaginians that, regarding Hamilcar, the leader of the Gallic army, they could do nothing but declare him an outlaw and confiscate his property;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> as to the deserters and fugitives, they had already sent back all they could find after search, and would send an embassy to Rome to give satisfaction to the senate on that point. They sent two hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">modius</hi> was the practical equivalent of the peck, and equalled one-sixth of the Greek <hi rend="italics">medimnus.</hi></note> of wheat to Rome and the same quantity to the army in Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The embassy then proceeded to Numidia, where they delivered their gifts and messages to Masinissa. When the king offered them two thousand Numidian cavalry, they accepted one thousand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king himself supervised their embarkation and sent them to Macedonia with two <pb id="p.59"/>hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi> of wheat and as much<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> barley.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The third errand was to Vermina, who met the ambassadors at the frontier and left it to them to lay down terms of peace satisfactory to Rome, while for his own part he promised to maintain a just and lawful peace with the Roman people.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time Lucius Cornelius Lentulus the proconsul returned from Spain.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but that there was no precedent handed down from antiquity that one who had not been in command as dictator or consul or praetor should celebrate a triumph. He had held the province of Spain as proconsul<note>An anachronism is involved in the use of the word <hi rend="italics">proconsul</hi> to translate the phrase <hi rend="italics">pro consule.</hi> After the time of Sulla consuls and praetors served in administrative and judicial capacities in Rome during their terms of office, but without exercising <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> (cf. the note on iii. 2 above), and were then sent out as proconsuls and propraetors, with the <hi rend="italics">imperium,</hi> to govern the territorial provinces. They were thus eligible for triumphs. In the third century, even private citizens, in cases of emergency, could be commissioned to act <hi rend="italics">pro consule, pro praetore,</hi> i.e. as substitutes for magistrates. Not being a regularly elected magistrate, exercising command under auspices which he had himself taken, such a person could not be granted a triumph.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nevertheless, it was proposed that he enter the city in ovation,<note>An ovation was a minor dignity conferred on commanders who were adjudged undeserving of triumphs. The conditions of eligibility were probably identical with those for a triumph, and the tribune's position seems to have been technically correct.</note> though
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the tribune Tiberius Sempronius Longus objected that this would be no more in accordance with ancestral custom or any precedent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Finally, prevailed upon by the general agreement of the senators, the tribune withdrew his veto, and Lucius Cornelius, by authority of the <pb id="p.61"/>senate, was allowed to enter the city in ovation. He<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> brought home forty-three thousand pounds of silver and two thousand four hundred
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and fifty pounds of gold from the booty, and presented to each of his soldiers a sum amounting to one hundred and twenty <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consular army had now moved from Arretium to Ariminum, and five thousand allies of the Latin confederacy from Gaul to Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore Lucius Furius proceeded by forced marches from Ariminum against the Gauls who were still besieging Cremona, and bivouacked about a mile and a half from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was an excellent chance for a victory if he had attacked their camp immediately after his march; the Gauls had scattered through the neighbourhood without leaving a strong guard on duty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But Furius spared his weary troops because he had made a strenuous march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Gauls, called back by the shouts of their comrades, dropped the booty which they had in hand and hurried back to their camp. The next day they moved out in battle-array, nor did the Roman refuse the engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the Romans had barely time to form inline, with such speed did the enemy advance to the attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The right squadron<note>The <hi rend="italics">ala</hi> was a normal unit of organization among the allied troops. Perhaps because the allies were often posted on the flanks, with the Roman infantry in the centre, such units were sometimes designated <quote>right</quote> and <quote>left.</quote> But the meaning here is uncertain.</note> &mdash;he had the allied army divided into squadrons &mdash;occupied the front line, with two Roman legions in reserve. Commanders were designated: Marcus Furius of the right squadron, Marcus Caecilius of the legions, Lucius Valerius Flaccus of the cavalry &mdash;all were lieutenants.<note>See the note on iii. 4 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The praetor kept with him two lieutenants, Gaius Laetorius and Publius Titinius, by whose aid he
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> planned to watch the whole engagement and meet all sudden attacks of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At first the Gauls hoped, concentrating the mass of their <pb id="p.63"/>force on one place, to be able to overwhelm and<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> destroy the right squadron which was in the van.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When this did not succeed, they tried to outflank and envelop the enemy's line, a plan which seemed easy on account of their great numbers arrayed against a few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the praetor saw this, that he too might extend his front, he threw in two legions from his reserves on the right and left flanks of the front-line force and vowed a temple to Diiovis if he routed the enemy on that day.<note>Livy (XXXIV. liii. 7) records the dedication of a temple to Jupiter vowed by Furius. The name of the divinity here reported may be corrupt.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He ordered Lucius Valerius to send the cavalry of two legions to one side against the flank of the enemy and to the other the allied cavalry, and not to allow the enemy to envelop his lines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Seeing too that the Gallic centre was weakened by the extension of the line, at the same time he gave his men the order to charge in mass formation and to break through, and the flanks were thrown back by the cavalry, the centre by the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Gauls, suffering heavy losses in every quarter, suddenly broke and in complete rout fled to their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The cavalry pursued them in their flight, and presently the legions too followed and stormed the camp. Less than six thousand Gauls escaped;
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> more than thirty-five thousand were killed or captured, along with seventy standards and more than two hundred Gallic wagons laden with abundant spoils. Hamilcar<note>Another version of the fate of Hamilcar is related at XXXII. xxx. 12 and XXXIII. xxiii. 5.</note> the Carthaginian general and three noble Gallic commanders fell in the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> About two thousand of the captives from Placentia were recovered and restored to the colonists.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This great victory brought joy to Rome, and when the news came a thanksgiving of three days was proclaimed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About two thousand of the Romans and allies perished in that battle, most of them from <pb id="p.65"/>the right squadron, against which at the first attack<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the enemy's main effort had been directed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Although the war had been practically ended by the praetor, the consul Gaius Aurelius, having transacted the necessary business in Rome, also set out for Gaul and took over the victorious army from the praetor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The other consul,<note>We return to Greece and continue the narrative of the end of the year <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date> and the following spring, interrupted at chap. xix; cf. the note on xviii. 9 above.</note> having arrived in his province near the end of autumn, was wintering around Apollonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From the fleet which was moored at Corcyra, Gaius Claudius and the Roman triremes, as has been related, had been sent to Athens, and when they arrived at Piraeus they had inspired great hopes in the allies who were now in despair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the customary raids on the fields which were made by land from Corinth by way of Megara were stopped, and the ships of the pirates from Chalcis,<note>Chalcis in Euboea, Demetrias in Thessaly, and Corinth in Achaea were the three <quote>fetters</quote> of Greece XXXII. xxxvii. 3-4). This campaign and Philip's retaliation well illustrate the vague strategy of both sides in this war.</note> which had made both
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the sea and the farm-lands on the coast dangerous for the Athenians, not only would not venture past Sunium, but did not dare to enter the open sea beyond the strait of Euripus. In addition to these, three Rhodian quadriremes arrived, and there were three Athenian vessels without protecting decks, assembled to defend the lands on the coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Just as Claudius had made up his mind that it was sufficient for the present if the city and fields of the Athenians could be guarded with this fleet, an opportunity for a greater feat was presented to him.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Exiles from Chalcis, driven out by the violence of Philip's garrison, brought the news that Chalcis could be captured without any opposition:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for the Macedonians, because there was no fear of an enemy near by, were straggling about the country, <pb id="p.67"/>and the citizens likewise, trusting in their Macedonian<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> garrison, were careless in their guarding of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Acting on this information, Claudius started out, and although he reached Sunium so early that he could have made the opening of the Euboean straits, he held his fleet at anchor until night-fall, lest he be seen after rounding the promontory; at dusk he moved, and after a calm voyage reached Chalcis a little before daybreak.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With a few soldiers using scaling ladders, he captured the nearest tower and the adjoining wall in a thinly-populated section of the city, the sentinels being found in some places asleep, in others absent from their posts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans then advanced to the centre of the city, and killing the guards and breaking down the gates they admitted the rest of their forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thence they scattered throughout the town, the confusion being further increased by a fire which broke out in the buildings around the forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both the royal granaries and the arsenal were burned, with a great store of munitions and artillery. Indiscriminate slaughter of fugitives and fighting men followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When there was no longer anyone of military age who had not perished or fled, Sopater the Acarnanian, commander of the garrison, having fallen, all the booty was first collected in the forum and then loaded on the ships. The prison also was broken open by the Rhodians, who released the captives whom Philip had confined there, thinking they would be in safest custody.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The king's statues were then thrown down and broken up, and when the recall was sounded the Romans embarked and returned to Piraeus, whence they had set out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But if the Roman force had been large enough, so that they could
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> have held Chalcis without <pb id="p.69"/>abandoning the defence of Athens, this event would<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> have been an auspicious beginning of hostilities: Chalcis and the Euripus would have been lost to the king, for as on the land the pass of
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thermopylae is the gateway to Greece, so by sea is the strait of Euripus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip was then at Demetrias. When the news of the destruction of Chalcis reached him there, although it was too late to send aid, the city having been lost, nevertheless, seeking revenge, as the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> next best thing after assistance, he at once set out with five thousand light infantry and three hundred cavalry and made all speed for Chalcis, not doubting that the Romans could be destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Disappointed in this hope, and finding only the ugly spectacle of the friendly town lying half-ruined, with its embers still smoking, and only a few left to bury those who were slain in the battle, he recrossed the strait by the bridge as rapidly as he had come and hurried through Boeotia toward Athens, thinking that a not dissimilar result would follow a similar course of action.<note>Philip hoped to take Athens by surprise as the Romans had taken Chalcis.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And this would have happened, had not a scout-the Greeks call them <quote>all-day runners,</quote> and they cover great distances in a day's run &mdash;seen the king's army from a watch-tower, set out at midnight and reached Athens before him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was the same sleep and the same carelessness that had betrayed Chalcis a few days earlier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Athenian praetor<note>Livy frequently applies the Latin term to the commanders of foreign military forces. The usual title in Greece was <quote>strategus.</quote></note> and Dioxippus, who commanded an auxiliary force of mercenaries, aroused by the alarming message, assembling the soldiers in the forum, ordered the trumpet sounded from the citadel, to inform all that the enemy was coming. So there was a rush from all sides to the walls and gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some hours later, but still before daybreak, Philip approached the city, <pb id="p.71"/>and seeing the numerous lights and hearing the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> shouts of frightened men, usual in such a crisis, halted and ordered his men to pitch camp and rest, intending to employ open force, since stratagem had failed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He attacked on the side of the Dipylon Gate.<note>The gate, which, as its name implies, accommodated twoway traffic, lay on the north-west side of the city and was the principal exit towards the west. The gate was double in depth also; cf. <hi rend="italics">in angustiis</hi> in sect. 15 below, where Philip was caught in the court between the two parts. Livy's weakness in detailed topography and the aimlessness of the campaign make it difficult to determine Philip's route of approach. The easy route from Boeotia was byway of Eleusis, the Sacred Way, and the pass of Daphne to the Dipylon Gate; the road past the Academy led over the difficult pass of Phyle. The question seems to be avoided by modern historians and the mobility of Philip would have enabled him to come by one road and attack by another.</note> This gate, placed, so to speak, at the forefront of the city, was somewhat wider and more extensive
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> than the rest, and inside and outside there were wide avenues, so that the citizens could form their line from the market-place to the gate, and so that the road, about a mile long, outside the city and leading to the gymnasium of the Academy, offered ample space for infantry and cavalry. The Athenians with the garrison of Attalus and the mercenaries of Dioxippus, formed their array within the gate and marched out by this road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Philip, seeing this, thought that he had the Athenians in his hands and that he was about to sate his rage with long-desired slaughter &mdash;r
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> he hated no other Greek city so much as Athens &mdash;and urged his soldiers to take him as their example in the fight and to remember that the standards and the battle-line should be where their king was, and put spurs to his horse, inspired by rage and by the hope of glory
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> alike, because he thought that his fighting would be a glorious sight, since the walls were lined with a great crowd, as for a show.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Riding with a few companions far in front of the line, and even into the press of the enemy, he inspired both
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> enthusiasm in his own troops and terror in his foes. Pursuing <pb id="p.73"/>many soldiers whom he had wounded, either at long<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> range or hand to hand, and driving them inside the gate, when he had done greater damage to the Athenians as they crowded together in the narrow space, yet he escaped safely after his rash venture, since the troops who manned the towers on the walls withheld their weapons, from fear of harming their own men mingled with the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Afterwards when the Athenians held their men within the walls, Philip, giving the
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> signal for a retirement, pitched camp at Cynosarges,<note>This suburb lay to the eastward, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus.</note> where there was a temple to Hercules and a gymnasium with a grove around it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But Cynosarges, the Lyceum, and all the sacred and pleasant sites around the city were burned; the buildings and even the tombs were destroyed, and nothing consecrated to divine or human use escaped his uncontrollable passion.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day, when the gates had been closed and then suddenly thrown open, because troops of Attalus from Aegina and Romans from Piraeus had entered the city, the king moved his camp about three miles from the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thence, making for Eleusis, in the hope of capturing, by an unexpected attack, the temple and the citadel which commands and surrounds the temple, when he found that vigilance was not in the least relaxed and that reinforcements were coming from the fleet at Piraeus, he gave up that plan and marched toward Megara and straight on to Corinth, and hearing that the Achaean council<note>See the Introductory Note.</note> was in session at Argos, he suddenly appeared at the meeting itself, to the surprise of the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were deliberating about a <pb id="p.75"/>war against Nabis,<note>Nabis had seized authority at Sparta (see the Introductory Note). The war against him conducted by the Romans and their allies is described in XXXIV. xxii. 5 ff.</note> the tyrant of Sparta, who, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> seeing that the military power of the Achaeans had declined with the transfer of command from Philopoemen to Cycliadas,<note>The Achaean League elected a <hi rend="italics">strategus</hi> annually, and frequent changes occurred, both in the military efficiency and in the political sympathies of the administration. Philopoemen had been a vigorous and independent magistrate: see Plutarch's biography of him. Cycliadas was an inferior soldier and was suspected of pro-Macedonian tendencies.</note> by no means his equal as a general, had renewed the war and was ravaging their territories and was now even threatening their towns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While they were debating how many men should be enlisted from each city for the war against this enemy, Philip promised that, so far as Nabis and the Spartans were concerned, he would free them from that responsibility, and by the immediate despatch of
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> an army would not only prevent Nabis from ravaging the lands of the allies, but would transfer the whole terror of the war into Laconia itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When this offer was received with great applause, <quote>nevertheless,</quote> he said, <quote>it is proper that your possessions be defended by my arms in such a way that meantime mine shall not be deprived of protection.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Prepare, then, if it seems wise, a force of soldiers sufficient to hold Oreus and Chalcis and Corinth, that, with my rear protected, I may safely make war upon Nabis and the Spartans.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Achaeans were not deceived as to the real meaning of so generous an offer and promise of aid against the Lacedaemonians: the purpose was to lead the Achaean youth as hostages from the Peloponnesus in order to commit the people to war with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So Cycliadas, praetor of the Achaeans, thinking it not at all to the point to argue about <hi rend="italics">that,</hi> when he had simply replied that it was not allowable under the laws of the Achaeans to vote upon other subjects than those for which the meeting was called, after <pb id="p.77"/>passing a decree regarding raising an army
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> against<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Nabis, adjourned the congress that was held fearlessly and spiritedly, although up to that time he had been counted among the king's partisans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Philip, disappointed in this great hope, enlisted a few volunteer soldiers and returned to Corinth and to the land of Attica.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During this same period while Philip was in Achaea, his prefect Philocles left Euboea with two thousand Thracians and Macedonians to plunder the territory of the Athenians in the region of Eleusis, and crossed the pass of Cithaeron.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sending half his force to plunder far and wide through the country, he with the rest made camp secretly in a suitable place for an ambuscade, that, if an attack were made by the Eleusinians from the citadel
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> upon his foragers, he might fall upon the enemy suddenly and unexpectedly as they were dispersed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His ambush did not go undetected. So recalling the troops that had gone forth to forage and forming them for battle, he set out for Eleusis to assault the citadel, but was repulsed from there with many casualties and joined Philip on his return from Achaea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> An attack on the same fortress was attempted by the king as well; but Roman ships arriving from the Piraeus and the garrison admitted into the city compelled him to abandon his undertaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king then divided his army and sent Philocles to Athens with half of them and himself proceeding to Piraeus, in the hope that while Philocles was keeping the Athenians within the city by approaching the walls and threatening an attack, the opportunity might be offered himself of taking Piraeus, left with a small guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, with practically the same defenders, the capture <pb id="p.79"/>of Piraeus was in no wise easier for him than that<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> of Eleusis. Suddenly he marched from Piraeus to Athens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Driven thence by a sudden sally of cavalry and infantry in the narrow space between the half-ruined walls<note>Themistocles had built a double wall from Athens to the harbour, but this had been partially destroyed during the Peloponnesian War and had not been maintained.</note> which with their two arms join Piraeus and Athens, he gave up the attempt on the city and, again dividing
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> his force with Philocles and setting out to plunder the country districts, while he had devoted his former raid to destroying the tombs around the city, that he might leave nothing inviolate, he ordered the temples
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of the gods which the Athenians had consecrated in all the demes to be torn down and burned;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and the land of Attica, with its wonderful adornment of works of art and its abundance of native marble and the skill of its artists offered material for his rage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For he was not satisfied merely to destroy the temples and statues themselves, but even ordered the separate stones to be broken up, lest they be left whole upon the piles of ruins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And after his wrath, or rather objects on which to expend his wrath, had been exhausted, he retired from the enemy's country to Boeotia, and did nothing else worth mentioning in Greece.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul Sulpicius<note>The arrival of Sulpicius was recorded in xviii. 9, on which see the note. The events now described may belong to the end of the year <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date> or, more probably, to the following spring.</note> was at that time encamped along the Apsus river between Apollonia and Dyrrachium, and summoning to him there his lieutenant Lucius Apustius he sent him with part of the troops to ravage the enemy's country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Apustius, having plundered the frontiers of Macedonia and having captured at the first assault the towns of <pb id="p.81"/>Corrhagum, Gerronius and Orgessum, arrived at<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Antipatrea, a city situated in a narrow pass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There he first summoned the leading men to a conference and tried to induce them to put themselves under Roman protection; then, when they scorned his suggestions, relying on the size and walls and site of the city, he stormed and captured it by force of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> arms and killing all the men of military age and giving the booty to the soldiers he tore down the walls and burned the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fear of a similar fate caused Codrio, a strong and well-fortified town, to be surrendered to the Romans without resistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Leaving a garrison there, he took by storm Cnidus &mdash;a name better known than the town because of the other Cnidus in Asia. As the lieutenant was returning to the consul with a satisfactory amount of booty, Athenagoras, one of the king's prefects, attacked his rear while it was crossing a river and caused some confusion to his rearguard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The lieutenant, hastily riding back when he heard their shouts and uproar, faced the troops about and formed line of battle, placing the baggage in the centre, whereupon the king's soldiers did not withstand the Romans' charge. Many of them were killed and more captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The lieutenant returned to the consul with his army intact and thence was at once sent back to the fleet.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The war having been begun with this sufficiently successful expedition, the petty kings and princes, neighbours to the Macedonians, came to the Roman camp; Pleuratus, son of Scerdilaedus, and Amynander, king of the Athamanes, and from the Dardani Bato, son of Longarus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Longarus on his own account had waged war with Demetrius, father of Philip. To their proffers of assistance, the consul <pb id="p.83"/>replied that he would accept the aid of the Dardani<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> and Pleuratus when he led the army into Macedonia; to Amynander he assigned the task of winning the Aetolians<note>The Aetolian League (see the Introductory Note) was in alliance with Philip, but its assistance was sought by both sides: see section 6 below. Its general policy is well presented in xxxii. 5 below.</note> over for the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To the ambassadors of Attalus &mdash;for they too had arrived at this time &mdash;he gave instructions that the king should await the Roman fleet at Aegina, where he was wintering, and uniting with it should continue as before the naval warfare on Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Ambassadors were sent to the Rhodians also, that they should take up their share in the war. Nor did Philip &mdash;for he had by now reached Macedonia &mdash;carry on less vigorously his preparations for the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He sent his son Perseus, who was still a boy, with guardians from among his friends to guide his youth, with part of the troops to hold the passes which lead to Pelagonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He destroyed Sciathus and Peparethus, cities not unknown to fame, to prevent their becoming prize and prey to the fleet of the enemy. He sent ambassadors to the Aetolians, lest that restless people should, on the arrival of the Romans, change its allegiance.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The council of the Aetolians, which they call Panaetolian,<note>This council, attended by delegates from all the Aetolian cities, was regularly held in the autumn at Naupactus or Thermum.</note> was to be held on the appointed day.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Macedonians, with whom the latest treaty<note>The Macedonian alliance in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xii. 2) superseded the treaty with Rome of <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date> (XXVI. xxv. 1).</note> had been made, were first heard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They said that they had nothing new to say since <pb id="p.85"/>nothing new had happened; inasmuch as, for the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> same reasons for which they had made peace with Philip after trying the useless Roman alliance, they should wish to keep a peace once for all established.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <quote>Or do you prefer,</quote> said one of the ambassadors, <quote>to imitate Roman presumption, or shall I call it fickleness? After ordering that your ambassadors at Rome should receive the answer, 'Why do you come to us, Aetolians, when without our authority you made peace with Philip?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> ', these same Romans now demand that you make war -on Philip along with them; as they formerly pretended that they had taken arms against him on your account and for your sakes, now they forbid you to be at peace with Philip.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They crossed to Sicily first to assist Messina; the second time, to rescue and restore to liberty Syracuse, besieged by the Carthaginians; now they themselves hold both Messina and Syracuse and all Sicily and they have made it a province, tributary and subject to their rods and axes.<note>The aid rendered to Messina brought on the First Punic War, as a result of which part of Sicily became a province, governed by magistrates whose servants carried the rods and axes as symbols of the <hi rend="italics">imperium.</hi> The implication is that the assistance was merely the beginning of conquest. For Syracuse cf. xxxi. 8 and note.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No doubt, just as you hold your council at Naupactus, under your own
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> laws, with magistrates elected by yourselves, able to choose freely whomsoever you wish as friend and enemy, able to have peace or war at your own discretion, so a council of the Sicilian cities is called at Syracuse or Messina or Lilybaeum: the Roman praetor presides at the council; the men whom he has summoned by his authority assemble;
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> they see him seated on his lofty platform, rendering haughty justice, with a throng of lictors around him; their rods threaten their backs, the axes their throats; and year by year the lots grant them one master after another.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At that they should not marvel, nor can they, when they see the <pb id="p.87"/>Italian cities, Rhegium, Tarentum, Capua, subject to<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the same rule, not to mention the nearer cities on whose ruins Rome rose to power.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Capua indeed, tomb and monument of the Campanian race, survives, its people buried, exiled, driven away, a city despoiled, without senate, without people, without magistrates, a monstrosity, more cruelly left habitable than if it had been destroyed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is madness to hope that anything will remain in the same condition if foreigners, separated from us more by language, manners and laws than by the space of land and sea, shall gain control.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The rule of Philip seems to interfere somewhat with your liberty; but he, though he would justly be angry with you, has asked nothing from you except peace and to-day desires nothing but your loyalty to your pledge of peace.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the Macedonians, with the permission <pb id="p.89"/>and indeed at the bidding of the Romans themselves, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the Athenians were brought in, who were able, having suffered dreadfully, to assail with greater reason the savageness and cruelty of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They lamented the devastation and miserable ruin of their land: they did not complain because they suffered the treatment of an enemy from an enemy, for there are certain laws of war which are legitimately to be experienced as well as practised:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it is sad, rather than unjust to the sufferer, that crops be burned, homes be destroyed, men and animals driven off as booty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but they did, however, complain that he who calls the Romans aliens and barbarians had so polluted human and divine law alike that on his first raid he had waged impious war on the gods of the world below, on his second, with the gods above.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All the tombs and monuments in their land had been destroyed, the shades of all the dead left naked, no man's bones left with their covering of earth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had had shrines, which their ancestors dwelling in the country demes had once consecrated in their little villages and towns and which, even when united in one city,<note>The unification (<foreign lang="greek">sunoikismo/s</foreign>) of the Attic demes into the city (<foreign lang="greek">a)/stu</foreign>) of Athens was traditionally ascribed to Theseus (Thucydides II. xv. 2) and assigned to the year <date value="-1259">1259 B.C.</date></note> they had not left deserted. About all these temples Philip had built his destroying fires; half-burned, mutilated images of gods lay amid the fallen portals of their shrines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The sort of land he had made of Attica, once so rich in art and treasure, such, if he were permitted, he would make of Aetolia and all Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Their city too would have suffered the same despoliation if the Romans had not come to its aid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For in the same criminal fashion the gods that keep the city and Athena, guardian of its citadel, had been attacked, so too the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, so Zeus and Athena at Piraeus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but, repulsed not only <pb id="p.91"/>from their temples but also from the walls by force of<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> arms, he had spent his wrath on those shrines which were protected by a sense of reverence alone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They therefore begged and besought the Aetolians to pity the Athenians and under the leadership, first of the immortal gods, second of the Romans, who were next to the gods in power, to undertake the war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the Roman delegate spoke: <quote>First the Macedonians, then the Athenians, have changed the whole tenor of my argument.
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the Macedonians, when I had come to complain of the injuries inflicted by Philip upon so many states allied with us, by taking the lead in accusing the Romans, have caused me to prefer a defence
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> of ourselves to an accusation of them, and when the Athenians have described his cruel and inhuman crimes against the gods above and below, what have they left for me or anyone else with which to reproach him further?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Consider that these same complaints are made by the people of Cius,<note>The towns named in this list had all at one time or another suffered at Philip's hands. Furius maintains that Rome's treatment of Capua and other towns was kind and generous in comparison.</note> Abydus, Aenus, Maronea, Thasos, Paros, Samos, Larisa, Messene here from Achaea, and that those complaints are of more grievous and cruel treatment wherever he had greater power to do harm.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For as to those matters with which he has charged us, unless they merit glory, I confess that they cannot be defended. He has reproached us with Rhegium and Capua and Syracuse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Take Rhegium: in the war with Pyrrhus a legion sent by us when the townspeople of Rhegium themselves begged us to send troops for their protection, criminally seized the city it was sent to guard.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Did we, then, approve this crime? Or did we, making war upon the guilty legion and reducing it to submission, when we <pb id="p.93"/>had made it pay to the allies the penalty, with scourgings<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> and beheadings, did we restore to the people of Rhegium their city, their lands and all their possessions along with their liberty and laws?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When we had given aid to the Syracusans, oppressed by foreign tyrants, a thing which made their fate more pitiable, and when we had been worn out by besieging, for nearly three years, the city strongly fortified by land and sea, since now the Syracusans themselves preferred to be ruled by tyrants to being captured by us, we delivered to them a city taken and liberated by these same arms.<note>After the death of Hieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse, Hippocrates and Epicydes, born in Carthage but descended on their father's side from a Syracusan exile, persuaded the Syracusans to join Carthage. After a three years' siege (214-<date value="-212">212 B.C.</date>) the city was taken by Marcellus. The Roman victory meant both the capture (<hi rend="italics">captain</hi>) by the Romans and the liberation (<hi rend="italics">liberatam</hi>) of the city from its <quote>foreign tyrants</quote> Hippocrates and Epicydes. See XXIV-XXV, <hi rend="italics">passim.</hi></note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> We do not deny that Sicily is our province and that the cities which were on the side of Carthage and in agreement with her made war on us are our vassals and tributaries; nay, on the contrary, we wish both you and all nations to know this, that each one's fortune is proportioned to his services to us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Or should we be ashamed of the punishment of the Campanians, of which not even they can complain?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> These people, when we had warred with the Samnites on their behalf for almost seventy years, with great losses to ourselves, and when after that we had bound them to us, first by treaty, then by intermarriages
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and personal ties, finally by the gift of citizenship, were the first of all the states of Italy who in our time of stress foully murdered our garrison and went over to Hannibal, and then, enraged because they were besieged by us, sent Hannibal to attack Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If neither their city nor any man of them survived, who could say <pb id="p.95"/>that they had been punished more severely than they<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> themselves deserved?
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> More of them, from consciousness of their guilt, committed suicide than were punished by us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> From the rest we did indeed take away their town and their fields, but in such a way that we left them enough land and room to dwell in, and we permitted the city itself to stand safe and uninjured, so that he who sees it to-day finds no sign of its assault and capture. But why do I mention Capua, when we gave peace and liberty to conquered Carthage?
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> This is the greater danger, that by treating the vanquished too generously we may thereby incite more peoples to try the fortune of war against us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Let this be our defence of ourselves and our answer to Philip, whose murders within his family, whose slaughterings of friends and relatives, whose passions, more unnatural almost than his cruelty, you know better than I, as you are nearer neighbours to Macedonia.
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> So far as you are concerned, men of Aetolia, we undertook the war with Philip for you and you made peace with him without us.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> And perhaps you will argue that when we were busy with the Punic war, you, compelled by fear, received terms of peace from him who was at that time more powerful; and that we, in the press of greater matters, ourselves neglected the war which you abandoned.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> But now, by the grace of the gods, having finished the Punic war, we have addressed ourselves with all our energy to Macedonia, and to you, accordingly, is offered the opportunity of reinstating yourselves in our alliance and friendship, unless you prefer perishing with Philip to conquering with the Romans.</quote></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this had been said by the Roman <pb id="p.97"/>commissioner, and the opinions of all were turning<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> toward the Romans, Damocritus, chief of the Aetolians, bribed &mdash;so men say &mdash;by
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the king, argued, not agreeing in any way with either side, that nothing was so inconsistent with wisdom in a great crisis as haste; for repentance, swift yet none the less late and unavailing, followed, when hastily-formed plans could not be recalled or annulled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The time for making the decision, the ripe moment for which should, in his judgment, be awaited, could be fixed even now:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> since it was provided by the laws that questions concerning peace or war should not be debated except at the Panaetolian and Pylaic<note>This is probably the other stated meeting of the League, but this name is not used elsewhere in this connection.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Possibly, as Professor Capps suggests to me, the Pylaic meeting was that of the Amphictyonic Council, now dominated by Aetolia, at Thermopylae; one expects, however, action by an Aetolian and not by an Amphictyonic agency. Cf.

						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxxv. 8.</note> council, they should at once decree that the praetor should call a council, in good faith, when he wished to
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> discuss the question of peace or war, and that whatever was then proposed and decreed should be valid and legal just as if determined at a Panaetolian or Pylaic session.<note>Damocritus seems to propose that the council adjourn to meet on call, and that this adjourned meeting be regarded as a continuation of the regular meeting, and that the <quote>laws</quote> of the League be stretched to this extent.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The ambassadors being thus dismissed with the decision hanging in the balance, he said that this was wise conduct for the League: for whichever side enjoyed the better fortune of war, to an alliance with that side they would turn. Such were the proceedings of the Aetolian council.</p> 
				<p>XXXIII. Philip was energetically preparing for war on land and sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He assembled his navy at Demetrias in Thessaly; expecting that Attalus and the Roman fleet would move from Aegina in the <pb id="p.99"/>beginning of spring, he placed Heraclides, to whom<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> he had previously given the same post, in command of the fleet and the coast;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he himself collected the land forces, thinking that he had detached from the Romans two powerful allies, the Aetolians on one side, the Dardani on the other, since the passes to Pelagonia were held by his son Perseus. The consul was not preparing, but actually waging, war.<note>Livy here resumes the narrative interrupted at xxviii. 6 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was leading the army through the territory of the Dassaretii, carrying with him untouched the grain he had brought from winter quarters, since the country supplied adequately the needs of the soldiers. The forts and towns surrendered, some voluntarily, others through fear; some were carried by assault, some were found abandoned as the barbarians fled to the neighbouring mountains. He established a base near Lyncus on the river Bevus; from there he sent troops to forage among the granaries of the Dassaretii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Philip, it is true, saw that everything round about was in confusion and that the people were greatly terrified, but not knowing in which direction the consul had marched, he sent a squadron of cavalry to ascertain where the enemy had gone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul was equally at a loss; he knew that the king had left his winter quarters, though ignorant of the region to which he had marched. He too sent out cavalry to scout. These two cavalry forces, coming from different directions, after they had wandered long and aimlessly over the roads in the land of the Dassaretii, finally met on the same highway. Neither was unaware, since they heard the sound of men and horses from far off, that the enemy was approaching.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So, before they came in sight of one another, they had prepared horses and arms for <pb id="p.101"/>battle, nor was there any delay in charging as soon<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> as the enemy came in sight. Not unequal, as it chanced, in either numbers or courage, since both consisted of picked men, they fought on equal terms for some hours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The weariness of men and horses ended the struggle without a decision in favour of either party. Of the Macedonians, forty troopers fell; of the Romans, thirty-five.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nor did either side, the king's or the consul's, have to report any more definite information as to where the enemy's camp lay; but this information was secured through deserters, whom in every war their fickleness causes to furnish information to the enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, thinking that he would do something to secure the affection of his people and increase their readiness to encounter danger on his behalf
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> if he undertook the burial of the cavalrymen who had fallen on the expedition, ordered their bodies brought into camp, that the funeral honour might be seen by all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nothing is so uncertain or so unpredictable as the mental reaction of a crowd. What he thought would make them more ready to enter any conflict caused, instead, reluctance and fear;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for men who had seen the wounds dealt by javelins and arrows and occasionally by lances, since they were used to fighting with the Greeks and Illyrians, when they had seen bodies chopped to pieces by the Spanish sword,<note>The long and heavy sabre, adapted to slashing blows, carried by Roman cavalry: cf. Dion. Hal. VIII. 67. The short infantry weapon, used for both cutting and thrusting, was called <hi rend="italics">gladius Hispanus</hi> in XXII. xlvi. 5.</note> arms torn away, shoulders and all, or heads separated from bodies, with the necks completely severed, or vitals laid open, and the other fearful wounds, realized in a general panic with what weapons and what men they had to fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fear seized the king as well, who had never met the Romans in ordered combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So, recalling his son <pb id="p.103"/>and the guard which was at the passes to Pelagonia, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> that he might increase his own strength with these forces, he opened to Pleuratus and the Dardani the road into Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Using deserters as guides, he himself marched towards the enemy with twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and fortified with a wall and ditch a hill near Athacus, a little more than a mile from the Roman camp, and seeing the Roman camp which lay at his feet, it is said
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that he admired its whole arrangement and each section allotted its own place, with the rows of tents and also the well-spaced streets between, and that he remarked that no one could believe that that camp belonged to barbarians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For two days the consul and the king remained in camp, each waiting for the other to assume the offensive; on the third day the Roman led out all his forces to the battleground.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The king, fearing the gamble of a decisive battle at this early moment, sent four hundred Tralles &mdash;a people of Illyria, as I have elsewhere<note>Cf. XXVII. xxxii. 4.</note> said &mdash;and three hundred Cretans, adding to the infantry an equal number of cavalry under command of Athenagoras, one of his nobles, to harass the Roman cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans, on the other hand &mdash;their battle-line was a little more than half a mile away &mdash;sent out skirmishers and about two squadrons of cavalry, that the infantry and cavalry might equal the enemy in number also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king's forces assumed that the type of fighting would be that to which they were accustomed, that the cavalry, alternately advancing and retreating, would now discharge their weapons and now retire, that the swift movements of the Illyrians would be useful for sallies and sudden <pb id="p.105"/>charges, and that the Cretans would shower arrows<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> upon the enemy advancing in disorder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Roman attack, no more vigorous than stubborn, prevented the carrying out of this plan;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for just as if they were in regular line of battle, both the skirmishers, after hurling their spears, came to a hand-to-hand combat with their swords, and the cavalry, as soon as they had charged the enemy, stopping their horses either fought from horseback or leaped from their saddles and fought mingled with the footmen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So neither the king's cavalry, unused to a stationary battle, could stand against the Romans, nor his infantry, running to and fro and almost unprotected by armour, against the light-armed Romans, equipped with shield and sword and prepared alike for defence or offence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So they did not sustain the struggle, but relying on nothing else than their swiftness of foot they fled to the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, after an interval of a day, when the king was determined to engage with all his cavalry and light infantry, he had concealed his targeteers,<note>The <hi rend="italics">caetra</hi> was a small, light shield (cf. <foreign lang="greek">pe/ltn</foreign>).</note> those whom
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> they call <quote>peltasts,</quote> in ambush in a suitable place between the two camps, and had instructed Athenagoras and the cavalry that if things went well in the open battle they should exploit their advantage, but if not, they should by retiring gradually draw the enemy towards the place of ambush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And the cavalry did in fact retire, but the commanders of the peltasts, not waiting long enough for the signal and disclosing their forces prematurely, lost the opportunity for a victory. The Roman, both successful in the open battle and safe from the ambuscade, returned to camp.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Next day the consul led out all his army in <pb id="p.107"/>battleline, placing in front of the ranks his elephants, an<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> auxiliary which the Romans then used for the first time, because they had some which they had taken in the Punic war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he saw the enemy lurking behind his ramparts, he advanced to the hills and even against the wall itself, taunting him with being afraid. When he could not even then gain the opportunity to fight, since foraging was unsafe because his base was so close to that of the enemy, the cavalry being ready at any moment to attack the soldiers scattered through the fields, he moved his camp about eight miles from there to Ottolobum &mdash;so
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they call the place &mdash;that he might provision himself more safely because of the distance.<note>The sites described in these chapters cannot be positively identified.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While the Romans were gathering grain in the neighbouring fields, the king at first kept his men within the camp, that carelessness might increase in the enemy along with boldness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When he saw them well scattered, he set out with all his cavalry and the Cretan auxiliaries, in so far as these fast-moving infantrymen could keep up with the cavalry, and marching at full speed set up his standards between the Roman camp and the foragers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then, dividing his forces, he sent part to pursue the scattered foragers, giving the word to leave no man alive, and himself with the remainder stood and blocked the roads by which the enemy seemed likely to return to camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now there was slaughter and flight everywhere, nor had any news of the disaster yet reached the Roman camp, because the fugitives fell in with the king's patrols, and more were killed by the men who blocked the roads than by those who were sent out to destroy them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Finally, however, some of them slipped through the line of enemy <pb id="p.109"/>guards and in their panic brought confused rumours<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> rather than definite news to the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul sent the cavalry to aid the harassed in any way they could, and himself led out the legions from the camp and forming a hollow square marched towards the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some of the cavalry wandered aimlessly about the country, misled by the shouts that rose from this place and that, others met the enemy face to face.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The battle began in several places at once. The royal guard put up the stiffest fight, for by reason of the number of infantry and cavalry it was practically a regular battle and most of the Romans encountered them, since they blocked the central road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In this too the Macedonians had the advantage, because the king himself was there to urge them on, and the Cretan auxiliaries dealt many unexpected wounds, fighting in close array and according to plan against men who were scattered and not in formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But if they had observed discretion in the pursuit, it would have meant not only success in the present engagement, but final victory in the war as well;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> as it was, in their greed for slaughter, following too incautiously, they met the Roman cohorts advancing under command of the tribunes, and the fleeing cavalry, as soon as they
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> saw the standards of their friends, faced about and attacked the disordered enemy, and in a moment, the tide of battle turning, the pursuers became the pursued.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many were struck down in hand-to-hand fight, many killed in flight; and they died not by the sword alone, but some of them were swallowed up, horses and all, when they became entangled in the swamps. Even the king was in danger; for, thrown headlong to the ground when <pb id="p.111"/>his wounded horse fell, he narrowly escaped being<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> trampled to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A trooper saved him, who quickly leaped down and lifted the terrified king to the back of his own horse;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> he himself, since on foot he could not equal the speed of the fleeing cavalry, perished, struck down by the cavalry who rushed up at the fall of the king. The king, riding about the marshes over roads and blind paths in full flight, came at length to his camp, when nearly all had given up hope of his safe return.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Two hundred of the Macedonian cavalry fell in this battle, and about one hundred were captured;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> about eighty horses, with their trappings, some spoils of weapons being also recovered among the booty, were driven off.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There have been some who accused the king of rashness and others the consul of lack of energy on that day:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Philip, they said, should have remained quiet, knowing that in a few days the enemy would be reduced to extreme need by the consumption of all the grain in the adjacent country, while the consul, after routing the enemy's cavalry and light infantry and almost capturing the king himself, should have immediately attacked the enemy's camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for the enemy, dismayed as they were, would not have awaited his onslaught, and the war could have been finished at one stroke.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This, as usual, was easier to say than to do. For if the king had made his attack with all his infantry in addition, perhaps in the confusion, when they were all rushing, beaten and panic-stricken, from the battle-field into the camp, if they had at once fled before a conquering foe that was overrunning the defences, the king might have been driven from his camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> but since his entire infantry had remained in camp, with outposts <pb id="p.113"/>and patrols stationed before the gates, what could<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> he have accomplished, except to imitate the rashness of the king, who had a little before pursued the scattered and fleeing cavalry?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor would there be any criticism even of the king's original plan, of attacking the foragers scattered over the fields, had he limited his objective to success in this attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is less strange, too, that he tempted fortune in this way, because there was a report that Pleuratus and the Dardani had already left home with great forces and had invaded Macedonia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and if he were surrounded by these encircling forces, it might well be believed that the Roman could end the war by sitting still.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So Philip, thinking it far less safe to remain in the same camp after two cavalry defeats, wanting to withdraw from there and to escape detection while so doing, at sunset sent a herald to the consul to ask a truce for burying
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the cavalrymen, and eluding the enemy stole away silently during the second watch, leaving numerous fires burning throughout the camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul was engaged in refreshing himself at the time it was announced that the herald had come and why he had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Replying merely that in the morning there would be opportunity for a conference, he gave Philip what he sought, the chance to retire rapidly during the night and a part of the next day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He made for the mountains, choosing a road which he knew the Roman, with his heavy-armed column, would not take. At daybreak the consul sent the herald away after granting the truce, and when he learned, no long time later, that the enemy had gone, not knowing where to pursue him, he spent some days in the same camp while gathering supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thence he marched to Stuberra and <pb id="p.115"/>brought there from Pelagonia the grain which was in<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the fields. He then marched to Pluinna, still ignorant as to where the enemy had gone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Philip had established a base near Bruanium, marching from there across country he inspired sudden terror in the enemy. On that account the Romans moved from Pluinna and encamped on the Osphagus river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king also pitched camp not far away, throwing up a rampart along the bank of a river &mdash;the natives call it Erigonus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, feeling certain that the Romans would move toward Eordaea, he hurried forward to gain the pass, that the Romans might not force the road, which was closed by the narrow entrance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There he threw up hasty fortifications, using sometimes a rampart, sometimes a ditch, sometimes piles of stones to serve as a wall, sometimes cut-down trees, as the nature of the terrain
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and the material at hand permitted, and, as he thought, rendered a road which was already naturally difficult impassable by the obstacles which he placed in all the open places.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There were many forests in the neighbourhood, a great hindrance to the Macedonian phalanx,<note>For the formation and battle tactics of the phalanx, and its advantages and disadvantages as compared with the more mobile Roman legion, see Polyb. XVIII. xxviii-xxxii. incl. Livy's account, while less explicit and detailed, is consistent with that of Polybius.</note> which was of absolutely no use except where it could thrust, so to speak, a rampart in front of the shields with its very long spears, and for this purpose they needed open country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Thracians too were impeded by their lances, which were likewise of great length, among the branches which projected in every direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Only the Cretan contingent was of much service, but even they, since they could only, if there was an attack, direct their arrows against unprotected horses and riders, so against the Roman shields they lacked the power of penetration, and there were left no unexposed parts at which they could aim.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <pb id="p.117"/>And so, when they perceived that weapons of this<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> kind were ineffective, they harassed the enemy with the stones which lay everywhere through the whole valley. The clash of these against the shields, causing more noise than damage, delayed the advancing Romans for a little while.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then, scorning these also, part of the Romans, forming a <hi rend="italics">testudo,</hi><note>An attack formation, in which overlapping shields, held above the heads and at the sides of the soldiers, offered protection to the men inside.</note> advanced in face of the enemy, while others, gaining the saddle by a short detour,
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> dislodged the terrified Macedonians from their strong points and outposts, and even killed some of them, since flight was slow in the difficult country.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So the pass was won with less trouble than had been anticipated, and the consul marched to Eordaea, and after laying waste the country in all directions, proceeded toward Elimia. Then he made an attack on Orestis and assaulted the town of Celetrum, which lay on a peninsula; a lake surrounds its walls; a narrow tongue of land offers the only approach from the mainland.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At first the natives, relying on their position, closed the gates and refused the demand to surrender;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but when they saw the standards brought forward and the <hi rend="italics">testudo</hi> advancing towards the gates and the isthmus filled with a throng of hostile troops, in panic they surrendered before they tried the issue of a battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From Celetrum he proceeded to the land of the Dassaretii and took the city of Pelium by storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He carried off the slaves from there with the rest of the booty, dismissed the freemen without ransom, and restored the town to them, leaving a strong garrison; for the town was favourably situated as a base for conducting raids into Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So the consul, having traversed the enemy's country, led his troops back to the peaceful <pb id="p.119"/>region around Apollonia, whence he had begun the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Philip was distracted by the Aetolians, the Athamanes and the Dardani and so many wars breaking out in one place after another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Against the Dardani, who were by this time withdrawing from Macedonia, he sent Athenagoras with the light infantry and the greater part of the cavalry, with orders to press on them from behind as they withdrew, and by nibbling at their rearguard to make them less inclined to move their army from home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Damocritus, the same president who had caused the delay in declaring war at Naupactus, had, at the next council, stirred up the Aetolians to war after they had heard of the cavalry battle at Ottolobum and the invasion of Macedonia by the Dardani and Pleuratus with the Illyrians, and, in addition, of the arrival of the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> fleet at Oreus and the naval blockade which threatened so many Macedonian cities on the coast.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These causes had reunited Damocritus and the Aetolians with the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and joining Amynander, the king of the Athamanes, they set out and besieged Cercinium. The inhabitants closed its gates, whether willingly or under compulsion, since they had a royal garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But within a few days Cercinium was captured and burned; both the slave and free inhabitants who survived from the great disaster were carried off with the rest of the booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Fear of the same fate drove all the dwellers around the marsh of Bo&euml;be to leave their homes and flee to the mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Aetolians then turned away and began to march toward Perrhaebia, by reason of the shortage of plunder. They captured and ruthlessly destroyed Cyretiae; they received in <pb id="p.121"/>voluntary surrender and alliance the people of<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Maloea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After Perrhaebia, Amynander made the proposal that they march against Gomphi; Athamania lies close to this town, and it seemed possible to capture it without a great struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Aetolians sought the fields of Thessaly, rich booty for the pillager, with Amynander following, though he did not approve either the haphazard raids of the Aetolians or their habit of pitching camp wherever chance suggested, without any deliberate choice of position or any care as to defence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Therefore, lest their rashness and carelessness cause any disaster to himself and his men, when he saw them encamping in the plains, exposed to attack from the town of Pharcado, he occupied a hill
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> a little more than a mile away, that was safe even though weakly fortified.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the Aetolians, except that they were plundering, seemed scarcely to remember that they were in hostile territory, some wandering about half-armed, some lying around the unguarded camp, spending days and nights alike in sleeping and drinking, Philip fell upon them unawares.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When some frightened fugitives from the fields had brought the news that he was approaching, Damocritus and the other commanders were terrified &mdash;for it was about the hour of noon, when most of them lay asleep and heavy with food &mdash;men
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> were rousing one another, ordering them to arm, sending out messengers to recall the pillagers who were straggling through the fields, and so great was the panic that some of the cavalry went out without swords and most of them without putting on their breastplates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Led out in such haste, when they had been able with difficulty to collect six hundred out of the whole number, infantry and <pb id="p.123"/>cavalry, they encountered the king's cavalry, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> superior in numbers, in equipment and in courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And so at the first shock, barely essaying a battle, they made for the camp in disgraceful rout; those who were cut off by the cavalry were killed and captured.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip ordered the recall sounded as his men approached the rampart; for men and horses were wearied less by the battle than by the length and especially the excessive speed of the march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So he ordered the cavalry by troops, the companies of light infantry in succession, to go to get water and to take their
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> meal, and kept some on guard under arms, as he awaited the column of infantry which moved more slowly on account of the weight of their equipment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they arrived, they too were ordered to set up their standards, stack their arms, and take a hasty meal, only two or three from each company at a time being sent for water; meanwhile the cavalry and light infantry stood ready in formation in case the enemy should make any move.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Aetolians &mdash;for now even those who had been scattered through the country had returned to camp &mdash;stationed armed guards around the gates and wall to defend the fortification, while, themselves in high spirits, they watched from safety their inactive foes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After the Macedonian standards were moved and the soldiers arrayed and formed for battle began to approach the wall, all suddenly left their posts and fled through the rear part of the camp to the hill and the camp of the Athamanes. Many of the Aetolians were killed or captured in their headlong flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If enough of the day had remained, Philip could without doubt have driven the Athamanes also from their <pb id="p.125"/>camp, but having used up the day in fighting and<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> then in plundering the camp, he bivouacked in a nearby plain beneath the hill, intending to attack the enemy at the following dawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But the Aetolians, still in the grip of the panic in which they had left their own camp, during the ensuing night fled in every direction. Amynander was of the greatest service, under whose leadership the Athamanes who knew the roads led them back to Aetolia over the mountains by paths unknown to the pursuing enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Aimless wandering in the disorderly flight threw no large number into the hands of the Macedonian cavalry, whom Philip had sent out to harass the enemy's column when at daybreak he saw the hill deserted.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, moreover, Athenagoras, the king's prefect, overtaking the Dardani as they retired into their own country, threw the rear of the column into confusion; then, after the Dardani had faced about and formed their line, there was a regular battle on equal terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the Dardani had begun again to proceed on their march, the king's forces with their cavalry and light infantry harried the Dardani, who had no such auxiliaries, and were burdened with weapons that were hard to handle; the terrain too favoured the Macedonians.<note>I have supplied the object of <hi rend="italics">adiuvabant</hi> in accordance with the apparent sense of the passage.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A very few were killed, more wounded, none captured, for it is their way not to leave their ranks rashly, but to fight and give ground in close formation.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In this way Philip, by checking two nations with timely attacks, undertaken with boldness not merely successful in the result, had recouped the losses sustained in the Roman war. Then another piece of good fortune diminished the number of his enemies <pb id="p.127"/>in Aetolia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Scopas,<note>Scopas had been strategus of the Aetolians in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>, but after a political reverse had gone to Egypt and entered the service of Ptolemy.</note> a prominent man among the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> tribe, sent by King Ptolemy from Alexandria with a great quantity of gold, had transported to Egypt six thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry whom he had hired; nor would he have left a single fighting-man of the Aetolians, if Damocritus, now warning them of the present war, now of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the future depopulation of the state, had not by his reproofs kept at home a part of the younger men, though
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> it is uncertain whether his action was due to concern for the state or a desire to thwart Scopas, who had not been generous with gifts to him.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the actions of the Romans and Philip on land during that summer; in the beginning of the same summer, the fleet, under the lieutenant Lucius Apustius, leaving Corcyra and rounding Malea joined King Attalus in the neighbourhood of Scyllaeum in the territory of Hermione.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then indeed the Athenian people, whose hatred for Philip had long been restrained by fear, in view of the prospect of aid at hand, gave full vent to their anger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Tongues ready to incite the mob are never lacking in that city; and this conduct is encouraged by popular applause, not only in free states generally, but especially in Athens, where oratory has greatest influence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They immediately proposed and the people passed a motion that all statues of Philip, all representations of him, and their inscriptions, and also those of his ancestors, male and female, should be removed and done away with, that all the feast-days, sacred observances and priesthoods which had been established in honour of him or his ancestors should be abolished;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> even the places in which any memorials or inscriptions in his honour had been set up should <pb id="p.129"/>be accursed, and that it should not be lawful to place<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> or dedicate in them thereafter anything that could lawfully be placed or dedicated in any unpolluted spot;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the public priests, as often as they offered prayers on behalf of the people of Athens and their allies, their armies and fleets, should so often curse and execrate Philip, his children and his kingdom, his military and naval forces, and the whole race and name of the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was added to the decree that if anyone thereafter made any proposal that had to do with bringing disgrace or ignominy on Philip, the Athenian people would adopt it <hi rend="italics">in toto;</hi> that if anyone said or did anything to lessen his ignominy or increase his honour, any person who slew such an one would be deemed to have slain him lawfully.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finally, it was added that all the decrees which had once been passed against the Pisistratidae<note>Hippias and Hipparchus, tyrants of Athens in the sixth century B.C., and the traditional objects of her hatred.</note> should be kept in force in the case of Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This was the Athenians' war against Philip, conducted by means of letters and words, which constitute their sole strength.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Attalus and the Romans, putting in first at Piraeus after leaving Hermione, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> tarrying there a few days and being loaded down with decrees as effusive in the praise of the allies as those others in condemnation of the enemy, sailed from Piraeus to Andros.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And when they had anchored in the harbour which they call
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Gaurium, sending ashore agents to test the disposition of the people, whether they preferred to surrender the city voluntarily rather than endure an attack, after the citizens replied that the citadel was held by a garrison of the king and that they were powerless, Attalus and the Roman lieutenant landed troops and all the <pb id="p.131"/>equipment for assaulting cities and approached the city<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> from different directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman arms and standards, which they had never seen before, and the spirit of the soldiers, so ready to advance to storm the walls, caused no small terror among the Greeks; so they straightway took refuge in the citadel and the enemy possessed the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And after holding the citadel for two days, trusting to the strength of the place rather than to their arms, on the third day they bargained that they and the garrison be transferred to Delium in Boeotia with one garment each, and surrendered the city and the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans gave these to King Attalus; the booty and the ornaments of the city they took for themselves. Attalus, rather than possess a deserted island, persuaded both nearly all of the Macedonians and some of the Andrians to remain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Later on those who had already crossed under the agreement were brought back from Delium by the king's promises, since longing too for their native land increased their inclination to trust him.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>From Andros they proceeded to Cythnos. After spending some days in vain in attacking the city, because it seemed scarcely worth the effort, they departed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At Prasiae &mdash;this is a place on the Attic mainland &mdash;twenty light-draft vessels of the Issaei<note>Issa was a small island off the Dalmatian coast.</note> joined the Roman fleet. These were sent to ravage the territory of the Carystii, while the rest put into Geraestus, a famous port of Euboea, to wait until the Issaei should return from Carystus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then all of them, setting sail for the open sea, went past the island of Scyros to Icos. Being delayed there a few days by strong north winds, as soon as calm weather returned, they sailed past Sciathus,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> a city recently looted and <pb id="p.133"/>destroyed by Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The soldiers, wandering around<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> the country, brought to the ships the grain and whatever food-stuffs they found; of booty there was none, nor had the Greeks done anything to deserve being plundered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Thence, on their way to Cassandrea, they held their course first for Mendaeus, the seaport of that city. Then, when they had rounded the promontory and were trying to bring the fleet up close to the city walls, a violent storm arising and the ships having been almost buried under the waves or scattered, they escaped to the shore with the loss of a great part of their rigging. This storm at sea was an omen of their fortunes on land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For when, after re-assembling the ships and landing the troops, they attacked the city, they were repulsed with considerable loss &mdash;there was a strong royal garrison there &mdash;and retiring after the failure of their enterprise they steered for Canastraeum in Pallene. Thence sailing around the cape of Torona they made for Acanthus. There they first plundered the country and then captured and sacked the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They went no farther &mdash;for by now the ships were laden with booty &mdash;but returned to Sciathos and thence to Euboea by the way they had come.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There they left the fleet and with ten light vessels entered the Malian gulf for a conference with the Aetolians regarding the plan of campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Pyrrhias the Aetolian was the head of the embassy Which came to Heraclea to discuss plans with the king and the Roman lieutenant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Attalus was asked to furnish one thousand soldiers in accordance with the treaty; for he was bound to supply that number for the armies fighting against Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was refused the Aetolians because they had previously <pb id="p.135"/>objected to marching out to devastate Macedonia, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> at the time when they might have compelled Philip, who was burning everything sacred and profane around Pergamum, to withdraw through concern for his own property.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the Aetolians were dismissed with hopes rather than actual assistance, the Romans making lavish promises; Apustius with Attalus returned to the fleet.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The question of an attack on Oreus was next discussed. The city was defended both by walls and, because it had been attacked before, by a strong garrison. After the capture of Andros twenty Rhodian ships, all decked, under command of Agesimbrotus, had joined the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were left on guard off Zelasium &mdash;this promontory in Phthiotis occupied a very strategic position beyond Demetrias &mdash;to watch if any movement from there was made by the Macedonian fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Heraclides, the king's prefect, was in command of the fleet there, intending to take advantage of any opportunity which was offered by the enemy's negligence rather than to undertake anything by open force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Romans and King Attalus attacked Oreus from opposite sides, the Romans by way of the maritime citadel, the king's troops up the valley lying between the two citadels, where the city was guarded by a wall as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And as they occupied different places, so they fought in different ways: the Romans by moving against the walls the mantlets, and sheds and battering-ram, the king's troops hurling missiles and huge stones with balistae, catapults, and every sort of artillery; they dug tunnels too, and whatever else had proved useful in the former siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But the Macedonians defending the city and citadels were not only more <pb id="p.137"/>numerous than before, but they fought with greater<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> courage, mindful at once of the king's rebuke for their former error<note>Oreus had been taken by Attalus and the Romans in <date value="-207">207 B.C.</date> (XXVIII. vi. 1-6) through the treachery of the Macedonian commander.</note> and also of his threats and promises for the future. Accordingly, when more time than was expected was being spent there, and a blockade and siege-works held out more hope than a sudden assault, the lieutenant, thinking that something else should be done in the meantime, leaving what seemed a sufficient force to complete the works, crossed to the nearest part of the mainland, to Larisa &mdash;this
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> is not the famous Larisa in Thessaly, but another, which they call Cremaste &mdash;and by a surprise attack captured everything but the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Attalus too took Pteleum when the citizens were fearing nothing of the sort, while the siege of the other city was going on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And now not only were the siege-works completed around Oreus, but the garrison which was inside was exhausted by continuous toil, by watchfulness day and night alike, and by wounds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Parts of the wall, moreover, fell in several places under the blows of the battering-ram; and the Romans, entering through the breaches by night penetrated to the citadel which is above the harbour. Attalus at daybreak, when the signal was given by the Romans from the citadel, also assailed the city, large parts of the wall having collapsed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> the garrison and the townspeople fled to the other citadel, where they surrendered two days later. The city was given to the king, the prisoners to the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The autumnal equinox was now at hand, and the Euboean gulf, which they call Coela, is dangerous to mariners. So, wanting to get away from there before the winter storms, they returned to Piraeus, whence they had set out on the campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.139"/>Apustius left thirty ships there and sailed past<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Malea to Corcyra. The king waited for the day of the mysteries of Ceres,<note>See xiv. 7 above and the note.</note> that he might take part in the ceremonies; after the celebration he too departed for Asia, having previously sent Agesimbrotus and the Rhodians home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This is the record of the actions of this summer on land and sea performed against Philip and his allies by the Roman consul and lieutenant with the aid of King Attalus and the Rhodians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The other consul, Gaius Aurelius,<note>The narrative continues from xxii. 3 above.</note> having arrived in his province and found the campaign finished, made no secret of his anger at the praetor for having fought in his absence.<note>We do not know what effect the senatorial decree reported in xi. 1 above had on the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> of Furius. Normally, he would have become a subordinate of Aurelius, and as such he would have no authority to fight without explicit orders from the consul and would be ineligible for a triumph. This is Aurelius' position. Furius seems to argue that his own <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> authorized him to act independently of the consul, and both of these claims are maintained in the debate that follows. The complicated legal question of the military status of Furius with respect to Aurelius is probably insoluble. The whole story of Furius' victory (xxi. 1-xxii. 3 above) and his triumph (xlvii. 6-xlix. 3 below) is rejected by some scholars as an anticipation of the events related in xxxii. 30, but their reasons seem inadequate.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Sending him accordingly to Etruria, he himself led the legions into the enemy's country, and, laying it waste, carried on the war with more booty than glory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Lucius Furius, partly because there was nothing for him to do in Etruria, partly because he was ambitious for a triumph over the Gauls, which he thought he could more easily obtain in the absence of the angry and jealous consul, when he had unexpectedly appeared in Rome, summoned the senate in the temple of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Bellona,<note>Magistrates and others possessing the <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> were not permitted to cross the <hi rend="italics">pomerium,</hi> the religious boundary of Rome. The temple of Bellona was outside this limit, and the senate often met there under circumstances like these.</note> gave an account of his achievements and asked that he be allowed to enter the city in triumph.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On many of the senators he made a favourable impression, because of the greatness of his achievements and through his personal influence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <pb id="p.141"/>The older members were for refusing the triumph, -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> partly because he had fought with an army legally under another's command, partly because he had left
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> his province as a result of his ardent desire to petition for a triumph when the opportunity offered itself; but this conduct was unprecedented;<note>Dio (frg. 57. 81) adds that an explanation of his actions was demanded.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the senators of consular rank especially urged that he should have waited for the consul; for he might, while defending the colony by locating his camp near the city, without committing himself to a decisive engagement, have delayed matters until the consul's arrival;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the senate's proper conduct would be to wait for the consul, as the praetor had not done; when they had heard consul and praetor debating face to face, they would, they said, judge more fairly concerning the issue.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A great part of the senate thought that the senators should consider only his record, and whether he had fought during his term of office and under his own auspices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When one of the two colonies which had been established as, so to speak, barriers to restrain Gallic uprisings had been sacked and burned, and the flames were about to leap over to the other, so close at hand, as from one building to another in a continuous row, what, pray, was the praetor to do?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For if it was improper to take any action without the consul, either the senate was at fault for entrusting an army to the praetor &mdash;for it would have been possible to order by senatorial decree that nothing should be done by the praetor, but only by the consul, if it had been desired that the consul's army and not the praetor's should do the fighting &mdash;or
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> else the consul was at fault, who had not joined the army at Ariminum, when he had ordered it to move from Etruria to Gaul, <pb id="p.143"/>to participate in a war which could not be legally<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> -<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> conducted without him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The emergencies of war, they argued, do not wait for the delays and postponements of commanders, and sometimes you must fight, not because you wish it, but because the enemy compels it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The battle itself and its results should be considered. The enemy had been routed and slaughtered, their camp captured and plundered, the siege of the colony raised, the prisoners from the other colony recovered and restored to their friends, the war finished in a single battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Not only had men rejoiced at that victory, but also a three-day period of thanksgiving had been decreed to the immortal gods, because Lucius Furius the praetor had conducted affairs, not poorly and rashly, but well and successfully. Finally, Gallic wars were by the will of fate, so to speak, entrusted to the Furii.<note>The dictator Camillus and his son, members of the <hi rend="italics">gens Furia,</hi> had won fame in fighting the Gauls: cf. V. xlix. 6; VII. xxv. 11; Tacitus, <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> II. lii. 8.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Through speeches of this kind, delivered by the praetor and his friends, the prestige of the consul, who was absent, was outweighed by the personal influence of the praetor, who was present, and a full session voted a triumph to Lucius Furius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lucius Furius the praetor triumphed over the Gauls while still in office, and deposited in the treasury three hundred and twenty thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of bronze, and one hundred thousand five hundred pieces<note>Livy does not specify the denomination of these coins, which were probably <hi rend="italics">denarii.</hi></note> of silver.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were no captives led before his chariot, no spoils displayed, no soldiers in his train.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Everything but the victory was in possession of the consul.</p> 
				<p>Next the games which had been vowed by Publius Cornelius Scipio during his consulship in Africa were celebrated with great splendour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was also decreed, regarding lands for his soldiers,<note>The distribution of land mentioned in iv. 1-2 above probably included only veterans of the Italian armies. Provision is now made for those who had fought in Spain and Africa.</note> that each <pb id="p.145"/>should receive two <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> of land for each year of their<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> service in Spain or Africa; the decemvirate<note>Probably the commission that made the previous allotment, but Livy may have omitted a motion creating a new decemvirate.</note> should make the distribution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Also, a commission of three was created to fill up the number of colonists for the people of Venusia, because the strength of that colony had been diminished in the Hannibalic war. The commissioners chosen were Gaius Terentius Varro, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, Publius Cornelius Scipio, the son of Gnaeus, and they enrolled the colonists for Venusia.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In the same year Gaius Cornelius Cethegus, who as proconsul was governing Spain, defeated a large hostile force in the territory of the Sedetani. According to report, fifteen thousand Spaniards were killed in this battle and seventy-eight standards captured.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Gaius Aurelius the consul, when he returned from the province to Rome to hold the elections, did not make the complaint that they had anticipated, that the senate had not waited for him nor given the consul an opportunity to debate with the praetor, but he did protest that they
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> had decreed the triumph in such a way that they had heard the testimony of no one except the man who was to
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> triumph, and not of those who had been present at the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their ancestors had ordained that the lieutenants, tribunes, centurions, and even the common soldiers should attend a triumph, to the end that the Roman people might see the witnesses to the deeds of the man to whom so signal an honour was given. Was there no one from the army which had fought against the Gauls, no camp-follower at least, if there was no soldier, whom the senate could ask how much truth or untruth there was in the praetor's report?<note>Aurelius' criticism of the procedure of the senate is surprisingly mild, but Furius had already celebrated his triumph.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then announced the date of the elections, at which <pb id="p.147"/>Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Villius<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> Tappulus were chosen consuls.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Also, grain was very cheap this year; a great quantity of grain which was brought from Africa was distributed to the people at two <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> per <hi rend="italics">modius</hi> by
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the curule aediles Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Sextus Aelius Paetus. They also celebrated the Roman Games with great magnificence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> they repeated one day's performance; they set up in the treasury five bronze statues out of the money collected as fines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Plebeian Games were thrice repeated entire by the aediles Lucius Terentius Massiliota and Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus, who had been chosen praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Funeral games lasting four days were exhibited in the forum in commemoration of the death of Marcus Valerius Laevinus, by his sons Publius and Marcus, and a gladiatorial show was given by them; twenty-five pairs of gladiators fought.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>It happened that both the curule aediles chosen at the election were men who could not be inaugurated at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For Gaius Cornelius Cethegus was elected in his absence, since he was engaged in administering the province of Spain; Gaius Valerius Flaccus, who was present when he was elected, could not take the oath to observe the

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At the request of Flaccus that he <pb id="p.149"/>be exempted from the operation of the law, the<note type="margin">B.C. 200</note> senate decreed that if the aedile could find someone, approved by the consuls, who would take the oath on his behalf, the consuls, if it seemed wise to them, should request the tribunes to bring a resolution before the assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lucius Valerius Flaccus, the praetor-elect, was proposed to take the oath in his brother's place.

				<p>The causes of the renewal of the war against King Philip
					of Macedonia, for some time interrupted, are reported thus:
					At the time of the mysteries, two young Acarnanians who
					had not been initiated came to Athens and entered the
					temple of Ceres with others of their countrymen. For this
					reason they were killed by the Athenians as if guilty of a
					monstrous crime. The Acarnanians, incensed by their
					death, asked help of Philip to avenge them and laid siege
					to Athens; the Athenians asked aid of the Romans a few
					months after the grant of peace to the Carthaginians.
					When the ambassadors of the Athenians who were being
					besieged by Philip had asked the senate for assistance and
					the senate thought that it should be granted, the assembly
					dissenting because the long-continued toil of so many wars
					was a burden, the authority of the senate prevailed upon
					the assembly also to vote that aid be sent to the allied state.
					This war was entrusted to the consul Publius Sulpicius,
					who, leading his army to Macedonia, fought successfully
					with Philip in cavalry battles. The people of Abydus,
					besieged by Philip, slew themselves and their families after
					the manner of the Saguntines. Lucius Furius the praetor
					defeated in pitched battle the Insubrian Gauls who were in
					revolt and Hamilcar the Carthaginian who was stirring up
					war in that part of Italy. Hamilcar and thirty-five thousand men were killed in that campaign. It contains in
					addition the raids of King Philip and Sulpicius the consul
					and the captures of cities by each. The consul Sulpicius
					conducted the war with the aid of King Attalus and the
					Rhodians. Lucius Furius the praetor triumphed over the
					Gauls.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls and praetors, having entered upon<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> their offices on the Ides of March, drew lots for the provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The result gave Italy to Lucius Lentulus, Macedonia to Publius Villius, while of the praetors, the city jurisdiction fell to Lucius Quinctius, Ariminum to Gnaeus Baebius, Sicily to Lucius Valerius, and Sardinia to Lucius Villius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul Lentulus was directed to enlist new legions, Villius to take over the army from Publius Sulpicius; he was allowed, as addition thereto, to enroll whatever number of soldiers he saw fit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The legions which Gaius Aurelius the consul had had were decreed to the praetor Baebius, with the proviso that he should keep them until the consul with the new army should relieve him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> when he arrived in Gaul, all the soldiers who had served their terms were to be sent home except five thousand of the allies; this number seemed sufficient to hold the province around Ariminum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The authority of two praetors of the preceding year was extended, that of Gaius Sergius, to permit him to organize the distribution of land to the soldiers who had served for many years in Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia,<note>Sergius had been <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus</hi> the year before. The legislation authorizing this distribution is not mentioned by Livy.</note> and
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that of Quintus Minucius, to enable him to complete the inquiry<note>For this episode see XXXI. xii. 1-4.</note> regarding conspiracies in Bruttium, which he had carried on as praetor with loyalty and energy, to return to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Locri for punishment the men he had sent in chains to Rome after they were <pb id="p.157"/>found guilty of sacrilege, and to arrange to replace<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> the money stolen from the shrine of Persephone, along with the sin-offerings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Latin Festival was repeated by order of the pontiffs, because delegates from Ardea had made complaint in the senate that the flesh of the animals sacrificed on the Alban Mount had not been given to them, as was the custom.<note>This ceremonial had been practised by the memberstates of the Latin League and later by them and the Romans jointly (see V. xvii. 2, etc.), and was continued after the subjugation to Rome in <date value="-338">338 B.C.</date> White steers were sacrificed to Jupiter Latiaris, and the flesh was divided among the cities that were members of the league.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>News came from Suessa that two gates and the adjacent portion of the wall had been struck by lightning; and ambassadors from Formiae reported that the same thing had happened to the temple of Jupiter, from Ostia, to the temple of Jupiter, from Velitrae, to the shrines of Apollo and Sangus;<note>Sangus (<hi rend="italics">Semo Sancus</hi>) was a Sabine deity worshipped in Rome also; cf. VIII. xx. 8.</note> and it was said that the hair had grown in the temple of Hercules;<note>Livy is pardonably vague about this phenomenon, but it was probably the hair on the statue in the temple that began to grow, rather than hair on the walls of the building.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> also, Quintus Minucius the propraetor wrote from Bruttium that a five-legged colt had been born, and three chicks each with three feet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Letters were brought from Macedonia, from the proconsul Publius Sulpicius, in which, among other things, it was said that a laurel had grown out of the stern of a war-ship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By reason of the former prodigies, the senate had decreed that the consuls should sacrifice full-grown victims to whatever gods it seemed wise; on account of this last event,<note>The books of the pontiffs probably furnished no precedent.</note> the <hi rend="italics">haruspices</hi> were called into the senate, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> on their advice a period of prayer was proclaimed to the people for one day, and sacrifices were performed at all the banquet tables of the gods.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Carthaginians that year brought to Rome the first instalment of the tribute imposed upon them.<note>An initial payment was reported at XXX. xliv. 4.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Because the quaestors reported that it was not <pb id="p.159"/>pure silver and since a fourth part of it melted away<note>The quaestors melted up sample coins and the bullion proved to be 25 per cent. short in weight. This was due to the presence of base metal in the coins.</note> -<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> while they were testing it, the Carthaginians made up the shortage in the amount of money by borrowing in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At their request that, if the senate was now favourably disposed, their hostages should be returned to them, one hundred hostages were given back;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> hope for the rest was offered if they remained faithful. When they asked also
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that the hostages who were not returned should be moved from Norba, where they were not comfortable, to some other place, it was permitted them to go to Signia or Ferentinum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A concession was also made to the people of Gades, who asked that no prefect<note>The term <hi rend="italics">praefectus</hi> was applied sometimes to a resident military governor, sometimes to a minor official sent by a provincial governor to administer affairs in individual communities, sometimes to an official designated to oversee civil and legal administration in a town. In Italy, communities so governed enjoyed only limited privileges. Probably a person of the last class is meant here.</note> should be sent to Gades contrary to what had been agreed upon with Lucius Marcius Septimus<note>Marcius, a centurion, assumed command of the Roman forces in Spain after the death of the two Scipios (Cicero, <hi rend="italics">pro Balbo,</hi> 34), and in <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date> concluded a treaty with the people of Gades (XXVIII. xxxvii. 10).</note> when they put themselves under the protection of the Roman people. Also, when ambassadors from Narnia complained that the colonists there were not up to the number determined,<note>The act establishing each colony determined the number of colonists assigned. The burdens imposed upon a colony were proportioned to the legal, and not to the actual number of colonists.</note> and that some persons of alien race, mingling with them, were conducting themselves as colonists, by reason of this report the consul Lucius Cornelius was directed to appoint a board of three to investigate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This board consisted of Publius and Sextus Aelius &mdash;both surnamed Paetus &mdash;and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus. What had been granted to the people of Narnia, to wit, the increasing of the number of colonists, the people of Cosa asked but did not obtain.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls transacted the necessary business <pb id="p.161"/>at Rome and departed for their provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> Villius, on his arrival in Macedonia, found a dangerous mutiny in the army, begun some time before and not repressed with sufficient vigour at the outset.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were about two thousand soldiers who had been brought back from Africa to Sicily after the defeat of Hannibal, and about a year later moved to Macedonia as volunteers.<note>The enlistment of volunteers from the African army was authorized at XXXI. viii. 6; their enlistment was mentioned at XXXI. xiv. 2.</note> They asserted that this had not been done with their consent; they had been put on board by their tribunes in spite of their protests.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But whatever the facts were, whether their service was compulsory or voluntary, it was, they said, finished, and it was right that there be some end to their soldiering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For many years they had not seen Italy; they had grown old under arms in Sicily, Africa, Macedonia; they were now worn out by labour and exertion and drained of blood by the many wounds they had received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul replied that their demand for discharge seemed to have merit if properly presented; but neither this cause nor any other justified mutiny.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Accordingly, if they chose to remain with the standards and obey orders, he would write to the senate regarding their discharge; they would obtain what they wanted more easily by obedience than by resistance.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip<note>Here Livy resumes his account of Philip's campaign after the defeat of the Aetolians (XXXI. xlii. 9) in the autumn of the year <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date></note> was at that time besieging Thaumaci with the greatest energy, using terraces and mantlets, and was on the point of using his battering-ram against the walls;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but he was compelled to give up his enterprise by the sudden attack of the Aetolians, who, under the command of Archidamus, slipped through the screen of Macedonian patrols into the city, and never, either by night or day, ceased making sallies, now against the Macedonian outposts, now <pb id="p.163"/>against their siege-works. The nature of the place, -<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> too, aided them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For Thaumaci lies high above the road as you come from Pylae and the Malian Gulf by way of Lamia, on the very pass, overlooking what they call Hollow Thessaly;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the country is rough as you pass through, over roads that wind their way through twisting valleys, and when you reach the city, suddenly the whole plain spreads out before you like an expanse of open sea, so that you can hardly measure with your eyes the fields beneath you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From this marvellous sight is derived the name <quote>Thaumaci.</quote><note>Livy connects the name with the Greek <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> <quote>a marvel.</quote></note> The city is defended both by its lofty site and by the fact that it lies on cliffs with steep descents on all sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These difficulties, together with the fact that it was scarcely a due reward for so much effort and risk, induced Philip to abandon his design.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Winter, too, was now at hand when he retired from there and led his troops into winter quarters in Macedonia.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There the rest devoted to relaxation of mind and body alike whatever little quiet time was allowed them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Philip, however great relief of mind he had obtained after the ceaseless labour of marching and fighting, was so much the more concerned and worried about the final outcome of the war, not only fearing the enemy, who was pressing upon
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> him by land and sea, but distrusting the attitude now of his allies, now even of his subjects, fearing both that the former should revolt, in the hope of an alliance with the Romans, and that the Macedonians themselves should be inspired by a desire for revolution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So he sent ambassadors to Achaea, partly to demand the oath<note>Livy says nothing elsewhere about this oath, but it may be mentioned by Polybius (IV. ix. 4), who speaks of a reciprocal pledge, which may have been gradually converted into an admission of Macedonian supremacy.</note> &mdash;for they had agreed to renew annually their pledges of loyalty to him &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> partly to restore <pb id="p.165"/>to the Achaeans Orchomenus and Heraea, and also<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> Triphylia which had been taken from the Eleans, and to the Megalopolites Aliphera, since they argued that this city had never belonged to Triphylia, but should be given back to them, since it was one of the towns that had been turned over to form the city of Megalopolis in accordance with the decree of the Arcadian council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And with the Achaeans indeed he did by these measures strengthen the alliance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but with regard to the disposition of the Macedonians, since he realized that his friendship with Heraclides was particularly a source of unpopularity for him, he heaped accusations upon him and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> threw him into prison, to the great joy of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Philip at this time made preparation with great energy, if he had ever done so before, on any occasion, and drilled both his Macedonians and his mercenary troops, and in the beginning of spring sent all his foreign auxiliaries and what light-armed troops he had, under Athenagoras, to Chaonia by way of Epirus, to hold the passes leading to Antigonea &mdash;the Greeks call them The Narrows.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He himself followed a few days later with the heavier troops, and when he had reconnoitred the whole region, he determined upon a site near the river Aous as the most suitable place for a fortified base of operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This river, flowing through a defile between ranges, one called by the natives Meropus, the other Asnaus, leaves a narrow road along the bank. He ordered Athenagoras and the light troops to hold and fortify Asnaus; he himself pitched camp on Meropus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Where the cliffs were steep, a guard of a few armed men held them; where they were less defensible, they were protected, some by ditches, <pb id="p.167"/>some by ramparts, some by towers. Numerous<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> pieces of artillery were also posted in suitable places, to keep the enemy at a distance with their missiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The royal headquarters he established in plain sight on a hill in front of the rampart, to inspire terror in the enemy and in his own men the hope that springs from confidence.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul had learned through Charopus the Epirote what passes the king had occupied with his army, and after wintering in Corcyra he crossed to the mainland at the coming of spring and began to lead his army against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he was about five miles from the king's camp, after fortifying the place and leaving behind the legions, he himself went forward to reconnoitre with some light troops, and on the next day held a council, whether he should try to force
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> a passage through the valley which was held by the enemy, although great labour and danger were involved, or should follow the same circuitous route by which Sulpicius had entered Macedonia the previous year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> While he was spending many days in discussing this question, word came to him that Titus Quinctius had been elected consul, had obtained from the lots the province of Macedonia, had hastened his journey, and had already arrived at Corcyra.<note>There is no real confusion in Livy's chronology. The source which Livy follows in sects. 1-4 represents Villius, the consul of <date value="-199">199 B.C.</date>, as reaching Greece too late to take the field in the autumn of that year (I am drawing this inference from the silence of Livy), as wintering in Corcyra, and as carrying on, in the spring of <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date>, before the arrival of his successor, the campaign just described. Then, in sects. 5-7, Livy quotes from Valerius Antias an entirely different story of the spring campaign of <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date> This variant Livy, at least by implication, rejects. He reports, in sect. 4 and again in sect. 8, at the end of each of the conflicting narratives, the arrival of Quinctius in Greece, although he does not mention the election of Quinctius as consul for <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date> until vii. 12 below.</note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Valerius Antias writes that Villius, because he could not use the direct road, since the whole country was held by the king, entered the defile, followed the valley through the midst of which the river Aous flows, and, hastily throwing a bridge over the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <pb id="p.169"/>river to the bank on which the king's camp lay, -<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> crossed and engaged the enemy; that he defeated the king and put him to flight and expelled him from his camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that he killed twelve thousand of the enemy in that battle and captured- two thousand two hundred, together with one hundred thirty-two standards and two hundred thirty horses; and that he vowed a temple to Jupiter in this battle, if success attended him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other Greek and Latin writers, at least those whose annals I have consulted, report that Villius did nothing worthy of remark, but handed over to the next consul, Titus Quinctius, the war in the same state that he had received it.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was happening in Macedonia,<note>Livy now records the events in Rome of the year <date value="-199">199 B.C.</date></note> the other consul, Lucius Lentulus, who had remained at Rome, held the meeting for the election of censors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although many distinguished men were candidates, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Publius Aelius Paetus were elected censors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They selected the members of the senate in complete harmony with one another and without putting the brand of infamy<note>The censors could determine also a citizen's classification on the census lists, and so could degrade an individual by placing him in a lower classification. This was accomplished by placing a particular mark (<hi rend="italics">nota</hi>) opposite his name on the rolls. But in Livy here, this reference is to membership of the Senate only.</note> on any man, let the contract for the collection of the sales-tax at Capua and Puteoli and the port-duties of Castra,<note>Capua was not a port, and <hi rend="italics">portoria venalicium</hi> can not then refer to customs-duties, but must mean some other form of tax on merchandise, most probably a sales-tax of some kind. The town meant in the next clause cannot be identified, but it has been conjectured that it was a town which grew out of one of Hannibal's semi-permanent camps (Pliny, <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> III. 95). If so, it may have been a harbour, and <hi rend="italics">potorium</hi> would have its ordinary meaning of a <quote>port-tax.</quote> My translation takes it thus, and regards <hi rend="italics">Castrum</hi> as the shorter genitive of <hi rend="italics">Castra.</hi> Possibly we should read <hi rend="italics">Castrum Portorium</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italics">Castrum Novum</hi> in XXXVI. iii. 6), but this leaves <hi rend="italics">fruendum</hi> with no obvious construction. There is corruption in the text of the earlier part of the sentence, and perhaps it extends into this clause; in this case certainty as to the meaning is probably unattainable.</note> where there is now a town, and for this place enrolled three hundred colonists &mdash;for this number had been fixed by the senate &mdash;and sold the land of Capua at the foot of Mount Tifata.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At this same time Lucius Manlius Acidinus, on <pb id="p.171"/>his return from Spain, was prevented by Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> Porcius Laeca, tribune of the people, from entering the city in ovation,<note>Manlius, like Lentulus (XXXI. xx.), had commanded in Spain after the return of Scipio (XXVIII. xxxviii. 1), and the situations of the two men, with respect to a triumph, were similar. The opposition of Laeca is more successful than that of Sempronius in the other case.</note> although the privilege had been granted him by the senate, and, entering the city as a private person, deposited in the treasury twelve hundred pounds of silver and about thirty pounds of gold.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>During the same year, Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus, who had succeeded Gaius Aurelius, consul of the preceding year, as governor of the province of Gaul, rashly invaded the territory of the Insubrian Gauls and was cut off with almost his entire army;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he lost more than six thousand seven hundred men; such a disaster was suffered in a war that no one any longer feared. This event summoned Lucius Lentulus the consul from the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he arrived in a province full of terror and had taken over a panic-stricken army, he roundly upbraided the praetor and ordered him to leave the province and return to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor did the consul, even, accomplish anything worth recording, being recalled to Rome to hold the elections; the actual meetings were blocked by the plebeian tribunes Marcus Fulvius and Manius Curius, because they would
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> not allow Titus Quinctius Flamininus to stand for the consulship immediately after the quaestorship:<note>Until the enactment of the <hi rend="italics">lex Villia annalis</hi> in <date value="-180">180 B.C.</date> (XL. xliv. 1), custom alone controlled the sequence in which the offices were held, though sect. 11 below suggests that there were certain legal conditions of eligibility. However, the later legislation that created the <hi rend="italics">cursus honorum</hi> merely gave legal form to the prevailing practice, which was that the offices of quaestor, aedile, praetor, and consul should normally be held in that order.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the aedileship and praetorship, they said, were already treated with contempt, and the nobles, without passing through the offices in succession, and so giving proof of their worth, were aiming straight at the consulship and, leaping over the intermediate stages, were making the <pb id="p.173"/>highest distinctions continuous with the lowest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> -<note type="margin">B.C. 199</note> After being debated in the assembly,<note>The centuriate assembly met in the Campus Martius: hence <hi rend="italics">campestri.</hi></note> the matter was referred to the senate. The Fathers voted that it seemed proper that the right should reside in the people to elect anyone they chose who sought an office it was legally permissible to him to hold.<note>The phrase <hi rend="italics">per leges liceret</hi> may be rather negative in force: <quote>it was not expressly forbidden.</quote> No legislation fixing eligibility qualifications is known to us antedating the <hi rend="italics">lex Villia</hi> (see note to sect. 9 above), and had there been age limits, Flamininus, who was about thirty years of age (XXXIII. xxxiii. 3), would probably have been excluded by them. The phrase then may refer to restrictions such as that which limited the tribunate to plebeians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The tribunes yielded to the senate's will. Sextus Aelius Paetus and Titus Quinctius Flamininus were chosen consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then the praetorian elections were held. The choice fell on Lucius Cornelius Merula, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Marcus Porcius Cato, and Gaius Helvius, who had been plebeian aediles.<note>The clause refers to Cato and Helvius alone.</note> By them the Plebeian Games were repeated, and a banquet to Jupiter was held on the occasion of the games.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Also, the Roman Games were celebrated with great splendour by the curule aediles Gaius Valerius Flaccus (who was Flamen Dialis) and Gaius Cornelius Cethegus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Servius and Gaius Sulpicius Galba, pontiffs, died that year; in their place Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio were appointed pontiffs.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Sextus Aelius Paetus and Titus -<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> Quinctius Flamininus had been inaugurated and had convened the senate on the Capitoline, the senate decreed that the consuls should arrange between themselves or cast lots for the provinces of Macedonia and Italy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> whichever of them was allotted Macedonia was authorized to enlist, as reinforcement to the legions, three thousand Roman infantry and three hundred cavalry, and besides five thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry of the allies of <pb id="p.175"/>the Latin confederacy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> An entirely new army was<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> provided for the other consul. The command of Lucius Lentulus, consul of the previous year, was extended, and he was ordered not to leave the province himself or to discharge the veteran troops until the consul arrived with the new legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls drew lots for the provinces: Italy fell to Aelius, Macedonia to Quinctius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The praetors then drew, Lucius Cornelius Merula receiving the city jurisdiction, Marcus Claudius Sicily, Marcus Porcius Sardinia, Gaius Helvius Gaul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They then began to conduct the levy; for in addition to the consular armies the enlistment of troops for the praetors as well was ordered;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for Marcellus, for service in Sicily, four thousand infantry of the allies and the Latin confederacy and three hundred cavalry; for Cato, two thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry from the same source for Sardinia, so that these two praetors, on
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> arrival in their provinces, could send home their veteran infantry and cavalry.</p> 
				<p>The consuls then presented to the senate ambassadors from King Attalus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they had explained that the king was aiding the Roman cause on land and sea with his fleet and all his forces, and had up to that day zealously and loyally performed whatever the Roman consuls ordered, they said that there was ground for fear that by reason of the activity of King Antiochus he could not guarantee to continue;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for Antiochus had invaded the kingdom of Attalus when it was stripped of the protection of its navy and army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Therefore Attalus begged the senators, if they wished to employ his fleet and forces for the Macedonian war, themselves to send forces to defend his kingdom; if they did not, to permit him to return <pb id="p.177"/>to defend his possessions with his fleet and other troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> -<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> The senate ordered this reply given the ambassadors: that the senate appreciated the fact that King Attalus had aided the Roman generals with his fleet and other forces; that they would neither themselves send aid to Attalus against Antiochus, an ally and friend of the Roman people, nor keep Attalus' troops longer than was convenient for the king;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> that the Roman people had always employed the property of others at the pleasure of those others;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> that both the beginning and the end of rendering assistance was under the control of those who wished the Roman people to enjoy their aid; that they would send ambassadors to Antiochus to point out that the Roman people was employing the aid of Attalus and his ships and soldiers against the common enemy Philip;
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> that he would oblige the senate by keeping away from the kingdom of Attalus and refraining from war, and that it was
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> proper that kings who were allies and friends of the Roman people should likewise be at peace with one another.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul Titus Quinctius, when he had conducted his levy in such a way as to select generally soldiers of tried courage who had served in Spain or Africa, and was hastening his departure for his province, was detained by reports of prodigies and by their expiation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Lightning struck a public highway at Veii, the forum and temple of Jupiter at Lanuvium, the temple of Hercules at Ardea, the wall and towers and the so-called <quote>White Temple</quote> at Capua; flames were seen in the sky at Arretium;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the earth subsided in a great cavern three <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> in extent at Velitrae; at Suessa Aurunca men said that a two-headed lamb was born, and at Sinuessa <pb id="p.179"/>a pig with a man's head.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By reason of these prodigies<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> a day of prayer was proclaimed, and the consuls attended to the sacrifices and, having appeased the gods, departed to their provinces, Aelius with the praetor Helvius to Gaul;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and the army which he received from Lucius Lentulus, and which he was under obligation to discharge, he turned over to the praetor, intending himself to conduct the war with the new legions which he had brought with him. Nor did he accomplish anything noteworthy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the other consul, Titus Quinctius, had crossed from Brundisium earlier than previous consuls had been wont to leave, he proceeded to Corcyra with eight thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry.<note>The narrative continues from the arrival of Quinctius (vi. 4 above); see the note.</note> From Corcyra he crossed in a quinquereme to the nearest parts of Epirus and hastened rapidly to the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There he delayed a few days after sending Villius home, until the troops from Corcyra overtook him, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> held a council, whether to attempt to force a passage straight through the enemy's camp or, without even trying so difficult and dangerous a feat, to proceed into Macedonia rather by the safe but longer route through the Dassaretii and by way of Lyncus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And this latter view would have prevailed had there not been the fear that, when he had moved farther from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> sea, he would let the enemy slip from his grasp, if, as had happened before, the king preferred to safeguard himself in wildernesses and forests, and the summer would be spent in vain. Whatever might then be the result, it was decided to attack the enemy, even on this very unfavourable terrain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But the council was firmer in its resolution to do this than clear as to how to accomplish it.</p> <pb id="p.181"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus, sitting in sight of the enemy, they had<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> wasted forty days without attempting anything. And so Philip was encouraged to try peace proposals through the mediation of the people of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Epirus, and, after a council had been called, Pausanias the praetor and Alexander the master of the horse,<note>The exact significance of these titles, as applied to these individuals, is unknown.</note> chosen for the purpose, brought the consul and the king together in a conference at the point where the river Aous is confined within its narrowest course.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The substance of the consul's demands was this: The king should withdraw his garrisons from the cities; he should restore what property was recoverable to those whose lands and towns he had ravaged; a valuation should be made of the rest by an impartial board.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Philip replied that the status of the several cities was not uniform: those which he had himself captured, he would set free; of those which he had received from his forefathers he would not surrender his hereditary and lawful possession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If these states with which he had fought complained of any losses due to war, he would submit to arbiters chosen by them from nations with which both parties were at peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul responded that for this purpose there was no need of any arbiter or umpire: for to whom was it not evident that he who had been the aggressor in war inflicted the injury, and that Philip, attacked by none, had first waged war on all?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, when they came to discuss what states were to be set free, the consul named the Thessalians before all the rest. At this the king became so incensed with rage that he exclaimed, <quote>What heavier command, Titus Quinctius, could you lay upon a beaten foe?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> and so rushed from the conference; and he was with difficulty restrained from beginning the <pb id="p.183"/>battle with missiles, since they were separated by<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> the intervening river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The next day, in consequence of sallies from the outposts, there were numerous slight skirmishes in the plain, which afforded ample space for them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> then, as the royal forces withdrew to the steep and rugged hillsides, the Romans too, carried away by their zest for combat, forced their way to the same places.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On their side were the advantages of order and discipline and armour adapted to affording protection to the wearer; on the enemy's, the terrain and the catapults and ballistae ranged on almost all the cliffs as along a wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When many had been wounded on both sides, and a considerable number had even fallen, as in a regular engagement, night put an end to the fighting.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When matters were in this state, a shepherd, sent by Charopus, a leading man of Epirus, was brought before the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He said that he had been accustomed to pasture his flocks in the valley which the king's camp then occupied, and knew all the tracks and paths of those hills.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If the consul wished to send some men with him, he would guide them by a road, quite level and not very difficult, to a place commanding the enemy's position.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul, on hearing this, sent to Charopus to inquire whether he thought the shepherd should be trusted in so important a matter. Charopus ordered the message back to be that he should trust him, but only so far as to keep the control of the situation in his own hands rather than in the shepherd's. Wishing,
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> rather than venturing, to trust him, and with feelings of mingled joy and apprehension, he was persuaded by the assurances of Charopus and determined to use the chance presented to him, <pb id="p.185"/>and, to prevent the king
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> from suspecting, he did not<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> cease for two successive days to attack the enemy, posting detachments on all sides and sending fresh troops to relieve the weary. Then he put a tribune in command of four thousand picked infantry and three hundred cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He ordered him to take the cavalry as far as the ground permitted; when the road became impassable for cavalry, he should leave them on some level spot and go with the infantry wherever the guide conducted them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> when he reached, as the guide promised, the place above the enemy, the tribune should send up a smoke-signal but raise no shout until, after the answering signal had been received from him, he could judge that the battle had begun. He instructed the tribune to march by night &mdash;and the moon happened to be full &mdash;and by day to take time for food and rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The guide, loaded with magnificent promises, if he should keep faith, but nevertheless in chains, he turned over to the tribune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Having thus sent out his troops, the Roman pressed the attack the more vigorously from all sides, selected vantage-grounds.<note>The corruption in the text makes the meaning uncertain.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile, on the third day, when the Romans had sent up the smoke-signal that they had reached and were holding the height which they had sought, then in earnest the consul formed his army in three columns and marched with the flower of his troops up the middle of the valley and hurled his right and left wings against the camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the enemy came to meet him with no less vigour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And while, carried forward by their desire to fight, they were struggling outside the breastworks, the Roman army enjoyed no small advantage in courage and skill and character of weapons; but after the <pb id="p.187"/>king's troops, when many had been wounded and<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> killed, retired to positions strengthened by art or strong by nature, the danger recoiled upon the Romans, who pushed forward impetuously over unfavourable ground and cramped places that hindered easy withdrawal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor would they have succeeded in getting away without suffering for their rashness had not first a shout been heard from the rear and then an attack from that side too driven the king's troops mad with sudden panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Part broke in a rout; others, when they had made a stand, more because they had no place to flee than because they had sufficient will to fight, were cut off by the enemy pressing on from both front and rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The whole army could have been destroyed if the victors had pursued the routed enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> but the narrow roads and the rough country hindered the cavalry, the weight of their arms the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At first the king fled headlong and without looking back; then, having travelled five miles, suspecting what proved to be true, that the enemy could not follow on account of the unfavourable ground, he stopped on a certain hill and sent out messengers throughout the ridges and valleys to collect the stragglers in one place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When all the army (except not more than two thousand men who were lost) had come to the same place, as if following some signal, they made for Thessaly in solid column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Romans followed as far as it was safe, killing and despoiling the slain, and plundered the king's camp, which, even when undefended, was difficult to approach; and spent that night in their own camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day the consul followed the enemy along the defile through which the river makes its <pb id="p.189"/>way down the valley.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king on the first day<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> reached the camp of Pyrrhus; the place called by this name is in Triphylia and belongs to the territory of Molottis. The next day &mdash;an over-long march for an army, but fear drove them on &mdash;they reached thence the Lyncus mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This range is in Epirus, lying between Macedonia and Thessaly; the side which overlooks Thessaly faces east, the northern, Macedonia. It is clothed with abundant forests; the summits of the ridges offer open fields and ever-flowing springs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There Philip remained in camp for several days, uncertain in mind whether he should straightway return to his kingdom or try to beat the enemy into Thessaly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> His decision was to lead the army into Thessaly, and he moved to Tricca by the shortest routes; then he rapidly traversed the towns in his way. He summoned from their homes the men who could follow; the towns he burned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The owners were allowed to carry with them what they could of their possessions; the rest was booty for the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nor was there any hardship unexperienced, which an enemy could inflict, greater than what they suffered at the hands of their allies. Such actions were distasteful to Philip even as he did them, but he wished
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> to rescue, from a land that was soon to belong to his enemies, at least the persons of his allies. So Phacium, Iresiae, Euhydrium, Eretria, Palaepharsalus, were destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Excluded from Pherae, when he tried to take it, because it would require time if he tried to capture it, and he had no time, he gave up that undertaking and crossed into Macedonia; for it was rumoured that the Aetolians were close at hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They, having heard of the battle at <pb id="p.191"/>the Aous river, and having laid waste the country<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> close around Sperchiae and Macra, which they call, Come, crossed thence into Thessaly and captured Cymene and Angeia at the first assault. From Metropolis, while they were devastating the farms, they were driven back, the townsmen having collected to defend their walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When they attacked Callithera they sustained more stubbornly a similar sally of townspeople; and driving back within their own walls the party that had made the sally, they departed, content with this success, because they had no real hope of capturing the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Next they took and sacked the villages of Teuma and Celathara and received Acharrae in surrender. Xyniae was abandoned by the inhabitants in similar fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The procession of its citizens, exiles from their homes, fell in with a garrison which was on its way to Thaumacus,<note>Probably the place called Thaumaci in chap. iv. above</note> that it might forage in greater security;
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> the undisciplined and unarmed mass, mingled too with the unwarlike mob, was slaughtered by the soldiers,. The abandoned city of Xyniae was looted. The Aetolians next captured Cyphaera, a fortress favourably situated to threaten Dolopia. Such is the record of the Aetolians' swift campaign of a few days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Nor did Amynander and the Athamanes remain quiet after they heard of the Roman victory.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But when Amynander, having asked the consul for a small detachment, since he had little confidence in his own men, was moving on Gomphi, he immediately took by storm a town called Phaeca, lying between Gomphi and the narrow pass which separates Athamania and Thessaly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he attacked Gomphi, and the inhabitants, after defending the city with all their might for some days, were <pb id="p.193"/>finally reduced to surrender by their fear, when he<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> had placed his scaling-ladders against the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The surrender of Gomphi caused great terror to the Thessalians. In turn the inhabitants of Argenta and Pherinium and Timarum and Ligynae and Strymon and Lampsus and other insignificant forts in the vicinity surrendered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While the Aetolians and Athamanes, laying aside their fear of Macedonia, were reaping, through plundering, the fruits of another's victory, and Thessaly was being wasted by three armies at once, not knowing which to believe was foe and which ally, the consul marched
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> into the country of Epirus through the pass which had been laid open by the flight of the enemy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> although he knew full well which side the Epirotes favoured, with the exception of one leading citizen, Charopus, nevertheless, because he saw them zealously carrying out his orders in their desire to please him, he judged them rather by their present than their past behaviour, and won over, by his readiness to pardon, their support for the future.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, sending messengers to Corcyra, that the cargo-ships should proceed to the Ambracian gulf, he advanced by easy marches and on the fourth day encamped on Mount Cercetius, summoning there Amynander with his auxiliaries, not so much from need of his assistance as that he might have guides into Thessaly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> From the same motive, many volunteers of the Epirotes were enlisted for service with the auxiliaries.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first city of Thessaly to be attacked was Phaloria. It had a garrison of two thousand Macedonians, which at first resisted with the greatest energy, using every resource for defence which their <pb id="p.195"/>arms and fortifications gave them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But the persistent<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> siege, relaxed by neither night nor day, since the consul thought that the attitude of the other Thessalians depended on whether the first had held out against the Roman attack, broke down the resistance of the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the capture of Phaloria delegations came from Metropolis and Cierium offering the surrender of these cities. Their request was granted; Phaloria was burned and destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then he proceeded against Aeginium; seeing that the place was very strong and almost impregnable, with even a small garrison, he hurled a few weapons against the outpost and turned his course towards the region around Gomphi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And descending into the plains of Thessaly, since the army was now in want of everything, because he had spared the farms of the Epirotes, he sent scouts in advance to ascertain whether the supply-ships had headed for Leucas or the Ambracian gulf, and sent the cohorts in relays to Ambracia to provision;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and the road from Gomphi to Ambracia, while difficult and hard to travel, is short.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And so in a few days, the supplies having been transported from the fleet, the camp was full of an abundance of all things. Thence he marched to Atrax.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is about ten miles from Larisa; its people are sprung from Perrhaebia; the town lies above the river Peneus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At first the Thessalians felt no concern at the coming of the Romans; and as for Philip, while he did not dare himself to move into Thessaly, yet, established in a base camp within Tempe, he sent troops as occasion arose, as each point was threatened by the enemy.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the same time that the consul had first established his camp face to face with <pb id="p.197"/>Philip in the passes of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Epirus, Lucius Quinctius, -<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> the brother of the consul,<note>Livy now describes the naval operations of the same summer. Lucius Quinctius, while junior to Titus in official status, was older.</note> to whom the senate had entrusted the charge of the fleet and the command of the sea-coast, also crossed to Corcyra with
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> two quinqueremes, and when he found that the fleet was gone from there, thinking he should not delay, when he had
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> overtaken the ships at the island of Same, he sent back Livius,<note>At XXX. xlvii. 2 Apustius was in command of the fleet. The condensed treatment given the preceding year of the war may be responsible for Livy's having failed to mention Livius before (see note on vi. 4 above).</note> whom he had succeeded, and finally reached Malea, generally towing the ships which were following loaded with supplies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Ordering the rest to follow from Malea with all possible speed, he himself led the way to Piraeus with three light quinqueremes and took over the ships left there by Lucius Apustius the lieutenant to guard Athens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the same time two fleets sailed from Asia, one under King Attalus &mdash;this consisted of twenty-four quinqueremes &mdash;and one from Rhodes, comprising twenty decked vessels commanded by Agesimbrotus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These fleets met near the island of Andros and crossed from there to Euboea, separated from Andros by a narrow stretch of water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They first ravaged the lands of the Carystii; then, since Carystus seemed strong, a garrison having been hastily sent from Chalcis, they went on towards Eretria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There Lucius Quinctius also came with the ships from Piraeus, when he heard of the arrival of King Attalus, after leaving orders that as each ship of his own fleet arrived it should proceed to Euboea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Eretria had to endure a vigorous attack; for the ships of the three united fleets carried artillery of all kinds and devices for destroying cities, and the country <pb id="p.199"/>provided material in abundance for the construction<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> of new works.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The citizens at first defended their wall stoutly, then, worn out and some of them wounded, when they saw part of the wall demolished by the enemy's engines, they bethought them of surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But there was a Macedonian garrison, which they feared no less than the Romans, and Philocles, the king's prefect, kept sending messages from Chalcis that he would be with them in due time, if they would withstand the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This hope mingled with fear compelled them to hold out beyond their wish or their ability; later on, when they learned that Philocles, now beaten and terrified, had sought refuge in Chalcis, they straightway sent ambassadors to Attalus asking his pardon and protection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> While, with their hopes centred on peace, they were less zealous in performing their military duties, and were posting
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> armed guards only at the point where the wall had been thrown down, paying no attention to the rest, Quinctius during the night, attacking with scaling-ladders in a quarter that seemed free from danger, captured the city. The whole multitude of the citizens with their wives and children fled to the citadel and then surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> There was no great quantity of money, gold or silver; statues, paintings of ancient workmanship, and adornments of that sort were found there in greater abundance than was to be expected, considering the size
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> of the town or its wealth in other respects.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The allies then returned to Carystus, all the population of which, before the troops disembarked, left the city and fled to the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Presently they sent ambassadors to seek protection <pb id="p.201"/>from the Roman commander. Life and liberty were<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> at once granted the citizens; a ransom of three hundred <hi rend="italics">nummi</hi><note>The value of the <hi rend="italics">nummus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">sestertius</hi> was about four cents, or two pence.</note> per head was fixed for the Macedonians, and they were ordered to give up their arms and depart. Having paid this ransom they were transported to Boeotia unarmed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The fleets, having captured two important cities of Euboea within a few days, sailed around Sunium, the promontory of the land of Attica, and steered toward Cenchreae, the port of the Corinthians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Meanwhile<note>The value of the <hi rend="italics">nummus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">sestertius</hi> was about four cents, or two pence.</note> the consul was finding the siege of Atrax longer and more difficult than anyone had expected, and the enemy resisted in a way that he had not in the least anticipated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For he had believed that the whole task would be to batter down the wall; and that if he had opened a way into the city for the soldiers, the flight and slaughter of the enemy would follow, as usually happens in captured towns;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but when a section of the wall was thrown down by the battering-rams and the soldiers had entered the city over the ruins, that was, so to speak, the beginning of new and fresh toil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the Macedonians who formed the garrison, numerous and picked men, thinking that it would be a most noble exploit to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> defend the city with arms and valour rather than with walls, in close array, strengthening their formation by increasing the number of ranks within it, when they saw the Romans scaling the ruins, thrust them out over ground that was rough and admitted no easy retreat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul was enraged, and thought that this disgrace not merely meant a delay in capturing this one city, but affected the final issue of the war as a whole, which generally turns on the influence of little things;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> clearing out the place which was heaped <pb id="p.203"/>up with the debris of the fallen wall, he moved up<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> a tower of great height, carrying a large number of men in its numerous galleries, and sent out cohorts, one after the other, under their standards, to pierce, if possible, with their attack the wedge-formation of the Macedonians &mdash;they themselves call it the phalanx.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But in addition to the limits of space, only a little of the wall having been destroyed, the enemy had the advantage in character of weapons and in tactics.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the Macedonians inclose order held before them spears of great length, and when the Romans, hurling
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> their javelins to no purpose, had drawn their swords against this sort of <hi rend="italics">testudo,</hi><note>For the Roman <hi rend="italics">testudo,</hi> see the note on XXXI. xxxix. 14. Livy seems to mean that the multitude of spears, projecting in front of the phalanx, offered a projection against frontal attack comparable to that afforded by the <hi rend="italics">testudo.</hi> To visualize this battle, we must picture the phalanx diminished in frontage sufficiently to fit it into the breach in the wall (this protected it against flank attack), and correspondingly deepened. Since the ranks, from front to rear, carried spears of increasingly greater length, the points presented an almost impenetrable barrier. In the characteristic Roman attack, the soldiers threw their javelins to break up, at least temporarily, the hostile formation, and then closed in individual hand-to-hand combat. The mass of the phalanx, in this situation, was too dense to be affected by the javelins, and the spears projecting in front prevented the Romans from closing in and reaching the enemy with their swords.</note> closely-fashioned as if with shields, they could neither approach near enough to engage hand to hand nor cut off the ends of
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> the spears, and if they did cut off or break any of them, the spearshaft, the broken part being itself sharp, helped, along with the points of the undamaged pikes, to make a sort of wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Moreover, the parts of the rampart that still stood protected the two flanks, nor was it possible either to retire or to charge from a distance, a manoeuvre which usually throws the ranks into disorder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> An accident, too, served to increase the courage of the enemy; for when the tower was being moved along the terrace of loosely-compacted earth, one of its wheels, slipping into a deep rut, caused the tower to lean so much that it seemed to the enemy about to fall,
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and caused a panic fear among the soldiers standing upon it.</p> <pb id="p.205"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As nothing turned out successfully, the<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> consul was most reluctant to permit a comparison of men and weapons to be made,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and at the same time he realized that there was no immediate prospect of capturing the town nor any way to winter his troops far from the sea and in a region wasted by the calamities of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So he raised the siege, and because there was no harbour on the whole coast of Acarnania and Aetolia which could both accommodate the fleet which brought supplies to the army and at the same time provide shelter
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> for wintering the troops, Anticyra in Phocis, facing the Gulf of Corinth, seemed the most suitable place
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for this purpose, because it was not far from Thessaly and the enemy's country, and it had in front the Peloponnesus, separated by a narrow expanse of sea, and behind it Aetolia and Acarnania and on the sides Locris and Boeotia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He took Phanotea in Phocis at the first assault and without a struggle. Anticyra caused only a little delay to his siege. Ambrysus next and Hyampolis surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Daulis, because it was located on a lofty hill, could not be taken by escalade or siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By harassing the defenders with darts and tempting them to make sallies, by alternately retiring and pursuing, and by fighting small engagements of no significance, they brought them to such a pitch of carelessness and to such a feeling of contempt that the Romans, mingling with the defenders as they withdrew into the gate, assaulted the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Other unimportant strongholds of Phocis surrendered, more from fear than by reason of attack. Elatia closed its gates, and seemed disinclined to admit either commander or Roman army, unless it were compelled by violence.</p> <pb id="p.207"/>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the consul was besieging Elatia, -<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> there came the gleam of hope of a greater achievement, the winning over of the Achaeans from alliance with the king to friendship with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had expelled Cycliadas,<note>See XXXI. xxv. 3 ff., and the Introductory Note.</note> the leader of the faction inclined to favour Philip; Aristaenus, who wished the state to join the Romans, was the president.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman fleet with Attalus and the Rhodians lay at Cenchreae, preparing for a concerted attack on Corinth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore thought it best, before they undertook this task, to send ambassadors to the Achaean people, promising that if they would turn from the king to the Romans, they would reunite Corinth to the ancient council of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By the authority of the consul, delegates were sent to the Achaeans by his brother Lucius Quinctius, Attalus, the Rhodians, and the Athenians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> An audience was granted them at Sicyon. But the state of mind among the Achaeans was complex.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Spartan Nabis, a dangerous and ever-present enemy, terrified them; the Roman arms were a menace; to the Macedonians they were bound by acts of kindness both old and new; the king himself they looked on with suspicion, for his cruelty and treachery, and, not
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> judging by what he was doing at that time, to suit the occasion, they saw that he would be a harsher master after the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They not only did not know what opinion each one would express in the senate of his own state or in the common councils of the people,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but were not very clear as to what they would want or desire as they considered the matter in their own thoughts. The opportunity was offered the ambassadors to speak to an audience in this state of uncertainty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Roman delegate, <pb id="p.209"/>Lucius Calpurnius, was first heard, then the ambassadors<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> of King Attalus, and after them the Rhodians; next the representatives of Philip were given audience, and finally the Athenians were heard, that they might refute the Macedonian arguments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They assailed the king in quite the fiercest terms, for no others had suffered so much or so grievously.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And this meeting was dismissed at sunset, the whole day having been consumed by the set speeches of so many ambassadors.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next day the council assembled; and when, through the herald, after the Greek custom, the magistrates gave the opportunity to offer a motion, if anyone wished, and no one came forward, there was a long silence as men looked at one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor was it strange, if men whose minds were in a way bewildered by pondering independently the conflicting claims, were rendered still more uncertain by the speeches on both sides, delivered through an entire day, bringing forward and urging arguments that were hard to meet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At length Aristaenus, the praetor of the Achaeans, so as not to dismiss the council without debate, spoke thus: <quote>Where are those rivalries of feeling, Achaeans, which cause you hardly to refrain from blows, when mention is made of Philip and the Romans at your dinners and social gatherings?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Now, in a council called for this one purpose, after you have heard the words of representatives of both sides, when the magistrates lay the question before you and the herald asks for motions, you are silent!
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If there is no concern for the general welfare, can no personal interest even, which has turned your minds this way or that, draw a word from anyone?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Especially as there is no one so <pb id="p.211"/>dull as not to know that this is the time to speak and to<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> advise what each either desires or thinks best, before we reach any decision; when once a decree has been passed, all, even those who formerly opposed it, must defend it as good and expedient.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This exhortation of the praetor not only prompted no one to make a proposal, but provoked no groan or whisper from so large a council, drawn from so many peoples.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So the praetor Aristaenus spoke again: "You lack counsel, leaders of the Achaeans, no less than the power of speech; but each one refuses to promote the public interest at the cost of peril to himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Perhaps I too should keep silence if I were a private citizen; now I see that, so far as the praetor is concerned, either the ambassadors should not have been granted an audience or they should not be sent away unanswered; but how can I answer except in accordance with your decree?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And since no one of you who have been summoned to this council wishes or dares to say anything in the way of suggestion, let us consider the ambassadors' speeches delivered yesterday as opinions expressed in debate, just as if they had not intended what was to their own interest but recommended what they deemed profitable for us.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans, the Rhodians and Attalus ask for our alliance and friendship, and in the war which they are waging with Philip they think it proper that we should assist them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Philip reminds us of our alliance with him and of our oath, and now demands that we take our stand with him, now says that he is satisfied if we refrain from taking up arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Does it occur to no one why those who are not yet our allies demand more than our ally? This is not, ye Achaeans, the <pb id="p.213"/>result of Philip's moderation or the Romans' arrogance;<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> fortune both gives and takes away confidence in making demands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We see no sign of Philip except his ambassador; the Roman fleet lies at Cenchreae, displaying the spoils of the cities of Euboea, we see the consul and his legions marching through Phocis and Locris, separated from us by a narrow stretch of water;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> do you wonder why Cleomedon, Philip's delegate, suggested with such hesitation a while ago that we take up arms in the king's cause against the Romans? If, in accordance with that treaty and oath,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> respect for which he tried to instil into us, we ask him that Philip protect us both against Nabis and his Lacedaemonians and against the Romans, he will not only find no garrison wherewith to protect us: he will not even find an answer to give us, any more, by Hercules, than Philip did last year;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> when, by promising that he would conduct the war against Nabis, he had tried to allure our fighting men away to Euboea, after he saw that we would neither vote him that protection nor consent to be involved in the Roman war, forgetful of that alliance about which he now uses such fine words, he left us to Nabis and the Lacedaemonians to plunder and rob.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And to me, at least, Cleomedon's speech seemed by no means consistent with itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He belittled the Roman war, and claimed that the result would be the same as that of the earlier war which they engaged in with Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Why then does Philip, remaining away, ask our aid, rather than, being present in person, defend us, his ancient allies, against both Nabis and the Romans? Defend <hi rend="italics">us,</hi> do I say? Why did he permit Eretria and Carystus to be captured in that way? Why so many <pb id="p.215"/>towns of Thessaly? Why Locris and Phocis? Why<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> does he now allow Elatia to be besieged? Why did he leave the passes of Epirus and his impregnable position above the Aous river, abandon the defile which he held and retire far into his own kingdom?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> It was either under compulsion, or from fear, or by design. If he voluntarily left so many allies to be sacked by the enemy, how can he object if his allies take measures for their own security? If he was afraid, let him excuse also our fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> If he retired because he was beaten in battle, shall we Achaeans, Cleomedon, sustain the Roman attack which you Macedonians did not resist? Or should we take your word for it that the Romans are not employing in the war greater forces and military power than they did before, or should we rather look at the obvious facts?
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Then they aided the Aetolians with their fleet; they waged war with neither consular commander nor consular army;<note>In <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date> (XXVI. xxiv. 10) the Romans sent a fleet to the east, but their land forces there were inconsiderable until <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xii. 2). A consular army had as its nucleus, normally, two Roman legions; the forces assigned to inferior commanders were largely or wholly made up of Latin allies.</note> at that time the maritime cities of Philip's allies were in fear and terror;
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> the inland districts were so safe from Roman arms that Philip pillaged the Aetolians even while they asked in vain for Roman aid; but now the Romans have finished the Punic War, which they endured for sixteen years in, as it were, the very heart of Italy, and they have not
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> sent assistance to the Aetolians, who were carrying on the war, but they themselves, as leaders in the war, have attacked Macedonia by land and sea at once. Now the third consul is here, prosecuting the war with boundless energy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Sulpicius, meeting the king in Macedonia itself, defeated him and put him to flight, and plundered the richest part of his kingdom; now Quinctius has dislodged him from his camp, <pb id="p.217"/>though he held the passes of Epirus, relying on the<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> nature of the country, on his fortifications and on his army, pursued him as he
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> fled to Thessaly, and captured the royal garrisons and allied towns almost under the king's very eyes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>"Grant that what the Athenians said about the king's cruelty, greed and passion was not true; grant that we are not interested in the crimes against supernal and infernal gods which he committed in the land of Attica, and much less interested in the sufferings of the Ciani and Abydeni, who are far away from us; let us forget, if you will, our own wounds;

					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> When Nabis and the Spartans press on us by land and the Roman fleet by sea, on what ground should I invoke the king's alliance and Macedonian guards? Or shall we with our ownarms defend against the Romans the towns they will besiege?
					<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> Nobly did we defend Dymae in the former war! The misfortunes of others furnish us examples in abundance; let us not seek how we may be an, example to others.</p> 
				<p><quote>Do not, because the Romans come of their own accord to seek our friendship, disdain what you ought to have hoped for and particularly desired.

					<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> For as to what Cleomedon pointed out to you a while ago, a middle course, as it were, and the safest way to decide, to wit, that you remain neutral and avoid war, that is not a middle course: it is no course at all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> For, in addition to the fact that you must either accept or reject the Roman alliance, what other course is open except for us, since we have no sure claim to <pb id="p.221"/>consideration anywhere, to play the part of men who<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> have been merely awaiting the event, with the intention of adapting our counsels to the decision of fortune, and eventually become the prey of the conqueror?

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the praetor's speech there arose an outcry, some applauding, some sharply rebuking those who approved; and soon not individuals only but whole communities were involved in the quarrel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then among the magistrates of the people &mdash;they call them <hi rend="italics">damiurgi,</hi><note>Livy appropriately uses the Doric spelling of the word. The number was probably inherited from the time when the League consisted of ten cities.</note> and the number appointed is ten &mdash;an argument began no less violent than that among the mass of the delegates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Five announced that they would put a motion favouring a Roman alliance and call for a vote; five held that it was illegal either for the magistrates to submit or the council to decree anything subversive of the alliance with Philip. This day too was spent in argument.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>One day of the legal council remained; for the law ordered the decision to be reached on the third day; on the matter to be decided that day feeling ran so high that parents could scarcely keep their hands off their children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was present Pisias of Pellene; he had a son, a <hi rend="italics">damiurgus,</hi> Memnon by <pb id="p.223"/>name, of the faction which forbade a motion to be<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> made or a vote taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Pisias for a long time entreated his son to allow the Achaeans to consult the general welfare and not to destroy the entire race by his obstinacy, but when prayers
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> proved unavailing he swore that he would kill him with his own hand, treating him not as a son but as an enemy, and with these threats he won his point, so that next day he joined the party which proposed a vote.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When now the majority favoured that course, and almost all the cities were clearly expressing their approval of the motion and openly declaring what the decision would be, the delegates from Dymae and Megalopolis
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and some of the Argives, before the motion was passed, arose and left the council, no one expressing either surprise or reproach.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For within the memory of their forefathers, the Megalopolitani, defeated by the Spartans, had been restored to their homes by Antigonus,<note>Actually, this had happened in <date value="-226">226 B.C.</date> (Polyb. V. xciii), so that Livy's phrase <hi rend="italics">avorum memoria</hi> is an exaggeration.</note> and to the Dymaei, who had recently been captured and plundered by the Romans, Philip had restored both liberty and their homes, having ordered them to be ransomed wherever they were enslaved;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> many of the Argives, too, besides believing that the kings of Macedon were derived from them, were bound to Philip by personal ties as well and by private friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For such reasons they withdrew from a council which had leaned towards ordering an alliance with Rome, and indulgence was granted them for withdrawing, bound as they were by great and recent acts of kindness.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The other peoples of the Achaeans, when called on to vote, approved by immediate decree the alliance with Attalus and the Rhodians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the treaty with the Romans, since it could not be ratified except <pb id="p.225"/>by vote of the people,<note>Foreign alliances required the approval of the assembly at Rome.</note> was postponed to the time<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> when ambassadors could be sent to Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for the present, it was voted that three commissioners should be sent to Lucius Quinctius and that all the army of the Achaeans should be moved to Corinth, since Quinctius was now besieging the city itself after his capture of Cenchreae.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They now encamped in the vicinity of the gate which leads to Sicyon; the Romans were operating on the side towards Cenchreae, Attalus, having led his army across the Isthmus, from the direction of Lechaeum, the port on the other sea,<note>The port of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf.</note> conducting the siege at first without much energy, since they hoped for dissension within between the citizens and the royal garrison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they proved completely harmonious, the Macedonians conducting the defence as if it were of their common fatherland, the Corinthians permitting Androsthenes, the commander of the garrison, to exercise his authority over them as if he were a citizen and their elected general, thenceforth all the hope of the besiegers rested in their own strength, their weapons, and their siegeworks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From all sides, though the task was difficult, they moved their mounds towards the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the side where the Romans were attacking the battering-ram had destroyed part of the wall; when the Macedonians rushed to defend this place with their arms, because it was without protection, a desperate battle took place between them and the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And at first the Romans were easily repulsed by superior numbers; then, summoning reinforcements of the Achaeans and the troops of Attalus, they restored equality, and there seemed no doubt that the Macedonians and Greeks would be easily <pb id="p.227"/>dislodged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was a great host of Italian deserters, -<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> some from Hannibal's army who had followed Philip from fear of punishment by the Romans, some naval allies who had recently deserted the fleet and come over in the hope of more highly-rewarded service;<note>The <hi rend="italics">navales socii</hi> were freedmen or members of allied Italian cities, employed as rowers on war-ships.</note> their hopelessness regarding immunity, if the Romans conquered, inspired them to courage or rather to frenzy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the side toward Sicyon is a promontory, sacred to the Juno whom they call Acraea,<note>That is, Juno of the Heights.</note> and rising high into the air; thence the distance to Corinth is about seven miles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Thither Philocles, also a prefect of the king, brought fifteen hundred soldiers through Boeotia. Vessels from Corinth were at hand to transport the force thus arriving to Lechaeum. Attalus urged that the works be burned and the siege immediately abandoned; Quinctius persisted more stubbornly in his undertaking.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He too, when he saw the royal guards stationed before all the gates, and perceived that their sallies could not be easily resisted, went over to the opinion of Attalus. And so, with their design unaccomplished, after sending the Achaeans home they returned to their ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Attalus proceeded to Piraeus, the Romans to Corcyra.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this was being done by the navy,<note>The narrative interrupted at xix. 1 is continued.</note> the consul in Phocis, having pitched his camp in front of Elatia, tried first to attain his end by conferences, using the principal citizens of Elatia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> after he had received the reply that the decision was not for them to make and that the king's garrison was stronger and more numerous than the citizens, he then attacked the city from all sides with arms and engines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he brought up a battering-ram and a section of wall between two towers fell with a mighty crash and din and left the city <pb id="p.229"/>open to attack, at the same time a Roman cohort<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> broke through the gap left by the recent collapse, and also
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the guards from all parts of the city, each leaving his own post, hurried to the spot which was endangered by the enemy's attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the same moment the Romans were both climbing over the ruins of the wall and moving their ladders against the standing ramparts. And while the conflict drew the eyes and thoughts of the enemy in one direction, the wall in several places was taken by escalade and the soldiers climbed over into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hearing their shouts, the terrified enemy left the place they had been defending in force and made for the citadel, the unarmed crowd too following. So the consul took the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Having sacked it, he sent messengers to the citadel to promise life to the garrison, if they wished to give up their arms and depart, and liberty to the Elatenses, and an agreement having been made to this effect, a few days later he occupied the citadel.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the arrival of Philocles, the king's prefect, in Achaea not only raised the siege of Corinth, but brought about the betrayal of the city of Argos to Philocles through the agency of certain chief men, after the sentiments of the commons had first been tested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was the custom on assembly-days that at the beginning the presiding officers should pronounce, as an auspicious act, the names of Zeus, Apollo, and Heracles; and the custom was extended by a decree that King Philip's name should be joined to these.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But because, after the alliance was made with the Romans, the herald did not add his name to the others, a shout first
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> rose from the crowd, then an uproar, as his partisans supplied the name <pb id="p.231"/>of Philip and ordered that the legal honour be paid<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> him, until with roars of applause his name was read.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> With the confidence inspired by this show of loyalty, Philocles was summoned and occupied by night a hill overhanging the city &mdash;they call this citadel Larisa &mdash;and leaving a guard there he marched in embattled array at daybreak towards the marketplace which lies at the foot of the citadel, where the battle-line from the other side was drawn up to meet him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was a force of Achaeans, recently placed there, about five hundred youths chosen from all the cities; Aenesidemus of Dymae was in command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A herald was sent to them by the king's prefect, to order them to leave the city: he reminded them that they were no match for the citizens, who sided with the Macedonians, even by themselves, and still less after their junction with the Macedonians, whose attack at Corinth not even the Romans had withstood; but at first he influenced neither commander nor soldiers;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> a little later, when they saw the Argives too in arms, coming from the opposite direction in a strong column, and realized that their destruction was certain, they still seemed ready to suffer any fate, if their leader had been more stubborn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Aenesidemus, rather than lose the flower of the Achaean fighting men along with the city, having made a pact with Philocles that the men should be allowed to depart, himself with a few clients refused to leave the spot where he had taken his armed stand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Philocles sent to ask him what he meant. Without moving at all, with his buckler held out in front of him, he replied that he proposed to die under arms, in defence of the city entrusted to him. Then by order of the prefect javelins were thrown by the Thracians and all were <pb id="p.233"/>killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And after the alliance between the Achaeans<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> and the Romans had been agreed upon, these two most celebrated cities, Argos and Corinth, were in the hands of the king.

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Two slaves came to him before dawn and related in detail what had happened and what was likely to occur.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ordering them to be kept under guard at his home, the praetor summoned the senate and laid before them what the informants had told him, and on receiving orders to investigate and suppress this conspiracy, set out with five
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> lieutenants, administered the oath to those he met in the fields, and compelled them to take arms and follow him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With this hastily-raised force of about two thousand armed men, he reached Setia before anyone knew where he was going.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There, when the ringleaders in the plot had been summarily arrested, there was an exodus of slaves from the town. Cornelius sent troops through the country to pursue the fugitives, and himself returned to Rome.<note>Some such addition as this seems necessary to complete the sentence. It may be assumed that an account of the search and the punishment of the criminals is still missing.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Conspicuous service had been rendered by the two slaves who had given information, and by the one free man. To him the senate ordered given a reward of one hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">asses;</hi> to the slaves, twenty-five thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> each, and their freedom; compensation for them from the treasury was paid to their owners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Shortly after this, word was received that the slaves, some of the remnants of the same conspiracy, were about to occupy Praeneste.<note>This town (now Palestrina), about twenty-five miles east of Rome, was strongly situated and therefore frequently a military objective. Catiline planned to seize it in <date value="-63">63 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Lucius Cornelius the praetor went there and executed about five hundred who were implicated in the crime. The state feared that the Carthaginian hostages and prisoners had contrived the plot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> So at Rome watchmen patrolled the streets, the minor magistrates were ordered to make <pb id="p.237"/>inspections, and the three officials in charge of the<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> quarry-prison<note>Stone quarries, probably on the north-east slope of the Capitoline, were used as places of temporary confinement, since imprisonment within Rome was rarely imposed as a punishment by the courts, and perhaps also for prisoners of war. The Mamertine Prison, still to be seen in the same vicinity, may have been a part of the system, at least originally. The <hi rend="italics">triumviri capitales</hi> had charge of the prison and of executions.</note> to increase their vigilance, and the praetor sent letters around to the Latin
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> confederacy, that the hostages kept should be in private custody, with no opportunity to come out into public places, the prisoners loaded with chains of not less than ten pounds' weight, and guarded only in a public prison.<note>That is, in a place like the <hi rend="italics">lautumiae</hi> in Rome.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same year ambassadors from King Attalus deposited on the Capitoline a golden crown of a weight of two hundred forty-six pounds, and expressed to the senate his gratitude because Antiochus, influenced by the authority of the Roman ambassadors, had withdrawn his army from the frontiers of Attalus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>During the same summer two hundred cavalry, ten elephants, and two hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">modii</hi> of grain arrived, sent by King Masinissa to the army which was serving in Greece. Also from Sicily and Sardinia great stores of provisions and clothing for the army were sent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcus Marcellus was governing Sicily, Marcus Porcius Cato, Sardinia, a man of integrity and uprightness, but considered overharsh in his restraint of usury;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the usurers were expelled from the island, and the expenses which the allies were accustomed to incur for the comfort of the praetors were cut down or abolished.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When Sextus Aelius the consul had returned from Gaul to hold the elections, he announced that Gaius Cornelius Cethegus and Quintus Minucius Rufus <pb id="p.239"/>had been chosen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two days later the praetorian<note type="margin">B.C. 198</note> election was held. This year, for the first time, six praetors were chosen, in consequence of the increase that had taken place in the number of the provinces<note>In viii. 5 above Livy gives the assignments of the praetors for the current year. The new arrangement provides praetorian governors for the two Spanish provinces, which had since the expulsion of the Carthaginians been governed by pro-magistrates. The omission of Gaul, tacitly included with Italy, enabled the senate to designate a <hi rend="italics">praetor peregrinus,</hi> who presided over the court trying cases in which Romans and non-Romans were involved.</note> and the enlargement of the empire;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the following were elected: Lucius Manlius Volso, Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus, Marcus Sergius Silus, Marcus Helvius, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and Lucius Atilius (of these, Sempronius and Helvius were plebeian aediles). The curule aediles were Quintus Minucius Thermus and Tiberius Sempronius Longus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Roman Games were four times repeated that year.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Gaius Cornelius and Quintus -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Minucius assumed the consulship, the first question to be settled concerned the consular and praetorian provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The case of the praetors was first disposed of, since that could be done by lot. The city jurisdiction fell to Sergius, that between citizens and aliens to Minucius; Atilius obtained Sardinia, Manlius Sicily, Sempronius Nearer Spain and Helvius Farther Spain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As the consuls were making ready to draw lots for Italy and Macedonia, the tribunes of the people, Lucius Oppius and Quintus Fulvius, intervened, because, as they said, Macedonia was a distant province, and there had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> no greater difficulty up to that time in the conduct of the war than the fact that just when he was undertaking to carry on the war, with the campaign scarce begun, the former consul was recalled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was already the fourth year since the declaration of war with Macedonia. Sulpicius had spent the greater part of his <pb id="p.241"/>year in searching for the king and his army. Villius, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> while making contact with the enemy, had been recalled before accomplishing anything.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius, though detained for the greater part of the year<note>See ix. 1 above and, for a somewhat different interpretation, vi. 4.</note> in Rome by religious observances, had still so managed things that if either he had arrived earlier or winter had been later, he could have finished the war;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> now, it was said, having retired into winter quarters, he was making such preparations that if no successor interfered he seemed in a fair way to end the war that coming summer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By such arguments they prevailed upon the consuls to say that they would put themselves in the senate's hands if the tribunes of the people would do the same. When both parties agreed to leave full discretion to the senate, the Fathers voted that both consuls should have Italy as province, and prolonged the term of Titus Quinctius until a successor, authorized by decree of the senate, should have arrived.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To the consuls two legions each were assigned, and the task of prosecuting the war with the Cisalpine Gauls who had revolted against the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Reinforcements were voted for Quinctius for service in Macedonia, six thousand infantry, three hundred cavalry, and three thousand naval allies. Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was placed in command of the same fleet of which he already had charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Each of the praetors sent to Spain received eight thousand infantry of the allies and the Latin confederacy, and four hundred cavalry, with orders to send the veterans home from Spain; they were directed, moreover, to fix the boundaries which should be observed between the nearer and the farther provinces.<note>Although two proconsuls had usually exercised command in the Spanish peninsula, this is apparently the first time that definite boundary-lines were established. Henceforth two distinct Spanish provinces are consciously recognized by the Romans.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Additional <pb id="p.243"/>lieutenants for Macedonia were named, Publius<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who had been consuls in that province.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the consuls and praetors set out for their provinces, it was decreed that expiation for the prodigies should be made, because at Rome the temples of Vulcan and Summanus and the wall and gate at Fregellae had been struck
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> by lightning, and at Frusino a light had shone during the night, and at Aefula a two-headed lamb with five feet had been born, and at Formiae two wolves had entered the town and injured certain persons they encountered, while at Rome a wolf had not only come into the city but had even climbed to the Capitoline.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Gaius Atinius, tribune of the people, carried a proposal that five colonies should be established on the sea-coast, two at the mouths of the Vulturnus and Liternus rivers, one at Puteoli, one at Castrum Salerni; to these Buxentum was added, and it was ordered that three hundred families be sent to each colony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A commission of three, to hold office for three years, was created to found these colonies, and Marcus Servilius Geminus, Quintus Minucius Thermus, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus were chosen as its members.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the levy had been held and other matters, human and divine, which had to be done by them in person, had been disposed of, the two consuls set out for Gaul, Cornelius by the straight road<note>The Via Flaminia.</note> towards the Insubres, who were in arms, allied with the Cenomani;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quintus Minucius marched up the left<note>The left or west coast, looking north from Rome.</note> side of Italy towards the lower sea,<note>The Tuscan Sea, to the west of Italy; contrasted with the <hi rend="italics">mare superum</hi> or Adriatic.</note> and having conducted his army to Genoa, began the war with the Ligures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The towns <pb id="p.245"/>of Clastidium and Litubium, both belonging to the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Ligures, and two cantons of the same people, the Celeiates and the Cerdiciates, surrendered. And now all the states on this side of the Po except the Gallic Boi and the Ligurian Ilvates were under his control; there were altogether fifteen towns and twenty thousand men, according to report, that had surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thence he led his legions into the territory of the Boi.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The army of the Boi had not long before this crossed the Po and had effected a
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> junction with the Insubres and the Cenomani, because they had heard that the consuls were to carry on the war with their legions united, that they too might consolidate their strength by combining their armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when the news got around that one consul was burning the farms of the Boi, dissension at once arose;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the Boi demanded that all should go to the relief of their harassed countrymen; the Insubres asserted that they would not desert their own possessions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the army was divided, the Boi going home to defend their land, the Insubres with the Cenomani encamping along the river Mincius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Two miles farther down stream, the consul Cornelius was also encamped along the same river. Thence, sending messengers to the villages of the Cenomani and to Brescia, which was the capital of the tribe, when he was assured that the young men were in arms without the approval of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> elders, and that the Cenomani had joined the revolt of the Insubres without a decision of the state to that effect, he summoned the chiefs to his presence and began to contrive and plan
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that the Cenomani should desert the Insubres and, taking up their standards, either go home or join <pb id="p.247"/>the Romans. And this, indeed, he could not accomplish;<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> but a pledge was given the consul to this effect, that in the battle they would either remain quiet or, if occasion offered, even aid the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Insubres knew nothing of these negotiations; yet they somehow suspected that the fidelity of their allies was weakening. So when they formed the battle-line they did not dare to entrust either flank to them, lest, if they treacherously gave way, they might cause a complete defeat, but placed them behind the standards in support.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul at the beginning of the battle vowed a temple to Juno Sospita<note>In XXXIV. liii. 3 Livy records the dedication of a temple to Juno Matuta, vowed by Cornelius in the Gallic war four years before.</note> if the enemy should be routed and put to flight that day;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the soldiers shouted out that they would bring about the fulfilment of the consul's vow and the attack on the enemy began. The Insubres broke at the first assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some say that when the Cenomani also, in the midst of the fighting, assailed them in the rear, there was a double turmoil, that between the two lines thirty-five thousand of the enemy were slain and five thousand two hundred
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> taken alive, among them Hamilcar,<note>Hamilcar was killed in the battle between Furius and the Gauls (
						<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxi. 18); he was also led in the triumph of Cornelius (XXXIII. xxiii. 5). Livy makes no effort to decide which of these conflicting accounts is correct, though he is aware of the contradictions as well as the resemblances (note the phrase <hi rend="italics">auctores sunt</hi> in sect. 11). Some scholars believe that Livy and his sources have made two battles out of one.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Carthaginian general, who had been the prime mover of the war; and that one hundred and thirty military standards and more than two hundred wagons were captured. Many Gallic towns which had joined the Insubres in revolt gave themselves up to the Romans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>XXXI. The consul Minucius had at first wandered far and wide through the country of the Boi, raiding in every direction, but later, when they had left the <pb id="p.249"/>Insubres and returned to defend their possessions, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> he remained in camp, thinking that he would fight a regular battle with the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Boi would not have declined the contest if the news that the Insubres had been defeated had not diminished their ardour. So, leaving their leader and their camp, they scattered through the towns, each to defend his own property, and changed the enemy's plan of operations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For, giving up hope of deciding the war by a single engagement, he began once more to ravage the fields and burn the buildings and storm the towns. During this time Clastidium was burned. Thence he led his legions against the Ligurian Ilvates, who alone were not submissive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This tribe too surrendered when they heard that as the Insubres had been defeated in battle, so the Boi were too terrified to dare to try fortune in the open field. The dispatches of the two consuls, describing their successes in Gaul, reached Rome about the same time. Marcus Sergius the city praetor read them in the senate and, with the senate's authorization, then to the people. A thanksgiving of four days was decreed.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By that time it was winter,<note>Livy returns to Polybius (XVIII. i-viii), his authority for the eastern campaign, and the abrupt change of source may explain the harshness of the transitional clause.</note> and while Titus Quinctius, after the capture of Elatia,<note>See xxiv. 7 above.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One faction called in the Aetolians, who were nearer, the other the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Aetolians were first to arrive; but the richer faction<note>The Romans consistently supported the wealthier and more conservative parties in the Greek towns.</note> excluded the Aetolians and, sending a messenger to the Roman commander, held <pb id="p.251"/>the city until he came.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A royal garrison held the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> citadel and could not be induced either by the threats of the people of Opus or by the influence of the Roman commander to withdraw from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A delay, preventing an immediate attack, occurred because a herald had come from the king requesting a time and place for a conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was reluctantly granted to the king, not because Quinctius was not eager to seem to have ended the war himself, partly by arms, partly by diplomacy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for he did not yet know whether a successor to him would be appointed, that is, one of the new consuls, or his own term would be extended, a thing which he had instructed his friends and relatives to strive for with all their might;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but on the whole he considered that a conference would be expedient, that he might be free to lean either towards war, if he remained, or towards peace, if he were relieved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They chose a place on the shore of the Malian Gulf near Nicaea. Thither the king came from Demetrias with five light ships and one war-vessel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There were with him nobles of Macedonia and the Achaean exile Cycliadas, a man of distinction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> King Amynander was with the Roman general, as well as Dionysodorus, representing Attalus, and Agesimbrotus, the commander of the Rhodian fleet, and Phaeneas, chief of the Aetolians, and two Achaeans, Aristaenus and Xenophon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman, attended by them, went out to the edge of the strand, and when the king had taken his place in the prow of his ship as it lay at anchor Quinctius spoke: <quote>It will be more convenient if you come ashore, that we may be nearer and speak and listen in turn.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When the king refused to do this, Quinctius asked, <quote>Whom, pray, do you fear?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <pb id="p.253"/>With proud and kingly mien he replied, <quote>None do<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> I fear, save only the immortal gods; but I do not trust the word of all I see around you, and least of all that of the Aetolians.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <quote>As to that,</quote> replied the Roman, <quote>we all share the danger equally who come to conference with an enemy, if there is no trust.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <quote>Nevertheless, Titus Quinctius,</quote> said the king, <quote>Philip and Phaeneas are not equal rewards for perfidy, if there should be a breach of faith; for it would not be equally difficult for the Aetolians to find another praetor and the Macedonians another king to take my place.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Silence followed, the Roman believing that the conference should be opened by him who had asked it, the king that he who was proposing terms of peace, and not he who was receiving them, should speak first;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> then the Roman began: He said that his speech was simple; for he would say only what was essential if there were to be terms of peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king must withdraw his garrisons from all the cities of Greece, must give up the captives and fugitives to the allies of the Roman people, must restore to the Romans the parts of Illyricum<note>After the peace of <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xii. 1), Philip had occupied certain districts on the Illyrian coast which Rome had taken over after the defeat of the Illyrians in <date value="-229">229 B.C.</date> (Per.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These were his conditions and those of the Roman people; but the king must hear besides the demands of the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The ambassador of King Attalus demanded that the ships and prisoners which had been taken in the naval battle off Chios be given back, and that the Nicephorium<note>A sacred grove outside Pergamum: Strabo, XII. iv.; Diodorus, XXVIII. 5.</note> and the temple of Venus which he had despoiled and destroyed should be restored to <pb id="p.255"/>their former state;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the Rhodians asked for Peraea<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> &mdash;a district on the mainland opposite their island, and under their ancient rule<note>Taken at the time of the operations mentioned in XXXI. xiv. 4.</note> &mdash;and demanded that the garrisons be withdrawn from Iasus and Bargyliae and the city of the Euromenses, and on the Hellespont
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> from Sestus and Abydus, and that Perinthus should be given back to the Byzantines and permitted to enjoy its ancient rights, and that all the markets and ports of Asia should be made free.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Achaeans demanded Corinth and Argos. Phaeneas, praetor of the Aetolians, having made practically the same demands as the Romans, that Greece should be evacuated, and also that the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> cities which had formerly been under the control and sway of the Aetolians should be returned to them, was interrupted in his speech by Alexander, an Aetolian noble, and considered eloquent, as Aetolians go.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He said that he had kept silent for a long time, not because he thought that anything was being accomplished at the conference, but to avoid breaking in on the speech of any of the allies. Philip, he said, had never kept peace with good faith or waged war with true courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In conference he plotted and tried to entrap his opponents; in battle he would not engage in the open field or fight hand to hand, but instead would retreat, burn and rob cities and, though conquered, destroy the prizes of the conquerors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Macedonian kings of old did not conduct matters thus,<note>I have completed the apparent sense of the first clause.</note> but were used to fight in battle array and to spare the cities, so far as they could, that they might have a richer empire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For what sort of wisdom was it to destroy the things for the possession of which you fight, and leave yourself nothing but the fighting?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Philip had, during the preceding <pb id="p.257"/>campaign, wasted more friendly cities in Thessaly than all<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> the enemies Thessaly had ever had.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> To the Aetolians themselves, too, he had as an ally done more damage than he had as an enemy: he had taken possession of Lysimachia after driving out the magistrate and the Aetolian garrison; he had utterly ruined and destroyed Cios, another city under their control;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> with the same deceit he held Phthian Thebes, Echinus, Larisa, and Pharsalus.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, angered at Alexander's speech, moved his ship nearer the shore, that he might be heard more clearly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he had begun to reply, especially to the Aetolians, Phaeneas rudely interrupted him, saying that the decision did not turn on words: Philip must either conquer in battle or obey his betters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <quote>That is clear,</quote> retorted Philip, <quote>even to a blind man,</quote> making jest of Phaeneas' affliction of the eyes; he was, it must be admitted, more facetious by nature than becomes a king, and not even in serious business did he refrain from jesting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then he began to complain that the Aetolians, like the Romans, ordered him to retire from Greece, although they could not say within what boundaries Greece lay; for in Aetolia itself, the Agraei, the Apodoti, the Amphilochi, who comprise a great part of the country, were not in Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>Or,</quote> he asked, <quote>do they have just ground for complaint that I have not kept my hands off their allies, when they themselves have long observed this custom as an established practice, of allowing their own young men to fight against their allies, official sanction being merely withheld, and opposing battle-lines will very often both contain Aetolian auxiliaries?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I did not capture Cios, but I aided my ally and friend Prusias<note>King of Bithynia (XXIX. xii. 14).</note> who was <pb id="p.259"/>besieging it; also, I rescued Lysimachia from the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Thracians, but, because necessity diverted me from guarding it to this war, the Thracians hold it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So much for the Aetolians; but to Attalus and the Rhodians I owe nothing justly; for the beginning of the war was their act, not mine; however, to do honour to the Romans, I shall restore Peraea## to the Rhodians and to Attalus the ships and such prisoners as can be found.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now as to the restoration of the Nicephorium and the temple of Venus, what reply can I make to
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> those who demand that they be restored, except that (and
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> in this way alone can woods and groves cut down be restored) I shall take upon myself the responsibility and cost of planting &mdash;since this is the sort of thing that kings are pleased to ask and reply to one another.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The rest of his speech was directed to the Achaeans, in which he recounted first the services of Antigonus to the people and then his own, bade that their decrees be read, which included all honours, divine and human, and taunted them with their most recent decree, in which they repudiated the alliance with him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and after violently assailing their perfidy, he said that he would nevertheless give back Argos to them; regarding Corinth, he would confer with the Roman commander and ascertain from him
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> at the same time whether he thought it proper that he evacuate those cities which he himself had captured and which he held by right of conquest, or those also which he had inherited from his sires.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the Achaeans and Aetolians were preparing to answer him, since the sun was now near its setting, the council was adjourned until next day, and Philip returned to the base from which he had <pb id="p.261"/>come, the Romans and the allies to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> next day Quinctius arrived at Nicaea &mdash;for this was the place agreed upon &mdash;at the appointed time; Philip was nowhere in sight and no messenger from him arrived for several hours, and just as they were ready to abandon hope of his coming, suddenly his ships appeared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And Philip said that, since such heavy and unjust demands had been made, being uncertain what to do, he had spent the day in deliberation;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> it was the general opinion that he had purposely deferred his arrival until late, so as to give the Achaeans and Aetolians no time to reply to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> him, and he himself confirmed this belief by asking that the others retire, that time might not be wasted in argument and that some end might be set to the affair, and that he be permitted to confer with the Roman commander by himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first the request was denied, lest the allies seem to be excluded from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> conference, but finally, as he persisted in his plea, with the consent of all, the Roman general with Appius Claudius, tribune of the soldiers, left the rest behind and came out to the water's edge; the king with the two companions whom he had had with him the day before came ashore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After they had talked for some time apart, what account Philip gave his own friends is uncertain;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the report of Quinctius to the allies was that Philip ceded to the Romans the whole Illyrian coast, sent back the deserters and whatever prisoners there were;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> to Attalus he returned the ships and the naval allies captured with them, and to the Rhodians the region which they call Peraea, but he would not give up Iasus or Bargyliae; to the Aetolians he surrendered Pharsalus and Larisa but not Thebes;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> to the Achaeans he would yield not only Argos but <pb id="p.263"/>Corinth as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The decision as to the places from<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> which he would or would not retire pleased no party: for more, they maintained, was lost thereby than gained, nor would causes for strife ever be wanting until he withdrew his garrisons from all Greece.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When shouts to this effect were uttered by the whole council, all speaking at once, their words reached Philip even standing at a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly he asked Quinctius to postpone the whole question until the next day: he would assuredly persuade them or suffer himself to be persuaded. The beach near Thronium was selected for the meeting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thither all came at an early hour. There Philip first asked both Quinctius and all the others who were present not to entertain views which would disturb the hope of peace, and finally begged for time in which he could send an embassy to the senate at Rome:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he would either obtain peace on these terms or submit to whatever conditions of peace the senate imposed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The others did not all like this suggestion: for nothing else, they said, was sought than postponement and delay to collect fresh troops;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius argued that this would have been true had it been summer and the time for active operations; now, with winter at hand, nothing was lost by granting an interval to send ambassadors:
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for none of the agreements they had made with the king could be ratified except on the authority of the senate, and while winter gave the necessary respite from war the views of the senate could be sought.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other leaders of the allies also agreed with this opinion; and having granted a truce of two months, they too decided to send one ambassador each to advise the senate, lest it be deceived by the <pb id="p.265"/>king's misrepresentations. A stipulation was added<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> to the agreement regarding the truce, that the king's garrisons should be immediately withdrawn from Phocis and Locris.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And Quinctius himself sent with the ambassadors of the allies Amynander, king of the Athamanians, to add distinction to the embassy, and Quintus Fabius &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> was the son of the sister of the wife of Quinctius &mdash;and Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they reached Rome, the ambassadors of the allies were heard before those of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Much of their speech was devoted to reviling the king; they influenced the senate especially by their description of the geography of the sea and lands in that
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> region, so that it was clear to all that if the king held Demetrias in Thessaly, Chaleis in Euboea, and Corinth in Achaea, Greece could not be free, and that Philip
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> himself, with equal insolence and truth, called them the fetters of Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the ambassadors of the king were admitted; and when they had begun a lengthy argument, a terse question, whether he would evacuate these three cities, cut short their speech, since they said they had no explicit instructions from him regarding them. So the king's ambassadors were dismissed without obtaining peace; Quinctius was given full discretion regarding peace and war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When it was made clear to him that the senate was not ready to discontinue the war, he, being himself more eager for victory than for peace, thereafter neither granted Philip any conference nor consented to receive any embassy that did not announce a withdrawal from all Greece.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Philip saw that the decision must be reached on the battlefield and that he must <pb id="p.267"/>collect around himself forces from every quarter, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> being
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> especially concerned about the cities of Achaea, a region far away from him, and yet more concerned about Argos than Corinth, it seemed the best plan to commit Argos on deposit, as it were, to Nabis, the tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, with the provision that he would restore it to him if victorious, but that Nabis himself should keep it if misfortune should come, and he wrote to Philocles, who was in charge of Corinth and Argos, that he should have an interview with the tyrant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Philocles, apart from the fact that he was already coming bringing gifts, added as a pledge of future friendship between the king and the tyrant, that the king wished to unite his daughters in marriage with the sons of Nabis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tyrant at first refused to accept the city on any other terms than an invitation to assist the city, proffered by a decree of the Argives themselves;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> later, when he heard them mentioning the name of tyrant in a crowded assembly not only with scorn but even with cursing, he, thinking that he had found a cause for despoiling them, bade Philocles deliver the city to him when he pleased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The tyrant was admitted to the city at night, without the knowledge of anyone; when day came all the commanding sites were in his hands and the gates were closed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A few of the leading men got away in the first confusion and their property was plundered in their absence; the gold and silver of those who remained was appropriated and heavy fines imposed upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those who paid promptly were let go without insult or bodily injury; those who were suspected of concealing or holding back assets were punished and tortured like slaves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then he called an assembly and proposed measures, <pb id="p.269"/>one for the cancellation of debts,<note><hi rend="italics">Tabulae novae,</hi> or new contracts between debtors and creditors, which in extreme cases might absolve debtors entirely, provided Roman demagogues and even politicians with popular sympathies with an effective vote-getting argument: the case of Catiline is in point. Distribution of public land to individuals was another plank in the popular platform in republican Rome, and Livy's personal opposition to such measures, which were regarded as subversive by conservatives. is clearly apparent in this passage.</note> the other for a<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> distribution of land to individuals, thus lighting two torches with which revolutionists could inflame the commons against the nobility.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having the city of Argos in his power, the tyrant, no longer remembering from whom and on what terms he had received the city, sent agents to Quinctius at Elatia and to Attalus, who was wintering at Aegina, to tell them that Argos was in his power:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> if Quinctius would come there to a conference, he had no doubt that they would come to a complete agreement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius, with a view to stripping Philip of that source of strength also, having agreed to come, sent word to Attalus to leave Aegina and meet him at Sicyon, and himself crossed
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> from Anticyra<note>In Phocis, on the north shore of the Corinthian Gulf.</note> to Sicyon with ten quinqueremes which his brother Lucius Quinctius had by chance recently brought there from their winter station at Corcyra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Attalus was already there; saying that the tyrant should come to the Roman general, and not the Roman to the tyrant, he prevailed upon Quinctius not to go to the city of Argos itself. Not far from the city is the place called Mycenica; there they agreed to meet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius arrived with his brother and a few military tribunes, Attalus with his royal retinue, Nicostratus, praetor of the Achaeans, with a few auxiliaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They found the tyrant waiting there with his entire army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Wearing his armour and attended by an armed body-guard, he advanced to about the centre <pb id="p.271"/>of the space between the two parties; Quinctius was<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> unarmed, as were his brother and two tribunes of the soldiers, while at either side of the king, who was likewise unarmed, stood the Achaean praetor and one of his own courtiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The conversation began with an apology by the tyrant because he had come armed and hedged about by armed men though he saw the Roman commander and the king unarmed; he feared not them, he said, but the Argive exiles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, when they began to discuss the terms of alliance, the Roman made two demands: first, that he put an end to his war with the Achaeans, second, that he send with him auxiliaries against Philip. The auxiliaries he agreed to send; in place of peace with the Achaeans, he obtained an armistice until the war with Philip should be concluded.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With regard to Argos, another dispute was started by King Attalus, who charged Nabis with holding by force a city betrayed by the guile of Philocles, while the other defended himself by pointing to his summons by the Argives themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king demanded an assembly of the Argives, that this assertion might be proved; the tyrant did not refuse this; but the king said that a free assembly, that would show what the Argives wished, should be made possible, the guards having been withdrawn from the city and no Lacedaemonians intermingled;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the tyrant refused to withdraw the guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This discussion came to nought. They left the conference, six hundred Cretans having been furnished to the Roman by the tyrant, and a truce for four months made between Nicostratus, praetor of the Achaeans, and the Spartan tyrant.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Quinctius then set out for Corinth and approached <pb id="p.273"/>the gate with the Cretan contingent, that it might<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> be clear to Philocles, the prefect of the city, that the tyrant had deserted Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Philocles also held a conference with the Roman commander, and to the suggestion that he at once desert and hand over the city, he returned a reply that hinted delay rather than refusal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Corinth Quinctius crossed to Anticyra; thence he sent his brother to sound the people of the Acarnanes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Attalus went from Argos to Sicyon. There the city, for its part, added new distinctions to the king's former honours, while he, in addition to the fact that he had once redeemed for them the sacred precinct of Apollo at a high price, at this time also,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> not to pass by an allied and friendly city without some act of generosity, gave them as a present ten talents of silver and ten thousand <hi rend="italics">medimni</hi> of grain; and so he returned to his fleet at Cenchreae.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And Nabis, strengthening the garrison at Argos and returning to Sparta, even as he had despoiled the men, sent his wife to rob the women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> She invited now prominent individuals, now groups of women related to one another, and partly by flattery, partly by threats, took from them not only their money but finally even their raiment and their whole feminine adornment as well.</p>

				<p>Many prodigies, reported from various quarters, are

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These events occurred during the winter; but<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> in the beginning of spring Quinctius summoned Attalus to Elatia, and, wishing to bring under his control the Boeotians, a people whose attitude had thus far been uncertain, he set out through Phocis and encamped five miles from Thebes, which is the capital of Boeotia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thence the next day, taking the soldiers of one company and Attalus and the numerous embassies which had come in from all directions, he set out to march towards the city, ordering the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi><note>The soldiers in the foremost of the three lines (<hi rend="italics">hastati, principes, triarii</hi>) in which a legion was normally formed for battle.</note> of the legion &mdash;they amounted to two thousand men &mdash;to follow at the distance of a mile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they had completed about half the march, Antiphilus, the praetor of the Boeotians, met them; the rest of the people from the wall watched the approach of the Roman commander and the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Only weapons here and there and a few soldiers were seen around them; the windings of the road and the intervening valleys hid the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi> who were following at a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When Quinctius was close to the city he decreased his pace, as if to show respect to the approaching throng; the real reason for the delay was to allow the <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi> time to overtake him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The townspeople, since the crowd was gathered in front of the lictor, did not see the rapidly <pb id="p.281"/>approaching column of armed men until they arrived at the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> general's quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then all were dumbfounded, thinking that the city had been betrayed and captured by the treachery of Antiphilus the praetor, and it seemed clear that no opportunity was left the Boeotians for freedom of action in the council which had been called for the next day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They concealed their sorrow, the display of which would have been both fruitless and not without risk.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Attalus opened the discussion in the council. He began with the services of his forefathers and himself, in general to all Greeks and especially to the Boeotians, but being now an old man and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> too feeble to endure the strain of speaking, he fell silent and collapsed, and while he was being carried out
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and the report brought back that he had partially lost the use of his limbs, the assembly was adjourned for a time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Aristaenus, praetor of the Achaeans, spoke with the greater effect because he gave the Boeotians the same advice he had previously given the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Quinctius himself added a few words, in praise of the loyalty of the Romans rather than of their military strength or material resources.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A motion was then proposed and read by Dicaearchus of Plataea, about forming an alliance with Rome, and since no one dared to speak against it, it was received and carried by the unanimous consent of the Boeotian cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The meeting then adjourning, Quinctius, having remained in Thebes only as long
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> as the sudden illness of Attalus demanded, when it appeared that the attack did not for the moment imperil his life, but merely weakened his body, left him there to receive the necessary treatment and returned to Elatia, whence he had come;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> having brought the <pb id="p.283"/>Boeotians, as well as the Achaeans before them, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> into the confederacy and made the country behind him secure and peaceful, he now turned all his attention towards Philip and what remained of the war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, too, seeing that his ambassadors had brought from Rome no indication of peace, at the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> beginning of spring decided to conduct a levy through all the towns of his kingdom, since he was in great want of young recruits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the continuous fighting through several generations had exhausted the Macedonians; during his own reign many had fallen in naval battles with the Rhodians and Attalus and in engagements with the Romans on land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore enlisted recruits from the age of sixteen, and some who had served their allotted time but still possessed some share of strength were recalled to the colours. He thus filled up his ranks, and ordered a muster of all his troops at Dium<note>Dium was near the south-eastern frontier of Macedonia.</note> about the time of the vernal equinox.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There he established a base and spent the time of waiting for the enemy in drilling his troops daily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius also meanwhile had left Elatia and marched to Thermopylae by way of Thronium and Scarphea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There he held the Aetolian council, summoned to meet at Heraclea, to determine with how many troops they should follow the Romans to the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Having learned the decision of the allies, he advanced in three days from Heraclea to Xyniae, on the frontier of the Aenianes and Thessalians and made camp and waited for the Aetolian auxiliaries. These made haste, and six hundred infantry and four hundred cavalry arrived, commanded by Phaeneas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Quinctius broke camp at once, so as to leave no doubt why he had waited.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he had <pb id="p.285"/>crossed the border into the Phthiotic country, five<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> hundred Gortynii from Crete under the command of Cydas and three hundred from Apollonia, armed in the same fashion,<note>Both contingents were archers and light-armed.</note> joined him and a little later Amynander arrived with twelve hundred infantry of the Athamanes.</p> 
				<p>Philip learned of the departure of the Romans from Elatia, and since he was in a situation where a contest for supreme power impended, he determined to encourage his troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After he had repeated many oft-told stories of the brave deeds of their forefathers
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and also of the martial glory of the Macedonians, he came to the points which at that time were causing them the greatest terror and by which they could be roused to some degree of hopefulness.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Against the defeat sustained in the narrows at the Aous river he set the triple defeat inflicted at Atrax by the Macedonian phalanx upon the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Even there, when they had failed to hold the passes of Epirus which they commanded, the blame rested first on those who had not maintained careful vigilance, next, in the actual battle, on the light infantry and the mercenaries;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the Macedonian phalanx, on the other hand, had stood fast even then, and would always stand unconquered when regular battle was joined on level ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were sixteen thousand in the phalanx, the flower of the whole kingdom. In addition, there were two thousand with light shields, whom they call peltasts, and an equal number (two thousand each) of Thracians and Illyrians &mdash;Tralles
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> is the name of the tribe &mdash;and auxiliary mercenaries from different nationalities to the number of about fifteen hundred <pb id="p.287"/>and two thousand cavalry. With these forces the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> king awaited the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans had about the same number; it was only in cavalry strength that they were superior, because of the arrival of the Aetolians.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Quinctius had moved his camp towards Phthiotic Thebes, he conceived the hope that the city would be betrayed to him by Timon, a leader among this people, and approached it with a few cavalry and light infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This hope was so wholly belied that there was not only a battle with forces which sallied forth, but there was even grave danger had not infantry and cavalry, hastily summoned from the camp, arrived in time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And after nothing of this rashly-formed hope turned out well, he gave up for the present his design of further attacks upon the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And, assured that the king was in Thessaly, but not yet certain of the direction of his march, he ordered soldiers sent out into the country to cut timbers and prepare a stockade.<note>The <hi rend="italics">vallum,</hi> as here described, was a portable fortification which could be set up around a temporary camp.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Both Macedonians and Greeks employed a stockade, but in a manner ill adapted to ease of transportation or security in defence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> for they cut trees of too great size and with too many branches for one soldier to carry, especially with his arms, and when they had walled a camp by planting these in front, the destruction of their rampart was easy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For because the trunks of the great trees were planted far apart and numerous strong branches offered easy holds for the hand, two or at most three young men, if they exerted themselves, would easily pull out a tree, and,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> this being pulled out, there was at once an opening like a gate, nor was material ready at hand to block it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Roman cuts light forked trees with <pb id="p.289"/>three or perhaps four branches, as a general rule, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> so that each soldier could comfortably carry several at once, with his arms hanging on his back;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and they plant them so close together and interweave the boughs so completely that it is difficult to tell to which branch each trunk is joined or to which trunk each branch belongs;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> moreover, the branches are so sharp as to leave, interlaced, little space for inserting the hand, so that there is nothing that can be grasped and pulled out, since the interwoven branches bind one another together;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and, if one is by chance pulled out, it leaves a small gap and is easily replaced.<note>Polybius (XVIII. xviii) gives a very similar description (from which Livy borrows the above passage) and admires greatly the Roman art of war as thus manifested.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius made a short march the next day, the soldiers carrying the stockade with them, so that he was ready
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> to fortify a camp in any place, and when he had halted about six miles from Pherae, he sent out patrols to find out in what part of Thessaly the king was and what he was doing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The king was near Larisa. Being now informed that the Roman had moved from Thebes to Pherae and desiring, for his part, to end the struggle at once, he began to march towards the enemy and encamped about four miles from Pherae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Thence next day both sides sent out light troops to seize the hills overlooking the town, and these, when they were about equidistant from the ridge which was to be occupied, came to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> a halt as soon as they espied one another, waiting quietly for the runners whom they had sent back to camp to ask what they were to do, since the enemy had unexpectedly been met.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And on that day indeed they were withdrawn to camp without starting a battle; on the next day there was a cavalry engagement around the same hills, in which, mainly through the help of the Aetolians, <pb id="p.291"/>the king's forces were defeated and driven back to<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Both sides were greatly hindered in the action by the fact that the country was covered with many trees and gardens, as in suburban districts, while the roads were bordered with hedges and in some places entirely closed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Both commanders therefore reached the same decision, to retire from this country, and as if by agreement both marched in the direction of Scotusa, Philip hoping to find food there, the Roman by his advance to destroy the enemy's grain-supply.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The two columns marched the whole day, nowhere seeing one another, since there was a continuous range of hills between them. The Romans encamped near Eretria in Phthiotis, Philip on the river Onchestus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor did either army know for certain where the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> enemy was, even the following day, though Philip encamped near Melambium, as they call it, in the country of Scotusa, and the Romans around Thetideum, in the territory of Pharsalia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The third day a heavy rain, followed by a fog dark as night, kept the Romans in camp in fear of an ambuscade.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip wished to hurry and so ordered an advance, undeterred by the low-hanging clouds after the rain;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but so dense a fog obscured the day that the standard-bearers could not see the road nor the soldiers the standards, and the column, straggling along in obedience to the various cries, was as disorderly as if wandering about at night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They crossed the hills which are called Cynoscephalae<note>Literally, <quote>Dog's Head</quote> hills. Livy seems to misunderstand the manoeuvres here. The crossing of this ridge would, apparently, have placed Philip and the Romans on the same side, which is inconsistent with what follows. Polybius (XVIII. xx.) seems more accurate when he has Philip send <quote>his reserve back, with instructions to halt upon the summit of the intervening hills.</quote></note> and encamped after leaving there a strong guard of infantry and cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although the Roman had stayed in the <pb id="p.293"/>same camp near Thetideum, nevertheless he sent out<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> ten troops of cavalry and one thousand infantry to discover where the enemy was, with orders to guard against ambushes, which the darkness would hide, even in open country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they came to the guarded hills, both forces remained passive, as if struck with a mutual fear; then they sent messengers back to the camps to their commanders, as soon as their panic from this unexpected contact had subsided, and did not longer postpone the fight. The battle began at first with skirmishes of a few scouts in advance, then assumed larger proportions as reinforcements came to the aid of the defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In this battle, when the Romans were not holding their own, but kept sending message after message to their commander that they were hard pressed, five hundred cavalry and two thousand infantry,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> mostly Aetolians, under two military tribunes, were speedily sent and restored the unfavorable battle, and as fortune changed the Macedonians, finding themselves in difficulties, begged through messengers for aid from the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But since he had expected anything but a pitched battle that day, on account of the general darkness from the fog, having sent most of his troops of every sort out to forage, he hesitated for a time, not knowing what to do;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> then, as messengers kept urging him, and the fog had now uncovered the ridges of the mountains and he could see the Macedonians crowded together on the highest of a number of hills, defending themselves more with the advantage of position than with arms, thinking that he must at any
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> rate stake everything, lest he suffer the loss of some of his men, left unsupported, he sent Athenagoras, commander of the mercenaries,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <pb id="p.295"/>with all the auxiliaries except the Thracians and with<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> the Macedonian and Thessalian cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On their arrival the Romans were driven from the ridge and checked their retreat only when they reached more level ground in the valley. The Aetolian cavalry was the greatest safeguard to prevent their utter rout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At that time their cavalry was by far the best in Greece; in infantry they were inferior to their neighbours.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The news was more encouraging than their success in the battle warranted, since one after another, coming back from the field, shouted out that the Romans were fleeing in terror, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> this compelled Philip, though against his will, reluctant, and maintaining that it was a rash undertaking and that he liked neither the place nor the time, to commit his entire force to the action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Roman also did the same, from necessity rather than to seize an opportunity for fighting. The right wing, with the elephants alined in front of the standards, he held in reserve;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> with the left and all the lightarmed troops he attacked the enemy, reminding them at the same time that they would meet the same Macedonians whom they had driven out and defeated in battle in the passes of Epirus, defended by mountains and rivers, conquering the difficulties of Nature herself, the same Macedonians whom they had previously defeated under the leadership of Publius Sulpicius, when they held the pass to Eordaea;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that the Macedonian kingdom rested on reputation and not on strength, and that even this reputation had at last wholly faded away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By this time they had come up to their men stationed in the lowest part of the valley, who, encouraged by the arrival of the army and the general, renewed the <pb id="p.297"/>battle, charged, and again drove back the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Philip with the peltasts and the right wing of the infantry, the strength of the Macedonian army, which they called the phalanx, advanced on the run to meet the enemy, ordering Nicanor, one of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> his nobles, to follow at once with the rest of the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At first as he reached the ridge and saw that the battle was over there, with a few weapons and a few corpses of the enemy lying about, and that the Romans had been driven back from there and that the battle was raging near the enemy's camp, he was filled with excessive joy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> presently, as his men were retreating, made uncertain by the reversal of fear, he debated in terror whether he should withdraw his men to their own camp;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> then, as the enemy came nearer, when his men were being cut down in flight and could not be rescued unless they were reinforced, and not even he had any safe line of retreat, he was compelled, though his whole force had not come up, to try desperate measures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On the right flank he placed the cavalry and the light infantry who had been in the battle;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> he ordered the peltasts and the Macedonian phalanx to put aside their spears, the length of which was a hindrance, and to engage with swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At the same time, to prevent the line from being easily broken through, he diminished the front by half and doubled the depth by extending the files backward, so that the formation was deep rather than wide; he also ordered the troops to lessen intervals, so that man stood close to man and arms to arms.<note>I have given the apparent meaning, although the Latin is so harsh as to suggest the possibility that the text is corrupt. Polybius (XVIII. xxiv) says that they doubled the depth and closed in to the right. A drillmaster may wonder how these movements were executed, though he can hardly question that they were.</note></p> <pb id="p.299"/>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius absorbed into his ranks and among<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> the standards the men who had already been engaged and gave the signal with the trumpet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They say that only rarely at any other time has such a shout been raised at the beginning of a battle, for, as it happened, both armies shouted at once, and not only those who were fighting but also the reserves and those who were just then coming up to the line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the right flank, the king prevailed easily, mainly because of his position, since he was fighting from higher ground; on the left there was panic and confusion, especially since the part of the phalanx which was in the rear was still coming up;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the centre, which was nearer the right flank, stood watching the battle there, as if it were a spectacle which did not directly concern them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The phalanx, which had come up in column rather than in line, and in a form more fitted for the march than for battle, had barely reached the saddle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While it was still in disorder, Quinctius, although he saw his men retreating on the right, first sending his elephants against the enemy, attacked, thinking that the defeat of a part would involve the rest. The issue was never in doubt; the Macedonians immediately fled, turning back in terror at the first sight of the beasts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The others too followed them in their flight, and one of the tribunes
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> of the soldiers, forming a plan to fit the emergency, took the soldiers of twenty companies and, leaving the action where his men were clearly victorious and making a short detour, attacked the enemy's right from behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Any army would have been dismayed by an attack from the rear; but added to the general panic of all in such a crisis was the fact that the heavy and unwieldy Macedonian <pb id="p.301"/>phalanx could not change front, nor did the soldiers<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> who were falling back a little while before from the front upon men who were by now terrified on their own account permit this.<note>On rough ground, where space for movement was limited, the phalanx was at a serious disadvantage, and its vulnerability was in this case increased by the diminution of the intervals between files (see above). The necessary ground for the change of front to meet the new attack was denied them by the retreat of their own men who had backed up against the front of the phalanx, and the individual members of the right files could not face about because of the cramped space and the character of their weapons.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were at a disadvantage too because of their position, since the ridge from which they had been fighting, when they were pursuing the soldiers who had been driven<note>Cf. vii. 12 above.</note> down the hill, had been given up to the enemy which had been led around behind them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For a while they were caught between the two lines and slaughtered, then most of them threw away their arms and took to flight.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip with a few troopers and infantrymen at first held a hill higher than the rest, so as to watch the fortune of his left flank;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> later, when he beheld the disorderly flight and saw all the ridges round about filled with the gleam of standards and arms, he too left the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius, after pressing hard on the retreating enemy, suddenly, because he saw the Macedonians raising their spears, and not knowing what this meant, halted his troops for a moment because of the strangeness of the action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, when he learned that it was the customary gesture of the Macedonians to indicate their surrender, it was in his mind to spare the vanquished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the soldiers, ignorant that the fighting was over, so far as the enemy was concerned, and not knowing the general's plans, charged, and killing the first put the rest to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king fled at full speed to Tempe. Then he stopped a day at Gonni to collect any who had survived from the battle. The victorious Romans burst into the <pb id="p.303"/>enemy's camp in the hope of loot, but found that it<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> had, for the most part, already been plundered by the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On that day eight thousand of the enemy perished, five thousand were captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Of the victors about seven hundred fell. If we trust Valerius Antias, who is prone to increase numbers without restraint, forty thousand of the enemy were slain that day; the prisoners, he says &mdash;here his exaggeration is more moderate &mdash;numbered five thousand seven hundred, and two hundred and forty-nine standards were taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Claudius too gives the figures as thirty-two thousand killed and four thousand three hundred captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I have given my account, not because the numbers are smallest, but because I have followed Polybius, an authority worthy of credence on all matters of Roman history and especially on occurrences in Greece.<note>Polybius (XVIII. xxvii) gives the Macedonian losses as they are quoted here. See the notes, <hi rend="italics">passim,</hi> for Livy's use of Polybius for events in the east as compared with his dependence on Latin annalists for what happened in other parts of the world. Livy's description of the battle of Cynoscephalae follows closely that of Polybius, but was more obviously written by a man who was not a soldier and whose knowledge of the field was derived entirely from what he read and not from what he had seen or experienced.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Philip, having collected the straggling fugitives who had followed his trail after the changing fortunes of the battle-field, sent agents to Larisa to burn the royal records, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the Romans, and retired into Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Quinctius sold part of the prisoners and booty and gave part to the soldiers, and marched towards Larisa, still uncertain where the king had gone and what he was planning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There the king's herald met him, ostensibly to ask for a truce, that those who had fallen in the battle might be removed for burial, in reality to ask permission to send an embassy. <pb id="p.305"/>Both requests were granted by the Roman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> consul, moreover, added that the king should take heart, a phrase which gave great offence to the Aetolians, who were already swollen with pride and complaining that victory had changed the general: before the battle he had been wont to discuss with the allies all matters great and small, but now they were excluded from
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> all his deliberations, and he decided everything according to his own personal judgment, since he was trying to win a place of private influence with the king, in order that, although the Aetolians had endured the hardships
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> and toils of the war, the Roman might take to himself the credit for the peace and the profits of victory.<note>This sounds like an echo of the complaint of the Roman soldiers when they found that the Aetolians had already plundered Philip's camp, to the effect that they suffered the hardships and the Aetolians received the booty (Polyb. XVIII. xxvii).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And beyond doubt something of their honourable position had been lost; but they did not see why they should be utterly ignored.<note>The first clause of this sentence must be regarded as Livy's parenthetical explanation of what had happened.</note> They believed that the consul &mdash;a man of a soul unconquerable by such cupidity &mdash;was eager to receive gifts from the king;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> but he was in fact angry at the Aetolians, and with just cause, for their insatiable desire for booty and their arrogance in claiming the glory of the victory for themselves, while with their boasting they had offended the ears of everyone, and he saw that
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> with Philip out of the way and the power of the Macedonian kingdom broken the Aetolians would be held the masters of Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For these reasons he deliberately took many steps to cause them to be and to seem of less moment and importance in the eyes of all men.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A truce of fifteen days had been granted to the enemy and a conference arranged with the king; but before the time for this arrived, he called a council of the allies and referred to them the terms of peace <pb id="p.307"/>which they wished to be imposed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Amynander, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> king of the Athamanes, spoke briefly: the peace should be so arranged that Greece, even in the absence of the Romans, should be strong enough to maintain at once peace and liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The language of the Aetolians was more harsh; they said, after a brief preface, that the Roman commander was acting correctly and in order in discussing the conditions of peace with those whom he had had as his allies in the war;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but that he was totally wrong if he thought that he would leave either assured peace to the Romans or liberty to the Greeks unless Philip were either killed or dethroned, either of which was easy if he were willing to follow up his good fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In reply, Quinctius asserted that the Aetolians neither remembered Roman policy nor employed arguments consistent with themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the one hand, in all previous conferences and conversations they had always spoken of conditions of peace and not of waging a war of extermination;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> on the other, the Romans, in addition to observing, from remote antiquity, their custom of sparing conquered peoples, had given striking proof of their mercifulness in the peace granted to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He would say nothing about the Carthaginians: how many conferences had been held with Philip himself? Never was there any suggestion that he should give up his kingdom. Or, because he had been defeated in battle, did that make war an unpardonable offence?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> An armed enemy should be met in hostile mood; towards the conquered, the mildest possible attitude was the greatest thing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Macedonian kings seemed a menace to Greek liberty; if that kingdom and people were removed, <pb id="p.309"/>the Thracians, the Illyrians, and then the Gauls, fierce<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> arid untamed peoples, would pour into Macedonia and into Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They should not, by breaking up all the nearest states, open the way to themselves for larger and more powerful tribes. Then, when Phaeneas, the Aetolian praetor, interrupted, reminding him that if Philip escaped this time he would soon cause a greater war, Quinctius replied, <quote>Cease causing disturbance when we should be deliberating.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The conditions by which the king will be bound will not be such that he will be able to start a war.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This council was adjourned, and the next day the king came to the pass which leads to Tempe &mdash;this
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> was the place designated for the meeting &mdash;and on the third day a full council of the Romans and allies met him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There Philip conducted himself with great discretion, and conceding voluntarily those points without which peace could not be obtained, rather than having them wrung from him after argument, he said that he accepted all
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the conditions commanded by the Romans or demanded by the allies in the previous conference, and would submit everything else to the judgment of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Although he seemed in this way to have sealed the lips of even his bitterest enemies, nevertheless, when all were silent, Phaeneas the Aetolian asked, <quote>Well, Philip, do you restore to us at last Pharsalus and Larisa Cremaste and Echinus and Phthiotic Thebes?</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When Philip replied that there was no reason why they should not receive them, a dispute over Thebes broke out between the Roman commander and the Aetolians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for Quinctius maintained that it belonged to the Roman people by the law of war, because at the beginning of the campaign, when
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the army had <pb id="p.311"/>been moved against the town and they had been<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> invited to become friends to the Romans at a time when they had full power to break off relations with the king, they had preferred the alliance with the king to that with the Romans;<note>The Roman attack on Thebes was described in v. 1-3 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Phaeneas thought it right and in accordance with the military alliance, that what had belonged to the Aetolians before the war should be returned to them, and said that it had been provided in the original treaty, regarding
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> booty taken in the war, that movables, which could be carried or driven away, should belong to the Romans, and lands and cities should go to the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> To this Quinctius replied, <quote>You yourselves broke the rules laid down in that treaty, at the time you deserted us and made peace with Philip.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But even if that treaty still held, that clause would pertain to cities that had been captured; the Thessalian cities submitted to us of their own accord.</quote><note>Whether these arguments are mere hair-splitting cannot be ascertained. In XXVI. xxiv. 8-13 Livy gives in some detail the contents of the treaty of <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>, but does not cover this point (sect. 11 mentions the classification of booty referred to by Phaeneas). Livy's phrase <hi rend="italics">foedere primo</hi> suggests a second treaty of which we have no knowledge. In any case, according to the Romans, existing treaties were annulled by the separate peace which the Aetolians had made with Philip.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These words were received with applause from all the allies, but to the Aetolians they were unpleasant to hear at the moment, and later on they were the cause of war and, as a result of the war, of great slaughter to the Aetolians.<note>The ill-feeling thus engendered and increased by the resentment of the Aetolians at Rome's settlement with Philip led them, in <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> (XXXV. xii. 1 ff.), to invite Antiochus to invade Europe. They were not finally subjugated until <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date> (XXXVIII. xi. 1 ff.).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> It was agreed with Philip that he should surrender his son Demetrius and certain of his friends as hostages and pay two hundred talents, and send ambassadors to Rome with respect to other matters; for this purpose a truce of four months was granted. If peace was not obtained from the senate, it was agreed that Philip should recover his hostages and money.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It is said that nothing influenced the Roman <pb id="p.313"/>commander more strongly to secure a speedy peace<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> than the ascertained fact that Antiochus was planning war and an invasion of Europe.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, and, as some have related, on the very same day, the Achaeans routed the king's general Androsthenes in a pitched battle near Corinth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Philip intended to hold this city as a stronghold against the Greek cities, and when he had invited there the leading citizens under pretence of discussing with them the number of cavalry the Corinthians could furnish for
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the war, he had held them as hostages, and in addition to five hundred Macedonians and eight hundred auxiliaries of various nations, the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> number that had already been there for some time, he had sent there a thousand Macedonians and twelve hundred Thracians and Illyrians and eight hundred Cretans, for this people fought on both sides.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Added to these were one thousand Boeotians, Thessalians and Acarnanians, all provided with shields, and seven hundred of the youth of the Corinthians themselves, filling up his numbers to six thousand armed men, and these gave Androsthenes confidence enough to risk a decisive battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nicostratus, the praetor of the Achaeans, was at Sicyon with two thousand infantry and one hundred cavalry, but, seeing himself inferior both in numbers and in the quality of his troops, he would not leave his fortifications.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king's infantry and cavalry were roaming about and ravaging the lands of Pellene, Phlius and Cleonae, and finally crossed into the territory of Sicyon, taunting the enemy with cowardice;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> likewise they skirted with their ships the whole coast of Achaea and laid it waste.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the enemy was thus engaged in scattered groups and, as often happens in <pb id="p.315"/>cases of over-confidence, with a lack of vigilance, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Nicostratus, in the hope of attacking them unexpectedly, sent secret messages to the neighbouring states, naming the day and
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> fixing the numbers from each state to assemble at Apelaurum &mdash;this place is in the land of Stymphalia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When all was ready on the appointed day, he at once set out by night through the country of the Phliasii and arrived at Cleonae, no one knowing what he was planning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He had with him five thousand infantry, including ... light-armed troops, and three hundred cavalry. With these forces, after first sending out scouts to find out in which direction the enemy was moving, he waited.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Androsthenes, in ignorance of all this, had left Corinth and encamped on the Nemea, which is a stream separating the lands of Corinth and Sicyon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There he ordered half of his army, divided into three columns, and all his cavalry to lay waste at the same time the country of Pellene, Sicyon and Phlius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The three separate columns marched out. When this was reported to Nicostratus at Cleonae, he immediately sent out a strong force of mercenaries to close the pass which gives access to Corinthian territory,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and posting the cavalry ahead of the infantry to lead the way, himself followed rapidly in two columns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In one marched the mercenaries with the light infantry, in the other the shield-wearers: these constitute the chief strength in the armies of those states. The infantry and cavalry were now not far from the camp,<note>The camp of Androsthenes, mentioned in sect. 1 above.</note> and some of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thracians had made an attack upon the enemy, foraging and scattered through the fields, when sudden panic gripped the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The commander <pb id="p.317"/>was afraid, inasmuch as he had nowhere seen the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> enemy except in small detachments in the hills in front of Sicyon, not daring to march their column down into the plains, and had never believed that they would attack from Cleonae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He gave orders that the foragers should be recalled by a trumpet-blast and, hastily ordering the troops to arm, he marched out of the gate with his depleted column and formed his battle-line above the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The rest of the force, assembled and formed with difficulty, did not oppose the enemy's initial charge; the Macedonians had rallied in the largest numbers of all to the standards, and for a long time they rendered the prospect of victory uncertain;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> at last, exposed by the flight of the rest, with two lines
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> of the enemy advancing from different directions, the light infantry from the flank, the heavy infantry and peltasts from the front, as the hope of victory diminished they at first retired slowly, but then, as the pressure increased, they broke, and most of
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> them threw away their arms, abandoning hope of holding the camp, and made for Corinth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Nicostratus sent the mercenaries to follow them and the cavalry and Thracian auxiliaries against the raiders in the territory around Sicyon, and caused great slaughter there also, greater, almost, than in the battle itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Part of the troops, too, who had ravaged Pellene and Phlius, returning in disorder and ignorant of what had transpired, when near the camp, drifted into the enemy's outguards in the belief that they were their own, while part of them, suspecting from the confusion what the truth was, scattered in flight
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> in every direction, with the result that as they wandered about they were set upon even by the country-people. The losses that day were fifteen hundred killed, three <pb id="p.319"/>hundred captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All Achaea was freed from great<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> terror.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the battle of Cynoscephalae, Lucius Quinctius had summoned to Corcyra the leading men of the Acarnanes, the only people in Greece which had held to the Macedonian alliance, and had made some progress toward a movement there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But two principal causes had kept them loyal to the king; one, their native habit of fidelity, the other, their fear and hatred of the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A council was called at Leucas. Not all the cities assembled there, nor did all who came agree; but two persons, leading men and magistrates, brought it to pass that an unofficial decree favouring a Roman alliance was adopted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All those who were not represented resented this bitterly; and in this time of confusion in the state, two prominent Acarnanians, Androcles and Echedemus, sent by Philip, succeeded not only in rescinding the decree for a Roman alliance, but in convicting before the council,
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> on charges of treason, two men, both prominent in public life, Archelaus and Bianor, because they had proposed the decree, and in having Zeuxis the praetor removed from office because he had put the motion. The prisoners adopted a device rash but successful in its result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Though their friends advised them to yield to the situation and take refuge with the Romans at Corcyra, they determined to throw themselves on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> mercy of the assembly, and, by so doing, either mollify their wrath or endure what fortune had in store for them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they entered the crowded assembly, there was first applause and a demonstration of admiration, then silence, due to respect for their former high station and pity for their present state.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they were allowed to speak, they began <pb id="p.321"/>like suppliants, but as their speech progressed and they<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> reached the stage of defending themselves against the charges, they spoke with all the confidence that innocence gave them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> finally, daring even to complain somewhat and to rebuke at once the injustice and the harshness of their treatment, they roused such feelings that a majority defeated all the decrees
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> proposed against them but nevertheless voted to abide by the treaty with Philip and reject the friendship of the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the decrees at Leucas. This was the capital of Acarnania, and thither all the peoples were wont to come to council.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly, when this sudden change was reported to the lieutenant Flamininus at Corcyra, he at once set out with his fleet to Leucas and anchored in the harbour called Heraeum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He approached the walls with all kinds of artillery and equipment with which cities are assaulted, thinking that their minds would turn towards peace at the first alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But when they showed no signs of a peaceful disposition then he began to erect sheds and towers and to move the battering-ram towards the walls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Acarnania as a whole lies between Aetolia and Epirus, facing the west and the Sicilian sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Leucadia is now an island, cut off from Acarnania by a shallow channel dug by hand; then it was a peninsula,<note>Whether or not Leucas was in remote antiquity an island, a peninsula, or a tract of land separated from or joined to the mainland by something resembling a sand-bar or a tidal flat, Livy is here in accord with the usual ancient tradition, which represents it as an island made out of a peninsula by an artificial channel (Strabo I. iii. 18; X. ii. 8; Thucydides III. 81; IV. 8, etc.). The question naturally interlocks with the controversy over the identification of Leucas with the Homeric Ithaca (conveniently summarized by Buerchner in Pauly-Wissowa, <hi rend="italics">s.v.</hi> Leucas, by Jones in the Appendix to Vol. V of his Strabo in this series, and, most recently but very briefly, by Hennig, <hi rend="italics">Die Geographie des Homerischen Epos,</hi> Neue Wege zur Antike, I. Reihe, Heft 10, Leipzig, 1934, 85-101).</note> joined to Acarnania by a narrow neck of land on its western side; this neck of land was about five hundred paces long and not more than one hundred twenty paces wide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In this constricted place lay Leucas, <pb id="p.323"/>clinging to a hill facing the east and Acarnania; the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> lower parts of the town were flat, lying along the sea which separates Leucadia from Acarnania.<note>The acropolis of Leucas was on a hill; the lower town extended eastward from its base.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On that side it is vulnerable by land and sea, for the shallows are more like a pool than a sea and the whole country is flat and favourable for siege-works. So the walls in many places were either undermined or thrown down by the battering-ram.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But as the city itself was exposed to attack, just so were the minds of the enemy invincible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By day and night they laboured to rebuild the shattered walls, to close the ways laid open by their fall, to enter battle courageously, and to defend the walls with weapons rather than themselves with walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They would have prolonged the siege beyond Roman expectations had not certain exiles of the Italian race, living in Leucas, come down from the citadel and admitted the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Leucadians, nevertheless, rushing down from the higher ground with loud shouts and drawing up their array in the forum, resisted for a time in pitched battle. Meanwhile the fortifications in many places were taken by escalade, and entrance to the city was
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> gained over piles of stones and fallen buildings, and now the lieutenant himself with a strong force had surrounded the defenders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Part fell in the mellay, some threw down their arms and surrendered to the victor. And a few days later, when news came of the battle which had been fought at Cynoscephalae,
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> all the states of Acarnania submitted to the control of the lieutenant.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, when everything was going one way, the Rhodians also, with a view to reclaiming from Philip the district on the mainland &mdash;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Peraea is its name &mdash;which their forefathers had held, dispatched Pausistratus the praetor with eight <pb id="p.325"/>hundred Achaean infantry and about one thousand<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> eight hundred auxiliaries collected from different states:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> these were Gauls and Pisuetae and Nisuetae and Tamiani and Arei from Africa and Laudiceni<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> the inhabitants of Laodicea in Asia; the Galli were from Galatia and the other tribes from Africa.</note> from Asia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With these forces Pausistratus took Tendeba, a city in the territory of Stratonicea and well situated, without the knowledge of the king's forces who were on Thera.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There reinforcements, summoned at this time and for this purpose, to wit, one thousand Achaean infantry with one hundred cavalry, met them; Theoxenus was their commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Dinocrates, the king's prefect, first moved his camp towards Tendeba itself for the purpose of recovering the fortress, then to another fort, also in the country of Stratonicea &mdash;they call it Astragon &mdash;recalling all the garrisons which had been scattered far and wide and Thessalian auxiliaries from Stratonicea itself, and began to march towards Alabanda, where the enemy lay.<note>Both the movements of the opposing forces and their purposes are obscure.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Rhodians did not decline the battle. So, placing their camp near by, they came down to the battle-field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Dinocrates placed five hundred Macedonians on his right flank and the Agrianes on the left;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> in the centre he posted the troops gathered up from the garrisons of the forts &mdash;they were mostly Carians &mdash;and he covered the flanks with the cavalry and the Cretan and Thracian auxiliaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Rhodians had in the centre the Achaeans, a picked force of infantry, and the auxiliaries, made up of men of different races,
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> and the cavalry and what there was of light infantry placed outside the flanks.<note>This translation preserves what seems to be the soundest text of the sentence. It is, however, strange that Livy has not given in detail the formation of the Rhodian line, as he has that of the Macedonian. All conjectures intended to meet this objection are unreasonably bold.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On that day both lines merely remained standing <pb id="p.327"/>on the banks of the river flowing between them, -<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> which was then a small stream, and after hurling a few missiles retired to their camps. The next day the two armies were similarly formed and a battle began, severer than might be expected from the numbers of the combatants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For there were not more than three thousand infantry and one hundred cavalry on either side, but they fought not only with equal numbers and similar weapons but with the same courage and equal hope as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Achaeans at first crossed the river and attacked the Agrianes, and then almost the whole line hastily crossed the stream on the run. The issue was long in doubt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> By weight of numbers, the Achaeans, a thousand strong, dislodged the four hundred;<note>Presumably the Agrianes, though their number has not been given before.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> then, as the left gave way, the whole effort was directed against the right flank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The Macedonians could not be moved as long as the line held and the phalanx was, so to speak, compact; when, after their left flank was exposed, they tried to change front so as to
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> meet the enemy that was attacking them in flank, they first caused immediate disorder and confusion among themselves, then they began to fall back, and finally threw away their arms and fled at full speed. The fugitives made for Bargyliae, and Dinocrates sought refuge in the same place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The Rhodians followed as long as daylight lasted and then returned to camp. It is quite clear that if the victors had at once marched to Stratonicea, this city could have been recovered without a struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> The opportunity for this was lost while they consumed time in occupying the forts and towns of Peraea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Meanwhile the courage of those who were holding Stratonicea with the garrison was renewed, and presently Dinocrates <pb id="p.329"/>entered the walls with the troops that had survived<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> the battle. In vain was the city then invested and besieged, nor was it recovered until some time later through the aid of Antiochus.<note>The meaning is quite uncertain. In xxx. 11 below it is said that the Romans gave the city to the Rhodians according to the peace of <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> It is also possible that the city was included in the settlement in <date value="-189">189 B.C.</date>, after the war with Antiochus (XXXVII. vi. 6).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Such were the events of this period, which took place during, we may almost say, the same days in Thessaly, Achaea, and Asia.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When<note>The narrative which was interrupted at Chap. XIV above is resumed.</note> Philip learned that the Dardani had crossed the borders, out of contempt for his stricken kingdom, and were then

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> had turned against him and his people, nevertheless, thinking that to be robbed of the possession of Macedonia was a sadder fate than death, he quickly levied troops in the cities of Macedonia and with six thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry suddenly fell upon the enemy near Stobi in Paeonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Many men fell in the battle, many more through their lust for booty while roving through the fields. Those to whom flight was possible returned to their country without even risking the hazard of a battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Philip returned to Thessalonica with the courage of his people renewed by this one expedition, so different in its outcome from his other experiences.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> for, in addition to the fact that war is more easily waged against one at a time than when two have brought their united strength <pb id="p.331"/>to bear upon one, in Spain also about the same time<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> there was a grave uprising and revolt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When Antiochus, during the preceding summer, had transferred all the cities which are situated in Coele Syria from the power of Ptolemy to his own dominion and had retired to Antioch for the winter, this period was as full of activity as the summer had been.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For, when he had assembled huge military and naval forces by exerting all the strength of his kingdom, in the beginning of spring<note>This is the spring of <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date></note> he sent his two sons, Ardyes and Mithradates, ahead with the army by land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ordering them to wait for him at Sardis, he set out in person with one hundred decked ships and besides two hundred lighter vessels, schooners and brigs, with the double purpose of trying to win over the cities which had been under the control of Ptolemy
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> along the whole shore of Cilicia, Lycia, and Caria, and of aiding Philip with his army and navy &mdash;for that war had not yet been ended.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Many are the noble ventures which the Rhodians have undertaken on land and sea, to testify to their loyalty to the Roman people and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in behalf of the whole race of the Greeks, but they have done nothing more glorious than on this occasion, when, unterrified by the magnitude of the impending war, they sent ambassadors to the king, ordering him not to pass Chelidoniae &mdash;a promontory in Cilicia, made famous by the ancient treaty<note>In <date value="-449">449 B.C.</date>, Cimon made a treaty providing that Persian warships should not pass this promontory (Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Cimon</hi> 13).</note> between the Athenians and the Persian kings:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> if Antiochus did not keep his fleet and army within this limit, they vowed that they would oppose him, not from any ill-will towards him, but to prevent his joining Philip and interfering with the Romans who were undertaking to liberate <pb id="p.333"/>Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Antiochus was at the time besieging<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Coracesium, having recovered Zephyrium and Soli and Aphrodisias and Corycus, and Selinus, after rounding Anemurium &mdash;this also is a cape in Cilicia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All these and other forts on this coast having surrendered to him without resistance, either from fear or voluntarily, Coracesium unexpectedly closed its gates and delayed him. There the ambassadors of the Rhodians were given audience.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And although their message was one to inflame the king's mind, he restrained his anger and answered
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that he would send ambassadors to Rhodes with instructions to renew the long-standing relations existing between him and his ancestors and that state, and to bid them have no fears of the king's coming: no fraud or mischief was planned either for them or for their allies; for he would not violate the friendship of the Romans, in evidence whereof he cited both his own recent embassy to them and the senate's complimentary decrees and replies to him.<note>In <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date> (XXXII. viii. 15) the Romans sent an embassy to Antiochus with the request that he keep out of Pergamum, but the war with Philip compelled them to maintain this propitiatory attitude toward him. Antiochus shrewdly uses it to allay the suspicions of the Rhodians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At that time, as it happened, his ambassadors had returned from Rome, where they had been heard and dismissed courteously, as the situation demanded,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the outcome of the war with Philip being still in doubt. While the ambassadors of the king were relating this before the assembly of the Rhodians, the news came that the war had been ended at Cynoscephalae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Their fear of Philip having been dispelled by the receipt of this news, the Rhodians abandoned their design of going to meet Antiochus with the fleet; their other concern they did not forget, to wit, that of maintaining the liberty of the cities allied with Ptolemy, which were threatened with war by Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For some they helped with <pb id="p.335"/>reinforcements, some by warnings and information<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> as to the enemy's plans,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and they were responsible for preserving the liberty of the people of Caunus, Myndus, Halicarnassus, and Samos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It is hardly worth while to record in detail the events in this part of the world, since I am scarce able to recount those things which belong properly to the Roman war.</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time King Attalus, who had fallen ill at Thebes and then removed from Thebes to Pergamum, died in his seventy-second year, after he had been on the throne for forty-four years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fortune had bestowed upon this man nothing but wealth to give him hope of royal power. By using this both wisely and splendidly he brought it about that he seemed worthy of the throne, first in his own eyes, then in those of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then when in a single battle he had conquered the Gauls, a people the more terrible to Asia by reason of their recent arrival, he assumed the title of king, and thenceforth his greatness of soul always matched the greatness of his distinction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He ruled his subjects with perfect justice, exhibited remarkable fidelity to his allies, was courteous to his wife and sons &mdash;four

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>While this was the state of affairs in Asia, Greece, and Macedonia, the war with Philip having been scarcely finished and peace, at any rate, not yet assured, a great war broke out in Farther Spain.<note>The status of Spain had never been officially fixed since the Carthaginians were driven out during the Second Punic War. Until the present year it was normally governed by <hi rend="italics">privati cum imperio</hi> (see notes on XXXII. xxvii. 6 and xxviii. 11 above), and thorough pacification had not been attempted. Wars in Spain fill many pages in the next few books.</note> Marcus Helvius was now governor of that province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He sent dispatches to the senate that two petty kings, <pb id="p.337"/>Culcha and Luxinius, were in arms, that seventeen<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> towns had joined Culcha and the powerful cities of Carmo and Baldo
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> were with Luxinius, and that on the coast, the Malacini and Sexetani and all Baeturia and other states which had not yet disclosed their intentions would soon rise to join the revolt of their neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This letter was read to the senate by Marcus Sergius, the praetor who exercised jurisdiction in cases between citizens and aliens,<note>In XXXII. xxviii. 2 Sergius is <hi rend="italics">praetor urbanus,</hi> and this assignment is more probable.</note> and the Fathers voted that as soon as the praetorian elections were over the praetor to whom the province of Spain had by then been allotted should at the earliest possible moment refer to the senate the question of the Spanish war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the same time the consuls returned to Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when they summoned the senate to meet in the temple of Bellona and demanded a triumph for their successes in the war, Gaius Atinius Labeo and Gaius Afranius, tribunes of the people, insisted that the consuls offer separate motions regarding the triumph: they would not allow a common<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.,</hi> a motion covering both triumphs: cf. <hi rend="italics">communi animo consilioque</hi> three lines below.</note> motion to be voted on, lest equal honour be bestowed upon unequal merit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quintus Minucius replied that the province of Italy had fallen to the lot of both consuls and that he and his colleague had acted in accordance with a common policy and plan of campaign, and Gaius Cornelius added
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that the Boi, who were crossing the Po against him, to aid the Insubres and Cenomani, had been called away to defend their own homes when his colleague laid waste their towns and farms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To this the tribunes rejoined that they agreed that Gaius Cornelius had accomplished in the war results of such magnitude that there was no more question of his triumph than <pb id="p.339"/>there could be of paying honour to the immortal gods; &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> yet neither he nor any other citizen was so powerful in influence and resources that, when he had obtained a well-earned triumph, he could bestow the same unmerited honour upon a colleague who had the effrontery to demand it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quintus Minucius, they continued, had fought some unimportant battles in Liguria, hardly worthy of mention, and in Gaul had lost a great number of his men;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> they even mentioned by name Titus Iuventius and Gnaeus Ligurius, military tribunes of the fourth legion, who had fallen in the defeat along with many other brave men, citizens and allies. The surrender of small towns and villages had taken place, but this was fictitious, manufactured for the occasion, and without guarantees.<note>The <hi rend="italics">pignus</hi> is probably a guarantee, in the form of hostages, that the surrender was real.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These debates between the consuls and the tribunes continued for two days, but at last,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> overcome by the stubbornness of the tribunes, the consuls offered separate motions.<note>One may compare with the account given by the tribunes the narrative of Livy (XXXII. xxix. 5-xxxi. 5).</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Gaius Cornelius was granted a triumph with the consent of all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The people of Placentia and Cremona contributed to the applause given the consul, expressing their gratitude to him and testifying that they had been freed by him from the peril of siege, and many even that they had been rescued from slavery after they had been prisoners in the hands of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quintus Minucius, simply offering a motion, when he saw the whole senate opposed to him, declared that he would celebrate his triumph on the Alban Mount, both by virtue of his consular <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> and with the precedent of many distinguished men.<note>Minucius, having gone thus far, feels compelled to offer a formal motion that he be granted a triumph. Since this was clearly destined to fail, he awarded himself a triumph <hi rend="italics">in monte Albano,</hi> with which the senate could not interfere. So, in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>, Marcellus was refused a triumph, for technical reasons, but was granted an ovation and celebrated a triumph on the Alban Mount (XXVI. xxi. 2-6). See the notes on XXXI. xx. 5 and xlvii. 4 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Gaius Cornelius the <pb id="p.341"/>consul, while still in office, triumphed over the<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Insubres and Cenomani.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the procession were displayed many standards, much Gallic spoil was carried in captured carts, many noble Gauls were led before his chariot, and some say that Hamilcar<note>He was reported killed in XXXI. xxi. 18, but compare XXXII. xxx. 12.</note> the Carthaginian general was among them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but what especially attracted attention was the throng of colonists of Cremona and Placentia, following his car with caps of liberty<note>This was a conical cap worn by freedmen to mark their release from slavery and by the colonists here to signalize their rescue from captivity.</note> upon their heads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He carried in the triumph two hundred and thirty-seven thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of bronze, and seventy-nine thousand pieces of coined<note>These coins (<hi rend="italics">denarii</hi>) were stamped with a two-horse chariot.</note> silver; his gifts to the soldiers were seventy <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of bronze each, twice that amount to each centurion and thrice to each cavalryman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Quintus Minucius the consul triumphed over the Ligures and Gallic Boi on the Alban Mount. This triumph was of lesser note because of the place where it was held, the gossip about his exploits, and because all knew that the cost of it was taken, not duly requisitioned, from the treasury, but nevertheless in standards and wagons and spoils it almost equalled the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The amount of money too was about the same: the money carried amounted to two hundred and fifty-four thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of bronze, fifty-three thousand two hundred pieces of coined silver; his donatives to his soldiers were the same as his colleague's.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the triumph the consular elections were held. The choice fell on Lucius Furius Purpurio and Marcus Claudius Marcellus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Next day praetors were elected &mdash;Quintus Fabius Buteo, Tiberius Sempronius Longus, Quintus Minucius <pb id="p.343"/>Thermus, Manius Acilius Glabrio, Lucius Apustius<note type="margin">B.C. 197</note> Fullo, and Gaius Laelius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>About the end of the year a letter arrived from Titus Quinctius, stating that he had met King Philip in pitched battle in Thessaly and that the army of the enemy had been routed and put to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This letter was read by Marcus Sergius the praetor, first in the senate, and then, by order of the senate, in the assembly, and by reason of this victory a thanksgiving of five days was decreed. Soon after ambassadors arrived both from Titus Quinctius and from King Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Macedonians were conducted outside the city to the <hi rend="italics">villa publica,</hi><note>A residence in the Campus Martius, set aside for the entertainment of foreign ambassadors and other guests of the state.</note> and were there furnished quarters and hospitality, and were granted an audience before the senate in the temple of Bellona. Their message was brief, to the effect that the king promised to do whatever the senate should have ordered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the traditional manner, a commission of ten was created, with whose advice Titus Quinctius the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> commander should determine the conditions of peace for Philip, and a clause was added, providing that Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who as consuls had held the province of Macedonia, should be members of the commission.</p>

They were celebrated with greater splendour than at any other time, and were also viewed with greater joy because of the successes in war, and were thrice repeated entire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Plebeian Games were repeated seven times; Manius Acilius Glabrio and Gaius Laelius presided over these games,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> and out of the money received as fines<note>The aediles had police powers, including the right to impose fines: cf. xlii. 10 below.</note> they erected three bronze statues of Ceres and Liber and Libera.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Lucius Furius and Marcus Claudius Marcellus were -<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> duly inaugurated as consuls, and when the question of the provinces was brought up and the senate was for decreeing Italy to both consuls, they urged that they should draw lots for Macedonia along with Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Marcellus, who was more anxious for a province, by arguing that the peace was a make-believe and a fiction, and that the king would rebel once the army was withdrawn from there, unsettled the minds of the senators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And the consul might have won his point, had not Quintus Marcius Ralla and Gaius Atinius Labeo, tribunes of the people, announced that they would veto any action if the question was not first referred to the assembly whether they wished and ordered that peace be made with King Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This motion was then laid before the people convened on the Capitoline; all the thirty-five tribes voted <quote>aye.</quote><note><quote><hi rend="italics">Uti rogas</hi></quote> (<quote>as you propose</quote>) is the regular formula for an affirmative vote.</note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Italy was then decreed to both the consuls, with the same legions which the previous consuls had had, and it was further ordered that four new legions be recruited, two to guard the city, two to be sent wherever the senate directed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> in addition, that Titus Quinctius Flamininus should hold his province with the same legions: it appeared that the previous prorogation of his <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> was sufficient.<note>In XXXII. xxviii. 9 it is recorded that his <hi rend="italics">imperium</hi> was extended until the arrival of an authorized successor.</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetors then drew lots for their provinces: Lucius Apustius Fullo received the city jurisdiction, Manius Acilius Glabrio that between citizens and aliens, Quintus Fabius Buteo Farther Spain, Quintus Minucius Thermus
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nearer Spain, Gaius Laelius Sicily, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus Sardinia. A motion was passed that the consuls should transfer to

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Before either these praetors had left for a war which was virtually new, since this was the first time the Spaniards had taken up arms on their own account and without any Carthaginian army or commander, or even the consuls had departed from the city, they were <pb id="p.349"/>ordered to expiate the prodigies which were reported.

The arches were probably formal entrances to the temples.</note> and one in the Circus Maximus, and on these arches he placed gilded statues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These were the events of the winter.</p> <pb id="p.351"/>
				<p>Titus Quinctius was at this time wintering at<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> Elatia, and when the allies were making many requests of him, the Boeotians asked and were permitted to recover their fellow-countrymen who had served with Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius readily granted this, not because he thought they really deserved it, but because in view of the suspicions entertained about King Antiochus he was anxious to win sympathy for the Roman people among the Greek states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When these had been restored, it at once became clear how little gratitude he had won from the Boeotians; for they sent ambassadors to Philip, thanking him for restoring their countrymen, just as if that boon had been granted to them and not to Quinctius and the Romans,<note>If the text is right as it stands here, Livy implies that Quinctius transmitted to Philip, with his approval, the request, and that the Boeotians ignored his intercession on their behalf.</note> and at the next election they chose as Boeotarch<note>A typical Greek coinage, used as the title of the presiding magistrate of a Greek state.</note> one Brachyllas, for no other reason than that he had commanded the Boeotians who had served
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> with the king, passing over Zeuxippus and Pisistratus and others who had sponsored the alliance with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These men were incensed at this action for the moment and also fearful for the future:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> since such things happened with the Roman army encamped almost at the gates, what in the world would become of them when the Romans had gone back to Italy, and Philip, from his kingdom near by, was aiding his friends and
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> opposing those who had belonged to the other party?</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they had the Roman army close at hand, they determined to do away with Brachyllas, the principal partisan of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They chose for this an occasion when, after a public dinner, he was returning to his home in a drunken state and accompanied by a crowd of effeminate creatures who had been present as entertainers at the crowded dinner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <pb id="p.353"/>He was set upon by six armed men, of whom three<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> were Italians and three Aetolians, and killed. His companions scattered; there was a search and the noise of guards with torches hurrying through the whole city; the assassins escaped by the nearest gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At daybreak there was a full assembly in the theatre, as if at a meeting called in advance or summoned by the voice of a herald.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Openly the cry was that he had been killed by his own suite and the degenerates who were with him, but in their thoughts they pointed to Zeuxippus as instigator of the murder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For the time being, it was voted that the men who were with him should be arrested and questioned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While they were being examined, Zeuxippus, with ready courage, in order to divert suspicion from himself, came into the assembly, and declared that those men were mistaken who put the responsibility for so cruel a murder upon those eunuchs, and he put
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> forth many plausible arguments to that effect, and by these he created the assurance in some that, if he had felt any sense of guilt, he would never have exposed himself to the crowd or made any reference to this murder without being called upon to do so; others had no doubt that he was shamelessly trying to avert suspicion by volunteering to meet the charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A little later the innocent witnesses were tortured, and, knowing nothing themselves, mentioned Zeuxippus and Pisistratus, treating as evidence the general suspicion, but citing no proof to show that they had any knowledge of the affair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Zeuxippus, nevertheless, and a certain Stratonidas fled to Tanagra by night, fearing his own conscience more than the testimony of men who knew nothing about the crime; Pisistratus paid no attention to <pb id="p.355"/>the witnesses and remained in Thebes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Zeuxippus<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> had a slave, the go-between and agent in the whole affair, and fearing him as an informer, Pisistratus, by reason of that very fear, brought him forth to give evidence.<note>The meaning appears to be that Pisistratus, by advising Zeuxippus to do away with the slave, thereby brought about the very thing he was trying to prevent, viz., the giving of testimony by the slave, since the latter, learning the substance of the message, took steps to protect himself. This seems a more natural interpretation of <hi rend="italics">protraxit</hi> than to translate <quote>summoned,</quote> <quote>haled into court,</quote> or <quote>caused to turn state's evidence.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He sent word to Zeuxippus advising him to get rid of the slave who was his accomplice: he seemed to him, he said, less skilful in concealing an act than in performing it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The messenger had orders to deliver this letter to Zeuxippus as soon as possible, but being unable to find him at once, he gave it to that very same slave, whom he believed to be most faithful to his master of all the slaves, adding that it came from Pisistratus and contained information of the greatest interest to Zeuxippus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The slave, conscious of guilt, promised to deliver it at once, but opened it and having read it fled in terror to Thebes and laid his testimony before the magistrates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> And Zeuxippus, frightened at the flight of his slave, retired to Anthedon, thinking it a safer place of exile; Pisistratus and others were examined under torture and executed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This murder roused the Thebans and all the Boeotians to a frenzy of hatred against the Romans, for they thought that Zeuxippus, a leading man in the state, would not have committed such a crime without the cognizance of the Roman commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had neither army nor leader for a rebellion; turning to what was most like war, to brigandage, they cut off some soldiers in the taverns, others as they travelled about on various errands during the winter season.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some on the public highways were lured by decoys into planned <pb id="p.357"/>ambushes, some were brought by trickery to deserted<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> inns and killed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> finally, such crimes were committed not only from hatred, but also from greed of booty, because the soldiers who were usually travelling on business had money in their purses on their journeys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While at first the losses were small, but then grew larger day by day, all Boeotia began to have a bad name, and the soldiers were more afraid to leave camp than if they were in hostile territory. Then Quinctius sent agents among the cities to inquire into the charges of robbery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Most of the murders, it was found, had been committed around the Copaic swamp; there bodies were dug out of the muck and drawn from the marshes, with stones or jugs fastened to them so that the weight might drag them deeper into the mire; many other crimes were found to have been committed at Acraephia and Coronea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius at first ordered the criminals to be delivered to him by the Boeotians and a fine paid of five hundred talents for the five hundred soldiers, for so many had been killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the cities obeyed neither order, but merely made the verbal excuse that no act had been committed with official sanction, having sent ambassadors to Athens and into Achaea, to call the allies to witness that he was about to wage lawful and rightful war upon the Boeotians, he
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> ordered Appius Claudius to proceed against Acraephia with part of the forces and himself with another detachment invested Coronea, after first devastating the country through which both columns marched from Elatia. The Boeotians, dismayed by this calamity, when the whole region was filled with terror and flight, sent ambassadors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When these were not admitted to the camp, the <pb id="p.359"/>Achaeans and Athenians arrived. The pleas of the<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> Achaeans had more weight, because, if they did not obtain peace for the Boeotians, they had decided to join the war upon them.<note>This is the probable meaning, though the Latin is obscure.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Through the Achaeans an opportunity was gained for the Boeotians to visit and address the Roman, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> they were ordered to hand over the criminals and pay thirty talents by way of fine, and were granted peace and the discontinuance of the siege.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days later the ten commissioners arrived from Rome, and with their approval peace was granted to Philip on these terms:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that all the Greek cities which were in Europe or in Asia should enjoy their liberty and laws; that, whatever cities had been under the sway of Philip, from these Philip should withdraw his garrisons and should hand them over to the Romans, free of his troops, before the time of the Isthmian Games;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that he should withdraw also from the following cities in Asia: Euromum and Pedasa and Bargyliae and Iasus and Myrina and Abydus and Thasos and Perinthus (for it was determined that these too should be free); that, regarding the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> liberation of the Ciani, Quinctius should write to Prusias, king of Bithynia, the decision of the senate and the ten commissioners;<note>In XXXII. xxxiv. 6 Philip asserts that he aided Prusias to capture this town; Polybius (XV. xxii), on the other hand, says that Philip took it. Livy's accounts are at least consistent with one another.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that Philip should turn over to the Romans the prisoners and deserters, all his warships except five, and one royal galley of almost unmanageable size, which was propelled by sixteen tiers of oars; that he should have a maximum of five thousand soldiers and no elephants at all;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that he should wage no war outside Macedonia without the permission of the senate;<note>The last two clauses are omitted by Polybius (XVIII. xliv), and seem not to have been observed.</note> that he should pay to the Roman people an indemnity of one thousand talents, half at <pb id="p.361"/>once
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and half in ten annual instalments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Valerius<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> Antias states that a tribute of four thousand pounds of silver annually for ten years was imposed upon the king; Claudius fixes the payments at four thousand two hundred pounds annually for thirty years and twenty thousand pounds immediately.<note>The talent is calculated to be the equivalent of eighty Roman pounds, so that the figures here given vary a good deal. Livy's account is that of Polybius (XVIII. xliv).</note> The same writer mentions an explicit provision that he should not wage war with Eumenes, son of Attalus &mdash;he was the new king there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Hostages were taken to insure performance, among them Demetrius, the son of Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Valerius Antias adds that the island of Aegina and the elephants were presented as a gift to Attalus, who was absent, that the Rhodians were given Stratonicea and other cities in Caria which Philip had
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> held, and the Athenians the islands of Paros, Imbros, Delos, and Scyros.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While all the Greek cities approved this settlement, only the Aetolians with secret grumblings criticized the decision of the ten commissioners:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> mere words had been trimmed up with the empty show of liberty; why were some cities delivered to the Romans without being named, others specified and ordered to be free without such delivery, unless the purpose was that
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> those which were in Asia, being more secure by reason of their remoteness, should be set free, but those which were in Greece, not being named, should become Roman property, to wit, Corinth and Chalcis and Oreus along with Eretria and Demetrias?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their complaint was not altogether groundless. For there was some uncertainty with respect to Corinth and Chalcis and Demetrias, because in the decree of the senate, under which the ten commissioners were sent from Rome, the other cities of Greece and Asia were beyond question set free, but regarding these <pb id="p.363"/>threecities the commissioners were
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> instructed to take such<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> action as the public interest should have proved to demand, in accordance with the general good and their own sense of honour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was King Antiochus, who, there was no doubt, would invade Europe as soon as his forces seemed adequate; they did not wish to leave these cities, so favourably located, open to his occupancy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius with the ten commissioners moved from Elatia to Anticyra and thence to Corinth. There plans for the liberation of Greece were discussed almost every day at meetings of the ten commissioners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Quinctius urged repeatedly that all Greece should be set free, if they wished to stop the muttering of the Aetolians and to create genuine affection and respect for the Roman name among all the Greeks, and if they wished to convince them that they had crossed the sea to liberate Greece and not to transfer dominion from Philip to themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The others said nothing opposed to this as regards the freedom of the cities, but they believed it safer
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for the Greeks themselves to remain for a while under the protection of Roman garrisons than to receive Antiochus as lord in place of Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Finally, this decision was reached: Corinth should be given over to the Achaeans, a garrison, however, to be retained in Acrocorinthus; Chalcis and Demetrias should be held until the anxiety about Antiochus should have passed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The appointed time of the Isthmian Games was at hand, a spectacle always, even on other occasions, attended by crowds, on account of the fondness, native to the race, for exhibitions in which there are trials of skill in every variety of art as well as of strength and swiftness of foot;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> moreover, they came because, on account of the favourable situation of the place, lying <pb id="p.365"/>between the two opposite seas and furnishing mankind<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> with abundance of all wares, the market was a meeting-place for Asia and Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But at this time they had assembled from all quarters not only for the usual purposes, but especially because they were consumed with wonder what thenceforth the state of Greece would be, and what their own condition; they not only had their own silent thoughts, some believing one thing and others another, but discussed openly what the Romans would do; almost no one was convinced that they would withdraw from all Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They had taken their seats at the games and the herald with the trumpeter, as is the custom, had come forth into the midst of the arena, where the games are regularly opened with a ritual chant, and proclaiming silence with a trumpet-call, the herald read the decree:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>The Roman senate and Titus Quinctius, <hi rend="italics">imperator,</hi> having conquered King Philip and the Macedonians, declare to be free, independent, and subject to their own laws, the Corinthians, the Phocians, all the Locrians, the island of Euboea, the Magnesians, the Thessalians, the Perrhaebians, and the Phthiotic Achaeans.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had named all the states which had been subject to King Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the herald's voice was heard there was rejoicing greater than men could grasp in its entirety. They could scarce believe that they had heard aright, and they looked at one another marvelling as at the empty vision of a dream; they asked their neighbours what concerned each one, unwilling to trust the evidence of their own ears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The herald was recalled, each one desiring not only to hear but to behold the man who brought the tidings of his freedom, and again the herald read the same decree.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then, when the ground <pb id="p.367"/>for their joy was certain, such a storm of applause<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> began and was so often repeated<note>Valerius Maximus (IV. viii. 5) naively says that the loud and prolonged shouting produced air-pockets into which the birds flying above the arena dropped!</note> that it was easily apparent that of all blessings none pleases a throng more than liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The contests were then rapidly finished, no man's eyes or thoughts being fixed upon the sight; joy alone had so completely replaced their perception of all other delightful things.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the games were over, almost everyone rushed towards the Roman commander, so that he
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> was endangered by the crowd that rushed to one place, desiring to draw near him, to touch his hand, and showering garlands and chaplets upon him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But he was only about thirty-three years old, and both the vigour of youth and the joy he felt at so remarkable a reward of fame gave him strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor did the rejoicing spend itself at once, but was renewed for many days in thoughts and expressions of gratitude: there was one people in the world which would fight for others' liberties at
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> its own cost, to its own peril and with
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> its own toil, not limiting its guaranties of freedom to its neighbours, to men of the immediate vicinity, or to countries that lay close at hand, but ready to cross the sea that there might be no unjust empire anywhere and that everywhere justice, right, and law might prevail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> By the single voice of a herald, they said, all the cities of Greece and Asia had been set free;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> to conceive hopes of any such thing as this required a bold mind; to bring it to pass was the proof of immense courage and good fortune as well.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the Isthmian Games Quinctius and the ten commissioners received the embassies from the kings and states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> First of all, the representatives of King Antiochus were summoned. As they made about the same deceptive speech that they had <pb id="p.369"/>previously made at Rome, no ambiguous answer was<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> now given, as on the former
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> occasion, when the future was uncertain and Philip was unconquered, but clear warning was given him, to withdraw from the cities in Asia which had belonged to King Philip or King Ptolemy, to keep his hands off the free states and molest none of them in war: all the Greek cities everywhere must enjoy both peace and liberty. Before all, he was warned not to cross to Europe in person nor to send troops there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After the departure of the king's ambassadors, a council of the cities and states
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> began, and its work was accomplished the more speedily because the decisions of the ten commissioners were addressed to the states by name. To the Orestae &mdash;that is a tribe of the Macedonians &mdash;their own laws were restored, because they had been the first to revolt against the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Magnesians, Perrhaebians, and Dolopians were likewise declared free. The Thessalian people, in addition to receiving their liberty, were granted the Phthiotic Achaeans with the exception of Phthiotic Thebes and Pharsalus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Aetolians demanded that Pharsalus and Leucas should be restored to them in accordance with the treaty, and their petition was referred to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Phocians and the Locrians were annexed to them, as they had formerly been, the sanction of a decree having been added, Corinth and Triphylia and Heraea &mdash;this
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> too is a city in the Peloponnesus &mdash;were given back to the Achaeans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Oreus and Eretria the ten commissioners gave to King Eumenes, the son of Attalus, despite the protests of Quinctius; this one question was referred to the decision of the senate; the senate bestowed freedom upon these states, with the addition of Carystus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Lychnidus <pb id="p.371"/>and the Parthini were given to Pleuratus; both of<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> these Illyrian states had been under the control of Philip. They directed Amynander to hold the forts which he had taken from Philip during the period of the war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the dismissal of the council the ten commissioners, dividing up the tasks among themselves, went their several ways, each to liberate the cities in his own territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publius Lentulus went to Bargyliae, Lucius Stertinius to Hephaestia and Thasos and the cities of Thrace, Publius Villius and Lucius Terentius to King Antiochus, Gnaeus Cornelius to Philip.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He, after performing the less important tasks assigned him, asked the king whether he was disposed to listen to advice that was both sound and profitable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the king replied that he would receive it gratefully, if he suggested anything advantageous to him, Cornelius
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> urged him earnestly, now that he had been granted peace, to send ambassadors to Rome to ask for a treaty of alliance and friendship, lest, if Antiochus made any disturbance, he might
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> seem to have dallied and to have watched for an opportunity to revolt. The meeting with Philip took place at Thessalian Tempe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he had replied that he would at once send ambassadors, Cornelius went to Thermopylae, where a full meeting of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> states of Greece is held on stated days &mdash;they call this the Pylaic council;<note>For the Pylaic Council and its possible identity with the Amphictyonic Council, see XXXI. xxxii, 3 and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Aetolians especially he advised to abide resolutely and faithfully by the alliance with the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Some of the Aetolian leaders complained mildly that the attitude of the Romans towards their people was not the same after their victory as it had been during the war, others more
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> loudly reproached and taunted them, saying <pb id="p.373"/>that Philip could not have been conquered without<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> the Aetolians, and, more than that, the Romans could not even have crossed to Greece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman, after declining to reply to this, lest the argument degenerate into a quarrel, said that they would obtain full justice if they appealed to Rome. Therefore, on his suggestion, ambassadors were decided upon. This was the end of the war with Philip.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While these events were taking place in Greece, Macedonia, and Asia, a slave insurrection rendered Etruria almost a battle-field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Manius Acilius Glabrio, the praetor exercising jurisdiction in cases between citizens and aliens, was sent with one of the two city legions to investigate and suppress it, and destroyed part of them, cutting them off in detail,<note>This is a guess at the meaning of the lost text.</note> part of them by encountering them in a body;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> many of them were killed and many captured; some, who had been the instigators of the revolt, he scourged and crucified, others he turned over to their masters.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The consuls departed to their provinces. As Marcellus was entering the territory of the Boi, and was pitching camp on a certain hill, his troops being exhausted by building roads all the day, a chieftain of the Boi, Corolamus by name, fell upon him with a large force and killed about three thousand of his men;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> some distinguished men fell in that surprise attack, among them Titus Sempronius Gracchus and Marcus Iunius Silanus, commanders of allied detachments, and Marcus Ogulnius and Publius Claudius, military tribunes of the second legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The camp, however, was strongly fortified and stubbornly held by the Romans, when the enemy, elated by their victory, had assaulted it in vain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For some days after that he remained in the same camp, while he was treating the wounded <pb id="p.375"/>and restoring the courage of his men after so serious<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> an alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Boi &mdash;a people intolerant of the tiresomeness of delay &mdash;gradually dispersed to their forts and towns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Marcellus quickly crossed the Po and led the legions into the district of Comum, where the Insubres were encamped after calling the Comenses to arms. The Gauls, encouraged by the success of the Boi a few days before, attacked while still in march formation, and their first charge was so vigorous that it drove in the Roman front line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When Marcellus observed this and feared that once broken they would be routed, he threw in a cohort of the Marsi and then sent all the squadrons of the Latin cavalry against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their first and second charges dulled the edge of the enemy's spirited attack, and the rest of the Roman line, with renewed courage, first resisted and then charged fiercely. The Gauls did not continue the contest longer, but turned and fled in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Valerius Antias writes that more than forty thousand men
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> perished in that battle, and that eighty-seven standards were taken and seven hundred and thirty-two wagons and many necklaces of gold, one of which, of great weight, Claudius says was deposited in the temple on the Capitoline as a gift to Jupiter. The Gallic camp was captured and plundered that day, and the town of Comum was taken a few days later.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> After that, twenty-eight strongholds went over to the consul. This question, too, is debated by the writers, whether the consul led his army against the Boi
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> first or the Insubres, and whether the victory wiped out the memory of the defeat or the success gained at Comum was marred by the defeat among the Boi.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During this period of alternating fortunes the other consul Lucius Furius Purpurio <pb id="p.377"/>invaded the territory of the Boi by way of the <hi rend="italics">tribus</hi>-<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> <hi rend="italics">Sapinia.</hi><note>See XXXI. ii. 6 and note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he was already approaching the fortified town of Mutilum, fearing that he would be cut off by the Boi and Insubres together, he led the army back by the same way he had come, and after a long roundabout march through country that was open, and therefore safe, he joined his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thenceforth with united forces they penetrated first the Boian territory as far as Felsina, plundering as they went.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This city and all the forts in the neighbourhood and all the Boi except the men of military age, who were in arms in the hope of plunder &mdash;they had at this time retired into the pathless forests &mdash;surrendered. The army was then led against the Ligures.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Boi, with the intention of falling suddenly upon the Roman column, which would not be under strict discipline, since the Boi would be believed to be far away, followed by secret paths.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Failing to overtake them, and suddenly crossing the Po in boats, when they had laid waste the country of the Laevi and Libui, and were returning from there loaded with the spoils of the country along the edges of the Ligurian territory, they encountered the Roman column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A battle began, more sudden and furious than if they had clashed with minds prepared to fight at a predetermined time and place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There it was apparent how much stimulus passion can apply to courage; for the Romans fought with so much greater desire for slaughter than for victory that they left the enemy hardly a messenger to tell of the defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> By reason of these achievements, when the letters of the consuls were received in Rome, the senate decreed a thanksgiving of three days. A little later the consul Marcellus arrived in Rome, and was voted a <pb id="p.379"/>triumph with the complete agreement of the senators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> -<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> While still in office he triumphed over the Ligures and Comenses; the hope of a triumph over the Boi he left to his colleague, because he personally had suffered defeat at the hands of that people, but had been victorious when associated with his colleague.<note>There is no indication that Furius received a triumph, and this fact has been used to discredit the account of his earlier triumph. See the note to XXXI. xlvii. 4 above.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Many spoils of the enemy were transported in captured carts, and many standards; three hundred and twenty thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> of bronze and two hundred and thirty-four thousand pieces of coined silver were carried.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same year King Antiochus, after wintering at Ephesus, tried to coerce all the cities of Asia into acknowledging the sovereignty which he had once exercised over them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And he saw that the others, either because they were situated on level ground, or because they did not trust their walls or their weapons or their fighting men, would readily accept his yoke;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Zmyrna<note>This spelling is attested by the Livy MSS. and by MSS. in general.</note> and Lampsacus were contending for their independence, and there was danger that if they were allowed what they demanded, other cities in Aeolis and Ionia would follow the example of Zmyrna, those on the Hellespont, of Lampsacus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He therefore sent troops from Ephesus to invest Zmyrna and ordered his troops at Abydus to leave only a small guard there and march to attack Lampsacus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor did he seek only to frighten them by this show of force, but also through the mouths of his agents by courteous address and mild reproach for their rashness and stubbornness, to create the hope that they would soon have what they desired, but only when it was clear both
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> to them and to everyone else that their liberty had been granted by the king <pb id="p.381"/>and not attained through mere grasping at opportunity.<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To this they responded that Antiochus should be neither surprised nor angry if they were not inclined to submit with indifference to their hope of liberty being deferred. At the beginning of spring Antiochus himself left Ephesus with his fleet and sailed for the Hellespont and ordered his land forces to be transported from Abydus to Chersonesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When he had united his army and navy at Madytus, a city in the Chersonesus, since the people had closed their gates, he surrounded the walls with armed men; and the town surrendered as he was on the point of moving forward his engines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Fear of the same fate caused the people of Sestus and other towns of the Chersonesus to yield. Thence he proceeded with all his forces, naval and military alike, to Lysimachia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he had found it almost entirely abandoned and in ruins (the Thracians had captured, plundered, and burned it a few years before), he was seized by the desire of rebuilding a city so famed and so advantageously situated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Therefore he undertook everything at once;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> to rebuild the houses and walls, to ransom some of the Lysimachenses who were in slavery, to seek out and bring back some of them who had scattered in flight through the Hellespont and Chersonesus, to attract new colonists by the prospects of advantage held out to them, and to populate the city in every possible manner;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> at the same time, in order to dispel their fear of the Thracians, he set out in person with
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> half his land forces to devastate the neighbouring parts of Thrace, leaving the rest and all the naval allies engaged in the work of rebuilding the city.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this time, too, Lucius Cornelius, sent by the senate to arbitrate the difference between the <pb id="p.383"/>kings, Antiochus and Ptolemy, stopped at Selymbria, -<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> and some of the ten commissioners, Publius Lentulus from Bargyliae and Publius Villius and Lucius Terentius from Thasos, came to Lysimachia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Also, Lucius Cornelius from Selymbria and Antiochus from Thrace arrived there a few days later.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was a preliminary meeting with the ambassadors and then a kindly and hospitable reception, but when the debate over their instructions and the present situation in Asia began, there were displays of temper.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans did not conceal the fact that his conduct, from the time he set sail from Syria, was displeasing to the senate, and they also deemed it right that all the cities which had belonged to Ptolemy should be restored to him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> for, as regards the cities formerly held by Philip, which Antiochus had taken the opportunity to seize while Philip was
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> engaged in the Roman war, they regarded it as surely unendurable that the Romans should have suffered so many toils and dangers for so many years on land and sea and that Antiochus should carry off the prizes of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, granting that the Romans pretended to ignore his advance into Asia as an act which did not concern them, what then? What of the fact that he was even then crossing into Europe with all his fleets and armies, and how far did that differ from an open declaration of war on the Romans? He, of course, would deny it, even if he crossed into Italy, but the Romans would not wait for him to have the power to do this.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Antiochus replied that he was surprised that the Romans were making such diligent inquiry into what King Antiochus should do or how far he should advance by land or sea,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and that they <pb id="p.385"/>did not see that Asia was no concern of theirs, and<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> that they had no more right to ask what Antiochus was doing in Asia than Antiochus had to ask what the Roman people was doing in Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So far as Ptolemy was concerned, the loss of whose cities was a subject of complaint, he already had a treaty of friendship with Ptolemy and was taking steps which would soon lead to a tie of relationship as well.<note>In <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> (XXXV. xiii. 4) Ptolemy married the daughter of Antiochus: preliminary arrangements for this may have been under way at this time. It may be noted that just as Antiochus silenced the Rhodian ambassadors by quoting to them the complimentary speeches of Rome (see xx. 8 above), so he now silences the Romans by quoting to them a treaty of which they, apparently, knew nothing before and which weakened their case a good deal. Open covenants would have saved the free-speaking Romans a good deal of embarrassment in the east.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had not even taken advantage of Philip's ill fortune to seize and plunder, nor had he entered Europe to threaten the Romans; but all the country which had once been the kingdom of Lysimachus,<note>One of Alexander's generals, who had carved out a kingdom for himself in this region. He was defeated by Seleucus, founder of the Seleucid dynasty, to which Antiochus belonged, in <date value="-281">281 B.C.</date> (XXXIV. lviii. 5; Justin XVII. 1).</note> and which, on his defeat, had passed with his other possessions into the hands of Seleucus by right of conquest, he considered his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While his forefathers were busy with the disposition of other matters, possession of some of these towns had been seized, first by Ptolemy,<note>See xxxviii. 1 above.</note> then by Philip,<note>See XXXI. xvi. 4. Antiochus had apparently suffered along with Ptolemy from the depredations committed by Philip under the authority of the treaty which he had made with Antiochus to plunder the young Ptolemy (see the Introductory Note).</note> usurping the property-rights of others.<note>In XXXV. xvi. the argument turns on the Roman legal doctrine of <hi rend="italics">possessio</hi> (the unchallenged occupancy of a piece of property for a specified period), which under certain conditions could confer a valid title. Antiochus means that Ptolemy and Philip had violently interrupted his own <hi rend="italics">possessio</hi> and had thus robbed him of property which he was trying to recover. The propriety of attributing to Antiochus this much acquaintance with Roman law might be questioned.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Who could doubt that Lysimachus had been lord of the Chersonesus and the neighbouring parts of Thrace which are around Lysimachia? He himself had come only to recover his ancient possessions and to found anew Lysimachia, <pb id="p.387"/>destroyed by the attack of the Thracians, that his son<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> Seleucus might make it the capital of his kingdom.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They had spent some days in such debates when an unauthenticated rumour that King Ptolemy was dead caused no conclusion to be reached by their conversations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For each party pretended not to have heard it, and Lucius Cornelius, to whom had been entrusted the embassy to the two kings, Antiochus and Ptolemy, requested an adjournment of a short time, that he might visit Ptolemy, his purpose being that he might arrive in Egypt before any revolution should occur while
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the throne was changing hands, while Antiochus believed that Egypt would be his if he should have succeeded in gaining possession of it at this time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So he dismissed the Romans, leaving his son Seleucus with the army to rebuild Lysimachia according to plan, and himself sailed for Ephesus with his entire fleet, sending ambassadors to Quinctius to say, with a view to creating confidence, that the king would do nothing to modify their alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Skirting the coast of Asia, he came to Lycia, and learning at Patara that Ptolemy was alive, he gave up his design of sailing to Egypt;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> nevertheless, he set out for Cyprus, and when he had passed the promontory of Chelidoniae, he was delayed for a while in Pamphylia near the mouth of the Eurymedon river by a mutiny among his rowers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he resumed his voyage and was off the mouth of the river which they call Sarus, a terrific storm almost overwhelmed him and his whole fleet. Many ships were wrecked, many driven ashore, many so swallowed up in the sea that no one escaped to the shore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A large number of men perished, not only rowers and the nameless mass of soldiers, but some of the nobles, <pb id="p.389"/>friends of the king. Collecting the remnants left<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> from the wreck, and being in no condition to try an expedition to Cyprus, he returned to Seleucia with a train less rich than that with which he had set out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There he ordered the ships to be hauled up on land &mdash;for winter was now at hand &mdash;and went into winter quarters at Antioch. The affairs of the kings were in this state.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At Rome, in this year for the first time, the <hi rend="italics">tresviri epulones</hi><note>A college of three (later seven) priests, entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the feasts of the gods (see note on XXXI. viii. 2). Election of members now replaces the older method of co-optation, under which each college filled vacancies in its own ranks.</note> were elected &mdash;Gaius Licinius Lucullus, tribune of the people, who had proposed the law for their election, Publius Manlius, and Publius Porcius Laeca. These triumvirs, like the pontiffs, were given the right to wear the <hi rend="italics">toga praetexta.</hi><note>The toga worn by the ordinary citizen was of white or natural-coloured wool. This purple-bordered toga was reserved to boys who had not reached manhood (at which time they put on the ordinary toga) and to civil and religious dignitaries.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But a bitter struggle broke out that year between the whole body of priests and the city quaestors,<note>These were minor magistrates responsible for the care of public funds.</note> Quintus Fabius Labeo and Lucius Aurelius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Money was needed because it had been decided to pay to the private lenders the last instalment of the money contributed for the war.<note>See XXXI. xiii. 2-9 and the note.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The quaestors demanded it of the augurs and pontiffs because they had not paid the taxes during the war. The priests appealed in vain to the tribunes of the people, and the money was collected for the whole period in which it had not been paid.<note>Exemption from the payment of taxes seems not to have been a prerogative of the priesthoods. Perhaps in the confusion of the war period, they had for a time evaded payment, and had continued to do so after the war closed. At this time collection in full of all back-taxes was made: this seems to be the implication of the words <hi rend="italics">omnium annorum.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the same year two pontiffs died and new ones were appointed in their place, the consul Marcus Marcellus to replace Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus, who had fallen while serving as praetor in Spain, and Lucius <pb id="p.391"/>Valerius Flaccus in place of Marcus Cornelius Cethegus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> -<note type="margin">B.C. 196</note> Quintus Fabius Maximus the augur also died while still a young man, before he had held any public office, and this year no augur was chosen in his stead.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Marcus Marcellus the consul presided over the consular elections, and Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius Cato were announced as successful. Then the praetors were chosen, Gnaeus Manlius Volso, Appius Claudius Nero, Publius Porcius Laeca, Gaius Fabricius Luscinus, Gaius Atinius Labeo, and Publius Manlius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In that year the curule aediles, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and Gaius Flaminius, distributed to the people one million measures of grain at two <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> per measure. The Sicilians had brought this to Rome as a mark of respect to Gaius Flaminius himself and to his father; Flaminius had shared the credit for it with his colleague. The Roman Games were celebrated splendidly and were thrice repeated entire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The plebeian aediles, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Gaius Scribonius Curio, brought many grazers<note>They had probably rented public pasture lands but had trespassed on land which they had not leased.</note> to trial before the people; three of them were convicted, and out of the money paid by them as fines they built a temple to Faunus on the Island.<note>The island in the Tiber was in general sacred to Aesculapius (cf. X. xlvii. 7 for the introduction of this divinity), but other temples were erected there (XXXIV. liii. 7).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Plebeian Games were repeated for two days and a banquet held
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> on the occasion of the games.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus -<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Porcius Cato the consuls had, on the Ides of March, on which day they were inaugurated, laid before the senate the question of the provinces,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Fathers voted it as their decision that, since so great a war was raging in Spain that it now needed a consular commander and a consular army, the consuls should either arrange between themselves or cast lots for <pb id="p.393"/>Nearer Spain and Italy as their provinces;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> whichever received Spain as his province should take with him two legions, fifteen thousand of the allies of the Latin confederacy and eight hundred cavalry, and should take with him twenty war-ships;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that the other consul should recruit two legions; that the province of Gaul could be adequately defended with these, since the spirits of the Insubres and the Boi had been broken the previous year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Cato received Spain in the drawing and Valerius Italy. Then the praetors received their assignments: Gaius Fabricius Luscinus the city jurisdiction, Gaius Atinius Labeo that between citizens and aliens, Gnaeus Manlius Volso Sicily, Appius Claudius Nero Farther Spain, Publius Porcius Laeca Pisae, that he might be in the rear of the Ligures, and Publius Manlius was assigned to Nearer Spain as assistant to the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Since not only Antiochus and the Aetolians were causes of concern, but now, in addition, Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, the authority of Titus Quinctius was extended for a year, with the command of two legions. If any addition to these forces should be needed, the consuls were directed to enlist them and send them to Macedonia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Appius Claudius was permitted to enrol two thousand infantry and two hundred new cavalry in addition to the legion which Quintus Fabius had commanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> An equal number of new infantry and cavalry was authorized for Publius Manlius in Nearer Spain, and he was given the same legion which had served under the praetor Quintus Minucius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Also, to Publius Porcius Laeca were assigned ten thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry for service in Etruria in the neighbourhood of Pisae. In Sardinia, the command of Tiberius Sempronius Longus was extended.</p> <pb id="p.395"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the provinces had been thus assigned, -<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> the consuls, before they left the city, were instructed, in accordance with the decision of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> priests, to conduct the ceremony of the <quote>sacred spring</quote> which the praetor Aulus Cornelius Mammula had vowed by decree of the senate and vote of the people, in the consulship of Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius. The performance took place twenty-one years after the vow.<note>This vow taken in <date value="-217">217 B.C.</date> and its text are found in XXII. ix. 10-x. 6 (the name of the praetor given there is M. Aemilius, instead of A. Cornelius Mammula. Such confusions are too frequent in Livy or in the MSS.). A briefer description of the <hi rend="italics">ver sacrum</hi> is given also in XXXIV. xliv. 3 below, where reference is made to the repetition of the celebration because of flaws in the performance of <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date> The essence of the rite is the dedication to the gods of all animals born within a designated period in the <quote>spring.</quote></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At this time Gaius Claudius Pulcher, son of Appius, was chosen augur in place of Quintus Fabius Maximus, who had died the year before, and was installed in office.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When everyone wondered why the war which Spain had begun was receiving so little attention, a letter arrived from Quintus Minucius, saying that he had fought successfully in a pitched battle near the town of Turda with Budares and Baesadines, the Spanish commanders; that twelve thousand of the enemy had been killed, Budares their general captured, and the rest routed and put to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When this letter was read, less fear was felt with respect to Spain, where a great war had been anticipated; all their anxieties, especially after the return of the ten commissioners, were centred on King Antiochus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These reported what had been done in the matter of Philip and on what terms peace had been granted, and gave warning that a war of no less magnitude was threatened by Antiochus: he had already invaded Europe with a huge fleet and a splendid army, and if an idle hope &mdash;sprung
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> from an idler rumour &mdash;of invading Egypt, had not diverted his attention, Greece would presently be flaming with war; for not even the Aetolians would remain quiet, a people both naturally restless and ill-disposed towards the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was, <pb id="p.397"/>they said, another great evil in Greece, clinging to its<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> vitals, Nabis, now tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, but soon, if it were permitted, to be tyrant of all Greece, the equal in greed and cruelty of all the tyrants known to fame;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> if he were allowed to hold Argos, which dominates Peloponnesus almost like a citadel, when the Roman armies were withdrawn to Italy, the liberation of Greece from Philip would prove to have been in vain, and in place of a king who was at least far distant, if nothing else could be said for him, they would have as master a tyrant close at hand.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they heard words like these from men whose opinion carried such weight, especially on matters which they had investigated personally, the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> more important question, that which concerned Antiochus, called more for urgent action, but since the king for some reason or other had gone back to Syria, the question of the tyrant was rather one for debate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After it had long been debated whether there seemed sufficient cause for declaring war, or whether the decision should be left to Titus Quinctius, they gave him the responsibility of taking such action, in the case of Nabis the Lacedaemonian, as would be to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> advantage of the state, thinking that such action, whether accelerated or retarded, was not of so very great importance to the general interest of the state;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> it was more to be considered what Hannibal and the Carthaginians would do if war should break out with King Antiochus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The members of the faction opposed to Hannibal kept writing, each to his own friends among the leaders at Rome, that Hannibal had been sending messengers and letters to Antiochus and receiving from the king his secret agents; that, as some wild <pb id="p.399"/>beasts can in no wise be tamed, so this man's temper<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> was violent and implacable;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that he complained that a nation wasted away in a state of peace and could be aroused from its stupor only by the din of arms. The recollection of the recent war, not more waged than caused by this one man, made these accounts seem plausible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had, moreover, provoked the wrath of the leading citizens of Carthage by his recent conduct.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The order of judges<note>It consisted of about one hundred members.</note> at that time was in control in Carthage, principally because the same men were judges for life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The property, reputation, and life of every citizen were in their hands. A man who offended one of the judges made enemies of them all, nor was there any lack of persons to bring accusations before hostile judges.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Under their administration, marked by such violence &mdash;for they did not use their excessive wealth in the spirit of a free state &mdash; Hannibal had been elected praetor and summoned a quaestor to report to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The quaestor ignored the order; for he belonged to the opposing faction, and since he would be promoted from the quaestorship to the all-powerful order of judges, he already displayed arrogance proportioned to the power he would presently exercise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hannibal, thinking this conduct highly improper, sent a messenger to arrest the quaestor, and haling him before the assembly, assailed him and not less the order of judges, in comparison with whose pride of place and power the laws were as nought, and the magistrates as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he saw that his speech was well received, and that their haughty spirits menaced the liberty of the lowest classes also, he immediately proposed and enacted a law, that judges should be elected for one year <pb id="p.401"/>each, and that no one should be a judge for two consecutive<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But whatever influence he gained in this way with the commons, to the same extent he roused the animosity of a large party among the nobility.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Moreover, by another act he served the public interest but roused personal enmities against himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The public revenues were being partly wasted through carelessness, partly appropriated as their booty and spoils of office by some of the prominent men and magistrates, and money to pay the tribute to the Romans each successive year was lacking, and a heavy assessment seemed to threaten the citizens.<note>In <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date> (XXXVI. iv. 7), Carthage offered to pay at once all the remaining instalments on her indemnity. It might be inferred that Hannibal's reforms had proved successful.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Hannibal had investigated the revenues, how much was collected as taxes on land and as duty at the ports, for what purposes it was spent, how much the ordinary expenses of the state required, and how
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> much embezzlement took from the treasury, he asserted in the assembly that the state would be rich enough, if it collected the revenues not otherwise used and omitted the assessment on individual citizens, to pay its debt to the Romans, and this assertion he was able to make good.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But now the men whom embezzlement from the treasury had maintained for many years, as if they were being robbed of their property instead of being made to give up the profits of their thefts, in passion and anger tried to bring upon Hannibal the wrath of the Romans, who were themselves seeking an excuse for venting their hatred upon him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So, although Publius Scipio Africanus resisted this tendency for a long time, urging that it was undignified for the Roman people to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> become parties to the animosities of Hannibal's accusers, to lend the support of official prestige to party strife at Carthage, and, not satisfied with having <pb id="p.403"/>conquered Hannibal in battle, acting, so to speak, as<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> his prosecutors, to assert good faith and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> bring charges against him,<note>The legal procedures referred to in technical language are: <hi rend="italics">subscribere##:</hi> to sign one's name as seconding a prosecution brought by another without necessarily participating in the action; <hi rend="italics">calumniam iurare:</hi> to swear that a prosecutor is acting in good faith; <hi rend="italics">nomen deferre:</hi> to report the defendant's name to a magistrate as one who should be prosecuted on some charge.</note> they at length prevailed upon the senate to send an embassy to Carthage which should lay charges before their senate that Hannibal was conspiring with King Antiochus to foment war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Three ambassadors were sent &mdash;Gnaeus Servilius, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and Quintus Terentius Culleo. When they arrived in Carthage, on the advice of Hannibal's enemies, they caused the answer to be given to those who asked what their errand was, that they had come to put an end to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the disputes which had arisen between the Carthaginians and Masinissa, king of the Numidians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This was generally accepted; but Hannibal did not fail to see that he and he alone was the object of the Romans' attack and that peace had been granted to the Carthaginians with the reservation that with him alone there should be implacable war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So he decided to give way to the emergency and his fate; and having already made all his preparations in advance for his departure, he spent that day in the forum in order to avert suspicion and at dusk, clad in his ordinary dress, he made his way to the gate with two companions who were ignorant of his design.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had found the horses ready in the place he had ordered them to be, he crossed by night the territory which they call Byzacium and arrived next day at his castle on the coast between Acylla and Thapsus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There a ship was waiting for him, manned and equipped. Thus Hannibal left Africa, bewailing his country's fate more often than his own. The same day he reached the island of Cercina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since there were in port many Phoenician <pb id="p.405"/>vessels, loaded with merchandise, and crowds of<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> people came to pay their respects to him as he landed, he bade that the answer be given to their questions that he had been sent on an embassy to Tyre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Fearing nevertheless that one of these ships might leave at night and take the word to Thapsus or Hadrumetum that he had been seen at Cercina, he ordered preparations made for a sacrifice and the ship-captains and merchants invited to dinner and the sails and yards borrowed from their ships to provide a canopy &mdash;it chanced to be midsummer &mdash;for the diners on the shore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The dinner was given that day with all the pomp
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the situation and the time permitted, and the feasting was prolonged until late into the night with abundance of wine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As soon as Hannibal found an opportunity to elude the men who were in the harbour, he set sail. The rest were sound asleep, and when they finally woke
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> from slumber the next day, still heavy with wine, too late to accomplish anything, they spent some hours with the rigging, carrying it back to the ships, setting it up, and adjusting it.</p> 
				<p>At Carthage, the crowd of people which was accustomed to visit Hannibal gathered about the doors of his house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When it was generally known that he could not be found, the crowd rushed to the forum, demanding their foremost citizen;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> some said that he had escaped, which was the case, others that he had been murdered at the instigation of the Romans, and this aroused the greater resentment;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> one could see the various looks natural in a state made up of men of opposing parties and torn by factional strife; finally word came that he had been seen at Cercina.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman ambassadors stated in the senate that proof had been furnished the Fathers at <pb id="p.407"/>Rome, first, that King Philip had made war upon the<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Roman people mainly at the instigation of Hannibal, second, that

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amid the anxieties of great wars, either scarce<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> finished or soon to come, an incident occurred, trivial to relate, but which, by reason of the passions it aroused, developed into a violent contention.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius, tribunes of the people, proposed to the assembly the abrogation of the Oppian law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribune Gaius Oppius had carried this law in the heat of the Punic War, in the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius,<note>Sempronius was consul with Fabius (Cunctator) in <date value="-215">215 B.C.</date>, and with his son in <date value="-213">213 B.C.</date> The former date for the law is more probable: see vi. 9 and viii. 3 below.</note> that no woman should possess more than half an ounce of gold or wear a parti-coloured<note>Particularly one trimmed with purple.</note> garment or ride in a carriage in the City or in a town within a mile thereof, except on the occasion of a religious festival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tribunes Marcus and Publius Iunius Brutus were supporting the Oppian law, and averred that they would not permit its repeal; many distinguished men came forward to speak for and against it; the Capitoline was filled with crowds of supporters and opponents of the bill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The matrons could not be kept at home by advice or modesty or their husbands' orders, but blocked all the streets and approaches to the Forum, begging the men as they came down to the Forum that, in the prosperous condition of the state, when the private fortunes of all men were daily increasing, they should allow the women too to have their former distinctions restored.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The crowd of women <pb id="p.415"/>grew larger day by day; for they were now coming<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> in from the towns and rural districts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Soon they dared even to approach and appeal to the consuls, the praetors, and the other officials, but one consul, at least, they found adamant, Marcus Porcius Cato, who spoke thus in favour of the law whose repeal was being urged.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"If each of us, citizens, had determined to assert his rights and dignity as a husband with respect to his own spouse, we should have less trouble with the sex as a whole;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> as it is, our liberty, destroyed at home by female violence, even here in the Forum is crushed and trodden underfoot, and because we have not kept them individually under control, we dread them collectively.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For my part, I thought it a fairy-tale and a piece of fiction that on a certain island all the men were destroyed, root and branch, by a conspiracy of women;<note>Cato must refer to the story of Hypsipyle (Herodotus VI. 138; Hyginus, Fabulae 15), who, however, saved her father Thoas, king of Lemnos, when all the other men on the island were murdered by the women.</note> but from no class is there not the greatest danger if you permit them meetings and gatherings and secret consultations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And I can scarcely decide in my own mind whether the act itself or the precedent it sets is worse; the act concerns us consuls and other magistrates; the example, citizens, rather concerns you.<note>Cato's point is that it was the duty of the magistrates to suppress the gathering of the women as a disturbance of the peace and that it was the duty of the citizens to defeat the proposal to repeal, lest success at this time embolden the women to interfere with legislation on other occasions.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For whether the proposal which is laid before you is in the public interest or not is a question for you who are soon to cast your votes; but this female madness, whether it is spontaneous or due to your instigation, Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius, but which beyond question brings discredit upon the magistrates &mdash;I
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> do not know, I say, whether this madness is more shameful for you, tribunes, <pb id="p.417"/>or for the consuls: for you, if you have brought<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> these women here to support tribunicial seditions; for us, if we must accept laws given us by a secession of women, as formerly by a secession of plebeians.<note>The plebeian secession of <date value="-494">494 B.C.</date></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For myself, I could not conceal my blushes a while ago, when I had to make my way to the Forum through a crowd of women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Had not respect for the dignity and modesty of some individuals among them rather than of the sex as a whole kept me silent, lest they should seem to have been rebuked by a consul, I should have said, 'What sort of practice is this, of running out into the streets and blocking the roads and speaking to other women's husbands?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Could you not have made the same requests, each of your own husband, at home? Or are you more attractive outside and to other women's husbands than to your own?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And yet, not even at home, if modesty would keep matrons within the limits of their proper rights, did it become you to concern yourselves with the question of what laws should be adopted in this place or repealed.'
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Our ancestors permitted no woman to conduct even personal business without a guardian to intervene in her behalf;<note>A woman was never <hi rend="italics">sui iuris</hi> and was not a person in the legal sense. If she was not under the <hi rend="italics">potestas</hi> of a father or the <hi rend="italics">manus</hi> of a husband, a <hi rend="italics">tutor</hi> was appointed to act for her in legal matters.</note> they wished them to be under the control of fathers, brothers, husbands; we (Heaven help us!) allow them now even to interfere in public affairs, yes, and to visit the Forum and our informal and formal sessions.<note>See note on XXXI. vii. 2 above.</note> What else are they doing now on the streets and at the corners except urging the bill of the tribunes and voting for the repeal of the law?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Give loose rein to their uncontrollable nature and to this untamed creature and expect that they will themselves set bounds to their licence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> unless you act, this is the least of the things enjoined <pb id="p.419"/>upon women by custom or law and to which they<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> submit with a feeling of injustice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> It is complete liberty or, rather, if we wish to speak the truth, complete licence that they desire.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"If they win in this, what will they not attempt? Review all the laws with which your forefathers restrained their licence and made them subject to their husbands; even with all these bonds you can scarcely control them. What of this?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If you suffer them to seize these bonds one by one and wrench themselves free and finally to be placed on a parity with their husbands, do you think that you will be able to endure them? The moment they begin to be your equals, they will be your superiors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But, by Hercules, they object to the passage of any new law against them, they complain not of law but of wrongs done them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> what they want, rather, is that you repeal this law which you have approved and ratified and which in the trial and experience of so many years you have found good: in other words, that by abolishing this one law you weaken the force of all the rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No law is entirely convenient for everyone; this alone is asked, whether it is good for the majority and on the whole. If every law which harms anyone in his private affairs is to be repealed and discarded, what good will it do for all the citizens to pass laws which those at whom they are aimed will at once annul?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I should like to know what it is which has caused the panic-stricken matrons to rush out into the streets and barely refrain from entering the Forum and a public meeting. Is it that our captives, their fathers, husbands, sons or brothers, may be ransomed from Hannibal?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such <pb id="p.421"/>a calamity to the state is far away, and may it always<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> be; but yet, when it did happen, you refused this to their pious prayers.<note>See XXII. lxi. 3, where Livy records the refusal to redeem the Romans captured at Cannae.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But it was not affection nor anxiety about their dear ones which had brought them together: it was a religious rite, and they were about to receive the Idaean Mother as she came from Pessinus in Phrygia.<note>The worship of the Magna Mater was imported into Rome in <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>, and the stone which symbolized the goddess was received by the women (XXIX. x. 5; xiv. 10).</note> What pretext, respectable even to mention, is now given for this insurrection of the women?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> 'That we may glitter with gold and purple,' says one, 'that we may ride in carriages on holidays and ordinary days, that we may be borne through the city as if in triumph over the conquered and vanquished law and over the votes which we have captured and wrested from you; that there may be no limits to our spending and our luxury.'</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><quote>You have often heard me complaining of the extravagance of the women and often of the men, both private citizens and magistrates even, and

						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the memory of our forefathers Pyrrhus, through his agent Cineas, tried to corrupt with gifts the minds of our men and women as well.<note>See <hi rend="italics">Periocha</hi> XIII.</note> Not yet had the Oppian law been passed to curb female extravagance, yet not one woman took his gifts. What do you think was the reason?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The same thing which caused our ancestors to pass no law on the subject: there was no extravagance to be restrained.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As it is necessary that diseases be known before their cures, so passions are born before the laws which keep them within bounds. What provoked the Licinian law<note>One clause of the famous law of <date value="-367">367 B.C.</date> limited to five hundred <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> the amount of public land that any individual might hold (VI. xxxv. 5).</note> about the five hundred <hi rend="italics">iugera</hi> except the uncontrolled desire of joining field to field?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What brought about the Cincian law<note>By this law of <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> advocates were forbidden to charge fees for their services or to circumvent the law by accepting presents from their clients. Among the possible purposes was the desire to relieve the commons of financial and other obligations to the aristocracy.</note> except that the plebeians had already begun to be vassals and tributaries to the senate? And so it is not strange that no Oppian or any other law was needed to limit female extravagance at the time when they spurned gifts of gold and purple voluntarily offered to them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If it were to-day that Cineas were going about the city with those presents he would have found women standing in the streets to receive them. And for some desires I can find no reason or explanation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For though it may perhaps cause some natural shame or even anger that what is denied to you is permitted to another, yet, when the dress of all is made alike, what is <pb id="p.425"/>there which any of you fears will not be conspicuous<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> in herself?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The worst kind of shame, I tell you, is that derived from stinginess or poverty; but the law takes from you the chance of either, since you do not have what it is not allowed you to have.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> ' It is just this equality that I will not put up with,' says yonder rich woman. 'Why do I not stand out conspicuous by reason of gold and purple?
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Why does the poverty of other women lie concealed under cover of this law, that it may seem that, had it been legal, they would have owned what it is not in their power to own?' Do you wish, citizens, to start a race like this among your wives, so that the rich shall want to own what no other woman can have and the poor, lest they be despised for their poverty, shall spend beyond their means?
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Once let these women begin to be ashamed of what they should not be ashamed, and they will not be ashamed of what they ought.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> She who can buy from her own purse will buy; she who cannot will beg her husband. Poor wretch that husband, both he who yields and he who yields not, since what he will not himself give he will see given by another man.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Now they publicly address other women's husbands, and, what is more serious, they beg for a law and votes, and from sundry men they get what they ask.
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> In matters affecting yourself, your property, your children, you, Sir, can be importuned; once the law has ceased to set a limit to your wife's expenditures you will never set it yourself. Do not think, citizens, that the situation which existed before the law was passed will ever return.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> It is safer for a criminal to go unaccused than to be acquitted; and luxury, left undisturbed, would have been more endurable <pb id="p.427"/>then than it will be now, when it has been, like a<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> wild beast, first rendered angry by its very fetters and then let loose.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this the tribunes of the people who had declared that they would veto the bill spoke briefly to the same effect, and then Lucius Valerius argued thus for the measure which he had proposed: "If only private citizens had come forward to support or oppose the measure which we have placed before you, I too, since I judged that enough had been said on each side, should have waited in silence for your ballots;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> now, since that most influential man, the consul Marcus Porcius, has attacked our proposal not only with his authority, which unexpressed would have had enough of weight, but also in along and carefully-prepared speech, it is necessary to make a brief reply.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And yet he used up more words in reproving the matrons than he did in opposing our bill, and, in fact, left it in doubt whether the conduct for which he rebuked the matrons was spontaneous or inspired by us.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I propose to defend the measure rather than ourselves, at whom the consul directed his insinuations, more to have something to say than to make a serious charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This gathering of women he called a sedition and sometimes' a female secession,' because the matrons, in the streets, had requested you to repeal, in a time of peace and in a rich and prosperous commonwealth, a law that was passed against them in the trying days of a war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I know that there is this and still other vigorous language, which has been sought out to make the argument <pb id="p.429"/>sound more convincing;<note>The amplification of an argument was a recognized rhetorical device; to an opponent it would easily seem to be an exaggeration.</note> we all know, too, that<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Marcus Cato is an orator not only powerful but sometimes even savage, though he is kind of heart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What new thing, pray, have the matrons done in coming out into the streets in crowds in a case that concerned them? Have they never before this moment appeared in public? Let me unroll your own <hi rend="italics">Origines</hi> against you.<note>Valerius quotes or pretends to quote from Cato's own historical work, which treated of early Roman history. The <hi rend="italics">Origines</hi> had not actually been written at the time of the feminist agitation (Nepos, Cato 3; Quintilian XII. xi. 23, etc.). The scroll form of the ancient book explains the choice of the verb <hi rend="italics">revolvam.</hi></note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Hear how often they have done it and always, indeed, for the general good. Even in the beginning, while Romulus was king, when the Capitoline had been taken by the Sabines and pitched battle was raging in the centre of the Forum, was not the fighting stopped by the rush of the matrons between the two battle-lines?<note>The story is told in I. ix. 1-xiii. 5.</note> What of this?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When, after the expulsion of the kings, the Volscian legions led by Marcius Coriolanus had encamped at the fifth milestone, did not the matrons turn away from us the army which would have destroyed our city?<note>The story is told in II. xxxv. 6-xl. 10.</note> When the City was later captured by the Gauls, how was it ransomed? Why, the matrons by unanimous consent contributed their gold to the public use.<note>This story is told in v. 1-7.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In the recent war (not to go to remoter times), did not the widows, when there was a scarcity of money, aid the treasury with their wealth,<note>See XXIV. xviii. 14.</note> and when new gods too were brought in to help us in our crisis, did not the matrons in a body go down to the sea to receive the Idaean Mother? These cases, you say, are different.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It is not my purpose to prove them similar; it suffices if I prove that this <pb id="p.431"/>is nothing new.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But what no one wonders that all, -<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> men and women alike, have done in matters that concern them, do we wonder that the women have done in a case peculiarly their own? What now have they done?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> We have proud ears, upon my word, if, although masters do not scorn to hear the petitions of slaves, we complain that we are appealed to by respectable women.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"I come now to the matter which is under discussion. On this point the consul's argument was two fold: for he protested against the repeal of any law at all, and particularly of that law which was designed to limit feminine luxury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The former argument, a general appeal on behalf of the laws, was becoming to a consul; the latter, against luxury, was consistent with his strict moral code;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> accordingly, unless I reveal the fallacy in both, there is a danger that some misconception may blind your eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For while I acknowledge that, of these laws which have been passed, not for a particular occasion, but as permanent institutions because of their enduring benefit, none should be repealed, unless experience shows it to be useless or some emergency in the state renders it valueless, yet I see that certain laws which crises in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> state have demanded are, so to speak, mortal, and subject to change as conditions themselves change.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Laws passed in time of peace, war frequently annuls, and peace those passed in times of war, just as in handling a ship some means are useful in fair weather and others in a storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since they are so distinguished by nature, to which class, I ask, does the law which we are trying to repeal seem to belong? Well?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Is it an ancient regal law, born with the City itself, or, what is next to that, one <pb id="p.433"/>inscribed on the twelve tables by the decemvirs<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> appointed to codify the law? Is it a law without which our ancestors held that a matron's virtue could not be preserved, and which we too must fear to repeal lest along with it we repeal the modesty and purity of our women?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Who is there, then, who does not know that this is a new law, passed twenty years ago, in the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius? Since for so many years our matrons lived virtuous lives without it, what danger is there that when it is repealed they will rush into riotous luxury?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For if it were an ancient law, or passed for the purpose of holding feminine caprice under restraint, there would be danger that its abrogation would rouse their passion; but the occasion itself will tell you why the law was passed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Hannibal was in Italy, victorious at Cannae; he already held Tarentum,<note>Tarentum did not surrender to him until 213 or <date value="-212">212 B.C.</date> (XXV. xi. 20).</note> Arpi, Capua; he seemed ready to march on our city of Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> our allies had deserted us; we had no troops in reserve, no naval allies to maintain the fleet, no money in the treasury; slaves were being purchased for employment as soldiers, on condition that the price should be paid their owners after the war;

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> widows and minors deposited their money in the treasury; we were forbidden to have at home more than a certain quantity of gold or silver plate or <pb id="p.435"/>coined silver or bronze;<note>This statement is not quite consistent with the proposal of M. Valerius Laevinus in <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> (XXVI. xxxvi. 5-8). The speaker for rhetorical effect ignores the fact that the sumptuary laws he mentions were passed at different times.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> at such a time were the<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> matrons so absorbed in luxury and adornment that the Oppian law was needed to restrain them, when, since the rites of Ceres had to be omitted because all the women were in mourning, the senate limited the period of mourning to thirty days?<note>This happened in <date value="-216">216 B.C.</date> (XXII. lvi. 4).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Who fails to see that the poverty and distress of the state wrote that law, since all private property had to be diverted to public use, and that the law was to remain in force so long as the cause of its enactment lasted?<note>Valerius argues that the Oppian law was merely one of a series of emergency measures by which all elements in the state were affected. To leave this one law in force would mean continued discrimination against one element, the women, after the other methods had been abandoned.</note> For, if whatever emergency measure was passed by senatorial decree or popular vote should be for ever observed, why do we repay the loans advanced by private citizens?

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these speeches against and for the bill had been delivered, the next day an even greater crowd of women appeared in public, and all of them in
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> a body beset the doors of the Bruti, who were vetoing their colleagues' proposal, and they did not desist until the threat of veto was withdrawn by the, tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After that there was no question that all the tribes would vote to repeal the law. The law was repealed twenty years after it was passed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><pb id="p.441"/>
				<p>Marcus Porcius the consul, as soon as the Oppian<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> law was abrogated, at once set out for the harbour of Luna with twenty-five warships, of which five belonged to the allies, having ordered his army to muster at the same place and sent a proclamation along the coast to collect ships of every kind;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> as he set out from Luna he issued an order that they should follow him to the port of Pyrenaeus, and thence he would proceed against the enemy with all the fleet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They sailed past the Ligurian mountains and the Gallic gulf and joined him on the day he had set. Thence they sailed to Rhoda and ejected by violence a guard of Spaniards that was in the fortress.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Rhoda with favouring winds they came to Emporiae, and there landed all the forces except the naval allies.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Even at that time Emporiae consisted of two towns separated by a wall. One was inhabited by Greeks from Phocaea, whence came the Massilienses also, the other by the Spaniards;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but the Greek town, being entirely open to the sea, had only a small extent of wall, of less than four hundred paces in length, while the Spaniards, who were farther back from the sea, had a wall three miles around.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A third class of inhabitants, Roman colonists, was added by the deified Caesar<note>Since one of Pompey's sons fell in the battle of Munda (<date value="-45">45 B.C.</date>), the establishment of the colony was probably the work of Caesar (the other son of Pompey survived to contend with Augustus).</note> after the final defeat of the sons of Pompey, and at present all are fused into one mass, the Spaniards first, and later the Greeks, having been received into Roman citizenship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> One who saw them at that time would wonder what secured the safety of the Greeks, with the open sea on one side and the Spaniards, so fierce and warlike a people, their neighbours on the other. Discipline was their protector against their weakness, <pb id="p.443"/>which among more vigorous peoples is best main<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> tained when there is cause for fear.<note>Livy may be thinking of the discipline enforced by circumstances upon cities like Sparta.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The part of the wall which faced the interior they kept strongly fortified, with only a single gate leading in that direction, and at this one of the magistrates was posted as a continuous guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At night a third of the citizens kept vigil on the walls; they did this not merely as a result of custom or in obedience to the law, but they posted their sentinels and sent out their patrols with all the care they would have used had the enemy been at their gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No Spaniard was admitted to the city, nor did the Greeks themselves leave the city without good cause. Towards the sea the gates were open to all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Through the gate which led to the Spanish town they never passed except in large bodies, usually the third which had maintained the watch on the walls the night before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The cause of going out of the town was this: the Spaniards, who had no experience with the sea, enjoyed transacting business with them, and wanted both to buy the foreign merchandise which they brought in in their ships and to dispose of the products of their farms. The desire for the benefits of this interchange caused the Spanish city to be open to the Greeks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They were safer, too, for the reason that they were under the shelter of the Roman friendship, which they cultivated with resources inferior to those of the Massilienses but with equal devotion. At this time also they received the consul and his army with courtesy and kindness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Cato delayed there a few days, until he could find out where the forces of the enemy lay and what strength they possessed, and, not to be idle even in that time of waiting, he spent the whole period in drilling his <pb id="p.445"/>troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It happened to be the time of year when<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> the Spaniards had the grain on their threshing floors; he therefore forbade the contractors to purchase any and sent them back to Rome, saying, <quote>This war will support itself.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Leaving Emporiae, he burned and laid waste the fields of the enemy and filled everything with flight and terror.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the same time, as Marcus Helvius<note>Helvius had been governor of this province since <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXII. xxviii. 2); Claudius succeeded him in <date value="-195">195 B.C.</date></note> was retiring from Farther Spain, accompanied by a guard of six thousand men furnished by Appius Claudius the praetor, the Celtiberi with a large force fell upon him near the town of Iliturgi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Valerius writes that there were twenty thousand men there, that twelve thousand of them were killed, the town of Iliturgi taken and all the adults put to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After that Helvius came to the camp of Cato, and, because this region was now safe from the enemy, sent his guard back to Farther Spain and set out for Rome, and by reason of his victory entered the city in an ovation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He deposited in the treasury fourteen thousand seven hundred and thirty-two pounds of uncoined silver, seventeen thousand and twenty-three <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> stamped with the two-horse chariot, and one hundred and nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-nine silver coins of Osca.<note>Silver was produced in the region of Osca. The coins were probably Spanish <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> with Iberian inscriptions.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The reason for the senate's refusal of a triumph was that he had fought under another's auspices and in another's province. But it was not until two years later that he had returned home, though he had turned his province over to his successor Quintus Minucius,<note>In XXXIII. xxvi. 1 Minucius received the province of Nearer Spain, and so did not succeed Helvius. Probably Helvius accomplished little in his province and the confusion in the records resulted.</note> having been detained there the following year by a long and serious illness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So he entered Rome in an ovation <pb id="p.447"/>only two months before his successor Quintus<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Minucius celebrated his triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He too brought with him thirty-four thousand eight hundred pounds of silver and seventy-three thousand coined <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> and two hundred and seventy-eight thousand pieces of Oscan silver.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile in Spain the consul was encamped not far from Emporiae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thither came from Bilistages, chieftain of the Ilergetes,<note>One of the loyal tribes (XXIX. ii. 5).</note> three ambassadors, one of whom was his son, complaining that their strongholds were being besieged and that there was no hope of offering resistance unless the Roman sent aid; three thousand soldiers were sufficient, and if so great a force arrived, the enemy would not await them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To this the consul replied that he was indeed moved both by their danger and their fear;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but he had by no means enough troops, since a great number of the enemy was close at hand and he expected every day to have to meet them in pitched battle (he had no idea how soon), to allow him safely to weaken himself by dividing his army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the ambassadors heard this, they wept and threw themselves at the consul's feet, and begged him not to abandon them in such a crisis:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> where would they turn, rejected by the Romans? They had no allies, no other hope anywhere in the world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They might have escaped the existing danger if they had been willing to violate their pledges and unite with the rest, but no threats and no prospects of danger had moved them, since they hoped to have a sufficient help and assistance in the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If this were not the case, and they were refused by the consul, they called gods and men to witness that unwilling and under compulsion, to avoid the fate which the <pb id="p.449"/>Saguntines suffered, they would join the rebellion<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> and perish with the rest of the Spaniards rather than alone.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And on that day they were dismissed thus, unanswered. During the night which followed, a double care distressed the consul:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he was unwilling to abandon his allies, unwilling to weaken his army, an action which might either delay his engaging or cause danger in the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His decision not to weaken his forces remained unchanged, lest he suffer the disgrace of defeat at the hands of the enemy; he determined to offer to the allies hope instead of actuality:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> often, and especially in war, appearances have had the effect of realities, and the man who believes that help is at hand acts as if he really had it, and by this very confidence, which inspires both hope and daring, is saved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the following day he answered the ambassadors that, although he feared that he would diminish his own strength by lending part of it to them, yet he was paying regard to their emergency and peril rather than to himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He ordered warning to be given to one-third of the soldiers of each cohort to cook food in good season and put it on board ship, and the ships to be made ready for sailing the third day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He directed two of the ambassadors to take this news to Bilistages and the Ilergetes; the chief's son he kept with him, persuading him with kindly treatment and with gifts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The ambassadors did not leave until they saw the soldiers marching on board the ships; reporting this as unquestioned fact, they filled not only their own people but also the enemy with the news of the approaching Roman aid.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul, when enough of a show had <pb id="p.451"/>been given to keep up appearances, ordered the<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> soldiers to disembark; and he himself, since now the time of the year was drawing near when active operations could be carried on, established a winter camp three miles from Emporiae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thence as occasion offered, now in this direction and now in that, leaving small guards at the camp, he led the soldiers into the enemy's country to seek plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They usually set out at night, so as to march as far as possible from the camp and to take the enemy off their guard. By this means<note>Cato economizes time by combining practice-marches with fighting, and increases the distance covered on each raid by beginning his march during the night.</note> he hardened his recruits and captured a great number of the enemy; no longer did they venture to go outside the fortifications of their stations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had in this way sufficiently tested the tempers of his own men and the enemy, he called into conference the tribunes and prefects and all the cavalry and centurions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <quote>The time,</quote> he said, <quote>which you have often longed for is at hand, when you will have the opportunity of making display of your courage. So far you have fought more like guerillas than like soldiers; now, foe facing foe, you will meet in regular battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Henceforth you will be able, not to pillage country districts, but to drain the wealth of cities.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Our fathers, when the Carthaginians had both generals and armies in Spain, and they themselves had not a single soldier here, still demanded that it be stated in the treaty that the Ebro river should be the boundary of their empire;<note>See the note on XXXI. vii. 3.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> now, when there are two praetors, a consul, and three Roman armies stationed in Spain, and for nearly ten years no Carthaginian has been in these provinces, our empire on this side of the Ebro has been lost.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This it is your task to recover <pb id="p.453"/>with your arms and your daring, and to compel this<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> nation, which is rather in rebellion rashly than warring with steadiness of purpose, to accept again the yoke which it has thrown off.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After encouraging them in about this fashion, he announced that he would lead them against the enemy's camp that night, and so dismissed them to seek rest.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At midnight, after taking the auspices in due form, he set out, that he might choose the place he wished before the enemy was aware of his coming, led his troops beyond the camp of the enemy, and at daybreak, drawing up his line of battle, he sent three cohorts close to the very rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The barbarians, marvelling that the Romans had appeared in their rear, themselves ran to arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Meanwhile the consul harangued his troops: <quote>Nowhere, soldiers, is there any hope except in your courage, and I have deliberately acted so that there should be none.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Between us and our camp is the enemy, and in the rear is the enemy's country. What is most glorious is also the safest: to place our hopes in valour.</quote> After this he ordered the cohorts recalled, to draw the enemy out of their camp by the pretence of flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What he had anticipated occurred. Thinking that the Romans were retreating in terror, they rushed out of the gate and filled with soldiers all the space that was left between the camp and the enemy's battle-line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While they were in the confusion of forming their array, the consul, who had everything already prepared and in order, fell upon them in their disorder. The cavalry was the first to enter the battle on both flanks, but on the right they were at once repulsed, and retiring in fear they even caused a panic among the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the <pb id="p.455"/>consul observed this, he ordered two picked cohorts<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> to march around the right flank of the enemy and to show themselves in the rear before the infantry masses clashed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The alarm which thus confronted the enemy equalized the disadvantage caused by the flight of the Roman cavalry; but so greatly had the infantry and cavalry on the right flank been thrown into confusion that the consul himself seized with his hand some of them and turned them around to face the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so, as long as the fight was being carried on with missiles, the issue was uncertain; on the right, where the panic and flight had begun, the Roman resisted with difficulty, while on the left and in the centre the barbarians were hard pressed and looked
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> back with dread at the cohorts which were coming up in their rear. When they drew their swords after hurling their darts and javelins, then the battle, so to speak, took on new life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For they no longer received unexpected random wounds from a distance, but closing foot to foot put all their hope in courage and in strength.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As his men grew weary, the consul rekindled their spirits by bringing up reserve cohorts from the second line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A new line was established; fresh troops with unused weapons attacked the exhausted enemy and first, with a furious attack in wedge formation, pushed them back, then scattered them and put them to flight; with headlong speed they made across the fields for camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When Cato saw everything filled with confusion, he rode back to the second legion, which was in reserve, and ordered it to advance at quickened pace to attack the enemy's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If a soldier in too great eagerness got ahead of the rank, he himself rode up between the lines and <pb id="p.457"/>struck him with his spear-shaft, and ordered the tribunes<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> and centurions to punish him. By this time the camp was being attacked and the Romans driven back from the rampart with stones and poles and every sort of missile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But when the new legion came up, the vigour of the attackers increased, and the enemy fought with greater desperation in defence of their rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consul scanned everything with his gaze, that he might break through wherever the resistance was weakest. He saw that there were few defenders at the left gate, and there he led the <hi rend="italics">principes</hi> and <hi rend="italics">hastati</hi> of the second legion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The guard which was posted at the gate did not resist their onset; and the rest, seeing the enemy within the fortification, having lost their camp, likewise threw away their standards and arms. They were cut to pieces at the gates, where they were held fast in the narrow passages by their own numbers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The soldiers of the second legion attacked them in the rear, the rest plundered the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Valerius Antias relates that more than forty thousand of the enemy fell that day; Cato himself, a man not much inclined to be grudging in his own praise, says that many were killed, but does not give a definite number.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Three praiseworthy acts he is credited with having performed that day; first, that he had led the army around far from his ships and camp and engaged in the midst of the enemy, where his men had no hope except in their own courage;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> second, that he had thrown the cohorts against the enemy's rear; third, that he had ordered the second legion, when all the rest were disordered by their pursuit of the enemy, to march up to the gate of the camp at quickened pace but in orderly and disciplined formation under their <pb id="p.459"/>standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Later on there was no resting idle after<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> his victory. When, after giving the signal to retire, he had led his men back to camp laden with booty, he gave them a few hours for rest and led them out to plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They ravaged more widely, since the enemy was scattered in flight. This had no less influence than the defeat of the previous day in causing the Spaniards of Emporiae and their neighbours to submit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Many citizens of other states as well, who had taken refuge in Emporiae, surrendered. All of these the consul treated kindly, and after refreshing them with wine and food sent them home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then speedily moved his camp, and wherever the column went ambassadors met him, surrendering their cities, and by the time he
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> reached Tarraco, all Spain on this side of the Ebro had been subdued, while captives, both Romans and Latins of the confederacy, who had been overtaken by various misfortunes in Spain, were brought in and presented to the consul by the barbarians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the story was circulated that the consul meant to lead the army into Turdetania,<note>There were apparently two districts of this name, one near Saguntum, the other, and more important, near the south-western coast and so outside Cato's province. It is evident, however, from xvii. 1 ff. that a co-ordinated campaign against the latter people was planned.</note> and it was falsely reported to the mountaineers of the outlying districts that he had already set out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On this idle and unauthenticated rumour seven forts of the Bergistani<note>This people cannot be located.</note> revolted, but the consul led out his army and reduced them to submission without any battle worth mentioning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A little later, when the consul had returned to Tarraco but before he moved from that place, the same peoples revolted and were again subdued, but the same indulgence was not granted to the conquered. They were all sold at auction, in order to prevent their disturbing the peace too frequently.</p> <pb id="p.461"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Publius Manlius the praetor<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> had taken over the veteran army from Quintus Minucius whom he had succeeded, and uniting with it the army, also made up of veterans, of Appius Claudius Nero from Farther Spain, set out for Turdetania.<note>In XXXIII. xliii. 5-8, Livy says that Manlius was sent to Nearer Spain as <hi rend="italics">adiutor consulis</hi> but had troops, including those formerly under Minucius, under his command. His situation was, then, quite irregular, and his operations outside his superior's province of questionable legality, and there may be some confusion with his subsequent appointment to Farther Spain in <date value="-182">182 B.C.</date> (XL. i. 2).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Turdetani were considered the least warlike of all the Spaniards, yet, relying on their numbers, they went out to meet the Roman column.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The cavalry, sent against them, at once broke their line, and the infantry engagement was almost no battle at all; the veteran soldiers, well acquainted with the enemy and his manner of fighting, rendered the result certain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Yet the war was not ended by that battle: the Turduli hired ten thousand Celtiberi and prepared to carry on the war with the weapons of strangers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul meanwhile, alarmed by the rebellion of the Bergistani, and thinking that other states as well would follow their example if occasion offered, disarmed all the Spaniards on this side of the Ebro.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This action they took so hard that many committed suicide, a high-spirited people, who thought that life without arms was not worth living.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When this was reported to the consul, he ordered the senators of all the states summoned to his presence and addressed them thus: <quote>It is not more to our interest than to yours that you should not rebel, inasmuch as this has always happened with greater misfortune to the Spaniards than trouble to the Roman army.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I think that there is only one way to prevent this &mdash;to arrange matters so that you will not be able to rebel. I wish to accomplish this in the gentlest possible manner.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Do you, then, aid me with your advice on this matter. I shall follow no counsel more gladly than that which you <pb id="p.463"/>yourselves shall give me.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When they were silent, he<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> said that he would give them a space of a few days for reflection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When they were recalled, and had kept silent at the second council also, on one day he destroyed the walls of all the towns and proceeded against those who were not yet submissive, and as he passed through region after region, he accepted the surrender of all the neighbouring states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Segestica alone, an important and rich city, he captured with sheds and mantlets.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He had the greater difficulty in reducing the enemy than those who had first gone to Spain, because the Spaniards transferred their allegiance to his predecessors through weariness of the authority of the Carthaginians, but in his case the task was, so to speak, to claim them as slaves<note><hi rend="italics">In servitutem adserere</hi> is the technical legal phrase for trying to establish in court the fact that one is owner of a slave (III. xliv. 5).</note> after they had had a taste of liberty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and everything was in such commotion that some were in arms, some were being compelled by siege to join the uprising, and, unless prompt assistance were sent them, would not be able to hold out longer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But in the consul there was such vigour of mind and character that he attended to and performed all business, great and small, and he not only planned and gave orders for what was advantageous, but himself executed most of them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he exercised sterner and severer discipline over no one in all the army than over himself, and in frugality and vigilance and exertion
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he vied with the lowest of his soldiers, and except for his rank and his authority he enjoyed no distinction as compared with the rest of the army.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Celtiberi who had been hired by the enemy, as has been said before, made the war in Turdetania more difficult for the praetor Publius <pb id="p.465"/>Manlius. Therefore the consul, summoned by a<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> message from the praetor, led his legions there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he arrived, the Celtiberi and the Turdetani were in separate camps. With the Turdetani the Romans immediately began to skirmish, attacking their outguards, and they always came off victorious, no matter how rashly they had attacked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul ordered some of the military tribunes to go to confer with the Celtiberi and to offer them their choice of three proposals:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> first, if they wished to come over to the Roman side and receive twice the pay they had agreed to accept from the Turdetani;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> second, if they wished to go home after receiving a public pledge that the fact of their having joined the enemies of Rome should not cause them any damage;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> third, if battle was their desire under any conditions, that they should name a time and place for an armed settlement with him. The Celtiberi asked for time to consider the proposals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A council was held, at which the Turdetani crowded in, causing great excitement; for that reason a decision was impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Although it was uncertain whether their relation with the Celtiberi was one of war or peace, the Romans, nevertheless, just as if it were a time of peace, were bringing provisions from the farms and strongholds, often going in squads of ten into their fortifications under private truces, as if the right of trade had been officially recognized.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the consul failed to draw the enemy out to battle, he first sent certain light-armed cohorts out to ravage the fields of a region hitherto unattacked, then, hearing that the baggage and equipment
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of the Celtiberi was all at Saguntla, he proceeded to attack that town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When he found that nothing would <pb id="p.467"/>provoke them to battle, he paid<note>The troops were usually paid only once during a campaign, usually at the end of the season.</note> not only his own<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> soldiers but those of the praetor and with seven cohorts (the rest being left in the praetor's camp) returned to the Ebro.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With this small force he captured several towns. The Sedetani, the Ausetani, and the Suessetani came over to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Lacetani, a remote and forest-dwelling race, were kept under arms, partly by their native savageness, partly by their consciousness of having pillaged the allies in sudden raids while the consul and the army were engaged in the campaign in Turdetania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore the consul led to the attack upon their citadel not only the Roman cohorts but the young men of the allies, who were justly incensed at them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their town was long, but was not extensive in breadth in proportion. He halted at a distance of about four hundred paces from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There he left a guard of chosen cohorts, ordering them not to stir from that place until he came to them in person; the rest of the troops he led to the farther side of the town. The largest contingent among all his auxiliaries was furnished by the young men of the Suessetani; these he ordered to assault the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the Lacetani recognized their arms and standards, and recalled how often they had offered them insults with impunity in their own lands and how often they had routed them and put them to flight in pitched battle, they suddenly threw open the gate and attacked them in a body. The Suessetani scarcely waited for them to raise the shout, much less for them to charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the consul saw that this was turning out
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> as he had expected it would, he put spurs to his horse and rode off under the enemy's wall to the <pb id="p.469"/>cohorts, and bringing them into action, since the<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> enemy had all
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> scattered to pursue the Suessetani, he led them into the city on the side where all was silence and solitude and was in complete control before the Lacetani returned. Having nothing left to them but their arms, they presently surrendered.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The conqueror then quickly led his troops to the fort of Bergium. This was now primarily a nest of robbers, and from it raids were being made on the pacified districts of this province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A leader of the Bergistani escaped from it to the consul and began to apologize for himself and his fellow-citizens: their own state was not under their control, he said; the robbers, once admitted to the town, had brought it completely under their own dominion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul directed him to go back home, having provided himself with a plausible explanation for his absence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> when he should see the Romans approaching the walls and the robbers intent on defending the fortifications, he, with the men of his own party, would remember to seize the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This was done according to instructions; suddenly a double terror gripped the barbarians, as on one side the Romans were climbing the walls and on the other the citadel had been taken. The consul took possession of the place and ordered the men who had occupied the citadel and their relatives to be free, and to enjoy possession of their property, and, directing the quaestor to sell the other Bergistani, he put the robbers to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Having restored order in the province, he arranged for the collection
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> of large revenues from the iron and silver mines, and as a result of the regulations made at that time the wealth of the province increased every day.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For the rest of the summer the consul kept his army at Placentia and Cremona, in the neighbourhood of the Po, and rebuilt the parts of those cities which had been destroyed in the war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While this was the state of affairs in Italy and Spain, Titus Quinctius had spent the winter in Greece in such a fashion that, with the exception of the Aetolians, who had neither gained rewards of victory in proportion to their hopes nor proved able to be long satisfied with quiet, all Greece, enjoying to the full the blessings of peace and liberty combined, was happy in its condition, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> admired the Roman commander's bravery in war no more than his self-control, justice, and moderation after victory, and at this time the decree of the senate which declared war against Nabis the Lacedaemonian was delivered to him.<note>In XXXIII. xlv. 3 Livy says that the decision was left in the hands of Quinctius, and the following narrative is based on that assumption.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he had read this decree, Quinctius announced a council, to be held at Corinth on a designated day, and made up of delegations from all the allied states.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the prominent men in great numbers had come from all quarters to this meeting, not even the Aetolians being unrepresented, he addressed them as follows: <quote>The war against Philip was waged by the Romans and Greeks with feelings <pb id="p.473"/>and aims no less common than their several reasons<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> for entering the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For he had violated his friendship with the Romans, now by aiding their enemies the Carthaginians, now by attacking our allies in this country, and towards you he conducted himself in such a way that your wrongs,
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> even if we did not remember our own injuries, were a sufficiently good reason why we should take up the quarrel. To-day's decision depends entirely on you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I lay before you the question whether you wish to permit Argos, which, as you know, has been seized by Nabis, to remain under his control, or whether you think it proper that this most famous and ancient
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> city, situated in the heart of Greece, should be restored to liberty and enjoy the same condition as the other cities of the Peloponnesus and Greece.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This question, as you see, is one-which is altogether your concern; it does not touch the Romans at all, except in so far as the slavery of one city of liberated Greece does not permit their fame to be perfect and complete.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But if no concern for that city nor the example thus set nor the danger that the contagion of that evil may spread affects you, that is, so far as we are concerned, well and good. I ask your opinions on this matter, and shall abide by whatever decision the majority of you shall reach.</quote></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech from the Roman commander, they began to ascertain the views of the others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the Athenian ambassador had, to the extent of his capacity, and with effusive thanks, extolled the Romans' services to Greece, saying that <quote>when appealed to they had given aid against Philip, and were
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> of their own accord and without an appeal offering assistance against Nabis,</quote> and had <pb id="p.475"/>lamented that these services,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> great as they were, -<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> were nevertheless criticized in the talk of certain persons who threw out dark hints about the future, though they should rather be confessing their gratitude for the past, it was clear that he was attacking the Aetolians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore Alexander, a leading man of that people, assailed first the Athenians, once the leaders and champions of liberty, now the betrayers of the common cause from their desire to win a place for themselves by
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> adulation, then he complained that the Achaeans, the one-time soldiers of Philip, then finally deserters from him as his fortunes declined, had regained Corinth and in addition were trying to obtain Argos, while the Aetolians, foes to Philip from
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the beginning, allies to the Romans at all times, although they had agreed in the treaty<note>See XXXIII. xiii. 7-13 and the notes.</note> that the cities and fields were to be theirs when Philip was defeated, were being cheated out of Echinus and Pharsalus;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he also charged the Romans with deceit, in that, while they held out the empty name of liberty, they were holding with their garrisons Chalcis and Demetrias, despite the fact that they had been wont to object, when Philip hesitated to withdraw his troops from these towns, that <quote>while Demetrias and Chalcis and Corinth were
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> in his hands, Greece would never be free,</quote> and finally, in that they were making Argos and Nabis an excuse for remaining in Greece and keeping their army there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Let them, he said, transport their legions to Italy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> adding that the Aetolians promised either that Nabis would withdraw his garrison from Argos voluntarily and under terms imposed by them, or that they would compel him by force of arms to yield to the will of united Greece.</p> <pb id="p.477"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This boastful speech first provoked Aristae<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> nus, praetor of the Achaeans, to speak:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>May Jupiter Optimus Maximus and Queen Juno,<note>Iuno Acraea or Iuno Argiva may be meant; cf. XXXII. xxiii. 10. Iuno Regina was more specifically a Roman divinity, as is Iuppiter Optimus Maximus, but is not out of place on the lips of an Argive who was under the protection of Iuno.</note> under whose protection Argos is, forbid that that city be the prize to be contended for by the Spartan tyrant and the Aetolian robbers, in such a critical moment that its recovery by you would be a greater misery than its possession by him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The sea that lies between does not protect us from those brigands, Titus Quinctius; what will become of us if they establish their citadel in the heart of the Peloponnesus? They have only the tongue of Greeks, as they have only the shape of men; they live under rules and practices more savage than any barbarians, yes, than any wild beasts.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Therefore we beg you, Romans, both to recover Argos from Nabis and to establish the affairs of Greece in such a way as to leave us well protected from the brigandage of the Aetolians as well.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When men from all sides were uniting in censuring the Aetolians, the Roman said that he would have answered them, did he not see that all men were so enraged at them that they required to be soothed rather than provoked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He said that he was content with the opinions expressed about the Romans and the Aetolians, and therefore put the question what they would do about a war against Nabis if he would not give Argos back to the Achaeans. When a unanimous decree for war had been passed, he urged them that each state should send auxiliaries in proportion to its strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He even sent an ambassador to the Aetolians, more for the purpose of laying bare their intentions (and in this he succeeded) than from the hope that he could gain their adherence.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He ordered the tribunes of the soldiers to <pb id="p.479"/>summon the army from Elatia.<note>Elatia was the regular winter headquarters of Flamininus; cf. XXXIII. xxvii. 5.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> About this time, -<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> too, ambassadors from Antiochus arrived to discuss an alliance, but received the reply that he had nothing to say in the absence of the ten commissioners; it would be necessary for them to go to Rome and apply to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then proceeded to lead the assembled forces from Elatia towards Argos, and in the vicinity of Cleonae Aristaenus the praetor met him with ten thousand Achaean infantry and one thousand cavalry, and uniting their forces they encamped a short distance away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The next, day they marched down into the plain of the Argives and selected for their camp a position about four miles from Argos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The commander of the Spartan garrison was Pythagoras, at once the son-in-law and brother-in-law of the tyrant,<note>Nabis had married Apega, probably the sister of Pythagoras (XXXII. xl. 10-11; Polyb. XVIII. xvii.; cf. XIII. vii); Pythagoras in turn had married the daughter of Nabis.</note> and at the approach of the Roman she posted strong guards on both citadels (for Argos has two citadels) and likewise on other places that were favourably situated or open to attack;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> but while he was taking this action he could not conceal the fear which the coming of the Romans caused, and on top of the danger from outside there was also a mutiny within.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was an Argive named Damocles, a young man of greater spirit than discretion, who, after exchanging oaths, began conferring with suitable persons regarding expelling the garrison, and, in his desire to add strength to his conspiracy, proved to be too careless in his estimation of fidelity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When an agent sent by the prefect summoned him as he was talking to one of his party, he perceived that the plot had been betrayed and urged the conspirators who were with him to join him in armed resistance rather than perish under torture.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And so with a few of his friends he rushed <pb id="p.481"/>into the forum, crying out that all who wished the<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> safety of the state should follow him as the sponsor and leader of freedom. He roused almost no one, since they saw no immediate prospect of success anywhere, and not even any considerable material strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As he was uttering such appeals, the Lacedaemonians surrounded him and his party and put them to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then some of the others were arrested, and most of these were executed, a few imprisoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> During the following night many let themselves down over the wall by means of ropes and took refuge with the Romans.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When these men assured him that if the Roman army
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> had been at the gates the uprising would not have been so futile, and that the Argives would not remain quiet if he moved his camp nearer the city, Quinctius sent the light infantry and cavalry, who engaged with a party of Lacedaemonians who rushed out of the gate near Cylarabis &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> gymnasium less than three hundred paces from the city &mdash;and without great effort drove them back into the town. Then the Roman general placed his camp on the spot where the battle had occurred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He spent the next day watching to see if any new disturbance would arise; when he saw that the state had been overawed he called a council to consider laying siege to Argos.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The opinion of all the Greek chieftains except Aristaenus was the same, that since there was no other cause for the war than that city, the war should by preference begin there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Quinctius was by no means of the same opinion, and he listened with unmistakable -approval to the argument of Aristaenus, which was opposed to this generally held view;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and he even asked what, since the war had <pb id="p.483"/>been undertaken for the sake of the Argives and<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> against the tyrant, was less consistent than to let the enemy alone and attack Argos?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For his part, he would seek the main objective of the war, Sparta and the tyrant. Accordingly he dismissed the council and sent light cohorts out to forage. The ripe grain was harvested and brought into camp; the unripe was trampled down and destroyed, to prevent the enemy from enjoying it later.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then he moved his camp and crossing Mount Parthenius and passing Tegea he encamped on the third day near Caryae. There, before he entered the enemy's country he waited for the auxiliaries of the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Fifteen hundred Macedonians came from Philip and four hundred Thessalian cavalry. It was no longer auxiliaries, of whom there were plenty, that delayed the Roman commander, but the supplies that the neighbouring states had been ordered to contribute.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Also, great fleets were assembling: Lucius Quinctius had now arrived from Leucas with forty ships, together with eighteen warships of the Rhodians, and King Eumenes was off the Cyclades islands with ten warships, thirty cruisers and with them other vessels of smaller size. Many exiles of the Lacedaemonians, driven out by the misdeeds of the tyrants, also came to the Roman camp in the hope of being restored to their homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There were many who had been driven out by one tyrant or another, through the several generations<note>The next sentence reveals the exaggeration of the statement: Cleomenes was tyrant during the period 235-<date value="-221">221 B.C.</date> (Polyb. II. xlvii).</note> which had elapsed since tyrants first got control of Sparta.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The chief of the exiles was Agesipolis, to whom the throne of Lacedaemon belonged by right of birth, who had been exiled
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> in his childhood by the tyrant Lycurgus after the death of Cleomenes, <pb id="p.485"/>who had been the first to hold the tyranny in<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Sparta.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When so great a war on land and sea was threatening the tyrant, though on a true estimate of his own strength and that of the enemy he
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> could see almost no hope of success, he nevertheless did not neglect his preparations for war, but summoned from Crete a thousand of their chosen youths, in addition to a thousand who were already with him; he had also in his force three thousand mercenaries and ten thousand of his own countrymen along with the rural guards, and he fortified the city with a moat and rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To prevent any internal disorder, he held the people in check with terror and severe punishments, since he could not hope that they would wish well to a tyrant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since he entertained suspicions regarding certain citizens, he led out his entire force into a plain &mdash;they call it Dromos &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> stacking arms bade the Spartans to be summoned to a meeting and surrounded the gathering with armed guards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then he made some brief opening remarks, showing why he should be pardoned in such an emergency, when he feared everything and guarded against everything, and that it was to their own interest, if the present state of affairs made him suspect certain citizens, that these persons should be prevented from making any attempt upon him rather than punished for making the attempt;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he would accordingly hold certain persons under guard until the storm which was threatening should pass; when the enemy was driven off &mdash;and there was less danger from them if only internal treachery could be prevented &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> would at once release them; after this he ordered the <pb id="p.487"/>names of about eighty of the most prominent young<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> men to be read, and each one, as he answered to his name, was turned over to the guards; during the next night he put them all to death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then some of the Ilotae,<note>Probably a variant on the more familiar <hi rend="italics">Helots.</hi></note> a rural people, who had been country-dwellers from remote antiquity, were charged with trying to desert, driven with whips through all the streets, and put to death. By thus inspiring fear he stunned the minds of the crowd and prevented any attempt at revolution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He kept his troops within the walls, thinking himself unequal to the enemy, if he should dare to risk a battle, and fearing to leave the city while all men's minds were in such suspense and uncertainty.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius had now made adequate preparations and had left his base and on the second day arrived at Sellasia above the Oenus river, at which place it was said that Antigonus, king of the Macedonians, had contended in pitched battle with Cleomenes, the tyrant of the Lacedaemonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Having learned that the descent was through a difficult and narrow pass, he sent men ahead to build a road over a short bypass over the mountains, and came by a sufficiently wide and open way to the river Eurotas, which flows almost under the very walls of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the Romans were laying out their camp and Quinctius himself with the cavalry and light infantry had gone on ahead, the auxiliary forces of the tyrant attacked and threw them into panic and disorder, since they anticipated no such event, because no enemy had shown himself on their entire march and they had passed through an apparently peaceful country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For a time there was confusion as the cavalry called to the infantry and the infantry <pb id="p.489"/>to the cavalry, since each lacked confidence in itself; &mdash;<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> finally, the standards of the legions came up, and when the leading cohorts of the column were thrown into the fight, those who had a moment before been a cause of terror were driven in panic into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Romans retired so far from the wall that they were beyond spear-range, and forming their line waited for a while; when no enemy came out against them, they retired to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The next day Quinctius began to lead his troops in array along the river and past the city to the foot of Mount Menelaus; at the head marched the legionary cohorts and the light infantry and the cavalry formed the rear-guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Inside the wall Nabis had formed and made ready his mercenaries, in whom he placed most confidence, to attack the enemy in the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the tail of the column had passed, they burst from the town through several gates at once, with the same fury as the day before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Appius Claudius was bringing up the rear; he had prepared the minds of his men for what was likely to occur, lest it catch them unawares, and he at once faced about and presented a solid front to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So, just as if organized<note>The word <hi rend="italics">rectae</hi> (literally <quote>straight</quote>) in this context appears to mean the orderly alinement of a force drawn up for battle, and stands in contrast with the column, the formation adopted on the march.</note> battle-lines had met, there was a regular battle for a while; at length the soldiers of Nabis turned in flight; and this would have been less hazardous and dangerous if the Achaeans, who knew the ground, had not pressed them hard. They caused great slaughter and disarmed many of them as they scattered in flight in every direction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Quinctius encamped near Amyclae, and from that base he laid waste all the well-populated and pleasant <pb id="p.491"/>country districts which surrounded the city, and<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> when no enemy now left the gates he moved his camp to the river Eurotas. Next he devastated the valley that lies below Taygetus and the fields that stretched towards the sea.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At about the same time Lucius Quinctius received the surrender of the towns on the coast, some by their own choice, some from fear or as a result of attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then, having learned that the town of Gytheum was the Lacedaemonians' storehouse of naval supplies of all kinds and that the Roman camp was not far from the sea, he determined to attack the town with his whole force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was at that time a strongly fortified place, well supplied with large numbers of citizens and immigrants and with all military equipment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At an opportune moment for Quinctius, who was undertaking a difficult task, King Eumenes and the Rhodian fleet appeared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A huge crowd of naval allies, assembled from the three fleets, within a few days made ready all the engines necessary for the siege of a city strongly fortified by land and sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Soon mantlets were brought up and the wall was being undermined and shaken by battering-rams. So one tower was overthrown by the repeated blows, and the adjacent wall was ruined by its fall;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and the Romans attempted at once to force their way in from the harbour side, whence the approach was more level, to distract the enemy's attention from the more exposed place, and also through the breach made by the falling of the wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor were they far from winning to the place they sought, but their attack was slowed up by the hope held out to them, but soon after found delusive, that the city would capitulate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Dexagoridas and Gorgopas <pb id="p.493"/>were in command of the city, with equal authority<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Dexagoridas had sent word to the Roman lieutenant that he would give up the city,
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and when the time and method of procedure had been agreed upon, the traitor was slain by Gorgopas and the city was more vigorously defended by him alone. And the continuance of the siege would have been more difficult if Titus Quinctius had not come up with four thousand picked troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When he had revealed his line of battle, drawn up on the brow of a hill no great distance from the city, and on the other side Lucius Quinctius was pressing the assault from his works on land and sea, then despair compelled Gorgopas too to adopt the plan which he had punished with death in another's case,
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and bargaining that he should be permitted to lead away the soldiers whom he
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> had had as a garrison, he surrendered the city to Quinctius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Before Gytheum was surrendered, Pythagoras, the prefect who had been left at Argos, turned over the guardianship of the city to Timocrates of Pellene and with a thousand mercenaries and two thousand Argives joined Nabis in Lacedaemon.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although Nabis had been greatly alarmed at the approach of the Roman fleet and the surrender of the coast towns, yet he had rested on a slender hope as long as Gytheum was held by his troops;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> when he learned that it too had been given over to the Romans and that, while on land there was no hope, all the country being in
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the hands of the enemy, he was entirely cut off from the sea as well, considering that he must yield to fortune, he first sent a herald to the camp to find out whether they would permit ambassadors to be sent to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <pb id="p.495"/>When this was granted Pythagoras came to the<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> commander with no other message than that the tyrant be granted an interview with the general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When a council was summoned and all agreed that an interview should be granted, a time and place were appointed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They arrived with moderate escorts at some hills in the intervening country, and both parties, leaving their cohorts on guard in plain sight, came down to the meeting-place, Nabis with a
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> picked body-guard, Quinctius with his brother, King Eumenes, Sosilas the Rhodian, Aristaenus, praetor of the Achaeans, and a few military tribunes.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the tyrant had been given the option of speaking first or of listening, he began thus: <quote>If, Titus Quinctius and you others who are present, I had been able to discover for myself any reason why you should have declared or should now be waging war upon me, I should have waited in silence for the decision as to my fate;
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but as it is, I have been unable to control my curiosity to know, before I perish, why I am to perish.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And, by Hercules, if you were such men as the Carthaginians are reputed to be, among whom no sanctity attaches to a pledge of alliance, as regards myself too I should not wonder that you take little thought as to how you are acting;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but now, as I look at you, I see that you are Romans, men who hold treaties to be the most sacred of divinely-established institutions, and a pledge to be the most sacred of human ties.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When I look at myself, I hope that I see myself as one who, as a member of the state, in common with the other Lacedaemonians, has enjoyed a most ancient treaty<note>The exactness of this statement cannot be verified. There seems to be no record of an earlier treaty, yet in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xii. 14) Nabis is mentioned as an ally. The negotiations of <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (XXXII. xxxix. 10-xl. 4) make no mention of such an alliance.</note> with you, and who on his own account and in his own person has recently, <pb id="p.497"/>during
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the war with Philip, renewed this friendship<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> and alliance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, you say, I have violated and overturned it because I hold the city of Argos. How shall I defend myself against this charge? By the aid of the facts or by consideration of the time? The facts give me a double defence: first, when the citizens themselves invited me and turned the city over to me, I accepted it, not seized it; second, I received it when the city belonged to Philip's faction and was not in league with you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The time likewise acquits me of that charge, since the alliance between you and me was arranged at a time when I was already in possession of Argos, and your stipulation was that I should send you assistance for the war, not that I should withdraw my garrison from Argos.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But, by Hercules, in the dispute which concerns Argos, I come out the victor both by the justice of my case, because I received a
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> city which belonged not to you but to the enemy, received it by its own act and not through compulsion; and by your own admission, since by the terms of our alliance you left Argos in my hands.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But my title of tyrant and my behaviour argue against me, because I summon slaves to the enjoyment of freedom and establish the needy commons upon the soil.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As to my title, I can give this reply, that, whatever I am, I was the same when you yourself, Titus Quinctius, made the alliance with me.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At that time I recall that you saluted me as king; at this time I see that I am called tyrant. Therefore, if I had changed the title of my office, I should have to explain my inconsistency; since you are changing it, you must give reason for your own.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As to the fact that I have <pb id="p.499"/>increased population by freeing slaves and have distributed<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> land to the poor, I can defend myself against this charge by the plea of the time as I did before:
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> I had already done all this, such as it is, at the time when you arranged the alliance with me and accepted my aid in the war against Philip;
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> but if I had just recently done this, I should not ask, 'What harm have I done you in this way, or how have I broken the treaty?' but merely say that I had acted according to the tradition and custom of our ancestors.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Do not weigh what is done in Lacedaemon on the scales of your own laws and institutions. It is unnecessary to make a detailed comparison. You choose your cavalry and your infantry according to their census-ratings,<note>This was the basis of the constitution of Servius Tullius. The exactness of these statements regarding Roman and Spartan legislation need not be examined for this purpose.</note> and you desire that a few<note>The senators, who generally belonged in the higher censusclasses.</note> should excel in wealth and that the commons should be under their control;
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> our law-giver<note>Lycurgus.</note> ordained that the state should not be in the hands of the few, whom you call the senate, and that no one order should predominate in the state, but he believed that by equalizing wealth and rank it would come to pass that there would be many to bear arms for the country.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> I admit that I have spoken at greater length than suits the traditional brevity of our speech;<note>The Spartans were traditionally <quote>laconic.</quote></note> and I might have summed up briefly by stating that since I entered upon my friendship with you, I have done nothing to make you regret it.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Roman commander responded thus: <quote>We have never made any treaty of friendship and alliance with
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> you, but with Pelops, the lawful and legitimate king of the Spartans, whose rights the tyrants, who afterwards exercised violent sway in <pb id="p.501"/>Sparta, since we were kept busy by wars, now with<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> Carthage, now with Gaul, now with one state after another, had usurped, just as you too have done during this recent Macedonian war.<note>These statements cannot be verified, and Pelops cannot be positively identified.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What would be less consistent than for a people that was fighting against Philip for the liberation of Greece to make a treaty of friendship with a tyrant? And a treaty with a tyrant the most savage and lawless that ever lived?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even if you had neither taken Argos through fraud nor continued to hold it in the same way, we should be compelled, while we were setting all Greece free, to restore Sparta as well to its ancient liberty and its laws, which you have mentioned as if you were an imitator of Lycurgus.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It will be our responsibility that Philip's garrisons are withdrawn from Iasus and Bargyliae;<note>Rome's protection of remote towns is mentioned to present a sharp contrast with what follows.</note> shall we leave Argos and Lacedaemon, two most celebrated cities, once the lights of Greece, under your feet, that their slavery may tarnish our glory as liberators of Greece? But, you say, the Argives were on the side of Philip. We do not at all ask <hi rend="italics">you</hi> to be indignant with them on our account.<note>Nabis' indignation at Argos provokes an ironical reply.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We have convincing proof that the blame for this rests on two or at most three men, not on the state, just as, by Hercules, when <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> Nabis, with <hi rend="italics">your</hi> garrison were invited and received into the citadel, nothing was done with official sanction.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We know that the people of Thessaly and Phocis and Locris joined the party of Philip with the general approval of those peoples;
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> nevertheless, we have set them free along with the rest of Greece; what then do you think we shall do in the case of the Argives, who are innocent of any official decision?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> You said that we were charging you with inviting slaves to <pb id="p.503"/>become free and dividing the land among poor<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> men, nor are these trivial accusations; but what are they in comparison with the crimes which are every day committed in endless succession by you and your followers? Hold a free assembly in either Argos or Lacedaemon, if you want to hear true accusations against a most lawless despotism.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To pass over all other crimes of more distant date, what a slaughter did that Pythagoras, your son-inlaw, cause at Argos almost under my eyes?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Of what were you yourself guilty, at a time when I was practically on the frontiers of the Spartans?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Come, bid those men be led out in chains whom you arrested in the assembly and announced in the hearing of all your fellow-citizens that you would hold in confinement: let their wretched parents see that those whom they are mourning without cause are alive.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But, you say, granting now that all this is so, how does this concern you, O Romans? Can you say that to the deliverers of Greece? Can you say that to men who have crossed the sea and waged war on land and sea that they might accomplish this liberation?
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Yet you say, I have not personally violated your friendship and alliance. In how many instances do you want me to prove that you have done so? I shall not be long, but shall sum up the whole matter.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> In what ways, then, is friendship violated? Chiefly, no doubt, in these two ways: if you treat my allies as enemies, and if you associate yourself with my enemies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Both of these things you have done; for, in the first place, Messene, a city received into our friendship under one and the same treaty as Sparta, a city that was our ally, you, also our ally, captured by force of arms;<note>Nabis captured Messene in <date value="-201">201 B.C.</date> (Polyb. XVI. xiii). Both Nabis and Messene were included on the side of Rome in the treaty with Philip in <date value="-205">205 B.C.</date> (xxix. xii. 14).</note> in <pb id="p.505"/>the second place, you arranged not only an alliance<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> with Philip, our enemy, but also (Heaven help us!)
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> a personal relationship through the intervention of his prefect
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Philocles, and, just as if you were making regular war upon us, you rendered the sea around Malea dangerous with your pirate ships, and you captured and killed more Roman citizens, almost, than Philip did, and the coast of Macedonia was safer than the promontory of Malea for the ships that were transporting supplies for our armies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Cease then, if you please, to utter fine-sounding words about loyalty and treaty obligations, and dropping your popular style speak
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> as a tyrant and an enemy.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this Aristaenus began first to advise Nabis and then to plead with him, while he was in a position to do so and while there was opportunity, to consider his own interests
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> and prospects, and then to recall by name the tyrants of the neighbouring states who had laid down their authority and restored liberty to their subjects and so had passed not only a secure but also an honourable old age among their fellow-citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After this interchange of speeches, the approach of night broke up the conference. The next day Nabis agreed to withdraw from Argos and lead away his garrison, since this was the Romans' pleasure, and to give back the prisoners and deserters;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> if they had further demands, he requested that they deliver them in writing, that he might discuss them with his friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So an interval was granted the tyrant for his deliberations, and Quinctius also held a council to which he summoned the chiefs of the allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The opinion of the majority was that they should continue the war and get rid of the tyrant; never <pb id="p.507"/>under other conditions would the liberty of Greece<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> be assured; it would have been much better not to have begun the war against him than to discontinue it when once begun;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and he, having obtained a quasi-approval of his despotism, would be
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> more firmly established for having won the sanction of the Roman people for his unjust rule, and by his example would prompt many in other states to plot against the freedom of their citizens. The mind of the commander himself was more inclined towards peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For he saw that with the enemy driven inside his fortifications nothing remained but a siege, but the siege would be of uncertain issue and long duration, since they would invest, not Gytheum (and this, besides, had been surrendered, not captured), but Lacedaemon, a city exceedingly powerful in men and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There had been, he continued, one real hope, if dissension and insurrection among the Spartans themselves could have been begun while they were bringing up the army; when they saw the standards almost carried into the gates, no one had stirred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He added that Villius, the ambassador, had reported on his return that the peace with Antiochus could not be depended upon, and that he had crossed into Europe with far greater military and naval forces than before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If the siege of Sparta, he asked, kept the army busy, with what other troops would they conduct the war against a king so mighty and powerful?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Such was his spoken argument; unexpressed was another anxiety, that a new consul might obtain the province of Greece from the lots, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> that he might be compelled to hand over to a successor an incomplete victory in the war.</p> <pb id="p.509"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When by arguing on the other side he<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> produced no effect among the allies, by pretending to go over to their opinion he brought all into agreement with his plan.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <quote>May success attend us,</quote> he said, <quote>and let us lay siege to Sparta, since that is your will: but do not be deceived about this: since the siege of cities is a slow business, as you know, which often exhausts the patience of the besiegers sooner than that of the besieged, you ought even now to hold this prospect before your minds, that we must winter around the walls of Lacedaemon.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If this delay involved merely toil and danger, I should urge you to prepare both minds and bodies to resist them;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but now it demands much money also, for siege-works, for engines and artillery with which we must attack so strong a town, and for the purchase of provisions for you and us against the winter.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore, to prevent any sudden fear or a disgraceful abandonment of an unfinished enterprise, I propose that you should write to your states in advance, to ascertain what is the temper and what the strength of each. Of troops to aid me, I have enough and more; but the more numerous we are, the more supplies we shall require.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The enemy's country already offers nothing but the naked soil. Besides, winter will soon be here, making it difficult to transport supplies from a distance.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech at once directed the minds of all to thoughts of the domestic difficulties of each, the sloth, the ill-will, and the jealousy of those who stayed at home towards the soldiers in the field, the liberty that made agreement difficult, the public poverty, the unwillingness to make contributions from private funds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Their inclinations accordingly suffered a sudden change, <pb id="p.511"/>and they granted authority to the commander to do
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> what he considered consistent with the general interest of the Roman people and the allies.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius then summoned only his lieutenants and the tribunes of the soldiers, and wrote down the terms on which peace should be made with the tyrant:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> that there should be a truce of six months between Nabis and the Romans, King Eumenes, and the Rhodians; that Titus Quinctius and Nabis should at once send ambassadors to Rome, that the peace might be ratified by the authority of the senate;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> that the day on which the written conditions of peace should be delivered to Nabis should be the beginning of the armistice, and that ten days from that time the garrisons should be withdrawn from Argos and the other towns in Argive territory, and that they be handed over to the Romans, empty and free of troops, and that no slave, whether belonging to the king<note>I.e. Eumenes.</note> or to
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the state or to a private individual, should be removed, and if any had been previously removed they should be duly returned to their owners;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that he should give back the ships which he had taken from the cities on the sea, and that he should not have any ship except two small vessels which were propelled by not more than sixteen oars;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that he should restore the fugitives and captives to all the cities allied with the Roman people and to the Messenians all the property which could be found and which the owners could identify;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> that he should likewise return to the Lacedaemonian exiles their children and their wives who were willing to attend their husbands, provided that no wife should against her will follow a husband into exile;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that all property should be duly restored <pb id="p.513"/>to the mercenary soldiers of Nabis who had deserted<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> either to their own states or to the Romans;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that he should retain possession of no town in Crete, and those which he had held he should turn over to the Romans; that he should form no alliance with any people of the Cretans or anyone else, and should wage no war with them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> that from all the cities, both those which he had given up and those which had put themselves and their possessions under the protection and control of the Roman people, he should withdraw his garrisons and should keep himself and his troops away from them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> that he should found no city or fort on his own or another's territory; that he should give five hostages that these conditions should be observed, such as were satisfactory to the Roman commander, and among them his son, and should pay one hundred talents of silver immediately and fifty talents per year for eight years.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These articles were reduced to writing and delivered to Lacedaemon, the camp having been moved nearer to the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nothing in them was really pleasing to the tyrant, except that, contrary to his expectations, no mention was made of any restoration of the exiles; but the most offensive clause was that which deprived him of the ships and the cities on the coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The sea, indeed, had been of great profit to him, since his pirate boats had attacked the whole coast from the promontory of Malea; besides, he found the soldiers of these cities made by far the best kind of fighting men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Although he had discussed these conditions with his advisers in secret, nevertheless everyone was discussing them in common talk, since it is the nature <pb id="p.515"/>of the courtiers of kings to be untrustworthy in all<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> respects, but especially for keeping secrets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> People generally did not criticize the terms as a whole so much as individuals found fault with those that concerned themselves. Those who had married the wives of exiles, or had possessed themselves of parts of their property, mourned as if they were to be robbed, and were not to restore the property of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Before the eyes of the slaves who had been freed by the tyrant was the vision not only of their vainly-gained liberty but of a slavery much more grievous than before, since they were returned to the authority of angered masters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The mercenaries saw with regret that the rewards of service would diminish in peace, and they likewise knew that they could not return to their own states, which were not more opposed to tyrants than to their servants.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At first they made these complaints as they discussed the terms in their own gatherings; then suddenly they ran to arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the tyrant perceived that the people had of their own accord become angry enough, he ordered an assembly summoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had explained there the demands made by the Romans, and had falsely represented some of them as more burdensome and unjust than they actually were, and when each point was received with signs of disapproval, now from the whole assembly, now from one part or another, he asked what answer they wanted him to give and what they wished him to do.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Almost unanimously they bade him give no answer but to continue the war, and each one individually, as a crowd is wont to do, counselled him to be of good cheer and good hope, reminding him that fortune favoured <pb id="p.517"/>the brave.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Inspired by such speeches, the tyrant<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> announced that he would have the support of Antiochus and the Aetolians, and that he had abundant strength to withstand the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All thoughts of peace had gone from their minds and they rushed to their posts, unable to remain quiet longer. The sally of a few skirmishers and the weapons which they hurled at once removed from the Romans any doubt that the war would go on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the first four days there were only minor engagements with no very certain result;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> on the fifth day, in a regular battle, the Lacedaemonians were driven back into the town in such confusion that some of the Romans, as they were cutting down the fugitives, entered the city through the gaps which at that time existed in the wall.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And for the time Quinctius, having put a stop to the enemy's raids by reason of the alarm he had given them, and thinking that there was no alternative to the investment of the city, sent messengers to bring up the marines from Gytheum, and himself with the tribunes of the soldiers rode around the walls to reconnoitre the city's position.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sparta had at one time been without a wall; the tyrants had recently constructed a wall in the open and flat places;<note>The fortification of Sparta is differently dated by other ancient writers.</note> the higher ground and that difficult to approach was defended by guards of soldiers instead of a fortification.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he had made a sufficiently complete reconnaissance, thinking that he should attack from an encircling line, he stationed around the city his whole force &mdash;there were altogether, Romans and allies, foot and horse, soldiers and marines, about fifty thousand men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some bore ladders, others torches, others <pb id="p.519"/>other things, with which to attack and likewise to<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> cause terror.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The main body of his army he formed in three columns: his order was to attack with one on the side of the Phoebeum, with the second at the Dictynneum, with the third in the quarter which they call Heptagoniae &mdash;all these were open places without walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The city being thus encircled on every side with terror, the tyrant at first, actively attending to the sudden shouts and the panic-stricken messages, just as each spot was in greatest straits, either went to meet the enemy in person or despatched assistance;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> later on, as the confusion increased on all sides, he was so benumbed by terror that he was unable either to order what was appropriate or to hear the reports, and not only lost his power of judgment but was almost bereft of reason.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At first the Lacedaemonians held up the Roman attack in the narrow approaches, and the three lines were fighting in different places at the same time; then, as the fighting grew more severe, the battle was by no means equal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the Spartans were fighting with long-distance weapons, from which the Roman soldier protected himself with great ease, partly by the size of his shield, partly because some javelins missed their mark and others fell only lightly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For on account of the limited space and the throngs of soldiers, they not only had no room from which to hurl them on the run, which gives them the greatest momentum, but they lacked even room to try to throw them from an unimpeded and solid footing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Consequently, of the weapons hurled from directly opposite none pierced the <pb id="p.521"/>bodies, and few even the shields;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> some of the Romans were wounded by troops on their flanks who occupied the higher ground; presently, as they advanced, some unexpected wounds were suffered from spears and even tiles hurled from the housetops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then they held their shields above their heads and fitted them so closely together that no space was left for random shots or even for the insertion of a javelin from near at hand, and having formed their <hi rend="italics">testudo</hi> they forced their way forward.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The first narrow streets they entered, crowded with their own troops and those of the enemy, delayed them for a while; after they came out into the wider avenues of the city, gradually driving back the enemy, the violence of their assault could not be resisted longer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the Lacedaemonians had turned to flee, and in headlong flight were seeking the higher ground, Nabis too, trembling as if the city had been taken, looked about him for a way to escape; Pythagoras not only displayed the courage and performed the functions of a commander in other respects, but was,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> moreover, the sole reason why the city was not captured, for he ordered the buildings nearest the wall to be set on fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When these had flamed up in an instant, and the men who ordinarily would be accustomed to bring aid to put out the fire were helping it to burn more fiercely, the roofs were collapsing upon
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the Romans, and not only pieces of tile but half-burned beams were falling upon the soldiers and flames were shooting far out, while the smoke too was creating greater terror than danger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And so those of the Romans who were outside the city and were just at that moment making their most violent attack, <pb id="p.523"/>retired from the wall, and likewise those who had<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> already entered, lest they be cut off from their own men by the fire which was rising in their rear, fell back, and Quinctius, when he saw what the situation was, ordered the signal sounded for a retirement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And so, when they had almost captured the city they were recalled and returned to their camp.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius found more cause for hope in the enemy's panic than in the actual success he had gained, and for three days following kept them in a state of terror, sometimes harrying them with assaults, sometimes blocking open spaces with siege-works, that no way might be left open for escape.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Under the pressure of these repeated threats the tyrant again sent Pythagoras to plead for him,<note>Livy here uses <hi rend="italics">orator</hi> in its original sense.</note> but Quinctius at first scornfully ordered him to be expelled from the camp, but later, when he begged like a suppliant and threw himself
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> at his feet, he at length granted him an audience.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The beginning of his speech was an offer of complete submission to the decision of the Romans, but when this accomplished nothing, being held to be idle and unavailing, matters were then brought to this point that a truce should be concluded on the basis of the terms which had been delivered in writing a few days before, and the money and hostages were received.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>While the tyrant was being besieged, the Argives, when man after man brought the news that Lacedaemon was all but captured, themselves took heart, for the additional reason that Pythagoras had departed
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> with the strongest contingent of the garrison, and making light of the few who were in the citadel, they chose one Archippus as leader and drove out the garrison; as for Timocrates of Pellene, <pb id="p.525"/>because he had ruled them with kindness, they<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> allowed him to leave alive under a safeguard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the midst of their rejoicing Quinctius came to them, having granted peace to the tyrant and sent away from Lacedaemon Eumenes and the Rhodians and his brother Lucius Quinctius to the fleet.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The most popular of the festivals, the famous spectacle of the Nemean Games, which had been omitted at the usual time because of the misfortunes of war, was now, on the arrival of the Roman army and commander, proclaimed by the joyful citizens, who had chosen the general himself to preside at the games.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were many things which added to their joy: those of their countrymen had been brought back from Lacedaemon, who had been taken there by Pythagoras recently and by Nabis earlier;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the men had come back who had escaped after the discovery of the conspiracy<note>See xxv. 7-12 above.</note> by Pythagoras and after the executions had begun; they saw liberty recovered after a long interval,<note>Argos had come under the control of Philip in <date value="-198">198 B.C.</date> (XXXII. xxv. 11) and Livy exaggerates somewhat, as he frequently does.</note> and they beheld the authors of that liberty, &mdash;the Romans, whose cause for warring with the tyrant they had themselves been.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Moreover, the freedom of the Argives was proclaimed by the voice of the herald on the very day of the Nemean Games. As regards the Achaeans, whatever joy the restoration of Argos to the common council of Achaea brought to them was rendered incomplete to the same degree by the fact that Lacedaemon was left enslaved, with the tyrant close at hand;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the Aetolians, too, attacked the position of affairs at all their meetings: with Philip, they said, there had been no cessation from war until he had evacuated all the cities of Greece;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sparta was abandoned to the tyrant, and its legal king, though <pb id="p.527"/>in the Roman camp, and other citizens of the highest<note type="margin">B.C. 195</note> station, would live in exile; the Roman army had become the ready agent of Nabis' despotism.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> From Argos Quinctius led his troops back to Elatia, whence he had set out to the Spartan war.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> An audience before the senate was granted them outside the City in the temple of Apollo. They requested that the peace which had been agreed upon with Titus Quinctius be ratified, and this was granted to them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the question of the provinces was brought up, a full meeting of the senate adopted a proposal that, since the wars in Spain and Macedonia had been finished, both consuls should have Italy as their province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Scipio was of the opinion that one consul sufficed for Italy and that Macedonia should be decreed to the other. His arguments were that a great war was threatened by Antiochus, who had already and without provocation crossed into Europe;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> what did they think he would do then, with the Aetolians, avowed enemies, on one side calling him to the war, and on the other Hannibal, a general distinguished for his defeats of the Romans, urging him on?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> While the debate about the consular provinces was in progress, the praetors cast lots;

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was decided that a new army should not be taken over to Macedonia and that the troops who were there should be brought back by Titus Quinctius and demobilized; likewise the army which was with Marcus Porcius Cato in Spain should be disbanded;

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Colonies of Roman citizens were that year founded at Puteoli, Volturnum, Liternum, three hundred to each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Also, colonies of Roman citizens were established at Salernum and Buxentum. The triumvirs who established them were Tiberius Sempronius Longus (one of the consuls of the year), Marcus Servilius and Quintus Minucius Thermus.<note>See XXXII. xxix. 4.</note> The land which had belonged to the Campanians was divided among them.<note>The apparent meaning is that these colonies were on land which had been taken from the Campanians in punishment for their revolt during the Second Punic War.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Likewise at Sipontum, in <pb id="p.535"/>territory which had belonged to the Arpini, a colony<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> of Roman citizens was founded by other triumvirs, Decimus Iunius Brutus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, and Marcus Helvius. Colonies of Roman citizens were established at Tempsa and Croton.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The land of Tempsa had been taken from the Brutti, who in turn had expelled the Greeks; Croton had been held by the Greeks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The triumvirs for Croton were Gnaeus Octavius, Lucius Aemilius Paulus, and Gaius Laetorius; for Tempsa, Lucius Cornelius Merula, Quintus . . ., and Gaius Salonius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Also, prodigies that year were both seen at Rome and reported from other places. In the Forum and the comitium and on the Capitoline drops of blood were seen, showers of earth fell several times, and the head of Vulcan burst into flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was announced that milk had flowed in the river Nar, that free-born children without eyes or noses had been born at Ariminum, and in the Picene country one without feet or hands.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In Gaul the proconsul Lucius Valerius Flaccus, in the vicinity of Milan, fought a pitched battle with the Insubrian Gauls and the Boi, who, led by Dorulatus had crossed the Po to rouse the Insubres to arms, and defeated them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ten thousand of the enemy fell. About the same time his colleague Marcus Porcius Cato triumphed over Spain. He carried in his triumph twenty-five thousand pounds of silver bullion, one hundred and twenty-three thousand silver <hi rend="italics">denarii,</hi> five hundred and forty thousand<note>The gender of <hi rend="italics">quingenta</hi> shows that <hi rend="italics">milia</hi> must be supplied.</note> silver coins of Osca, and one thousand four hundred pounds <pb id="p.537"/>of gold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From the booty, he gave to each of his<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> soldiers two hundred and seventy <hi rend="italics">asses,</hi> and thrice that amount to each trooper.</p> 
				<p>Tiberius Sempronius the consul proceeded to his province and first invaded the country of the Boi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Boiorix, their chieftain at the time, with his two brothers, had aroused the whole people to revolt and had placed his camp in open country, so that it was clear that they would fight if the enemy entered their territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When the consul saw how great was their strength and what confidence filled the enemy, he sent word to his colleague that, if he saw fit, he should make haste to arrive: that he, assuming the defensive, would drag matters out until his arrival.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The same motive which the consul had for delay was also for the Gauls (not to mention the fact that the enemy's hesitation gave them courage), a reason for acting quickly so as to finish the campaign before the armies of the consuls were united.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For two days, however, they did nothing more than stand ready to engage if anyone came out to meet them; on the third day they advanced towards the rampart and attacked the camp on all sides at once. The consul immediately ordered his men to take up arms;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> then he kept them under arms for a while, that he might increase the foolish confidence of the enemy and arrange his forces by the gates through which they would severally make their sally. Two legions were ordered to march out by the two main gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But at the actual opening of the gates the Gauls met them in such close array that they blocked the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For a long time they fought in these confined spaces; it was a matter not so much of hands and swords as of making <pb id="p.539"/>their way by pushing against one another with shields<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> and bodies, the Romans trying to force a way out for their standards, the Gauls trying either to enter the camp or to prevent the Romans from leaving it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Nor could the lines be moved in either direction until Quintus Victorius, a senior centurion, and Gaius Atinius, tribune
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> of the soldiers, the latter of the fourth, the former of the second legion, resorting to a device often tried in desperate encounters, snatched the standards from the hands of their bearers and threw them into the midst of the enemy.<note>The loss of the standard was the worst disaster that could befall them.</note> In their eager struggle to get back their standard, the soldiers of the second legion were the first to force their way through the gate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They were now fighting outside the rampart, the fourth legion being still inside the gate, when a new uproar was heard on the opposite side of the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Gauls had broken through the <hi rend="italics">porta quaestoria</hi><note>This gate, on the side opposite the enemy, was usually called the <hi rend="italics">porta decumana.</hi></note> and after stubborn resistance had slain the quaestor Lucius Postumius, whose surname was Tympanus, and Marcus Atinius and Publius Sempronius, commanders of allied detachments, and about two hundred of their men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had gained possession of the camp in that quarter, until an attached<note>With a consular army of two legions there were four cohorts not forming organic parts of the legions and so called <hi rend="italics">extraordinariae.</hi> The nearest equivalent in our modern terminology seems to be the one I have employed. Two other such cohorts are mentioned in the next sentence.</note> cohort, sent by the consul to defend the <hi rend="italics">porta quaestoria,</hi> killed some of the Gauls who had entered the camp, drove others outside the rampart, and blocked the entrance against those who were attacking the gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At almost the same instant the fourth legion with two attached cohorts burst through the gate. So there were three battles at once in different places around the camp, and the confused shouts distracted the minds of the fighters from their own immediate combats to the uncertain fortunes <pb id="p.541"/>of their comrades. Until noon the battle went on<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> with equal strength and with nearly the same hopes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When fatigue and heat had compelled the Gauls, with their soft and feeble bodies and their small capacity for enduring thirst, to retire from the fight, the Romans charged the few that were left and drove them, broken, to their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon the consul ordered the recall sounded; at this the majority turned back, but part, in their eagerness to fight and their hope of capturing the enemy's camp, pushed on to the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The whole mass of Gauls, in disdain of their small number, rushed out from their camp; the Romans in turn were put to flight and returned to their camp in consequence of their own terror and panic, although they had refused to retire at their commander's order. Thus there were varied fortunes on both sides, now defeat and now victory; yet about eleven thousand of the Gauls fell and five thousand of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Gauls retired into the interior of their country, while the consul led his legions to Placentia.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some say that Scipio united his army with that of his colleague and marched through the territory of the Boi and Ligures, plundering as he went, as far as the forests and marshes permitted, others that without accomplishing anything worth recording, he returned to Rome to hold the elections.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In that same year Titus Quinctius at Elatia, where he had put his troops into winter quarters, spent the entire period of the winter in administering justice and in undoing the arrangements in the cities which had been caused by the arbitrary conduct of Philip and his prefects, since by increasing the power of the men of their own faction they diminished the <pb id="p.543"/>privilege and liberty of the rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the beginning<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> of spring he summoned a council and went to Corinth. There he addressed the embassies of all the states, gathered around as for an assembly:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he began with the time when the first friendship was instituted between the Romans and the Greek people, and reviewed the achievements of the commanders who had preceded him in Macedonia, and his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The whole speech was received with great applause, except when mention was made of Nabis; it seemed by no means consistent for the liberator of Greece to have left a tyrant, who was not only a burden to his own country but a source of danger to all the cities in
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the neighbourhood, clinging to the vitals of a most famous state.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius, being aware of their feelings on this point, confessed that had it been possible without the destruction of Sparta, he would never have listened to any suggestion of peace with the tyrant;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> as it was, since he could not be crushed without causing the ruin of a most powerful state, it had seemed better that the tyrant be left helpless and almost entirely stripped of weapons with which to harm anyone, than to permit the city to be
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> destroyed by remedies too violent to be endured, and to perish in the very act of recovering its liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He added to his account of the past, that it was his intention to leave for Italy and take his entire army with him; within ten days they would hear that Demetrias and Chalcis had
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> been evacuated, and Acrocorinthus, under their own eyes, he would turn over to the Achaeans free from troops, that all might know whether the habit of lying belonged to the Romans or the Aetolians, who in all their talk had <pb id="p.545"/>spread abroad the story that
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the cause of liberty<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> had been unwisely entrusted to the Roman people, and that the Greeks had only changed masters, the Romans for the Macedonians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But these were men who weighed lightly what they said or did; he counselled the other states to judge their friends by their actions, not their words, and to reflect carefully on whom they should trust and against whom they should be on their guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They should use their liberty with discretion; controlled, it was salutary to individuals and to states; uncontrolled, it was both a burden to others and a source of impetuous and lawless action to its possessors. He advised the leaders in the states and the other orders to strive for harmony among themselves, and all the cities to take measures for the general good.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Against men who acted in unison neither king nor tyrant would be strong enough to do harm; strife and dissension furnished every opportunity to plotters, since the party which was defeated in an internal struggle would rather join hands with a foreigner than yield to a countryman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The liberty which had been gained by the arms of others and restored to them by the good faith of aliens, they should keep and guard by
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> their own efforts, that the Roman people might know that liberty had been given to men who deserved it and that their gift had been well bestowed.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When they heard these words, as from a father's lips, tears of joy dropped from every eye, so that they even interrupted him in the midst of his speech.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For a while there was the murmur of those who approved his words and of those who urged one another to let that utterance sink into the mind and heart as if it had been spoken by an oracle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then, <pb id="p.547"/>when they had become silent, he asked them that<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> any Roman citizens who might be in slavery in their states should be sought out and sent to him in Thessaly; it was unbecoming even for themselves that the liberators should be slaves in the land they had set free.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All cried out that they owed him thanks for this too, among other things, because he had reminded them to perform so just and necessary an obligation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was a great number of them, captives in the Punic War, whom Hannibal had sold when they were not ransomed by their relatives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is an indication of their number that Polybius writes that this cost the Achaeans one hundred talents, although they had fixed the price per head to be paid to their owners at five hundred <hi rend="italics">denarii.</hi> On that basis Achaea had one thousand two hundred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Calculate now, in proportion to this, how many there probably were in all Greece.</p> 
				<p>The meeting had not been dismissed when they saw the garrison coming down from Acrocorinthus, marching towards the gate, and departing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The commander followed their column with all the assembly attending him and proclaiming him
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> their preserver and liberator, and when he had taken leave of them and dismissed them he returned to Elatia over the same route by which he had come.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thence he sent his lieutenant Appius Claudius away with all his troops, with orders to march through Thessaly and Epirus to Oricum and await him there, for it was his intention to transport the army thence to Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He also wrote to his brother Lucius Quinctius, his lieutenant and commander of the fleet, to assemble there transports from all the coast of Greece.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He himself went to Chalcis, withdrawing the <pb id="p.549"/>garrisons not from Chalcis alone but from Oreus and<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> Eretria also, called a council there of the Euboean states and let them go after reminding
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> them in what condition he had found them and in what he was leaving them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> From there he proceeded to Demetrias; and having withdrawn the garrison
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he departed with all the citizens escorting him, as had happened at Corinth and Chalcis, and continued his journey to Thessaly, where there were the states not only to be set free, but also to be brought into some reasonable condition of order after all the chaos and confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For they had been thrown into confusion not only by the faults of the times and the king's lawless and violent behaviour, but also by the restless character of the people, which from the earliest times down to the present day has never conducted a meeting or an assembly or a council without dissension and rioting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He chose the senate and magistrates mainly on the basis of property and strove to make that element in the community more influential which found it advantageous to have everything peaceful and quiet.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had thus completed the organization of Thessaly, he marched through Epirus to Oricum, whence he planned to set sail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From Oricum all his troops were conveyed across to Brundisium. Thence they proceeded all the way through Italy to Rome in a virtual triumph, the captured articles forming as long a column as the troops which marched ahead of him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they arrived in Rome, Quinctius was granted an audience with the senate outside the city for the narration of his achievements, and a well-deserved triumph was voted by the eager senators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The triumph lasted <pb id="p.551"/>three days. On the first day the procession displayed<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> the arms, weapons, and statues of bronze and marble, more of which had been captured from Philip than received from the cities of Greece; and on the second day the gold and silver, wrought, unwrought, and minted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Of unwrought silver he had forty-three thousand two hundred and seventy pounds; of wrought silver there were many vases of all varieties, most of them embossed and some of remarkable workmanship; there were besides many fashioned from bronze, and in addition ten shields of silver.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Of minted silver there were eighty-four thousand Attic coins called <quote>tetrachma,</quote> and the weight of silver in them is about equivalent to three <hi rend="italics">denarii</hi> each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were three thousand seven hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, one shield made completely of gold, and fourteen thousand five hundred and fourteen gold coins with the image of Philip upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the third day one hundred and fourteen golden crowns, gifts from the cities, were carried past; the victims were in the procession, and in front of the chariot there were many noble prisoners and
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> hostages, among whom were Demetrius, the son of King Philip, and the Spartan Armenes, son of the tyrant Nabis. After them Quinctius himself entered the city. Following the chariot were throngs of soldiers, since the whole army had been brought back from the province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Each of these received in the distribution two hundred and fifty <hi rend="italics">asses</hi> for the infantry, twice that amount for the centurions, and thrice for the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A striking sight in the procession was furnished by the prisoners who had been released from slavery, following with

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Triumvirs were chosen to establish these colonies, whose authority should continue through three years; for the colony among the Brutti, Quintus Naevius, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and Marcus Furius Crassipes; for the colony in the land of Thurium, Aulus Manlius, Quintus Aelius, and Lucius Apustius. These two elections were conducted by the city praetor Gnaeus Domitius on the Capitoline.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> two years earlier the contract for its construction out of the money received as fines had been let out by the aediles Gaius Scribonius and Gnaeus Domitius, the latter of whom dedicated it while city praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Also, Quintus Marcius Ralla, a duumvir created for this purpose, dedicated a temple to Fortuna Primigenia on the Quirinal hill;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Publius Sempronius Sophus the consul had vowed this temple ten years before, during the Punic war, and as censor he had let the contract.<note>In <date value="-204">204 B.C.</date> (XXIX. xxxvi. 8) P.

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Likewise, on the Island, Gaius Servilius the duumvir dedicated a temple to Jupiter; it had been vowed six years before in the Gallic war by the praetor Lucius Furius Purpurio, and contracted for by the same man as consul.<note>In XXXI. xxi. 12 Furius vows a temple to Diiovis during his praetorship in <date value="-200">200 B.C.</date> In XXXV. xli. 8 Livy says that he vowed one temple to Jupiter while praetor and another while consul, and had both built on the Capitoline.</note> These were the events of that year.<note>This sentence has been misplaced, either by Livy or by a scribe, since the following chapter deals with the same year.</note></p> <pb id="p.555"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the following day the praetors were elected, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, Gaius Scribonius, Marcus Valerius Messala, Lucius Porcius Licinus, and Gaius Flaminius. At the Megalesian Games<note>These games in honour of the Magna Mater (see iii. 8 above and the note) were celebrated in April.</note> dramatic performances<note>They had been given for some time in connection with other games (XXXI. iv. 5 and the note).</note> were for the first time introduced by the curule aediles Aulus Atilius Serranus and Lucius Scribonius Libo.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At the Roman Games given by these aediles, the senate for the first time looked on segregated from
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the common people,<note>See xliv. 5 above.</note> and this caused gossip, as every novelty usually does, some thinking that this distinction, which should have been granted long before, was at last bestowed upon a most honourable body;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> others taking the view that whatever was added to the majesty of the senate was subtracted from the dignity of the commons, and that all such discriminations, which tended to draw the orders apart, were dangerous to impartial harmony and freedom.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For five hundred and fifty-eight years, they said, people had looked on from seats chosen at random; what had suddenly happened to make the Fathers unwilling to have the plebeians mingle with them in the crowd, or the rich man scorn the poor man as his neighbour at the show?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This was a novel and arrogant caprice, never desired nor practised by the senate of any other people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is reported that in the end even Africanus had repented that in his consulship he had suggested this innovation.<note>In xliv. 5 above Livy states that this proposal was made by the censors; however, Cicero (<hi rend="italics">de harusp. resp.</hi> 24) and Valerius Maximus (IV. v. 1; in II. iv. 3 he attributes it to Scipio Aemilianus) assert that it originated with Scipio.</note> So difficult it is to prove the need of any variation from ancient custom; people always prefer to stand by <pb id="p.557"/>the old ways, unless experience convincingly proves<note type="margin">B.C. 194</note> them bad.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the beginning of this year, the consulship -<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> of Lucius Cornelius and Quintus Minucius, earthquakes were reported with such frequency that people grew tired, not only of the cause itself, but of the ceremonies prescribed on that account;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> for the senate could not be convened nor public business transacted, since the consuls were busy with sacrifices and rites of expiation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Finally, the decemvirs were directed to consult the Books, and in accordance with their report a three-day period of prayer was ordered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Men with garlands on their heads made supplications at all the couches of the gods, and a decree was published that all who were of one family should offer their prayers collectively. Likewise, on the recommendation of the senate, the consuls proclaimed that on any day on which an earthquake had been reported and rites ordained, no one should report another earthquake.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the consuls first and afterwards the praetors drew lots for the provinces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Gaul fell to Cornelius, the Ligures to Minucius; the allotment to the praetors gave the city jurisdiction to Gaius Scribonius, that between citizens and aliens to Marcus Valerius, Sicily to Lucius Cornelius, Sardinia to Lucius Porcius, Nearer Spain to Gaius Flaminius, and Farther Spain to Marcus Fulvius.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though the consuls expected no war that year, a letter came from Marcus Cincius &mdash;he
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> was the prefect at Pisae &mdash;announcing that twenty thousand of the Ligures were in arms, had caused a conspiracy to be formed in all the towns of the whole tribe, and had first devastated the fields around Luna and then <pb id="p.559"/>had entered the territory of Pisae and overrun the<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> whole sea-coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Therefore Minucius, the consul to whom the Ligures had been allotted as his province, on the authorization of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the senate mounted the rostra and proclaimed that the two city legions which had been enlisted the previous year should assemble at Arretium the tenth day hence; in their place he would enrol two city legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Also he sent notice to the allies of the Latin confederacy, that is, to their magistrates and ambassadors, who were under the obligation to furnish soldiers,<note>The allies furnished troops by roster, so that not all of them were called on for men at the same time; usually those nearest the seat of war were selected when there was any freedom of choice.</note> that they should meet him on the Capitoline.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For these he made up a list amounting to fifteen thousand infantry and five
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> hundred cavalry, in accordance with the quota of young men in each state,<note>The levy was divided among the several states in proportion to population, and the consul's list gave to each the numbers of infantry and cavalry to be furnished.</note> and ordered them to go straight from the Capitoline to the gate and, in order to expedite the matter, proceed to hold the levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Fulvius and Flaminius each received three thousand Roman infantry and one hundred cavalry as reinforcements, with five thousand infantry of the allies and the Latin confederacy and two hundred cavalry, and the praetors were instructed to discharge their veterans on their arrival in the province.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When numerous soldiers who were in the city legions had appealed to the tribunes of the people to look into the cases of those who had given completed service or illness as bases for claims of exemption from military service, dispatches from Tiberius Sempronius put an end to their attempt:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> in these he wrote that ten thousand of the Ligures had entered the territory of Placentia and had laid it waste with slaughter and fire up to the very walls of the colony and the banks of the Po; the nation of the Boi was also considering a rebellion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For these reasons the <pb id="p.561"/>senate decreed that a state of civil war<note><hi rend="italics">Tumultus</hi> becomes almost a technical term for uprisings in Gaul; <hi rend="italics">cf., e.g.,</hi> XXXI. x. 1, 5; xi. 2; xlviii. 7.</note> existed, and<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> that it was their pleasure that the tribunes of the people should not investigate the cases of soldiers to prevent their mustering according to the proclamation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They added also that the allies of the Latin confederacy who had been in the army of Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius and had been discharged by those consuls should assemble on the day and at the place in Etruria which the consul Lucius Cornelius had announced in his proclamation, and that the consul Lucius Cornelius, on his way to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> province, should enlist, in the towns and rural districts along his route, whatever soldiers he saw fit, should arm them and lead them with him, and that he should have the privilege of discharging whichever of them he desired and at whatever time.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the consuls had conducted their levies and departed to their provinces, Titus Quinctius demanded that the senate should listen to an account of the arrangements which he, in concert with the ten commissioners, had made, and should, if it was their pleasure, ratify them by their vote;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> they would accomplish this more easily if they would hear the words of the ambassadors who had come from all Greece and a great part of Asia and those who had come from the kings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These embassies were introduced to the senate by the city praetor, Gaius Scribonius, and were accorded a courteous reception.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since the discussion with Antiochus was of longer duration, it was referred to the ten commissioners, part of whom had met the king either in Asia or at Lysimachia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Titus Quinctius was instructed to hear, in the company of the commissioners, what the king's ambassadors had to say, and to make such a reply <pb id="p.563"/>to them. as was consistent with the dignity and the<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> interest of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Menippus and Hegesianax were the leaders of the king's embassy. On their behalf, Menippus said that he did not see what there was in their embassy that was so difficult, since they had come merely to ask for friendship and conclude an alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There were three kinds of treaties, he said, by which states and kings concluded friendships: one, when in time of war terms were imposed upon the conquered; for when everything was surrendered to him who was the more powerful in arms, it is the victor's right and privilege to decide what of the conquered's property he wishes to confiscate; the second, when states that are equally matched in war conclude peace and friendship on terms of equality;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> under these conditions demands for restitution are made and granted by mutual agreement, and if the ownership of any property has been rendered uncertain by the war, these questions are settled according to the rules of traditional law or the convenience of each party;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the third exists when states that have never been at war come together to pledge mutual friendship in a treaty of alliance; neither party gives or accepts conditions; for that happens when a conquering and a conquered party meet. Since Antiochus was in this last class, he wondered on what account the Romans deemed it right to impose terms upon him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> prescribing what cities of Asia he was to leave free and independent and what he was to make tributary to him, and what cities they forbade the king's armies and the king to enter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For in that way it was proper to make peace with Philip, an enemy, but not a treaty of alliance with Antiochus, a friend.</p> <pb id="p.565"/>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quinctius replied thus: <quote>Since it is your<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> pleasure to discuss the matter systematically and to enumerate the different ways of establishing friendships, I shall set forth two conditions without which you may report to the king that there is no way to form a friendship with the Roman people:
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> first, that if he wishes us to have no interest in what concerns the cities of Asia, he too must himself keep entirely out of Europe;
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> second, that if he will not keep himself within the limits of Asia, but crosses into Europe, the Romans too shall have the right both to defend the existing friendships with the cities of Asia and to add new treaties of alliance.</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was indeed monstrous, replied Hegesianax, even to listen to a proposal that Antiochus should be excluded from the cities of Thrace and Chersonesus, districts which his forefather Seleucus, when
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he had defeated King Lysimachus in war and slain him in battle, had most honourably gained and bequeathed to his successors, and part of which, when they had been seized by the Thracians, Antiochus had with equal glory recovered in war, part of which, when abandoned, like Lysimachia itself, he had repopulated by recalling the inhabitants, and which, when destroyed by calamities and fires, he had rebuilt at great expense.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What kind of analogy was there then between the two cases, that Antiochus should be ousted from this possession, so acquired and so recovered, and that the Romans should keep out of Asia, which has never been theirs?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Antiochus is seeking the friendship of the Romans, but a friendship which when obtained will be a source of honour and not a cause for shame.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> To this Quinctius responded: <quote>Inasmuch as we are weighing the honourable, as it indeed ought to be <pb id="p.567"/>considered either the only or at least the first object<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> of concern to the foremost people of the world and to so great a king, which, pray, seems the more
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> honourable, to wish all the cities of Greece which are found everywhere to be free, or to make them slaves and tributaries?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If Antiochus believes it noble for him that the cities which his great-grandfather held by the law of war, but which his grandfather and his father never treated as their property, be reduced to slavery, then the Roman people
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> likewise considers it an obligation, imposed by its loyalty and consistency, not to abandon that championship of the liberty of the Greeks which it has taken upon itself.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As it liberated Greece from Philip, so it intends to free from Antiochus the cities of Asia which are of the Greek race.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For colonies were not sent out to Aeolis and Ionia to become the slaves of asking, but to increase the population and extend the influence of a most ancient people throughout the world.</quote></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At this Hegesianax hesitated, and could not deny that it was more honourable to go out under the banner of liberty than of slavery, and Publius Sulpicius, the eldest of the ten commissioners, said: <quote>Why not stop beating around the bush?
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Choose one of the two conditions so clearly stated by Quinctius a while ago, or cease to talk of friendship.</quote> <quote>But we,</quote> replied Menippus, <quote>have neither the desire nor the authority to make any settlement by which the power of Antiochus will be diminished.</quote></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The next day, when Quinctius had brought into the senate all the embassies from
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Greece and Asia, that they might know what was the attitude of the Roman people and what that of Antiochus towards the cities of Greece, he set forth both the king's <pb id="p.569"/>demands and his own:
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he bade them carry word<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> back to their states that with the same courage and the same fidelity with which the Roman people had won their liberty from Philip, they would win it from Antiochus if he did not retire from Europe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then Menippus began to beg both Quinctius and the Fathers not to make a hasty decision, as a result of which they would throw the whole world into confusion;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> let them both take for themselves and grant to the king time to consider; that he would be enabled to do so when the terms had been reported to him, and would either win some concession or else yield for the sake of peace. Accordingly the whole matter was postponed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was decided to send to the king the same ambassadors who had met him at Lysimachia, namely, Publius Sulpicius, Publius Villius, and Publius Aelius.<note>According to XXXIII. xxxix. 2 the earlier ambassadors were Lentulus, Villius, Terentius and Cornelius. There may have been another embassy which Livy has not mentioned.</note></p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They had hardly left the city when the ambassadors from Carthage reported that Antiochus was beyond doubt preparing for war with the aid of Hannibal, and created a feeling of anxiety lest a Punic war also was being provoked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hannibal, an exile from his country, had taken refuge with Antiochus, as has been said before, and was held in great honour by the king, for no other reason than that there could be no more suitable adviser for one who had long been revolving in his mind plans for an attack on Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His opinion was always one and the same, that the war should be waged in Italy;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Italy would supply both food and soldiers to a foreign enemy; if no disturbance was created there and the Roman people was permitted to use the man-power and the resources of Italy for a war outside of Italy, neither the king nor any people <pb id="p.571"/>could be a match for the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He asked for<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> himself a hundred warships, ten thousand infantry, and a thousand cavalry; with that fleet he would first visit -Africa; &mdash; he had great hopes that the Carthaginians too could be induced by him to revolt; if they hesitated, he would, in some part of Italy, arouse a war against the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king should cross to Europe with the rest of his army and hold his forces in some part of Greece, not crossing to Italy, yet prepared to cross, which would be sufficient to produce the impression and start the rumour of war.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had brought the king around to this opinion, and thought that he should prepare the minds of his countrymen for what he was going to do, he did not dare to write a letter lest, if intercepted by any chance, it reveal his designs;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> he found at Ephesus a Tyrian, Aristo by name, and having tested his resourcefulness on less important errands, he loaded him with gifts and also with the hope of rewards, to which even the king finally gave his assent, and sent him to Carthage with his instructions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He gave him the names of the persons whom he needed to meet, and provided him with secret modes of identification, by means of which they could be assured that the instructions were from him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When this Aristo arrived in Carthage, his reason for coming was discovered as quickly by the enemies of Hannibal as by his friends.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And at first the incident was discussed in conversations at social gatherings and at dinners;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> later, in the senate some said that nothing had been accomplished by the exile of Hannibal if, even when away, he could plot revolution and by stirring up men's minds disturb the security of the state;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> a <pb id="p.573"/>certain Aristo, a stranger from Tyre, had come<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> equipped with instructions from Hannibal and King Antiochus; every day certain individuals had secret conferences with him; schemes were being concocted in secret which would presently break out in the ruin of the entire community.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> All exclaimed that Aristo ought to be summoned and asked why he had come, and if he gave no good explanation, he should be sent to Rome in charge of ambassadors; they had already suffered enough punishment for the rashness of one man; private citizens might do wrong at their own risk, but the state should be saved not only from doing wrong but also from the reputation of doing wrong.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Aristo when summoned defended himself and made use of the strongest argument for his innocence, that he had brought no written communication to anyone;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> but he did not make entirely clear the reason why he had come, and was most noticeably at a loss when they charged him with having relations only with men of the Barcine faction.<note>The party of Hannibal; its name was derived from the name of the father of Hannibal, Hamilcar Barca (XXI. ii. 4).</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A violent debate then began, some arguing that he should be at once arrested as a spy and held under guard, others saying that there was no cause for measures that suggested martial law;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> it set a bad precedent to arrest strangers with no convincing proof, and the same treatment would be applied to Carthaginians, not only in Tyre but in other markets which they frequently visited.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A decision was not reached that day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Aristo, employing Carthaginian artifice against Carthaginians, as soon as it was dusk hung a written tablet over the place where the magistrates daily held their sessions, in the most crowded part of the city, and in the third watch went on board his ship and escaped. The next day, <pb id="p.575"/>when the <hi rend="italics">sufetes</hi><note>These officials, two in number, corresponded to the consuls at Rome, though etymologically the word is closer to the older title of praetor. The word <hi rend="italics">sufetes</hi> seems an attempt to express in Latin characters and sounds the Punic title.</note> took their seats to administer<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> justice, the tablet was seen, taken down, and read.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Its message was that Aristo had come with a private message for no man, but with a public errand to the elders &mdash;so they call their senate. The charge having thus been made general, the investigation of a few men was less vigorously pushed;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> nevertheless, it was voted that an embassy should be sent to Rome to report the whole affair to the consuls and the senate, and at the same time to complain about the injuries inflicted by Masinissa.</p> 
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Masinissa perceived that the good name of the Carthaginians was tarnished and that they were quarrelling among themselves, the nobles being suspected by the senate on account of their conferences with Aristo, the senate by
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the people on account of the declaration made by the same Aristo, considering that he had an opportunity to injure them, he both ravaged their coast and compelled certain cities which were dependents of the Carthaginians to pay their tribute to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They call this district Emporia; it is the coast of the lesser Syrtis and a fertile spot; one of its cities is Leptis, and this paid to the Carthaginians a tribute of one talent per day.<note>Excavations in this district in recent years have confirmed the general accuracy of Livy's brief description. There is as yet no comprehensive publication.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At this time Masinissa had endangered this whole region, and, with respect to part of it, had raised a question as to its ownership, whether it belonged to his kingdom or to the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And because he saw that they would go to Rome both to clear themselves and to complain of him, he likewise sent ambassadors to Rome for the double purpose of increasing Roman suspicions of them, by their insinuations, and of setting on foot an argument about the tribute-rights.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The <pb id="p.577"/>Carthaginians were first given audience, and with their<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> account of the Tyrian stranger they rendered the Fathers anxious lest they should have to fight with Antiochus and the Carthaginians at the same time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What most weighed against them was a suspicion due to the fact that they had set no guard over the person or ship of a man whom they had decided to arrest and send to Rome. Then the dispute with the king's envoys about the land began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Carthaginians maintained their case by their boundary-rights, because the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> district was within the limits which Publius Scipio, when he conquered them, had set for the land which should be under
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Carthaginian jurisdiction,<note>Livy's statement in XXX. xxxvii. 2 does not suggest that very precise boundaries had been fixed at this time.</note> and by the king's own admission, who, when he was pursuing Aphthir, a fugitive from his country, who was wandering around Cyrene with a party of Numidians, had requested, as a favour from them, a right of way through this very country as if it had without question belonged to the Carthaginians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Numidians charged that they were not telling the truth about the limits fixed by Scipio, and asked, if one wanted to determine the real origin of a property-right, what land in Africa was really Carthaginian. Coming there as strangers, they had been granted as a gift, for the purpose of building a city, as much land as they could encompass with the cut-up hide of a bull;<note>See Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Aeneid,</hi> I. 367-368.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> to whatever extent they had expanded beyond the limits of the Bursa,<note>The Bursa (cf. <foreign lang="greek">,</foreign> <quote>hide</quote>) was the citadel of Carthage and, according to Masinissa, the only territory in Africa to which they had any legitimate claim. It included the land encompassed by the bull's hide.</note> their seat, they had land gained by violence and without right.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As to the particular tract of land in question, they could not even prove that they had held it for any considerable time, and much less that they had held it continuously from the time they had begun to claim it. As occasion offered, now they and <pb id="p.579"/>now the Numidian kings had claimed the right to<note type="margin">B.C. 193</note> it, and possession had always remained with the party that was stronger in arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They asked that the land should remain in the condition in which it was before the Carthaginians became enemies to the Romans and the king of the Numidians their ally and friend and not to interfere to prevent that person from holding the land who was able to do so.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It was decided that the envoys of both states should receive the reply that they would send ambassadors to Africa to judge, on the actual ground, between the Carthaginian people and the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The ambassadors who were sent were Publius Scipio Africanus, Gaius Cornelius Cethegus, and Marcus Minucius Rufus, and after hearing the testimony and inspecting the place they left the matter undecided, without expressing an opinion in favour of either side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Whether they did this of their own accord or because they had been so instructed is not so certain as that this seemed expedient under the circumstances, that the case be left entirely undecided;
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> if this were not the case, Scipio alone, either from his knowledge of the affair or through his personal influence, since he deserved so well of both sides, could have settled the dispute by a nod.</p>

				<p>The Oppian law, which Gaius Oppius, tribune of the
					people, had proposed during the Punic war to limit the
					expenditures of the women, was repealed after great
					argument, though the principal speech against the
					abrogation of the law was made by Porcius Cato. He
					proceeded to Spain and pacified Nearer Spain in a war
					which broke out at Emporiae. Titus Quinctius Flamininus
					ended a successful war against the Lacedaemonians and
					Nabis their tyrant, granting them such a peace as he
					himself desired, and liberating Argos, which was under
					the control of the tyrant. In addition, the successes in
					Spain and against the Boi and the Insubres are recorded.
					The senate then for the first time watched the games apart
					from the commons. That this happened was the result
					of the action of the censors, Sextus Aelius Paetus and
					Gaius Cornelius Cethegus, and it was attended with great
					indignation on the part of the plebeians. Several colonies
					were founded. Marcus Porcius Cato triumphed over
					Spain. Titus Quinctius Flamininus, who had defeated
					Philip, king of the Macedonians, and Nabis, tyrant of
					the Lacedaemonians, for this reason celebrated a triumph
					lasting three days. Ambassadors of the Carthaginians
					announced that Hannibal, who had fled to Antiochus,
					was plotting war along with him. Hannibal, moreover,
					had tried, through Aristo, a Tyrian whom he had sent to
					Carthage without any written communications, to stir
					up the Carthaginians to make war.</p>
