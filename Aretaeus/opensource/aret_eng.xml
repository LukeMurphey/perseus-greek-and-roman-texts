					<div3 type="chapter" n="5"> <head>CHAPTER V. ON THE PAROXYSM OF EPILEPTICS</head>
						<p>* * * * sluggishness, vertigo, heaviness of the tendons, plethora
							and distension of the veins in the neck; and much nausea
							indeed after food, but also, not unfrequently, with abstinence,
							there is a faint nausea; and phlegm is often vomited; want of
							appetite and indigestion after little food: they have flatulence
							and meteorism in the hypochondria. These symptoms, indeed,
							are constant.</p>
						<p>But, if it be near the accession of the paroxysm, there are
							before the sight circular flashes of purple or black colours, or
							of all mixed together, so as to exhibit the appearance of the
							rainbow expanded in the heavens; noises in the ears; a heavy
							smell; they are passionate, and unreasonably peevish. They
							fall down then, some from any such cause as lowness of spirits,
							but others from gazing intently on a running stream, a rolling</p>
						<pb n="244"/>
						<p>wheel, or a turning top. But sometimes the smell of heavy
							odours, such as of the gagate stone (<hi rend="ital">jet</hi>), makes them fall
							down. In these cases, the ailment is fixed in the head, and
							from it the disorder springs; but, in others, it arises also from
							the nerves remote from the head, which sympathise with the
							primary organ. Wherefore the great fingers of the hands, and the
							great toes of the feet are contracted; pain, torpor, and trembling
							succeed, and a rush of them to the head takes place. If the
							mischief spread until it reach the head, a crash takes place,
							in these cases, as if from the stroke of a piece of wood, or of
							stone; and, when they rise up, they tell how they have been
							maliciously struck by some person. This deception occurs to
							those who are attacked with the ailment for the first time.
							But those to whom the affection has become habitual, whenever
							the disease recurs, and has already seized the finger, or is
							commencing in any part, having from experience a foreknowledge
							of what is about to happen, call, from among those who
							are present, upon their customary assistants, and entreat them
							to bind, pull aside, and stretch the affected members; and
							they themselves tear at their own members, as if pulling out
							the disease; and such assistance has sometimes put off the
							attack for a day. But, in many cases, there is the dread as of
							a wild beast rushing upon them, or the phantasy of a shadow;
							and thus they have fallen down.</p>
						<p>In the attack, the person lies insensible; the hands are
							clasped together by the spasm; the legs not only plaited
							together, but also dashed about hither and thither by the
							tendons. The calamity bears a resemblance to slaughtered
							bulls; the neck bent, the head variously distorted, for sometimes
							it is arched, as it were, forwards, so that the chin rests
							upon the breast; and sometimes it is retracted to the back, as
							if forcibly drawn thither by the hair, when it rests on this
							shoulder or on that. They gape wide, the mouth is dry; the
							tongue protrudes, so as to incur the risk of a great wound, or</p>
						<pb n="245"/>
						<p>of a piece of it being cut off, should the teeth come forcibly
							together with the spasm; the eyes rolled inwards, the eyelids
							for the most part are separated, and affected with palpitation;
							but should they wish to shut the lids they cannot bring them
							together, insomuch that the white of the eyes can be seen
							from below. The eyebrows sometimes relaxed towards the
							mesal space, as in those who are frowning, and sometimes
							retracted to the temples abnormally, so that the skin about the
							forehead is greatly stretched, and the wrinkles in the intersuperciliary
							space disappear: the cheeks are ruddy and quivering;
							the lips sometimes compressed together to a sharp point,
							and sometimes separated towards the sides, when they are
							stretched over the teeth, like as in persons smiling.</p>
						<p>As the illness increases lividity of countenance also supervenes,
							distension of the vessels in the neck, inability of speech
							as in suffocation; insensibility even if you call loudly. The
							utterance a moaning and lamentation; and the respiration a
							sense of suffocation, as in a person who is throttled; the pulse
							strong, and quick, and small in the beginning,--great, slow,
							and feeble in the end, and irregular throughout; tentigo of
							the genital organs. Such sufferings do they endure towards
							the end of the attack.</p>
						<p>But when they come to the termination of the illness, there
							are unconscious discharges of the urine, and watery discharges
							from the bowels, and in some cases an evacuation also of the
							semen, from the constriction and compression of the vessels, or
							from the pruriency of the pain, and titillation of the humours;
							for in these cases the pains are seated in the nerves. The
							mouth watery; phlegm copious, thick, cold, and, if you should
							draw it forth, you might drag out a quantity of it in the form
							of a thread. But, if with length of time and much pain, the
							matters within the chest ferment, but the restrained spirit
							(<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) agitates all things, and there is a convulsion and disorder
							of the same, a flood, as it were, of humours swells up to</p>
						<pb n="246"/>
						<p>the organs of respiration, the mouth, and the nose; and if
							along with the humours the spirit be mixed, it appears like
							the relief of all the former feelings of suffocation. They
							accordingly spit out foam, as the sea ejects froth in mighty
							tempests; and then at length they rise up, the ailment now
							being at an end. At the termination, they are torpid in their
							members at first, experience heaviness of the head, and loss
							of strength, and are languid, pale, spiritless, and dejected,
							from the suffering and shame of the dreadful malady.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="6"><head>CHAPTER VI. ON TETANUS</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">ETANUS</hi>, in all its varieties, is a spasm of an exceedingly
							painful nature, very swift to prove fatal, but neither easy to be
							removed. They are affections of the muscles and tendons
							about the jaws; but the illness is communicated to the whole
							frame, for all parts are affected sympathetically with the primary
							organs. There are three forms of the convulsion, namely,
							in a straight line, backwards, and forwards. Tetanus is in a
							direct line, when the person labouring under the distention is
							stretched out straight and inflexible. The contractions forwards
							and backwards have their appellation from the tension
							and the place; for that backwards we call Opisthotonos; and
							that variety we call Emprosthotonos in which the patient is
							bent forwards by the anterior nerves. For the Greek word
							<foreign lang="greek">TO/NOS</foreign> is applied both to a nerve, and to signify tension.</p>
						<p>The causes of these complaints are many; for some are apt
							to supervene on the wound of a membrane, or of muscles, or of
							punctured nerves, when, for the most part, the patients die; for,
							"spasm from a wound is fatal." And women also suffer from</p>
						<pb n="247"/>
						<p>this spasm after abortion; and, in this case, they seldom recover.
							Others are attacked with the spasm owing to a severe
							blow in the neck. Severe cold also sometimes proves a cause; for
							this reason, winter of all the seasons most especially engenders
							these affections; next to it, spring and autumn, but least of all
							summer, unless when preceded by a wound, or when any strange
							diseases prevail epidemically. Women are more disposed to tetanus
							than men, because they are of a cold temperament; but
							they more readily recover, because they are of a humid. With
							respect to the different ages, children are frequently affected,
							but do not often die, because the affection is familiar and akin
							to them; striplings are less liable to suffer, but more readily
							die; adults least of all, whereas old men are most subject
							to the disease, and most apt to die; the cause of this is
							the frigidity and dryness of old age, and the nature of the
							death. But if the cold be along with humidity, these
							spasmodic diseases are more innocent, and attended with less
							danger.</p>
						<p>In all these varieties, then, to speak generally, there is a
							pain and tension of the tendons and spine, and of the muscles
							connected with the jaws and cheek; for they fasten the lower
							jaw to the upper, so that it could not easily be separated even
							with levers or a wedge. But if one, by forcibly separating
							the teeth, pour in some liquid, the patients do not drink it but
							squirt it out, or retain it in the mouth, or it regurgitates by
							the nostrils; for the isthmus faucium is strongly compressed,
							and the tonsils being hard and tense, do not coalesce so as to
							propel that which is swallowed. The face is ruddy, and of
							mixed colours, the eyes almost immoveable, or are rolled about
							with difficulty; strong feeling of suffocation; respiration bad,
							distension of the arms and legs; subsultus of the muscles;
							the countenance variously distorted; the cheeks and lips tremulous;
							the jaw quivering, and the teeth rattling, and in certain
							rare cases even the ears are thus affected. I myself have beheld</p>
						<pb n="248"/>
						<p>this and wondered! The urine is retained, so as to induce
							strong dysuria, or passes spontaneously from contraction of
							the bladder. These symptoms occur in each variety of the
							spasms.</p>
						<p>But there are peculiarities in each; in Tetanus there is tension
							in a straight line of the whole body, which is unbent and
							inflexible; the legs and arms are straight.</p>
						<p>Opisthotonos bends the patient backward, like a bow, so
							that the reflected head is lodged between the shoulder-blades;
							the throat protrudes; the jaw sometimes gapes, but in some
							rare cases it is fixed in the upper one; respiration stertorous;
							the belly and chest prominent, and in these there is usually
							incontinence of urine; the abdomen stretched, and resonant if
							tapped; the arms strongly bent back in a state of extension;
							the legs and thighs are bent together, for the legs are bent in
							the opposite direction to the hams.</p>
						<p>But if they are bent forwards, they are protuberant at the
							back, the loins being extruded in a line with the back, the
							whole of the spine being straight; the vertex prone, the head
							inclining towards the chest; the lower jaw fixed upon the
							breast bone; the hands clasped together, the lower extremities
							extended; pains intense; the voice altogether dolorous; they
							groan, making deep moaning. Should the mischief then seize
							the chest and the respiratory organs, it readily frees the patient
							from life; a blessing this, to himself, as being a deliverance
							from pains, distortion, and deformity; and a contingency less
							than usual to be lamented by the spectators, were he a son
							or a father. But should the powers of life still stand
							out, the respiration, although bad, being still prolonged, the
							patient is not only bent up into an arch but rolled together
							like a ball, so that the head rests upon the knees,
							while the legs and back are bent forwards, so as to convey
							the impression of the articulation of the knee being dislocated
							backwards.</p>
						<pb n="249"/>
						<p>An inhuman calamity! an unseemly sight! a spectacle painful
							even to the beholder! an incurable malady! owing to the
							distortion, not to be recognised by the dearest friends; and
							hence the prayer of the spectators, which formerly would have
							been reckoned not pious, now becomes good, that the patient
							may depart from life, as being a deliverance from the pains
							and unseemly evils attendant on it. But neither can the
							physician, though present and looking on, furnish any assistance,
							as regards life, relief from pain or from deformity. For
							if he should wish to straighten the limbs, he can only do so
							by cutting and breaking those of a living man. With them,
							then, who are overpowered by the disease, he can merely sympathise.
							This is the great misfortune of the physician.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="7"><head>CHAPTER VII. ON ANGINA, OR QUINSEY</head>
						<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">NGINA</hi> is indeed a very acute affection, for it is a compression
							of the respiration. But there are two species of it; for it is
							either an inflammation of the organs of respiration, or an
							affection of the spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) alone, which contains the cause
							of the disease in itself.</p>
						<p>The organs affected are, the tonsils, epiglottis, pharynx,
							uvula, top of the trachea; and, if the inflammation spread, the
							tongue also, and internal part of the fauces, when they protrude
							the tongue outside the teeth, owing to its abnormal size;
							for it fills the whole of the mouth, and the protuberance
							thereof extends beyond the teeth. This species is called
							Cynanche, either from its being a common affection of those
							animals, or from its being a customary practice for dogs to
							protrude the tongue even in health.</p>
						<pb n="250"/>
						<p>The opposite symptoms attend the other species; namely,
							collapse of the organs, and diminution of the natural size,
							with intense feeling of suffocation, insomuch that it appears to
							themselves as if the inflammation had disappeared to the internal
							parts of the thorax, and had seized upon the heart and
							lungs. This we call Synanche, as if from the disease inclining
							inwardly and producing suffocation. It appears to me that
							this is an illness of the spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) itself, which has under-gone
							a morbid conversion to a hotter and drier state, without
							any inflammation of the organ itself. Nor is this any great
							wonder. For in the Charonæan caves the most sudden suffocations
							occur from no affection of any organ,<note n="1">The Charonæan ditches or pits
								here mentioned, were in Phrygia.
								See Strabo, xii. 8. They are mentioned
								by Galen, de usu partium,
								vii.; Epid.i.t.xvii. p. 10, ed. K”n;
								and Pliny, H.N. vii. 93. Their pestilential
								exhalations are often noticed
								by ancient authors.</note> but the persons
							die from one inspiration, before the body can sustain any
							injury. But likewise a man will be seized with <hi rend="ital">rabies</hi>, from
							respiring the effluvia of the tongue of a dog, without having
							been bitten. It is not impossible then, that such a change of
							the respiration should occur within, since many other phenomena
							which occur in a man bear a resemblance to external
							causes, such as juices which become spoiled both within and
							without. And diseases resemble deleterious substances, and
							men have similar vomitings from medicines and from fevers.
							Hence, also, it was not a wonderful thing, that in the
							plague of Athens, certain persons fancied that poisonous
							substances had been thrown into the wells in the Piræus
							by the Peloponnesians; for these persons did not perceive
							the affinity between a pestilential disease and deleterious
							substances.</p>
						<p>Cases of Cynanche are attended with inflammation of the
							tonsils, of the fauces, and of the whole mouth; the tongue
							protrudes beyond the teeth and lips; they have salivation, the</p>
						<pb n="251"/>
						<p>phlegm running out very thick and cold; they have their faces
							ruddy and swollen; their eyes protuberant, wide open, and
							red; the drink regurgitates by the nostrils. The pains
							violent, but obscured by the urgency of the suffocation; the
							chest and heart are in a state of inflammation; there is a longing
							for cold air, yet they inspire but little, until they are
							suffocated from the obstruction of the passage to the chest.
							In certain cases, there is a ready transference of the disease to
							the chest, and these die from the metastasis; the fevers feeble,
							slight, bringing no relief. But if, in any case, there is a turn
							to the better, abscesses form on either side, near the ears externally,
							or internally about the tonsils; and if these occur
							with torpor, and are not very protracted, the patients recover,
							indeed, but with pain and danger. But, if a particularly
							large swelling should occur, in such cases as are converted
							to an abscess, and the abscess is raised to a point, they
							are quickly suffocated. Such are the peculiar symptoms of
							cynanche.</p>
						<p>Those of Synanche are, collapse, tenuity, and paleness; the
							eyes hollow, sunk inwardly; the fauces and uvula retracted
							upwards, the tonsils approaching one another still more; loss
							of speech: the feeling of suffocation is much stronger in this
							species than in the former, the mischief being seated in the
							chest whence the source of respiration. In the most acute
							cases, the patients die the same day, in some instances, even
							before calling in the physician; and in others, although called
							in, he could afford them no relief, for they died before the
							physician could apply the resources of his art. In those in
							which the disease takes a favourable turn, all the parts become
							inflamed, the inflammation being determined outwardly, so
							that the disease becomes cynanche in place of synanche. It is
							also a good thing when a strong swelling, or erysipelas, appears
							externally on the chest. And the skilful physician diverts the
							mischief to the chest by means of the cupping-instrument, or</p>
						<pb n="252"/>
						<p>by applying mustard to the breast and the parts near the jaws
							he determines outwardly and discusses the disease. In certain
							cases, indeed, the evil by these means has been for a time driven
							outwards, but when so driven out it speedily reverts, and produces
							suffocation.</p>
						<p>The causes are infinite, more especially exposure to cold,
							and, less frequently, to heat; blows; fish-bones fixed in the
							tonsils, cold draughts, intoxication, repletion, and the ills from
							respiration.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="8"><head>CHAPTER VIII. ON THE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE UVULA</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> solid body suspended from the roof of the mouth
							between the two tonsils is called columella and gurgulio. Uva
							is the name of the affection. The columella (<hi rend="ital">uvula</hi>) is of a
							nervous nature, but humid, for it is situated in a humid
							region. Wherefore this body, the columella, suffers from
							various affections, for it becomes thickened from inflammation,
							being elongated and of equal thickness from the base to
							the extremity, and is attended with redness. Columna is the
							appellation of this affection. If it be rounded towards the
							extremity alone, and with its enlargement become livid and
							darkish, the name of the affection is Uva; for it altogether
							resembles a grape in figure, colour, and size. A third affection
							is that of the membranes when they have the appearance
							of broad sails, or the wings of bats, on this side and on that.
							This is called Lorum, for the lengthened folds of the membranes
							resemble thongs. But if the columella terminates in a
							slender and elongated membrane, having at its extremity a
							resemblance to the butt-end of a spear, it gets the name of</p>
						<pb n="253"/>
						<p>Fimbria. This affection arises spontaneously from a defluxion,
							like the others, but also from an oblique incision when the
							surgeon leaves the membrane at one side.<note n="1">Our author alludes here to
								the surgical operation, excision of
								the tonsils, described by Paulus
								Ægineta, vi. 30.</note> But if the organ
							(uvula) become bifid with two membranes hanging on this
							side and on that, it has no distinct appellation, but it is an
							easy matter for any one who sees it to recognise the nature of
							the disease.</p>
						<p>A sense of suffocation accompanies all these affections, and
							they can by no means swallow with freedom. There is cough
							in all the varieties, but especially in those named lorum and
							fimbria. For a titillation of the trachea is produced by the
							membrane, and in some cases it secretly instils some liquid
							into the windpipe, whence they cough. But in uva and
							columella there is still more dyspnœa and very difficult
							deglutition; for, in these cases, the fluid is squeezed up to the
							nostrils, from sympathy of the tonsils. The columella is
							common in old persons, the uva in the young and in adults;
							for they abound in blood, and are of a more inflammatory
							nature. The affections of the membranes are common in
							puberty and infancy. It is safe to apply the knife in all
							these varieties; but in the uva, while still red, hemorrhage,
							pains, and increase of inflammation supervene.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="9"><head>CHAPTER IX. ON ULCERATIONS ABOUT THE TONSILS</head>
						<p>U<hi rend="smallcaps">LCERS</hi> occur on the tonsils; some, indeed, of an ordinary
							nature, mild and innocuous; but others of an unusual kind,
							pestilential, and fatal. Such as are clean, small, superficial,
							without inflammation and without pain, are mild; but such as</p>
						<pb n="254"/>
						<p>are broad, hollow, foul, and covered with a white, livid,
							or black concretion, are pestilential. Aphtha is the name
							given to these ulcers. But if the concretion has depth, it
							is an Eschar and is so called: but around the eschar there is
							formed a great redness, inflammation, and pain of the veins, as
							in carbuncle; and small pustules form, at first few in number,
							but others coming out, they coalesce, and a broad ulcer is
							produced. And if the disease spread outwardly to the mouth,
							and reach the columella (<hi rend="ital">uvula</hi>) and divide it asunder, and if
							it extend to the tongue, the gums, and the alveoli, the teeth
							also become loosened and black; and the inflammation seizes
							the neck; and these die within a few days from the inflammation,
							fever, fœtid smell, and want of food. But, if it spread
							to the thorax by the windpipe, it occasions death by suffocation
							within the space of a day. For the lungs and heart can
							neither endure such smells, nor ulcerations, nor ichorous discharges,
							but coughs and dyspnœa supervene.</p>
						<p>The cause of the mischief in the tonsils is the swallowing of
							cold, rough, hot, acid, and astringent substances; for these parts
							minister to the chest as to the purposes of voice and respiration;
							and to the belly for the conveyance of food; and to the
							stomach for deglutition. But if any affection occur in the
							internal parts, namely, the belly, the stomach, or the chest, an
							ascent of the mischief by the eructations takes place to the
							isthmus faucium, the tonsils, and the parts there; wherefore
							children, until puberty, especially suffer, for children in particular
							have large and cold respiration; for there is most heat
							in them; moreover, they are intemperate in regard to food,
							have a longing for varied food and cold drink; and they bawl
							loud both in anger and in sport; and these diseases are
							familiar to girls until they have their menstrual purgation.
							The land of Egypt especially engenders it, the air thereof
							being dry for respiration, and the food diversified, consisting
							of roots, herbs of many kinds, acrid seeds, and thick drink;</p>
						<pb n="255"/>
						<p>namely, the water of the Nile, and the sort of ale prepared
							from barley. Syria also, and more especially Cœlosyria, engenders
							these diseases, and hence they have been named
							Egyptian and Syrian ulcers.</p>
						<p>The manner of death is most piteous; pain sharp and hot
							as from carbuncle;<note n="1">The term in the original,
								<foreign lang="greek">A)/NQRAC</foreign>, may either signify "a live
								coal," or the disease "Carbuncle."
								See Paulus Ægineta, iv. 25. It is
								somewhat doubtful to which of
								these significations our author applies
								it here; indeed, the former
								would be the more emphatic.</note> respiration bad, for their breath smells
							strongly of putrefaction, as they constantly inhale the same
							again into their chest; they are in so loathsome a state that
							they cannot endure the smell of themselves; countenance pale
							or livid; fever acute, thirst is if from fire, and yet they do not
							desire drink for fear of the pains it would occasion; for they
							become sick if it compress the tonsils, or if it return by the
							nostrils; and if they lie down they rise up again as not being
							able to endure the recumbent position, and, if they rise up,
							they are forced in their distress to lie down again; they mostly
							walk about erect, for in their inability to obtain relief they
							flee from rest, as if wishing to dispel one pain by another.
							Inspiration large, as desiring cold air for the purpose of refrigeration,
							but expiration small, for the ulceration, as if produced
							by burning, is inflamed by the heat of the respiration.
							Hoarseness, loss of speech supervene; and these symptoms
							hurry on from bad to worse, until suddenly falling to the
							ground they expire.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="10"><head>CHAPTER X. ON PLEURISY</head>
						<p>U<hi rend="smallcaps">NDER</hi> the ribs, the spine, and the internal part of the thorax
							as far as the clavicles, there is stretched a thin strong membrane,</p>
						<pb n="256"/>
						<p>adhering to the bones, which is named <hi rend="ital">succingens.</hi>
							When inflammation occurs in it, and there is heat with cough
							and parti-coloured sputa, the affection is named Pleurisy. But
							all these symptoms must harmonise and conspire together as
							all springing from one cause; for such of them as occur separately
							from different causes, even if they all occur together,
							are not called pleurisy. It is accompanied by acute pain of
							the clavicles; heat acrid; <hi rend="ital">decubitus</hi> on the inflamed side easy,
							for thus the membrane (<hi rend="ital">pleura</hi>) remains in its proper seat,
							but on the opposite side painful; for by its weight, the inflammation
							and suspension of the membrane, the pain stretches to
							all its adhesions at the shoulders and clavicles; and in certain
							cases even to the back and shoulder blade; the ancients called
							this affection Dorsal pleurisy. It is attended with dyspnœa, insomnolency,
							anorexia, florid redness of the cheeks, dry cough,
							difficult expectoration of phlegm, or bilious, or deeply tinged
							with blood, or yellowish; and these symptoms observe no
							order, but come and go irregularly; but, worst of all, if the
							bloody sputa cease, and the patients become delirious; and
							sometimes they become comatose, and in their somnolency
							the mind wavers.</p>
						<p>But if the disease take a bad turn, all the symptoms getting
							worse, they die within the seventh day by falling into syncope;
							or, if the commencement of the expectoration, and the
							more intense symptoms occurred with the second hebdomad,
							they die on the fourteenth day. It sometimes happens that
							in the intermediate period there is a transference of all the
							symptoms to the lungs; for the lung attracts to itself, being
							both porous and hot, and being moved for the attraction of
							the substances around, when the patient is suddenly suffocated
							by metastasis of the affection. But if the patient pass this
							period, and do not die within the twentieth day, he becomes
							affected with empyema. These, then, are the symptoms if
							the disease get into a bad state.</p>
						<pb n="257"/>
						<p>But if it take a favourable turn, there is a profuse hemorrhage
							by the nostrils, when the disease is suddenly resolved;
							then follow sleep and expectoration of phlegm, and afterwards
							of thin, bilious matters; then of still thinner, and again of
							bloody, thick, and flesh-like; and if, with the bloody, the bile
							return, and with it the phlegm, the patient's convalescence is
							secure; and these symptoms, if they should commence on the
							third day, with an easy expectoration of smooth, consistent,
							liquid, and (not) rounded sputa, the resolution takes place on
							the seventh day, when, after bilious discharges from the
							bowels, there is freedom of respiration, the mind settled, fever
							diminishing, and return of appetite. But if these symptoms
							commence with the second week, the resolution occurs on the
							fourteenth day.</p>
						<p>But if not so, it is converted into Empyema, as indicated
							by rigors, pungent pains, the desire of sitting erect, and the
							respiration becoming worse. It is then to be dreaded, lest,
							the lungs suddenly attracting the pus, the patient should be
							thereby suffocated, after having escaped the first and greater
							evils. But if the abscess creep in between the ribs and separate
							them, and point outwardly; or, if it burst into an intestine,
							for the most part the patient recovers.</p>
						<p>Among the seasons of the year winter most especially engenders
							the disease; next, autumn; spring, less frequently;
							but summer most rarely. With regard to age, old men are
							most apt to suffer, and most readily escape from an attack;
							for neither is there apt to be a great inflammation in an arid
							frame; nor is there a metastasis to the lungs, for old age is
							more frigid than any other age, and the respiration small, and
							the attraction of all things deficient. Young men and adults
							are not, indeed, very apt to suffer attacks; but neither, also, do
							they readily recover, for from a slight cause they would not
							experience even a slight attack of inflammation, and from
							great attacks there is greater danger. Children are least of all</p>
						<pb n="258"/>
						<p>liable to pleurisy, and in their case it is less frequently fatal;
							for their bodies are rare, secretions copious, perspiration and
							exhalation abundant; hence neither is a great inflammation
							formed. This is the felicity of their period of life in the
							present affection.</p>

						<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">NIMALS</hi> live by two principal things, food and breath (<hi rend="ital">spirit,
							pneuma</hi>); of these by far the most important is the respiration,
							for if it be stopped, the man will not endure long, but immediately
							dies. The organs of it are many, the commencement
							being the nostrils; the passage, the trachea; the containing
							vessel, the lungs; the protection and receptacle of the lungs,
							the thorax. But the other parts, indeed, minister only as instruments
							to the animal; but the lungs also contain the cause
							of attraction, for in the midst of them is seated a hot organ,
							the heart, which is the origin of life and respiration. It
							imparts to the lungs the desire of drawing in cold air, for it
							raises a heat in them; but it is the heart which attracts. If,
							therefore, the heart suffer primarily, death is not far off.</p>
						<p>But if the lungs be affected, from a slight cause there is
							difficulty of breathing; the patient lives miserably, and death
							is the issue, unless some one effects a cure. But in a great
							affection, such as inflammation, there is a sense of suffocation,</p>
						<pb n="262"/>
						<p>loss of speech and of breathing, and a speedy death. This is
							what we call Peripneumonia, being an inflammation of the
							lungs, with acute fever, when they are attended with heaviness
							of the chest, freedom from pain, provided the lungs alone are
							inflamed; for they are naturally insensible, being of loose
							texture, like wool. But branches of the aspera arteria are
							spread through them, of a cartilaginous nature, and these,
							also, are insensible; muscles there are nowhere, and the nerves
							are small, slender, and minister to motion. This is the cause
							of the insensibility to pain. But if any of the membranes, by
							which it is connected with the chest, be inflamed, pain also is
							present; respiration bad, and hot; they wish to get up into an
							erect posture, as being the easiest of all postures for the respiration.
							Ruddy in countenance, but especially the cheeks; the
							white of the eyes very bright and fatty; the point of the nose
							flat; the veins in the temples and neck distended; loss of appetite;
							pulse, at first, large, empty, very frequent, as if forcibly
							accelerated; heat indeed, externally, feeble, and more humid
							than natural, but, internally, dry, and very hot, by means of
							which the breath is hot; there is thirst, dryness of the tongue,
							desire of cold air, aberration of mind; cough mostly dry, but
							if anything be brought up it is a frothy phlegm, or slightly
							tinged with bile, or with a very florid tinge of blood. The
							blood-stained is of all others the worst.</p>
						<p>But if the disease tend to a fatal termination, there is insomnolency;
							sleep brief, heavy, of a comatose nature; vain
							fancies; they are in a doting state of mind, but not violently
							delirious; they have no knowledge of their present sufferings.
							If you interrogate them respecting the disease, they will not
							acknowledge any formidable symptom; the extremities cold;
							the nails livid, and curved; the pulse small, very frequent, and
							failing, in which case death is near at hand, for they die
							mostly on the seventh day.</p>
						<p>But if the disease abate and take a favourable turn, there is</p>
						<pb n="263"/>
						<p>a copious hemorrhage from the nose, a discharge from the
							bowels of much bilious and frothy matters, such as might seem
							to be expelled from the lungs to the lower belly, provided it
							readily brings off much in a liquid state. Sometimes there is a
							determination to the urine. But they recover the most speedily
							in whose cases all these occur together.</p>
						<p>In certain cases much pus is formed in the lungs, or there is
							a metastasis from the side, if a greater symptom of convalescence
							be at hand. But if, indeed, the matter be translated
							from the side to the intestine or bladder, the patients immediately
							recover from the peripneumony; but they have a
							chronic abscess in the side, which, however, gets better. But
							if the matter burst upon the lungs, some have thereby been
							suffocated, from the copious effusion and inability to bring it
							up. But such as escape suffocation from the bursting of the
							abscess, have a large ulceration in the lungs, and pass into
							phthisis; and from the abscess and phthisis old persons do not
							readily recover; but from the peripneumony, youths and adults.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="2"><head>CHAPTER II. ON THE BRINGING UP OF BLOOD</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HERE</hi> are two species of the discharge of blood by the mouth.
							The one that by the mouth from the head and the vessels there;
							the passage is by the palate and fauces, where are situated the
							commencement of the œsophagus and trachea; and with
							hawking, and small and more urgent cough, they eructate the
							blood into the mouth; whereas, in that from the mouth,
							neither does hawking accompany, and it is called <hi rend="ital">Emptysis</hi> [<hi rend="ital">or</hi>
							spitting of blood]. But when the discharge is more scanty,
							and by drops, or when it comes more copiously from the head,</p>
						<pb n="264"/>
						<p>or from the mouth, it is no longer called a bringing up, but
							either the same, or a spitting, or a hemorrhage. But if it
							ascend from the chest, and the viscera there, the lungs, aspera
							arteria, the parts about the spine, the discharge from these is
							not called a spitting, but a bringing up (in Greek, <foreign lang="greek">A)NAGWGH/</foreign>,
							the name being expressive of its coming upwards).<note n="1">Cælius Aurelianus, under the
								head of "Sanguinis fluor," thus
								explains the term:--"Improprium
								est enim fluorem vocare id quod
								ascensu quodam non lapsu fertur.
								Sed hæc Græci versa vice posuerunt,
								derivationem nominis intuentes.
								Hi enim anagogen vocant
								quod magis ex inferioribus ad superiora
								fluorem significat.'--<hi rend="ital">Tard.
									pass.</hi> iii. 9. We are at a loss for a
								proper vocable in English to express
								this term. It is usually
								translated <hi rend="ital">rejectio</hi> in Latin, which,
								however, is not sufficiently expressive.
								The most suitable in
								English, which I can think of, is
								"a bringing up."</note></p>
						<p>The symptoms of both are partly common, small and few in
							number, such as the seat of them, in which there is a coincidence
							between the bringing up and the spitting. But the peculiarities
							of each are great, many, and of vital importance, by which it
							is easy to distinguish either of them from the other. If,
							therefore, it came from the head, with a large discharge of
							blood, greater and more numerous symptoms will arise, but
							scanty from a slight and small spitting; in these cases, there is
							heaviness of the head, pain, noises of the ears, redness of
							countenance, distension of the veins, vertigo; and these are
							preceded by some obvious cause, such as a blow, exposure to
							cold, or heat, or intoxication; for drinking of wine speedily fills
							the head, and speedily empties it, by the bursting of a vessel;
							but from a slight intoxication there may be spitting, proceeding
							from rarefaction. Occasionally an habitual hemorrhage from the
							nostrils is stopped, and being diverted to the palate, produces
							the semblance of a bringing up of blood. If, therefore, it be
							from the head, there is titillation of the palate, frequent hawking,
							and with it a copious spitting takes place; a desire supervenes,
							and they readily cough. But if it flow into the aspera</p>
						<pb n="265"/>
						<p>arteria from the palate, they then bring it up by coughing,
							and this it is which deceives them into the supposition that it
							comes from the viscera below. It runs, also, from the head
							into the stomach, when it is vomited up with nausea, and thus
							proves a source of deception, as appearing to come from the
							stomach. The blood brought up by spitting is not very thick,
							but dark in colour, smooth, consistent, unmixed with other
							substances; for, being hawked up, it comes immediately upon
							the tongue in a round shape, being readily separated; and if
							you examine the roof of the palate, you will find it thickened
							and ulcerated, and, for the most part, bloody; and a slight
							and simple plan of treatment will suffice, namely, astringents
							applied to the palate in a cold state; for by hot, relaxing, and
							dilating applications the flow is increased, and this is an indication
							that the spitting is from the head, in which case evacuations
							are to be made from the head by the veins, the nostrils,
							or by any other channel of discharge. And these things must
							be done speedily; for if the blood is discharged a considerable
							time, the flow will become permanent, and the parts there will
							contract the habit of receiving the blood. The trachea, also,
							becomes ulcerated, and the patients cough instead of hawking;
							and this proves the commencement of a consumption.</p>
						<p>The flow of blood from the chest and viscera below is called
							a bringing up (in Greek, <foreign lang="greek">A)NAGWGH/</foreign>). It is truly of a fatal
							nature, if it proceed from any of the vital parts which are
							ruptured--either the <hi rend="ital">vena cava</hi> in the heart, which conveys
							the blood from the liver, or from the large vein which lies
							along the spine. For from hemorrhage, as from slaughtering
							or impeded respiration, death is very speedy. But in those
							cases in which the blood comes from the lungs, the side, or
							the trachea, they do not die so speedily; but, nevertheless, they
							become affected with Empyema and Phthisis. Of these the
							least formidable is that from the trachea. But if the vomiting
							come from the stomach or bowels, the cases are not of a very</p>
						<pb n="266"/>
						<p>fatal nature, even though the hemorrhage be large; neither is
							the recovery slow and changeable. But if it proceed from the
							liver and spleen, it is neither readily nor constantly discharged
							upwards, but the defluxion is more easy into the stomach and
							intestines. Yet neither is the discharge upwards by the lungs
							impossible or incredible, for in fevers there occur hemorrhages
							of blood from the liver and spleen by the nostrils, the blood
							flowing from the nostril on the same side as the viscus from
							which it comes. These, then, are the places from which the
							blood comes in the bringing up, and such the differences as to
							danger or mortality.</p>
						<p>But the modes are three; for it is brought up either from
							rupture of a vessel, or from erosion, or from rarefaction.
							Rupture, then, takes place suddenly, either from a blow,
							straining at a load, or lifting a weight upward, or a leap from
							a height, or from bawling aloud, from violent passion, or some
							other similar cause, when blood is instantly poured forth from
							the vessel in great quantity.</p>
						<p>But if it proceed from erosion, the patient is to be interrogated
							if he ever had a cough before, or was affected with
							dyspnœa, and whether nausea or vomiting ever afflicted him
							previously. For from such chronic affections the vessels are
							corroded by a continued, copious, and acrid defluxion. When,
							therefore, the containing vessels, having been long wasted and
							attenuated, at length give way, they pour forth blood.</p>
						<p>But the mode by rarefaction is, indeed, unattended by rupture,
							and on that account the discharge is neither copious nor
							sudden, nor does it consist of thick blood; for by the rarefaction
							of the vessels, the thin portion is excreted. But if
							much collect in a cavity, and be again brought up, it becomes
							thicker than natural, but yet not very thick, neither black,
							like a clot; but it is quickly brought up in greater quantity,
							as being from a collection. This mode of bringing up blood
							is common with women who have not their monthly purgation,</p>
						<pb n="267"/>
						<p>and appears at the periods of the purgation, and stops
							during the intervals between them; and if the woman is not
							cured, the discharge upwards of blood will revert for many
							periods, and also, in certain cases, the vessels burst from
							fulness.</p>
						<p>And there is a difference of the discharge, whether it be
							brought up from an artery or a vein. For it is black, thick,
							and readily coagulates, if from a vein; it is less dangerous, and is
							more speedily stopped; but if from an artery, it is of a bright
							yellow colour and thin, does not readily coagulate, the danger
							is more imminent, and to stop it is not so easy; for the pulsations
							of the artery provoke the hemorrhage, and the lips of the
							wound do not coalesce from the frequent movements of the
							vessel.</p>
						<p>Recovery, if from erosion, is protracted, difficult, and doubtful;
							for, owing to loss of substance, the parts of the ulcer do
							not come together, for it is an ulcer, and not a wound; and
							adhesion takes place more readily in ruptures, for the lips of
							the wound touch one another. This, then, is another difference
							as to danger. The mode attended with least danger is that
							from rarefaction; and in it the styptic and refrigerant method
							of treatment is sufficient.</p>
						<p>The places are to be indicated from which the blood is
							brought up; for many of the symptoms are common, deception
							is easy, and the cure different. Blood, then, from erosion
							is not readily brought up from the stomach, for the coldness
							and stypticity of the articles of food and drink bring the parts
							to a state of condensation. Neither, also, are cases from erosion
							common, although more so than the former; for acrid defluxions
							do not adhere for any length of time, but are either
							brought up or are passed downwards. Rupture is more common
							in the stomach. If, then, any rupture take place, the
							hemorrhage is not very great, such as that from the thorax;
							for the veins there are slender, and the arteries also are small.</p>
						<pb n="268"/>
						<p>But in appearance the blood is not very black, not intensely
							yellowish, smooth, or mixed with saliva, being brought up
							with nausea and vomiting, slight cough, sometimes with some
							discharge, and sometimes alone, without any expectoration;
							for the trachea sympathises with the gullet, being extended
							along and connected with it. There is pinching or constriction
							of the ulcer from the things swallowed, more especially if
							they are very cold, hot, or austere; and in certain cases
							pain is produced in the stomach, extending as far as the back;
							vomitings of phlegm, and sometimes, when the disease is long
							protracted, and there has been long abstinence from food, they
							bring up a great quantity of them; fevers, not of a continual
							type, but of an irregular kind.</p>
						<p>But, from the stomach, what is brought up may be black
							and coagulated, even if it proceed from an artery; but if it
							proceed from a vein, it is much blacker and much more compact;
							much nausea and vomiting of pituitous and bilious
							matter; blood mixed up with the food, provided the man had
							eaten previously, for both the food and the blood are collected
							together in the same place; eructations frequent and fœtid,
							and, if much collect together, there is anxiety of mind and
							vertigo; but if these be vomited they are relieved. They are
							prostrate in strength, generally affected with a burning heat,
							and constant pain of the stomach.</p>
						<p>But from the aspera arteria they bring up scanty and very
							fluid blood, with a cough; or, if they do not bring it up, they
							cough incessantly. There is a painful feeling in the throat,
							either a little below or above; voice hoarse and indistinct.</p>
						<p>But if it be from the lungs, the discharge is copious, especially
							if from erosion, with much cough, of an intense yellow
							colour, frothy, rounded; so that what is brought up from one
							part may be distinguished from what is brought up from
							another. But the defluxion, though contained in a common
							vessel, from the chest, is diversified after mixture, and you</p>
						<pb n="269"/>
						<p>may distinguish parts of them as being portions of the thorax,
							and parts which have a fleshy appearance as being portions of
							the lungs. There is heaviness of the chest, freedom from pain,
							and much redness of the face, particularly in these cases.</p>
						<p>But if brought up from the thorax, pain stretching to the
							anterior part of the breast is indicative of the ruptured part;
							cough intense, expectoration difficult, the blood not very fluid,
							moderately thick, without froth. But if, in passing, the lung
							be affected by consent, a certain amount of froth is imparted
							to it, for the passage from the chest to the trachea is by the
							lungs.</p>
						<p>But if, indeed, from the side there be discharged with cough
							blood which is black, smooth, fœtid, stinking, as from putrefaction,
							with acute pain of the side, many die after the manner
							of pleuritics with fever.</p>
						<p>A season that is humid and hot engenders these affections.
							Spring is thus humid and hot. Next the summer; autumn
							less, but winter least of all. They die in summer mostly from
							hemorrhage, for great inflammations do not readily occur
							then; secondly, in spring, from inflammation and ardent
							fevers; but in autumn, attacks of <hi rend="ital">phthisis</hi> readily occur.</p>
						<p>In a word, every discharge of blood upwards, even if small,
							and although the ruptured vessels may have already united, is
							attended with lowness of spirits, dejection, and despair of life.
							For who is so firm in mind as to see himself enduring a state
							resembling that of a slaughtered animal, and yet have no fear of
							death? For the largest and most powerful animals, such as bulls,
							die very quickly from loss of blood. That, however, is no great
							wonder. But this is a mighty wonder: in the discharge from the
							lungs alone, which is particularly dangerous, the patients do
							not despair of themselves, even although near the last. The
							insensibility of the lungs to pain appears to me to be the cause
							of this; for pain, even although slight, makes one to fear
							death, and yet, in most cases, it is more dreadful than pernicious;</p>
						<pb n="270"/>
						<p>whereas the absence of pain, even in the great illnesses,
							is attended with absence of the fear of death, and is more
							dangerous than dreadful.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="3"><head>CHAPTER III. ON SYNCOPE</head>
						<p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">ELL</hi> by all means has the physician, and well have the common
							people succeeded in the appellation of this affection! It
							is, indeed, the name of a very acute malady; for what is there
							greater or more acute than the power of <hi rend="ital">Syncope ?</hi> and what
							other name more appropriate for the designation of this
							matter? what other organ more important than the heart for
							life or for death? Neither is it to be doubted that syncope is
							a disease of the heart, or that it is an injury of the vital powers
							thereof--such is the rapidity and such the mode of the destruction.
							For the affection is the solution of the bonds of the vital
							power, being antagonistic to the constitution of the man; for
							having seized fast thereon, it does not let go its hold, but
							brings him to dissolution. Nor is it any great wonder; for
							other diseases are peculiar to, and prove fatal to, certain organs,
							in which they are engendered, and to which they attach
							themselves. Thus pestilential and very malignant buboes
							derive their origin from the liver, but from no other part;
							tetanus, in like manner, from the nerves, and epilepsy from
							the head. Thus, therefore, syncope is a disease of the heart
							and of life. But such persons as regard it to be an affection of
							the stomach, because by means of food and wine, and in
							certain cases by cold substances, the powers have been restored
							and the mischief expelled--these, it would seem to me, ought
							to hold phrenitis to be a disease of the hair and skin of the</p>
						<pb n="271"/>
						<p>head, since the phrenitics are relieved by the shaving and
							wetting thereof. But to the heart the vicinity of the stomach
							is most important, for from it the heart draws both what is
							suitable and what is unsuitable to itself. And by the lungs
							the heart draws spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) for respiration, but yet the
							lungs do not hold a primary place in respiration; for the
							powers are not in the organs, but there where is the original
							of life and strength: But the stomach is neither the original
							nor seat of life; and yet one would be injured by atony thereof:
							for food which proves injurious to the heart does not hurt
							the stomach itself, but by it the heart; since those dying in
							such cases have symptoms of heart-affections, namely, pulse
							small and feeble, <hi rend="ital">bruit</hi> of the heart, with violent palpitation,
							vertigo, fainting, torpor, loss of tone in their limbs, sweating
							copious and unrestrainable, coldness of the whole body, insensibility,
							loss of utterance. How should the stomach endure
							such symptoms? For those peculiar to it are nausea, vomiting,
							loss of appetite, hiccup, eructation, acidity; whereas in
							cardiac affections the patients are more acute in their senses,
							so that they see and hear better than formerly; they are also
							in understanding more sound, and in mind more pure, not
							only regarding present things, but also with regard to futurity
							they are true prophets. These, then, are the powers, not of
							the stomach, but of the heart, where is the soul and the nature
							thereof, and to it is to be referred this affection of its powers.</p>
						<p>But this form of disease is a solution of the natural tone
							from a cold cause and humidity, and therefore they are not
							affected with heat, either internally or externally, neither do
							they suffer from thirst, and their breath is cold even when the
							disease proceeds from strong and ardent fevers, by which syncope
							is usually kindled up. For when nature is strong, and
							of the proper temperament, it rules all and commands all,
							whether humour, spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), or solid, and, by their good
							order and symmetry, regulates the man in life; but if the bond</p>
						<pb n="272"/>
						<p>of nature--that is to say, its tone--be dissolved, then this
							affection is produced. The original of it is <hi rend="ital">causus</hi>, which is in
							this form.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="4"><head>CHAPTER IV. ON CAUSUS, OR ARDENT FEVER</head>
						<p>H<hi rend="smallcaps">EAT</hi>, indeed, everywhere, both acrid and subtil, but especially
							in the internal parts; respiration hot, as if from fire;
							inhalation of air large; desire of cold; dryness of tongue;
							parchedness of lips and skin; extremities cold; urine intensely
							tinged with bile; insomnolency; pulse frequent, small, and
							feeble; eyes clear, glancing, reddish; healthy colour of the
							countenance.</p>
						<p>But if the affection increase, all appearances become greater
							and worse; the pulse very small and very frequent; heat very
							dry and very acrid; intellect wavering; ignorance of all
							things; they are thirsty; a desire to touch anything cold,
							whether a wall, a garment, the floor, or a fluid; hands cold,
							palms thereof very hot, nails livid; breathing thick; perspiration
							like dew about the forehead and clavicles.</p>
						<p>But if nature attain the extremity of dryness and of heat,
							the hot is converted into cold, and the parched into humidity;
							for extreme intensities of things change to the opposite state.
							When, therefore, the bonds of life are dissolved, this is syncope.
							Then is there an irrestrainable sweat over all the body;
							respiration cold, much vapour about the nostrils; they have
							no thirst, and yet the other parts are parched except the
							organs of thirst, namely, the mouth and stomach; the urine
							thin and watery; belly for the most part dry, yet in certain
							cases the discharges are scanty and bilious; a redundancy of</p>
						<pb n="273"/>

							all parts, as in a river, there is a current outwards.</p>
						<p>As to the state of the soul, every sense is pure, the intellect
							acute, the gnostic powers prophetic; for they prognosticate to
							themselves, in the first place, their own departure from life;
							then they foretell what will afterwards take place to those present,
							who fancy sometimes that they are delirious; but these
							persons wonder at the result of what has been said. Others,
							also, talk to certain of the dead, perchance they alone perceiving
							them to be present, in virtue of their acute and pure sense,
							or perchance from their soul seeing beforehand, and announcing
							the men with whom they are about to associate. For
							formerly they were immersed in humours, as if in mud and
							darkness; but when the disease has drained these off, and
							taken away the mist from their eyes, they perceive those
							things which are in the air, and with the naked soul become
							true prophets. But those who have attained such a degree of
							refinement in their humours and understanding will scarcely

						<p>C<hi rend="smallcaps">HOLERA</hi> is a retrograde movement of the <hi rend="ital">materiel</hi> in the
							whole body on the stomach, the belly, and the intestines; a
							most acute illness. Those matters, then, which collect in the

							belly, and intestines, by the passages downwards. With regard
							to appearance, then, those things which are first discharged
							by vomiting, are watery; but those by the anus, liquid and</p>
						<pb n="274"/>
						<p>fetid excrement, (for continued indigestion is the cause of
							this disease); but if these are washed out, the discharges are
							pituitous, and then bilious. At first, indeed, they are borne
							easily, and without pain; but afterwards the stomach is
							affected with retchings, and the belly with tormina.</p>
						<p>But, if the disease become worse, the tormina get greater;
							there is fainting, prostration of strength in the limbs, anxiety,
							loss of appetite; or, if they take anything, with much rumbling
							and nausea, there is discharged by vomiting bile intensely
							yellow, and the downward discharges are of like kind;
							spasm, contractions of the muscles in the legs and arms; the
							fingers are bent; vertigo, hiccup, livid nails, frigidity, extremities
							cold, and altogether they are affected with rigors.</p>
						<p>But if the disease tend to death, the patient falls into a
							sweat; black bile, upwards and downwards; urine retained
							in the bladder by the spasm; but, in fact, sometimes neither is
							there any urine collected in the bladder, owing to the metastasis
							of the fluids to the intestine; loss of utterance;
							pulse very small, and very frequent in the cases affected with
							syncope; continual and unavailing strainings to vomit; the
							bowels troubled with tenesmus, dry, and without juices; a
							painful and most piteous death from spasm, suffocation, and
							empty vomiting.</p>

						<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> inflammation takes place in the intestines, creating a
							deadly pain, for many die of intense tormina; but there is
							also formed a cold dull flatus (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), which cannot readily
							pass either upwards or downwards, but remains, for the most
							part rolled up in the small convolutions of the upper intestines,
							and hence the disease has got the appellation of <hi rend="ital">Ileus</hi> (<hi rend="ital">or
								Volvulus</hi>). But if in addition to the tormina, there be compression
							and softening of the intestines, and the abdomen

						<p>The cause of Ileus is a continued corruption of much
							multifarious and unaccustomed food, and repeated acts of indigestion,
							especially of articles which are apt to excite Ileus,
							as the ink of the cuttle-fish. And the same effects may be
							expected from a blow, or cold, or the drinking of cold water
							largely and greedily in a state of sweating; and in those cases,
							in which the gut has descended into the scrotum with fæces,
							and has not been replaced into the belly, or has been restored
							to its place with violence, in such cases it is customary for the</p>
						<pb n="276"/>
						<p>lower intestines to get inflamed.<note n="2">The substance of all the
							information
							to be found in the
							works of the ancient authorities
							on the subject of Hernia, may be
							seen in Paulus Ægineta, b.vi., 65, p.
							66, Syd. Soc. Edit. I may mention,
							however, that although there be
							nothing in the works of the medical
							authorities which would lead
							us to suppose that the ancient
							surgeons were in the practice of
							operating to relieve incarcerated
							Hernia, the following passage in
							one of Martial's Epigrams would
							almost lead us to suppose the contrary,
							"Mitius implicitas Alcon
							secat enterocelas," <hi rend="ital">Epigr.</hi> xi. 84;
							which might be thus translated,
							"The surgeon Alcon inflicts less
							pain in cutting for incarcerated
							intestinal hernia.'</note> This affection is customary
							with children, who are subject to indigestion, and they
							more readily escape from the mischief, owing to their habits
							and the humidity of their intestines, for they are loose. Old
							persons do not readily suffer from the complaint, but rarely
							recover. The season of summer engenders the disease rather
							than that of spring; autumn, than winter; but the summer
							more than both.</p>
						<p>Many therefore die speedily of these tormina. But in
							other cases pus is formed; and then again, the intestine
							having become black and putrified, has separated, and thus
							the patients have died. In these cases, provided the Ileus is
							mild, there is a twisting pain, copious humours in the stomach,
							loss of tone, languor, vacant eructations bringing no relief,
							borborygmi in the bowels, the flatus passing down to the anus,
							but not making its escape.</p>
						<p>But if the attack of Ileus acquire intensity, there is a determination
							upwards of everything, flatus, phlegm, and bile;
							for they vomit all these; they are pale, cold over the whole
							body; much pain; respiration bad, they are affected with
							thirst.</p>
						<p>If they are about to die, there is cold sweat, dysuria, anus
							constricted, so that you could not pass a slender metal plate by
							it;<note n="3">Perhaps he means "a needle."

							patients are speechless; pulse, at last</p>
						<pb n="277"/>
						<p>rare and small, but before death very small, very dense, and
							failing. These symptoms attend the disease in the small
							intestines.</p>
						<p>But the same affections occur also in the colon, and the
							symptoms are similar, as also the issue; some of these escape
							if pus form in the colon, the reason of which is the fleshy
							thickness of this intestine. The pain is slender and sharp
							in the small intestines, but broad and heavy in the colon;
							the pain also sometimes darts up to the ribs, when the disease
							puts on the appearance of pleurisy; and these, moreover, are
							affected with fever; but sometimes it extends to the false
							ribs, on this side or on that, so that the pain appears to be
							seated in the liver and spleen; again it affects the loins, for
							the colon has many convolutions in all directions; but in
							other cases it fixes on the sacrum, the thighs, and the cremasters
							of the testicles. But in colic affections, they have
							rather retchings; and what is vomited is then bilious and
							oily. And the danger therefrom is so much the less, as the
							colon is more fleshy, and thicker than the small intestines,
							and consequently more tolerant of injury.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="7"><head>CHAPTER VII. ON THE ACUTE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE LIVER</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the affections of the liver, the patients do not die, indeed,
							more quickly than in those of the heart; but yet they suffer
							more pain; for the liver is, in a great measure, a concretion of
							blood. But if the cause of death happen to be situated in its
							<hi rend="ital">Portæ</hi>, they die no less speedily than from the heart; for these
							parts are tissues formed of membranes, of important and
							slender nerves, and of large veins. Hence certain of the philosophers</p>
						<pb n="278"/>
						<p>have held that the desires of the soul are seated
							there. In hemorrhage it greatly surpasses all the others;
							"for the liver is made up from the roots of veins." Wherefore
							a great inflammation does form in it, but not very frequently,
							nor in its vital parts, for the patient would die previously.
							But a smaller inflammation often takes place, whence it
							happens that they escape death, indeed, but experience a more
							protracted state of disease. For of its office, as regards sanguification,
							there is no stop nor procrastination, as from it a
							supply of blood is sent to the heart, and to the parts below
							the diaphragm.</p>
						<p>If from a greater cause--a stroke, or continued indigestion
							of much and bad food, and intoxication, or great cold--an
							inflammation forms in the portal system, a very speedy death is
							the result. For there is a latent, smothered, and acrid heat;
							pulse languid; the kind of pain varied, and every way diversified,
							sometimes darting to the right side, so as to resemble a
							sharp weapon fixed in the place, and sometimes resembling
							tormina; again, at other times the pain is deep--nay, very
							deep; and, intermediate between the pain, atony and loss of
							utterance. The diaphragm and succingens (<hi rend="ital">pleura</hi>) are dragged
							downwards; for from them the liver is suspended as a weight.
							For this reason, a strong pain extends to the clavicle on the
							same side; an ineffectual cough, or only a desire thereof, and
							when it comes to a conclusion, dry; respiration bad, for the
							diaphragm does not co-operate with the lungs, by assisting
							them in contraction and dilatation. They draw in a small breath,
							but expire a larger; colour, a dark-green, leaden; they loathe
							food, or if they force themselves to take any, they become
							flatulent in the epigastrium; eructations bilious, acid, fetid;
							nausea, retchings, belly mostly loose, discharges bilious, viscid,
							small in quantity. The affections always go on increasing;
							mind not very much deranged, but torpid, unsettled, stupid;
							much timidity; coldness of the extremities, tremblings, rigors,</p>
						<pb n="279"/>
						<p>hiccup of a spasmodic nature, jaundice, bile intense, the whole
							body tinged with bile. But if it appear before the seventh
							day, it proves fatal in many cases.</p>
						<p>But those who have escaped a fatal termination, either by a
							hemorrhage, or a rapid discharge from the bowels of bilious
							matters, or from frequent discharges of intense urine, in these
							cases, after three weeks, the liver is converted into a purulent
							abscess. But if it pass considerably this period without an
							abscess, it ends inevitably in dropsy; the patients are thirsty,
							drink little, are dried in body, lose fat; there is a desire for
							acids, and an insensibility to taste.</p>
						<p>Autumn engenders this affection, along with the indigestion
							produced by much summer-fruit and multifarious food. Of
							all ages, the adult is most subject to it.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="8"><head>CHAPTER VIII. ON THE ACUTE DISEASE OF THE VENA CAVA</head>
						<p>F<hi rend="smallcaps">ROM</hi> the portæ of the liver, there passes a wide vein
							through
							the space intermediate between its extremities, which, being
							always divided into slender and more numerous branches, is
							distributed at last all over the liver in vessels imperceptible to
							the sight; and with their extremities anastomose the extremities
							of other veins, which, at first, are slender and numerous,
							grow larger and fewer in number, and, at last, they are collected
							into one large vein; hence, having become two by
							division, these pass through the liver. The upper one, then,
							having passed through the first lobe, appears on its convex
							side; then, having passed the diaphragm, it is inserted into the
							heart: this is called the <hi rend="ital">vena cava.</hi> The other, having passed
							through the lower lobe, the fifth, to its concave side, makes its</p>
						<pb n="280"/>
						<p>exit near the spine, and is extended along it as far as the ischiatic
							region; and it, also, is called <hi rend="ital">vena cava.</hi> It obtains the same
							name, as being one and the same vein, which derives its origin
							from the liver. For if one choose, one may pass a plate of
							metal from the vena cava connected with the heart to that by
							the spine, and from the spine through the liver to the heart;
							for it is the same passage leading upwards.</p>
						<p>This vein, then, as I think, is all diseased in acute and
							strong affections; for it is altogether one vein. But other
							physicians fancy that only the part along the spine is affected,
							because there are no manifest symptoms in regard to the
							portion about the heart; for it is extended through the chest,
							having no adhesions, but floating in the chest, until, from the
							diaphragm, it adheres to the heart. If, then, any of the
							great ailments seize this vein, they are concealed by the thorax
							surrounding it.</p>
						<p>Wherefore <hi rend="ital">kedmata</hi><note n="1">See the note on the English
							translation of Hippocrates, Syd.
							Soc. Edit., vol. i. p. 216, and the
							authorities there referred to. The
							aneurismal varix would apply best
							to it in this place. It is not unlikely
							that aortal aneurisms were
							sometimes confounded with it. On
							this subject, see further Testa,
							<hi rend="ital">Malattie del Cuore</hi>, t. iii.</note> also form about this vein when a
							hemorrhage,
							bursting forth quickly proves fatal, the blood being
							discharged by the lungs and the arteria aspera, if it burst in
							the chest; but if, at its origin, the blood is poured into the
							lower belly, so that the bowels float in it, when the patients
							die before the blood makes its appearance, the belly being
							filled with blood.</p>
						<p>Inflammation likewise forms about the vein, and it, also,
							proves fatal, if it be great; for there is an acrid and pungent
							heat enclosed in the cavities of both, but little surpassing what
							is natural, so that to the touch the heat appears to be slight;
							but the patient fancies himself burning hot; pulse small, very
							frequent, so as to appear compressed and forcibly accelerated;</p>
						<pb n="281"/>
						<p>coldness of the extremities; intense thirst; dryness of the mouth;
							redness of countenance, along with paleness; he is reddish
							over the whole body; hypochondriac region hard, and retracted
							upwards; pain principally on the right side, and palpitation
							therein, extending to the flanks; and in certain cases, also, of
							the artery along the spine, provided the pulsation displays
							itself in the other hypochondriac region; for lying, as it does,
							on the left side, it sympathises with the other; the exhalation
							in the general system affording no relief, and not even making
							the skin soft, for it is dry, shrivelled, and rough; and more
							especially in the regions of the body where the bones are
							prominent, such as the back part of the elbow, the knees, or
							the knuckles. Sleep disturbed; the bowels, in certain cases,
							discharging nothing, and in others, the discharges small, acrid,
							bilious; urine, a bright yellow and pungent; not disordered, indeed,
							in mind, but they are torpid and wasted. Hence, those
							who have seen this constitution of disease have called it Causus,
							for the present symptoms are those of a species of Causus; and
							in autumn there is a tendency to malignity, both in adults and
							the young, in whom the habit of body is slender, from bad
							diet and hard labour. These, for the most part, die on the
							fourteenth day; but when the disease is protracted, they die
							in double that period. But those who either originally have a
							slight inflammation, or when a great inflammation is gradually
							resolved, escape the disease indeed, but never get rid of the
							mischief; for they labour under causus a long time. But the
							dangerous symptoms cease, namely, the pains, distension of
							the hypochondria, the bad pulse, and torpor of the intellect;
							but still they have nausea, are ill at ease, with distress of mind;
							and, moreover, these are attended with an accession of causus
							and thirst, dryness of the tongue and mouth; they inspire
							largely, drawing in a long and copious breath, as if wishing to
							draw in the whole atmosphere, for the purpose of refrigeration.
							And if they drink a large draught of cold water, they are</p>
						<pb n="282"/>
						<p>relieved, indeed, for a short time; but then again the thirst is
							kindled up, and again they drink copiously. And this is the
							successive course of the malady. And a good physician would
							give with impunity a copious cold draught, as in other
							species of causus, and even with less risk, in the case of those
							labouring under causus from disease of the <hi rend="ital">vena cava.</hi> And
							if either the bowels or the bladder carry off the drink, there
							is no necessity for inducing vomiting; but if not, after much
							cold drink much vomiting must be induced. For the patient
							would burst, if, after drinking so much, he should have no
							discharges by sweating, by urine, or by the bowels.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="9"><head>CHAPTER IX. ON ACUTE AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> kidneys, as far as regards the peculiar structure of the
							organ, are not productive of any great danger, even if they
							should suffer acutely; for, being of a glandular nature, they
							are mild and do not experience deadly diseases. But their office
							is important, namely, the secretion of the urine from the blood,
							and its expulsion.</p>
						<p>It is stopped either by a stone, or an inflammation arising
							there, or a clot of blood, or something such; when no mischief
							arises from sympathy, owing to the peculiar nature of the
							organ affected, but the retention of the urine produces all sorts
							of dreadful symptoms. Heat, which is acrid, and induces
							nausea; a heavy pain along the spine at the loins; distention
							of the parts, especially of those about the hypochondrium;
							suppression of urine, not entirely, but they pass urine in drops,
							and have a desire to pass more, for there is the sensation of an
							overflow. But if the urine become acrid and pungent, coldness,
							tremblings, spasms, distention and fulness of the hypochondria</p>
						<pb n="283"/>
						<p>supervene. This miserable state and the conjoined
							feeling become similar to that of tympanites produced by indigestion,
							from the taking of too much food. Pulse, at first,
							indeed, slow and languid; but, if the evil press harder, small,
							frequent, tumultuous, and irregular: sleep slight, painful, not
							continued; and suddenly starting up as if from the stroke of a
							sharp instrument, they fall over again into a deep sleep as if
							from fatigue: they are not much deranged in intellect, but
							talk incoherently; the countenance livid. But if the desire of
							making water return again, the patients pass a small quantity
							in drops, along with spasms and great pains, when, for a short
							time, they are relieved from their sufferings, and again they
							experience a relapse. Of those that die, they sink most
							quickly who pass no urine; but the greater part recover,
							either from the stone dropping down into the bladder along
							with the urine, or from the inflammation being converted into
							pus, or from being gradually dispelled. For, if the urine pass
							easily even in small quantity, they escape death; but for a
							length of time they waste in constitution; the patients undergo
							these sufferings while still able to keep up, but gradually fall
							into a state of consumption. The same seasons, places, and
							ages induce these affections as induce those in connection with
							the venæ cavæ.</p>
						<p>Sometimes blood bursts from the kidneys suddenly in large
							quantity, and flows continuously for many days. None, however,
							die from the hemorrhage itself, but from the inflammation
							accompanying the hemorrhage, if the bleeding is stopped;
							but most frequently they die of strong inflammation induced
							by the stoppage.</p></div3>
					<pb n="284"/>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="10"><head>CHAPTER X. ON THE ACUTE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE BLADDER</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> bladder is a dangerous part to suffer in acute diseases,
							even when it merely sympathizes with other parts; but more
							dangerous and fatal if the affection begin with itself; for it is
							very potent to make the other parts sympathise with it, as the
							nerves and the understanding: for the bladder is a cold and
							white nerve, at a very great distance from the innate heat, but
							very near the external cold: for it is situated in the lowest
							part of the belly, at the greatest distance from the chest. But,
							also, its office is of vital importance, namely, the passage of
							the urine.</p>
						<p>Even, then, when the passage is only stopped by stones, or
							clots, or from any native or foreign mischief, it is of a deadly
							nature. In women, the phlegmonous tumour of the uterus
							may compress it; and in men, the straight intestine at the end
							bowels, called the Rectum. In many cases, too, owing to
							involuntary restraint from modesty in assemblies and at banquets,
							being filled it becomes distended; and, from the loss of
							its contractile power, it no longer evacuates the urine. When,
							then, the urine is stopped, there is fulness of the parts above,
							namely, the kidneys; distension of the ureters, grievous pain
							of the loins, spasms, tremblings, rigors, alienation of mind.
							But if it suffer from an ulcer or inflammation, there are, indeed,
							many bad symptoms; but death from the ulcers is by
							far the most speedy. With regard, however, to the ulceration
							and purulent abscess, and those other affections which are not
							very acute, they will be treated of among the chronic diseases;
							but such as are acute, and prove fatal in fourteen days, or a
							little earlier or later, such as inflammation, thrombus, or a
							stone falling down to the neck of the bladder, of these I will
							now treat. If, therefore, any of these occur, there is retention</p>
						<pb n="285"/>
						<p>of urine; swelling in the hypogastric region; acute pain all
							over the abdomen; distension of the bladder; a sallow sweat
							on the tenth day; vomitings of phlegm, then of bile; coldness
							of the whole body, but especially of the feet: but, if the mischief
							spread farther, there come on fevers attended with hiccup,
							pulse irregularly frequent and small, redness of the countenance,
							thirst, distress of mind, delirium, spasms. From deleterious
							substances, such as cantharides and buprestis, both the
							bladder is distended with flatus, and the whole belly suffers
							violence; and all things get worse, and death cannot be long
							delayed.</p>
						<p>The bladder also sometimes suffers from hemorrhage; the
							blood there is bright and thin, but the patients never die from
							it, although it may not be easy to stop. But from the clots
							and the inflammation there is danger; for the coldness, mortification,
							gangrene, and the other evils consequent upon it
							readily prove fatal.</p>
						<p>Winter and autumn bring on these diseases. As to age,
							manhood, but still more old age. The other seasons and
							periods of life do not generally produce the diseases, and they
							very rarely prove fatal. Of all others, infants are most free
							from danger.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="11"><head>CHAPTER XI. ON HYSTERICAL SUFFOCATION</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the middle of the flanks of women lies the womb, a female
							viscus, closely resembling an animal; for it is moved of itself
							hither and thither in the flanks, also upwards in a direct line
							to below the cartilage of the thorax, and also obliquely to the
							right or to the left, either to the liver or spleen; and it likewise
							is subject to prolapsus downwards, and, in a word, it is</p>
						<pb n="286"/>
						<p>altogether erratic. It delights, also, in fragrant smells, and
							advances towards them; and it has an aversion to fetid smells,
							and flees from them; and, on the whole, the womb is like an
							animal within an animal.</p>
						<p>When, therefore, it is suddenly carried upwards, and
							remains above for a considerable time, and violently compresses
							the intestines, the woman experiences a choking, after the
							form of epilepsy, but without convulsions. For the liver, diaphragm,
							lungs and heart, are quickly squeezed within a narrow
							space; and therefore loss of breathing and of speech seems
							to be present. And, moreover, the carotids are compressed
							from sympathy with the heart, and hence there is heaviness of
							head, loss of sensibility, and deep sleep.</p>
						<p>And in women there also arises another affection resembling
							this form, with sense of choking and loss of speech, but not
							proceeding from the womb; for it also happens to men, in the
							manner of <hi rend="ital">catochus.</hi> But those from the uterus are remedied
							by fetid smells, and the application of fragrant things to the
							female parts; but in the others these things do no good; and
							the limbs are moved about in the affection from the womb,
							but in the other affection not at all. Moreover, voluntary and
							involuntary tremblings . . . . . . . . . . . but from the application
							of a pessary to induce abortion, powerful congelation
							of the womb, the stoppage of a copious hemorrhage, and such
							like.</p>
						<p>If, therefore, upon the womb's being moved upwards, she
							begin to suffer, there is sluggishness in the performance of her
							offices, prostration of strength, atony, loss of the faculties of
							her knees, vertigo, and the limbs sink under her; headache,
							heaviness of the head, and the woman is pained in the veins
							on each side of the nose.</p>
						<p>But if they fall down they have heartburn . . . . . in the
							hypochondriac regions; flanks empty, where is the seat of the
							womb; pulse intermittent, irregular, and failing; strong sense</p>
						<pb n="287"/>
						<p>of choking; loss of speech and of sensibility; respiration imperceptible
							and indistinct; a very sudden and incredible death,
							for they have nothing deadly in their appearance; in colour
							like that of life, and for a considerable time after death they
							are more ruddy than usual; eyes somewhat prominent, bright,
							not entirely fixed, but yet not very much turned aside.</p>
						<p>But if the uterus be removed back to its seat before the
							affection come to a conclusion, they escape the suffocation.
							When the belly rumbles there is moisture about the female
							parts, respiration thicker and more distinct, a very speedy
							rousing up from the affection, in like manner as death is very
							sudden; for as it readily ascends to the higher regions, so it
							readily recedes. For the uterus is buoyant, but the membranes,
							its supporters, are humid, and the place is humid in
							which the uterus lies; and, moreover, it flees from fetid
							things, and seeks after sweet: wherefore it readily inclines to
							this side and to that, like a log of wood, and floats upwards
							and downwards. For this reason the affection occurs in
							young women, but not in old. For in those in whom the
							age, mode of life, and understanding is more mobile, the
							uterus also is of a wandering nature; but in those more advanced
							in life, the age, mode of living, understanding, and
							the uterus are of a steady character. Wherefore this suffocation
							from the womb accompanies females alone.</p>
						<p>But the affections common to men happen also to the
							uterus, such as inflammation and hemorrhage, and they have
							the common symptoms; namely, fever, asphexy, coldness, loss
							of speech. But in hemorrhage the death is even more sudden,
							being like that of a slaughtered animal.</p></div3>

					<div3 type="chapter" n="12"><head>CHAPTER XII. ON SATYRIASIS</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> Satyrs, sacred to Bacchus, in the paintings and statues,
							have the member erect, as the symbol of the divine performance.
							It is also a form of disease, in which the patient has
							erection of the genital organ, the appellation of Satyriasis
							being derived from its resemblance to the figure of the god.</p>
						<p>It is an unrestrainable impulse to connection; but neither
							are they at all relieved by these embraces, nor is the tentigo
							soothed by many and repeated acts of sexual intercourse.
							Spasms of all the nerves, and tension of all the tendons, groins,
							and perineum, inflammation and pain of the genital parts, redness
							of countenance, and a dewy moisture. Wrapped up in
							silent sorrow, they are stupid, as if grievously afflicted with
							their calamity. But if the affection overcome the patient's
							sense of shame, he will lose all restraint of tongue as regards
							obscenity, and likewise all restraint in regard to the open performance
							of the act, being deranged in understanding as to
							indecency; for they cannot restrain themselves, are thirsty,
							and vomit much phlegm. Afterwards, froth settles on their
							lips, as is the case with goats in the season of rutting,
							and the smell likewise is similar. The urine, after long
							retention, is white, thick, and like semen; bowels constipated;
							spontaneous titillations of the sides and arm-pits; they have
							convulsions, loathe food, or, if presented to them, they snatch
							it confusedly.</p>
						<p>But if the illness tend to death, they become flatulent, belly
							protuberant, tension of the tendons and of all the muscles,
							difficulty of movement, contraction of the limbs, pulse small,
							weak, and irregular.</p>
						<p>All these symptoms have been sometimes removed by
							copious discharges from the bowels of phlegm and bile, and by</p>
						<pb n="289"/>
						<p>vomiting in like manner, not without danger. The proper
							cure is deep and very protracted sleep; for much sleep induces
							coldness, paralysis, and torpor of the nerves; and torpidity
							and refrigeration cure Satyriasis.</p>
						<p>The affection, for the most part, is formed in spring and
							summer. Of the periods of life, it occurs principally in boys
							and striplings, more especially in such as are naturally prone
							to sexual intercourse. It is a most acute, disgusting, and unseemly
							ailment. For the most part, the patients die on the
							seventh day. It is said, that women also suffer from this
							affection; that they have the same impulse to venery, and
							the other symptoms the same. I believe, indeed, that lust is
							engendered in women of a humid temperament, so as to induce
							a copious discharge of the superfluous humours; but I do
							not at all believe that they are affected with Satyriasis, for their
							nature, being cold, is not adapted to it. But neither, also,
							has woman the parts necessary for erection, like those of a
							Satyr, whence the affection derives its name; and neither also
							are men subject to suffocation from the womb, because men
							have not an uterus.</p>

						<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> chronic diseases the pain is great, the period of wasting
							long, and the recovery uncertain; for either they are not dispelled
							at all, or the diseases relapse upon any slight error;
							for neither have the patients resolution to persevere to the
							end; or, if they do persevere, they commit blunders in a
							prolonged regimen. And if there also be the suffering from a
							painful system of cure,--of thirst, of hunger, of bitter and
							harsh medicines, of cutting or burning,--of all which there is
							sometimes need in protracted diseases, the patients resile as
							truly preferring even death itself. Hence, indeed, is developed
							the talent of the medical man, his perseverance, his skill in
							diversifying the treatment, and conceding such pleasant things
							as will do no harm, and in giving encouragement. But the
							patient also ought to be courageous, and co-operate with the
							physician against the disease. For, taking a firm grasp of the
							body, the disease not only wastes and corrodes it quickly, but</p>
						<pb n="294"/>
						<p>frequently disorders the senses, nay, even deranges the soul
							by the intemperament of the body. Such we know mania and
							melancholy to be, of which I will treat afterwards. At the
							present time I shall give an account of 
							<hi rend="ital">cephalæa.</hi></p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="2"><head>CHAPTER II. ON CEPHALÆA</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> the head be suddenly seized with pain from a temporary
							cause, even if it should endure for several days, the disease is
							called Cephalalgia. But if the disease be protracted for a long
							time, and with long and frequent periods, or if greater and
							more untractable symptoms supervene, we call it Cephalæa.</p>
						<p>There are infinite varieties of it; for, in certain cases, the
							pain is incessant and slight, but not intermittent; but in
							others it returns periodically, as in quotidian fevers, or in
							those which have exacerbations every alternate day: in others
							it continues from sunset to noon, and then completely ceases;
							or from noon to evening, or still further into night; this
							period is not much protracted. And in certain cases the whole
							head is pained; and the pain is sometimes on the right and
							sometimes on the left side, or the forehead, or the bregma;
							and these may all occur the same day in a random manner.</p>
						<p>But in certain cases, the parts on the right side, or those on
							the left solely, so far that a separate temple, or ear, or one
							eyebrow, or one eye, or the nose which divides the face into
							two equal parts; and the pain does not pass this limit, but
							remains in the half of the head. This is called 
							<hi rend="ital">Heterocrania</hi>,
							an illness by no means mild, even though it intermits, and
							although it appears to be slight. For if at any time it set in
							acutely, it occasions unseemly and dreadful symptoms; spasm</p>
						<pb n="295"/>
						<p>and distortion of the countenance take place; the eyes either
							fixed intently like horns, or they are rolled inwardly to this
							side or to that; vertigo, deep-seated pain of the eyes as far as
							the meninges; irrestrainable sweat; sudden pain of the tendons,
							as of one striking with a club; nausea; vomiting of
							bilious matters; collapse of the patient; but, if the affection
							be protracted, the patient will die; or, if more slight and not
							deadly, it becomes chronic; there is much torpor, heaviness of
							the head, anxiety, and <hi rend="ital">ennui.</hi> For they flee the light; the
							darkness soothes their disease: nor can they bear readily to
							look upon or hear anything agreeable; their sense of smell is
							vitiated, neither does anything agreeable to smell delight
							them, and they have also an aversion to fetid things: the
							patients, moreover, are weary of life, and wish to die.</p>
						<p>The cause of these symptoms is coldness with dryness. But
							if it be protracted and increase, as regards the pains, the affection
							becomes Vertigo.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="3"><head>CHAPTER III. ON VERTIGO, OR SCOTOMA</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> darkness possess the eyes, and if the head be whirled round
							with dizziness, and the ears ring as from the sound of rivers
							rolling along with a great noise, or like the wind when it
							roars among the sails, or like the clang of pipes or reeds, or
							like the rattling of a carriage, we call the affection <hi rend="ital">Scotoma</hi>
							(or <hi rend="ital">Vertigo</hi>); a bad complaint indeed, if a symptom of the
							head, but bad likewise if the sequela of cephalæa, or whether
							it arises of itself as a chronic disease. For, if these
							symptoms do not pass off, but the vertigo persist, or if, in
							course of time, from the want of any one to remedy, it is</p>
						<pb n="296"/>
						<p>completed in its own peculiar symptoms, the affection vertigo
							is formed, from a humid and cold cause. But if it turn to an
							incurable condition, it proves the commencement of other
							affections--of mania, melancholy, or epilepsy, the symptoms
							peculiar to each being superadded. But the mode of vertigo
							is, heaviness of the head, sparkles of light in the eyes along
							with much darkness, ignorance of themselves and of those
							around; and, if the disease go on increasing, the limbs sink
							below them, and they crawl on the ground; there is nausea
							and vomitings of phlegm, or of yellow or black bilious matter.
							When connected with yellow bile, mania is formed; when
							with black, melancholy; when with phlegm, epilepsy; for it
							is liable to conversion into all these diseases.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="4"><head>CHAPTER IV. ON EPILEPSY</head>
						<p>E<hi rend="smallcaps">PILEPSY</hi> is an illness of various shapes and horrible; in the
							paroxysms, brutish, very acute, and deadly; for, at times, one
							paroxysm has proved fatal. Or if from habit the patient can
							endure it, he lives, indeed, enduring shame, ignominy, and
							sorrow: and the disease does not readily pass off, but fixes its
							abode during the better periods and in the lovely season of
							life. It dwells with boys and young men; and, by good
							fortune, it is sometimes driven out in another more advanced
							period of life, when it takes its departure along with the
							beauty of youth; and then, having rendered them deformed,
							it destroys certain youths from envy, as it were, of their
							beauty, either by loss of the faculties of a hand, or by the
							distortion of the countenance, or by the deprivation of some
							one sense. But if the mischief lurk there until it strike root,</p>
						<pb n="297"/>
						<p>it will not yield either to the physician or the changes of age,
							so as to take its departure, but lives with the patient until
							death. And sometimes the disease is rendered painful by its
							convulsions and distortions of the limbs and of the face; and
							sometimes it turns the mind distracted. The sight of a
							paroxysm is disagreeable, and its departure disgusting with
							spontaneous evacuations of the urine and of the bowels.</p>
						<p>But also it is reckoned a disgraceful form of disease; for it
							is supposed, that it is an infliction on persons who have sinned
							against the Moon: and hence some have called it the Sacred
							Disease, and that for more reasons than one, as from the
							greatness of the evil, for the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">I(ERO\S</foreign> also signifies
							<hi rend="ital">great</hi>; or because the cure of it is not human, but divine; or
							from the opinion that it proceeded from the entrance of a
							demon into the man: from some one, or all these causes
							together, it has been called Sacred.</p>
						<p>Such symptoms as accompany this disease in its acute form
							have been already detailed by me. But if it become inveterate,
							the patients are not free from harm even in the intervals,
							but are languid, spiritless, stupid, inhuman, unsociable, and
							not disposed to hold intercourse, nor to be sociable, at any
							period of life; sleepless, subject to many horrid dreams, without
							appetite, and with bad digestion; pale, of a leaden colour;
							slow to learn, from torpidity of the understanding and of the
							senses; dull of hearing; have noises and ringing in the head;
							utterance indistinct and bewildered, either from the nature of
							the disease, or from the wounds during the attacks; the
							tongue is rolled about in the mouth convulsively in various
							ways. The disease also sometimes disturbs the understanding,
							so that the patient becomes altogether fatuous. The cause of
							these affections is coldness with humidity.</p></div3>
					<pb n="298"/>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="5"><head>CHAPTER V. ON MELANCHOLY</head>
						<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">LACK</hi> bile, if it make its appearance in acute diseases of the
							upper parts of the body, is very dangerous; or, if it pass
							downwards, it is not free from danger. But in chronic
							diseases, if it pass downward, it terminates in dysentery and
							pain of the liver. But in women it serves as a purgation
							instead of the menses, provided they are not otherwise in a
							dangerous condition. But if it be determined upwards to the
							stomach and diaphragm, it forms melancholy; for it produces
							flatulence and eructations of a fetid and fishy nature, and it
							sends rumbling wind downwards, and disturbs the understanding.
							On this account, in former days, these were called
							melancholics and flatulent persons. And yet, in certain of
							these cases, there is neither flatulence nor black bile, but mere
							anger and grief, and sad dejection of mind; and these were
							called melancholics, because the terms <hi rend="ital">bile</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">XOLH\</foreign>) and <hi rend="ital">anger</hi>
							(<foreign lang="greek">O)RGH\</foreign>) are synonymous in import, and likewise <hi rend="ital">black</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ME/LAINA</foreign>),
							with <hi rend="ital">much</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">POLLH\</foreign>) and <hi rend="ital">furious</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">QHRIW/DHS</foreign>). Homer is authority
							for this when he says:--</p>
						<p>"Then straight to speak uprose
							The Atreidan chief, who `neath his sway a wide-spread empire held:
							Sore vexed was he; his mighty heart in his dark bosom swelled
							With rage, and from his eyes the fire like lightning-flashes
							broke."<note n="1"><p>------------------- <foreign lang="greek">*TOI=SI D᾿ A)NE/STH

						<p>The melancholics become such when they are overpowered by
							this evil.</p>
						<p>It is a lowness of spirits from a single phantasy, without</p>
						<pb n="299"/>
						<p>fever; and it appears to me that melancholy is the commencement
							and a part of mania. For in those who are mad, the understanding
							is turned sometimes to anger and sometimes to
							joy, but in the melancholics to sorrow and despondency only.
							But they who are mad are so for the greater part of life,
							becoming silly, and doing dreadful and disgraceful things;
							but those affected with melancholy are not every one of them
							affected according to one particular form; but they are either
							suspicious of poisoning, or flee to the desert from misanthropy,
							or turn superstitious, or contract a hatred of life. Or if at any
							time a relaxation takes place, in most cases hilarity supervenes,
							but these persons go mad.</p>
						<p>But how, and from what parts of the body, the most of
							these complaints originate, I will now explain. If the cause
							remain in the hypochondriac regions, it collects about the
							diaphragm, and the bile passes upwards, or downwards in cases
							of melancholy. But if it also affects the head from sympathy,
							and the abnormal irritability of temper change to laughter and
							joy for the greater part of their life, these become mad rather
							from the increase of the disease than from change of the
							affection.</p>
						<p>Dryness is the cause of both. Adult men, therefore, are
							subject to mania and melancholy, or persons of less age than
							adults. Women are worse affected with mania than men.
							As to age, towards manhood, and those actually in the prime
							of life. The seasons of summer and of autumn engender, and
							spring brings it to a crisis.</p>
						<p>The characteristic appearances, then, are not obscure; for the
							patients are dull or stern, dejected or unreasonably torpid,
							without any manifest cause: such is the commencement of
							melancholy. And they also become peevish, dispirited, sleepless,
							and start up from a disturbed sleep.</p>
						<p>Unreasonable fear also seizes them, if the disease tend to
							increase, when their dreams are true, terrifying, and clear:</p>
						<pb n="300"/>
						<p>for whatever, when awake, they have an aversion to, as being
							an evil, rushes upon their visions in sleep. They are prone to
							change their mind readily; to become base, mean-spirited,
							illiberal, and in a little time, perhaps, simple, extravagant,
							munificent, not from any virtue of the soul, but from the
							changeableness of the disease. But if the illness become more
							urgent, hatred, avoidance of the haunts of men, vain lamentations;
							they complain of life, and desire to die. In many, the
							understanding so leads to insensibility and fatuousness, that
							they become ignorant of all things, or forgetful of themselves,
							and live the life of the inferior animals. The habit of the
							body also becomes perverted; colour, a darkish-green, unless
							the bile do not pass downward, but is diffused with the
							blood over the whole system. They are voracious, indeed,
							yet emaciated; for in them sleep does not brace their limbs
							either by what they have eaten or drunk, but watchfulness
							diffuses and determines them outwardly. Therefore the bowels
							are dried up, and discharge nothing; or, if they do, the dejections
							are dried, round, with a black and bilious fluid, in which
							they float; urine scanty, acrid, tinged with bile. They are
							flatulent about the hypochondriac region; the eructations
							fetid, virulent, like brine from salt; and sometimes an acrid
							fluid, mixed with bile, floats in the stomach. Pulse for the
							most part small, torpid, feeble, dense, like that from cold.</p>
						<p>A story is told, that a certain person, incurably affected, fell
							in love with a girl; and when the physicians could bring him
							no relief, love cured him. But I think that he was originally
							in love, and that he was dejected and spiritless from being
							unsuccessful with the girl, and appeared to the common
							people to be melancholic. He then did not know that it was
							love; but when he imparted the love to the girl, he ceased
							from his dejection, and dispelled his passion and sorrow; and
							with joy he awoke from his lowness of spirits, and he became
							restored to understanding, love being his physician.</p></div3>

					<div3 type="chapter" n="6"><head>CHAPTER VI. ON MADNESS</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> modes of mania are infinite in species, but one alone in
							genus. For it is altogether a chronic derangement of the
							mind, without fever. For if fever at any time should come
							on, it would not owe its peculiarity to the mania, but to some
							other incident. Thus wine inflames to delirium in drunkenness;
							and certain edibles, such as mandragora and hyoscyamus,
							induce madness: but these affections are never called mania;
							for, springing from a temporary cause, they quickly subside,
							but madness has something confirmed in it. To this mania
							there is no resemblance in the dotage which is the calamity of
							old age, for it is a torpor of the senses, and a stupefaction of
							the gnostic and intellectual faculties by coldness of the system.
							But mania is something hot and dry in cause, and tumultuous
							in its acts. And, indeed, dotage commencing with old age
							never intermits, but accompanies the patient until death;
							while mania intermits, and with care ceases altogether. And
							there may be an imperfect intermission, if it take place in
							mania when the evil is not thoroughly cured by medicine, or
							is connected with the temperature of the season. For in certain
							persons who seemed to be freed from the complaint, either
							the season of spring, or some error in diet, or some incidental
							heat of passion, has brought on a relapse.</p>
						<p>Those prone to the disease, are such as are naturally passionate,
							irritable, of active habits, of an easy disposition, joyous,
							puerile; likewise those whose disposition inclines to the opposite
							condition, namely, such as are sluggish, sorrowful, slow
							to learn, but patient in labour, and who when they learn
							anything, soon forget it; those likewise are more prone to
							melancholy, who have formerly been in a mad condition. But
							in those periods of life with which much heat and blood are</p>
						<pb n="302"/>
						<p>associated, persons are most given to mania, namely, those
							about puberty, young men, and such as possess general
							vigour. But those in whom the heat is enkindled by black
							bile, and whose form of constitution is inclined to dryness,
							most readily pass into a state of melancholy. The diet which
							disposes to it is associated with voracity, immoderate repletion,
							drunkenness, lechery, venereal desires. Women also sometimes
							become affected with mania from want of purgation of the
							system, when the uterus has attained the development of
							manhood; but the others do not readily fall into mania, yet,
							if they do, their cases are difficult to manage. These are the
							causes; and they stir up the disease also, if from any cause
							an accustomed evacuation of blood, or of bile, or of sweating
							be stopped.</p>
						<p>And they with whose madness joy is associated, laugh, play,
							dance night and day, and sometimes go openly to the market
							crowned, as if victors in some contest of skill; this form is
							inoffensive to those around. Others have madness attended
							with anger; and these sometimes rend their clothes and kill
							their keepers, and lay violent hands upon themselves. This
							miserable form of disease is not unattended with danger to
							those around. But the modes are infinite in those who are
							ingenious and docile,--untaught astronomy, spontaneous philosophy,
							poetry truly from the muses; for docility has its good
							advantages even in diseases. In the uneducated, the common
							employments are the carrying of loads, and working at clay,--they
							are artificers or masons. They are also given to extraordinary
							phantasies; for one is afraid of the fall of the oilcruets
							..... and another will not drink, as fancying himself
							a brick, and fearing lest he should be dissolved by the liquid.</p>
						<p>This story also is told:--A certain joiner was a skilful
							artisan while in the house, would measure, chop, plane, mortice,
							and adjust wood, and finish the work of the house correctly;
							would associate with the workmen, make a bargain with them,</p>
						<pb n="303"/>
						<p>and remunerate their work with suitable pay. While on the
							spot where the work was performed, he thus possessed his
							understanding. But if at any time he went away to the
							market, the bath, or on any other engagement, having laid
							down his tools, he would first groan, then shrug his shoulders
							as he went out. But when he had got out of sight of the domestics,
							or of the work and the place where it was performed,
							he became completely mad; yet if he returned speedily he recovered
							his reason again; such a bond of connection was there
							between the locality and his understanding.</p>
						<p>The cause of the disease is seated in the head and hypochondriac
							region, sometimes commencing in both together, and the
							one imparting it to the other. In mania and melancholy,
							the main cause is seated in the bowels, as in phrenitis it is
							mostly seated in the head and the senses. For in these the
							senses are perverted, so that they see things not present as if
							they were present, and objects which do not appear to others,
							manifest themselves to them; whereas persons who are mad
							see only as others see, but do not form a correct judgment
							on what they have seen.</p>
						<p>If, therefore, the illness be great, they are of a changeable temper,
							their senses are acute, they are suspicious, irritable without
							any cause, and unreasonably desponding when the disease
							tends to gloom; but when to cheerfulness, they are in excellent
							spirits; yet they are unusually given to insomnolency; both are
							changeable in countenance, have headache, or else heaviness
							of the head; they are sharp in hearing, but very slow in
							judgment; for in certain cases there are noises of the ears,
							and ringings like those of trumpets and pipes. But if the
							disease go on to increase, they are flatulent, affected with
							nausea, voracious and greedy in taking food, for they are
							watchful, and watchfulness induces gluttony. Yet they are
							not emaciated like persons in disease (<hi rend="ital">embonpoint</hi> is rather
							the condition of melancholics) and they are somewhat pale.</p>
						<pb n="304"/>
						<p>But if any of the viscera get into a state of inflammation, it
							blunts the appetite and digestion; the eyes are hollow, and do
							not wink; before the eyes are images of an azure or dark colour
							in those who are turning to melancholy, but of a redder
							colour when they are turning to mania, along with purplecoloured
							phantasmata, in many cases as if of flashing fire;
							and terror seizes them as if from a thunderbolt. In other
							cases the eyes are red and blood-shot.</p>
						<p>At the height of the disease they have impure dreams, and
							irresistible desire of venery, without any shame and restraint
							as to sexual intercourse; and if roused to anger by admonition
							or restraint, they become wholly mad. Wherefore they are
							affected with madness in various shapes; some run along
							unrestrainedly, and, not knowing how, return again to the
							same spot; some, after a long time, come back to their relatives;
							others roar aloud, bewailing themselves as if they had experienced
							robbery or violence. Some flee the haunts of men,
							and going to the wilderness, live by themselves.</p>
						<p>If they should attain any relaxation of the evil, they become
							torpid, dull, sorrowful; for having come to a knowledge of
							the disease they are saddened with their own calamity.</p>
						<p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">ANOTHER SPECIES OF MANIA</hi>.</hi></p>
						<p>Some cut their limbs in a holy phantasy, as if thereby propitiating
							peculiar divinities. This is a madness of the apprehension
							solely; for in other respects they are sane. They are
							roused by the flute, and mirth, or by drinking, or by the
							admonition of those around them. This madness is of divine
							origin, and if they recover from the madness, they are cheerful
							and free of care, as if initiated to the god; but yet they
							are pale and attenuated, and long remain weak from the pains
							of the wounds.<note n="1">Our author, as Petit remarks,
								evidently refers here to the worship
								of Cybele; on which see in

					<pb n="305"/>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="7"><head>CHAPTER VII. ON PARALYSIS</head>
						<p><hi rend="ital">Apoplexy, Paraplegia, Paresis, Paralysis</hi>, are all generically the
							same. For they are all a defect of motion, or of touch, or
							of both; sometimes also of understanding, and sometimes of
							other sense. But apoplexy is a paralysis of the whole body,
							of sensation, of understanding and of motion; wherefore to
							get rid of a strong attack of apoplexy is impossible, and of a
							weak, not easy. But paraplegia is a remission of touch and motion,
							but of a part, either of the hand or of the leg. Paralysis
							for the most part is the remission (<hi rend="ital">paresis</hi>) of motion only, and
							of energy.<note n="1">It is difficult to find an appropriate
								word either in the Latin or
								English for the term <foreign lang="greek">PA/RESIS</foreign>. It
								would seem to be particularly applied
								to "a partial loss" either of
								sensibility or of motion. Alexander,
								however, makes little or no
								distinction between it and paralysis,
								x. 2.</note> But if the touch alone is wanting--(but such a
							case is rare)--the disease is called Anæsthesia rather than paresis.
							And when Hippocrates says, "the leg on the same side was
							apoplectic," he means to say that it was in a death-like, useless,
							and incurable state; for what is strong apoplexy in the whole
							body, that he calls paraplegia in the limb. <hi rend="ital">Paresis</hi>, properly
							speaking, is applied to suppression or incontinence of urine in
							the bladder. But distortion of the eye-brows, and of the
							cheeks, and of the muscles about the jaws and chin to the
							other side, if attended with spasm, has got the appellation of
							Cynic spasm. Loss of tone in the knees, and of sensibility
							for a time, with torpor, fainting, and collapse, we call <hi rend="ital">lipothymia.</hi></p>
						<p>Wherefore, the parts are sometimes paralysed singly, as one
							eye-brow, or a finger, or still larger, a hand, or a leg; and
							sometimes more together; and sometimes the right or the left</p>
						<pb n="306"/>
						<p>only, or each by itself, or all together, either entirely or in a
							less degree; and the parts only which are distant, homonymous,
							and in pairs--the eyes, hands, and legs; and also the parts
							which cohere, as the nose on one side, the tongue to the
							middle line of separation, and the one tonsil, the isthmus
							faucium, and the parts concerned in deglutition to one half.
							I fancy, also, that sometimes the stomach, the bladder, and the
							rectum, as far as its extremity, suffers in like manner; but the
							internal parts, when in a paralytic state, are concealed from the
							sight. Their functions, however, are but half performed; and
							from this I conclude, that these parts are half affected, as being
							cut in twain by the disease. And, indeed, this thing teaches
							us a lesson in respect to the diversity of power and discrimination
							between the right side and the left. For the inherent
							cause is equal; and means which occasion the affection are
							common in both cases, whether cold or indigestion, and yet
							both do not suffer equally. For Nature is of equal power in
							that which is equally paired; but it is impossible that the same
							thing should happen where there is an inequality. If, therefore,
							the commencement of the affection be below the head, such as
							the membrane of the spinal marrow, the parts which are
							homonymous and connected with it are paralysed: the right on
							the right side, and the left on the left side. But if the head
							be primarily affected on the right side, the left side of the body
							will be paralysed; and the right, if on the left side. The cause
							of this is the interchange in the origins of the nerves, for they
							do not pass along on the same side, the right on the right side,
							until their terminations; but each of them passes over to the
							other side from that of its origin, decussating each other in the
							form of the letter X. To say all at once, whether all together
							or separate parts be affected with paralysis ..... or of both;
							sometimes the nerves from the head suffer (these, generally,
							induce loss of sensibility, but, in a word, they do not readily
							occasion loss of sensibility; but if they sympathise with the</p>
						<pb n="307"/>
						<p>parts which are moved, they may undergo, in a small degree,
							the loss of motion); and sometimes those which pass from
							muscle to muscle (<hi rend="ital">from the spinal marrow to the muscles</hi>),<note n="2">See the note on the text.</note> these
							have the power of motion, and impart it to those from the
							head; for the latter possess the greater part of their motory
							power from them, but yet have it, to a small extent, of themselves:
							the former, too, principally suffer loss of motion, but
							rarely of themselves experience anæsthesia; indeed, as appears
							to me, not at all. And if the ligaments of nerves, which
							derive their origin from certain of the bones, and terminate in
							others, be loosened or torn, the parts become powerless, and
							are impeded in their movements, but do not become insensible.<note n="3">It will readily be understood
								that our author here refers to the
								ligaments proper of the joints.
								On this use of the term "Nerve,"
								see Hippocrates "On the articulations,"
								<hi rend="ital">pluries.</hi></note></p>
						<p>The varieties of paralysis are these: sometimes the limbs
							lose their faculties while in a state of extension, nor can they be
							brought back into the state of flexion, when they appear very
							much lengthened; and sometimes they are flexed and cannot
							be extended; or if forcibly extended, like a piece of wood on
							a rule, they become shorter than natural. The pupil of the
							eye is subject to both these varieties, for sometimes it is much

							pupil is also contracted to a small size, when I call it <hi rend="ital">Phthisis</hi>
							and <hi rend="ital">Mydriasis.</hi> The bladder, also, is paralysed in respect to
							its peculiar functions; for either it loses its powers as regards
							distension, or it loses its retentive powers, or it becomes contracted
							in itself, when being filled with urine, it cannot expel
							the same. There are six causes of paralytic disorders; for they
							arise from a wound, a blow, exposure to cold, indigestion,
							venery, intoxication. But so likewise the vehement affections
							of the soul, such as astonishment, fear, dejection of spirits, and,
							in children, frights. Great and unexpected joy has also occasioned</p>
						<pb n="308"/>
						<p>paralysis, as, likewise, unrestrained laughter, even unto
							death. These, indeed, are the primary causes; but the ultimate
							and vital cause is refrigeration of the innate heat. It
							suffers from humidity, or dryness, and is more incurable than
							the other; but if also in connection with a wound, and complete
							cutting asunder of a nerve, it is incurable. In respect to
							age, the old are peculiarly subject, and difficult to cure; in
							children, the cases are easily restored. As to seasons, the
							winter; next, the spring; afterwards, the autumn; least of all,
							the summer. Of habits, those naturally gross, the humid,
							indolent, brutish.</p>
						<p>When the affections are confirmed, they are made manifest
							by loss of motion, insensibility of heat and cold; and also of
							plucking the hair, of tickling, and of touching. It is rare
							indeed when in them the extremities are painful; but insensibility
							to pain is not worse as regards recovery. Wherefore
							the disease occurs suddenly; but if at any time it have prolonged
							onsets, there supervene heaviness, difficulty of motion,
							torpor, a sensation of cold, sometimes an excess of heat,
							short sleeps, greater phantasies, when they become suddenly
							paralytic.</p>
						<p>But in the Cynic spasm, it is not usual for all parts of the
							face to be cramped; but those of the left side are turned to
							the right, and those of the right to the left, when there is a
							considerable distortion of the jaw to this side or to that, as if
							the jawbone were dislocated. And in certain of these cases,
							also, there is luxation at the joint, when in yawning the jaw is
							displaced to the opposite side: strabismus of the affected eye,
							and palpitation in the under eyelid; the upper eyelid also palpitates,
							sometimes along with the eye, and at other times alone.
							The lips are distended, each on its own side; but sometimes
							both being collapsed, they splutter; in others, they are closely
							compressed, and are suddenly separated so as to expel the
							common spittle with a noise.</p>
						<pb n="309"/>
						<p>The tongue, also, is drawn aside; for it consists of a muscle
							and nerves, and at certain times, along its whole extent, it
							starts up to the palate, and makes an unusual sound. The
							uvula, also, is drawn aside; and if the mouth is shut, there is
							an unexpected noise within. And if you separate the mouth,
							you will perceive the uvula sometimes attached to the palate
							through its whole surface, and sometimes swiftly palpitating
							with force, like a bag-fish, when likewise a sound is produced.
							But there is apt to be deception in cynic spasms; for to the spectator
							it appears as if the parts unaffected were those possessed
							by the disease; for owing to the tension and colour of the
							affected parts, and the enlargement of the eye, they appear as
							if they were diseased. But in laughter, speaking, or winking,
							the true state of matters becomes manifest; for the parts affected
							are all drawn aside with a smack; the lip expresses no
							smile, and is motionless in talking; the eyelid is immoveable,
							the eye fixed, and the sense of touch is lost; while the sound
							parts speak, wink, feel, laugh.</p></div3>

						<pb n="310"/>
						<p>ceasing, indeed, at no time, but concealed during the day by
							the sweating and coldness of the body; for the characteristics

							viscera, as is manifested by the uneasiness, loss of strength,
							and colliquative wasting. For had the febrile heat left the
							body during the day, how should not the patient have acquired

							inwardly, the bad symptoms are all still further exacerbated,
							the pulse small and feeble; insomnolency, paleness, and all the

							whitish-green; broad, round; hard, or glutinous; rare, or diffluent;
							devoid of smell, fetid. There are all these varieties of
							pus. But those who test the fluids, either with fire or water,
							would appear to me not to be acquainted with <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi>;<note n="1">Our author would appear to
								allude here to certain passages in

							For if one of the common people see a man pale, weak,

							<hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi> (consumption). But in those who have no ulcer in the
							lungs, but are wasted with chronic fevers--with frequent, hard,
							and ineffectual coughing, and bringing up nothing, these, also,
							are called <hi rend="ital">consumptive</hi>, and not without reason. There is present
							weight in the chest (for the lungs are insensible of pain),--anxiety,
							discomfort, loss of appetite; in the evening coldness,
							and heat towards morning; sweat more intolerable than the
							heat as far as the chest; expectoration varied, as I have
							described.</p>
						<p>Voice hoarse; neck slightly bent, tender, not flexible,</p>
						<pb n="311"/>
						<p>somewhat extended; fingers slender, but joints thick; of the
							bones alone the figure remains, for the fleshy parts are wasted;
							the nails of the fingers crooked, their pulps are shrivelled and
							flat, for, owing to the loss of flesh, they neither retain their
							tension nor rotundity; and, owing to the same cause, the nails
							are bent, namely, because it is the compact flesh at their
							points which is intended as a support to them; and the tension
							thereof is like that of the solids. Nose sharp, slender; cheeks
							prominent and red; eyes hollow, brilliant and glittering;
							swollen, pale, or livid in the countenance; the slender parts
							of the jaws rest on the teeth, as if smiling; otherwise of a
							cadaverous aspect. So also in all other respects; slender,
							without flesh; the muscles of the arms imperceptible; not a
							vestige of the mammæ, the nipples only to be seen; one may
							not only count the ribs themselves, but also easily trace them to
							their terminations; for even the articulations at the vertebræ are
							quite visible; and their connections with the sternum are also
							manifest; the intercostal spaces are hollow and rhomboidal,
							agreeably to the configuration of the bone; hypochondriac
							region lank and retracted; the abdomen and flanks contiguous
							to the spine. Joints clearly developed, prominent, devoid of
							flesh, so also with the tibia, ischium, and humerus; the spine
							of the vertebræ, formerly hollow, now protrudes, the muscles
							on either side being wasted; the whole shoulder-blades
							apparent like the wings of birds. If in these cases disorder
							of the bowels supervene, they are in a hopeless state. But, if
							a favourable change take place, symptoms the opposite of
							those fatal ones occur.</p>
						<p>The old seldom suffer from this disease, but very rarely
							recover from it; the young, until manhood, become phthisical
							from spitting of blood, and do recover, indeed, but not
							readily; children continue to cough even until the cough
							pass into <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi>, and yet readily recover. The habits most

						<pb n="312"/>
						<p>protrude like folding doors, or like wings; in those which
							have prominent throats; and those which are pale and have
							narrow chests. As to situations, those which are cold and

					<div3 type="chapter" n="9"><head>CHAPTER IX. ON PERSONS AFFECTED WITH EMPYEMA.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HOSE</hi> persons in whose cavities above, along the region of
							the chest, or, in those below the diaphragm, abscesses of matter
							form, if they bring it up, they are said to be affected with
							Empyema; but if the matter pass downwards, they are said
							to labour under Apostemes. And in the ulcers in the chest,
							or in the lungs, if <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi> supervene, or in the pleura, or the
							sternum, or anywhere below at the junction of the lungs with
							the spine -- in all these cases the passage for the matter
							upwards is by the lungs. But in the viscera below the diaphragm,
							the liver, spleen, and kidneys, it is by the bladder;
							and in women by the womb. And I once made an opening
							into an abscess in the colon on the right side near the liver,
							and much pus rushed out, and much also passed by the
							kidneys and bladder for several days, and the man recovered.</p>
						<p>The common causes of all are a blow, indigestion, cold and
							the like. Of those in the chest also, chronic cough, pleuritis,
							peripneumony, and protracted defluxion; but also the determination
							of some acute diseases to any one of them.</p>
						<p>The humour is sometimes inert, weak, and rests on
							something else; sometimes bitingly acrid, and occasioning
							putrefactions even unto death. And there are many other
							varieties, as I shall presently declare. It is a wonder how</p>
						<pb n="313"/>
						<p>from a thin, slender membrane, having no depth, like that
							which lines the chest, so much pus should flow; for in many
							cases there is a great collection. The cause is an inflammation
							from redundancy of blood, by which the membrane is
							thickened; but from much blood much pus is formed intermediately.
							But if it be determined inwards, the ribs being
							the bones in this region. . . . . . . I have said above, that
							another species of <hi rend="ital">phthisis</hi> would naturally occur. But if it
							point outwards, the bones are separated, for the top of the
							abscess is raised in one of the intercostal spaces, when the ribs
							are pushed to this side or to that.</p>
						<p>There are certain symptoms common to all, and certain ones
							peculiar to each. A heaviness rather than pain is a common
							symptom (for the lungs are insensible), weak fevers, rigor
							towards evening, sweats in the remission, insomnolency,
							swellings in the extremities of the feet, and fingers of the
							hands, which at one time abate and at another increase;
							uncomfortable feeling; loss of appetite; wasting of the whole
							body; and if the change be prolonged, the phthisical habit
							is formed; for Nature can no longer perform her office, for
							the digestion is not as before, nor is there the plump habit of
							body; the colour dark; respiration in all cases bad, but worse
							in those affecting the upper cavity; but also cough at first
							as long as the inflammation is urgent, when the pains also are
							greater, and rigor, and heat, and watchfulness, and dyspnœa
							still more; pulse small, sluggish, feeble; they are disordered
							in the intellect; distension of the thorax.</p>
						<p>But if it be already come to the formation of pus, all the
							the greatest symptoms take place. Expectoration small with
							greater cough, and from an urgent abscess, at first of pituitous
							matters, tinged with bile of a darker colour as if from soot,
							but likewise tinged with blood, and thick; but if about to
							burst, of fleshy and deep-seated matter. And, if it burst,
							there is danger of suffocation should much pus be suddenly</p>
						<pb n="314"/>
						<p>poured forth; but if gradually, there is no danger. If then
							the pus is going to pass downwards, the upper part, where
							the abscess is situated, experiences sharp pain; discharges from
							the bowels fluid, at first watery with phlegm, afterwards
							bloody matter; and then again, substances resembling flesh
							floating in a fluid, if it has already burst. Pus follows them
							either by the bowels or the urine. Metastasis to the kidneys
							and bladder peculiarly favourable.</p>
						<p>The pus, whether it be carried upwards or downwards, is
							of various colours--pale, white, ash-coloured, or livid, black
							and fetid; or devoid of smell and very thick; or intermediate;
							or smooth and consistent; or rough and unequal, with
							fleshy substances floating in it, these being round or broad,
							readily separated or viscid. To say all in a word respecting
							the pus, such kinds as are white, concocted, devoid of smell,
							smooth, rounded, and are quickly coughed up, or pass downwards,
							are of a salutary character; but such as are very pale,
							bilious, and inconsistent, are bad. Of these by far the
							worst are the livid and black, for they indicate putrefaction
							and phagedenic ulcers.</p>
						<p>Along with these things, it will be proper to know also the
							habit and other concomitants of the disease. If at the time
							of the discharge, he feels comfortable, and gets rid of the
							fever; has good digestion, good colour, and a good appetite,
							if he coughs up readily, has a good pulse, and good strength;
							the patient is free from danger. But if fever supervene,
							and all the other symptoms turn worse, he is in a hopeless
							state. One ought also to consider the places in which the
							abscesses are seated. For where the matter forms in the sternum,
							it is slowly turned to a suppuration; for the parts are
							slender, devoid of flesh and cartilaginous; and such parts do
							not readily receive the superfluities of inflammation, but
							remain a long time without being formed into pus; for cartilage
							is of a cold nature, but the inflammations thereof are</p>
						<pb n="315"/>
						<p>innocuous. The wasting of the constitution is bad; for the
							suppuration lasts a long time; the spleen, the liver, the lungs,
							and diaphragm pass more quickly into suppuration, but they
							are dangerous and fatal.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="10"><head>CHAPTER X. ON ABSCESSES IN THE LUNGS.</head>
						
						<p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HEN</hi>, in cases of peripneumonia, the patients survive, though
							the inflammation be not discussed, those who escape the acute
							stage of the affection have suppurations. The symptoms, then,
							of an incipient and of a formed abscess have been stated by
							me under Empyema. If formed, then, there is no necessity for
							the same harsh measures and pains to procure the rupture and
							discharge of it as in the solid parts of the body, as it is readily
							brought up; for the distension of its pores is required rather
							than of the solid texture of its parts; for the lungs being a
							porous body and full of perforations like a sponge, it is not
							injured by the humour, but transmits it from pore to pore,
							until it reach the trachea. Thus the fluid finds a ready outlet,
							the pus being a flexible and slippery substance, and the respiration
							blows the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) upwards. For the most part
							they recover, unless at any time one be suffocated by the
							copious influx of the fluid, when, owing to the quantity of the
							pus, the trachea does not admit the air. Others die a protracted
							death, after the manner of those labouring under
							<hi rend="ital">phthisis</hi> and <hi rend="ital">empyema.</hi> The pus is white and frothy, being
							mixed with saliva, but sometimes ash-coloured or blackish.
							And sometimes one of the bronchia has been spit up in a case
							of large ulceration, if the abscess is deep, when portions of the</p>
						<pb n="316"/>
						<p>viscus are also brought up. Hoarse, breathing short, voice
							heavy-toned, their chest becomes broad, and yet they stand in
							need of its being still broader, owing to the collection of fluid;
							the dark parts of the eyes glancing, the whites are very white
							and fatty; cheeks ruddy; veins in the forehead protuberant.
							There is a marvel in connection with these cases, how the
							strength is greater than the condition of the body, and the
							buoyancy of spirits surpasses the strength.</p></div3>

						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> from running, gymnastic exercises, or any other work, the
							breathing become difficult, it is called <hi rend="ital">Asthma</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">A)=SQMA</foreign>); and
							the disease <hi rend="ital">Orthopnœa</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">O)RQO/PNOIA</foreign>) is also called Asthma, for in
							the paroxysms the patients also pant for breath. The disease
							is called <hi rend="ital">Orthopnœa</hi>, because it is only when in an erect position
							(<foreign lang="greek">O)RQI/W| SXH/MATI</foreign>) that they breathe freely; for when reclined
							there is a sense of suffocation. From the confinement in the
							breathing, the name <hi rend="ital">Orthopnœa</hi> is derived. For the patient
							sits erect on account of the breathing; and, if reclined, there is
							danger of being suffocated.</p>
						<p>The lungs suffer, and the parts which assist in respiration,
							namely the diaphragm and thorax, sympathise with them.
							But if the heart be affected, the patient could not stand out
							long, for in it is the origin of respiration and of life.</p>
						<p>The cause is a coldness and humidity of the spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>);
							but the <hi rend="ital">materiel</hi> is a thick and viscid humour. Women are more
							subject to the disease than men, because they are humid and
							cold. Children recover more readily than these, for nature in</p>
						<pb n="317"/>
						<p>the increase is very powerful to heat. Men, if they do not
							readily suffer from the disease, die of it more speedily. There
							is a postponement of death to those in whom the lungs are
							warmed and heated in the exercise of their trade, from
							being wrapped in wool, such as the workers in gypsum, or
							braziers, or blacksmiths, or the heaters of baths.</p>
						<p>The symptoms of its approach are heaviness of the chest;
							sluggishness to one's accustomed work, and to every other
							exertion; difficulty of breathing in running or on a steep
							road; they are hoarse and troubled with cough; flatulence
							and extraordinary evacuations in the hypochondriac region;
							restlessness; heat at night small and imperceptible; nose sharp
							and ready for respiration.</p>
						<p>But if the evil gradually get worse, the cheeks are ruddy;
							eyes protuberant, as if from strangulation; a <hi rend="ital">a râle</hi> during the
							waking state, but the evil much worse in sleep; voice liquid
							and without resonance; a desire of much and of cold air;
							they eagerly go into the open air, since no house sufficeth for
							their respiration; they breathe standing, as if desiring to draw
							in all the air which they possibly can inhale; and, in their
							want of air, they also open the mouth as if thus to enjoy the
							more of it; pale in the countenance, except the cheeks, which
							are ruddy; sweat about the forehead and clavicles; cough
							incessant and laborious; expectoration small, thin, cold, resembling
							the efflorescence of foam; neck swells with the inflation
							of the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>); the præcordia retracted; pulse small,
							dense, compressed; legs slender: and if these symptoms increase,
							they sometimes produce suffocation, after the form of
							epilepsy.</p>
						<p>But if it takes a favourable turn, cough more protracted
							and rarer; a more copious expectoration of more fluid matters;
							discharges from the bowels plentiful and watery; secretion of
							urine copious, although unattended with sediment; voice
							louder; sleep sufficient; relaxation of the præcordia; sometimes</p>
						<pb n="318"/>
						<p>a pain comes into the back during the remission; panting
							rare, soft, hoarse. Thus they escape a fatal termination. But,
							during the remissions, although they may walk about erect,
							they bear the traces of the affection.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="12"><head>CHAPTER XII. ON PNEUMODES.</head>
						
						<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">NEUMODES</hi> is a species of asthma; and the affection is connected
							with the lungs as is the case in asthma. The attendant
							symptoms are common, and there is but little difference; for
							dyspnœa, cough, insomnolency, and heat are common symptoms,
							as also loss of appetite and general emaciation. Moreover,
							the disease is protracted for a time, yet not longer than
							one year; for, if the autumn begin it, the patients die in
							the spring or in the summer; or if the winter, they terminate
							their life towards the autumn. Old persons also are at certain
							times readily seized; and being seized with rigors, it requires
							but a slight inclination of the scale to lay them on the bed of
							death. All labour in particular under want of breath; pulse
							small, frequent, feeble. But these symptoms are also common
							to asthma; they have this as peculiar; they cough as if going to
							expectorate, but their effort is vain, for they bring up nothing;
							or if anything is forcibly separated from the lungs, it is a small,
							white, round substance, resembling a hailstone.<note n="1">See in particular Galen, de loc.

						<pb n="319"/>
						<p>are greater. Some, indeed, die speedily of suffocation before

					<div3 type="chapter" n="13"><head>CHAPTER XIII. ON THE LIVER.</head>
						
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the formation of the body, the liver and spleen are equally
							balanced; for these viscera are equal in number, the one on
							the right side and the other on the left. They are unequal,
							however, in power, as regards health and diseases. In health,
							indeed, inasmuch as the liver has the power of nutrition, for
							"the roots of all the veins unite to form the liver": but in
							diseases it has much greater power to restore health and occasion
							death. As far, then, as the liver is superior in health, so
							much the worse is it in diseases, for it experiences more sudden
							and violent inflammations, and has more frequent and more
							fatal abscesses. In scirrhus, too, it proves fatal more quickly
							and with greater pain than the spleen. Those things which
							relate to inflammations thereof I have described among the
							acute affections.</p>
						<p>If it be converted into pus, a sharp pain possesses the parts
							as far as the clavicle and the tops of the shoulders, for the
							diaphragm from which the liver is suspended is dragged down
							by the weight, and the diaphragm drags the membrane lining
							the ribs to which it is attached, and this membrane (the
							<hi rend="ital">pleura</hi>) is stretched up to the clavicle and top of the shoulders,
							which also are dragged down. Along with the abscess there
							is acrid heat and rigors; cough dry and very frequent; colour
							grass-green; and if the patients be intensely jaundiced, it is of</p>
						<pb n="320"/>
						<p>the white kind; sleep not quite clear of phantasies; on the
							main, their understanding settled; or if, from any temporary
							cause, there be delirium, it quickly passes off; swelling under
							the nipples or sides, which deceives many, as if it proceeded
							from the peritoneum. But if there be swelling and pain on
							pressure below the false ribs, the liver is swelled; for it is filled
							by a collection of fluid. But if the collection is not below the
							bone, it is a symptom of the membrane (the peritoneum) being
							affected, and its boundaries are distinctly circumscribed; for
							the hand applied in pressure, after passing the circumference
							of the liver, sinks down into an empty space in the abdomen.
							But the hardness of the peritoneum is undefined, and no process
							at its extremity is apparent. If the process incline inwardly,
							nature is far superior to the physician; for it is either
							turned upon the bowels or the bladder, and far the least dangerous
							is the passage by the bladder: but if it incline outwards,
							it is bad not to make an incision, for otherwise the
							liver is corroded by the pus, and death is not long deferred.
							But, if you intend to make an incision, there is danger of
							hemorrhage, from which the patient may die suddenly; for
							hemorrhage in the liver cannot be checked. But if you are
							reduced to the necessity of making an incision, heat a cautery
							in the fire to a bright heat, and push it down to the pus, for
							it at the same time cuts and burns: and if the patient survive,
							there will run out a white, concocted, smooth, not fetid,
							very thick pus, by which the fever and other bad symptoms
							are diminished, and altogether the health is restored. But if
							the pus passes into the intestines, the belly has watery discharges
							at first, but afterwards they resemble the washings of
							flesh, and, again, they are like those in dysentery proceeding
							from ulcerations; but sometimes a bloody ichor, or thrombus
							is passed. Bile also is discharged, intensely yellow, or leekgreen,
							and, lastly, before death, black.</p>
						<p>But if the abscess do not suppurate, and the discharges from</p>
						<pb n="321"/>
						<p>the bowels are fetid like putrefaction, the food passes undigested,
							owing to the stomach and intestines having lost their
							tone; for thus the liver, even though now in good condition,
							does not perform digestion; along with these symptoms there
							is acrid heat, and altogether there is a turn to the worse;
							colliquative wasting of the flesh, pulse small, difficulty of
							breathing, when at no distance of time their life is at an end.
							In certain cases, the dysentery and the ulceration have healed,
							but the disease changed to dropsy. But if all these symptoms
							abate, if pus that is white, smooth, consistent, and inodorous,
							is discharged, and the stomach digests the food,
							there may be good hopes of the patient. But the best thing
							is for it to be discharged by the urine; for the passage by it
							is safer and less troublesome than the other.</p>
						<p>But if, after the inflammation, the liver does not suppurate,
							the pain does not go off, its swelling, changing to a hard state,
							settles down into scirrhus; in which case, indeed, the pain is
							not continued, and when present is dull; and the heat is
							slight; there is loss of appetite; delight in bitter tastes, and
							dislike of sweet; they have rigors; are somewhat pale,
							green, swollen about the loins and feet; forehead wrinkled;
							belly dried up, or the discharges frequent. The cap of these
							bad symptoms is dropsy.</p>
						<p>In the dropsy, provided there is a copious discharge of thick
							urine, having much re-crementitious sediment, there is a hope
							that the dropsical swelling may run off; but if the urine be
							thin, without sediment, and scanty, it conspires with the
							dropsy. But if nature change to her pristine state, and burst
							upon the bowels, along with copious watery discharges, it has
							also sometimes cured the dropsy. This mode of cure, however,
							is dangerous; for what from the copious evacuations,
							and the extreme prostration, the patients have sometimes died
							of weakness, as from hemorrhage. Sweating, if copious,
							carries off the disease with less danger, for dropsical persons</p>
						<pb n="322"/>
						<p>generally have not a moist skin. Such is the termination
							of the affections in the liver.</p>
						<p>But if the liver suppurate . . . . . children, and those till
							manhood; women less so. The causes are intemperance, and a
							protracted disease, especially from dysentery and colliquative
							wasting; for it is customary to call these persons <hi rend="ital">tabid</hi> who

						<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">CIRRHUS</hi>, a chronic disease, is habitual to the spleen (suppuration
							does not readily occur in it, and yet it does occur
							sometimes), when the pain is not severe, but swelling much
							greater than the pain; for it has been seen swelled on the right
							side as far as the liver in the whole common space between
							them, hence many have been deceived in supposing that it is
							not an affection of the spleen, but of the membrane, for it
							appears to them that the peritonæum is inflamed. It is hard
							and unyielding as stone. Such the spleen generally becomes
							in scirrhus, when also it is attended with great discomfort.</p>
						<p>But if it suppurate, it is soft to the touch, yielding to pressure
							at its top, when there is a formation of pus; but when
							it is not suppurated it does not yield. Sometimes it hangs
							entire in the abdomen, being moved about to this side and to
							that, whilst it remains a small body, and has space to float in.
							Nausea, restlessness, especially about the time of breaking.</p>
						<p>The symptoms of distension are, fevers, pains, and rigors
							(for generally they are free of rigors, and of pain when the heat
							is small, and hence abscess about the spleen is sometimes
							latent); for the viscus is porous and insensible even in health:
							they are swollen, dropsical, of a dark-green colour, along</p>
						<pb n="323"/>
						<p>with disquietude, dyspnœa as if from weight of the chest, for
							the evil is well marked. Even to its upper parts the abdomen
							is filled with a flatus (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), thick, misty, humid in
							appearance but not in reality; much desire of coughing comes
							on, and their expectoration is small and dry. If there be
							watery discharges from the bowels, they at first bring some
							slight relief; but if they increase, they waste the patient, and
							yet nevertheless they do good.</p>
						<p>But, if it should break, pure concocted pus is never discharged,
							but whitish and ashy, sometimes feculent, or livid.
							If the abscess become deeper, the fluid is dark, when likewise
							some of the juice of the melted spleen is discharged. In
							certain cases, entire portions of the spleen have been brought
							up, for the spleen is of a soluble nature. And if the ulcer
							does not heal, but remains for a long time, they lose appetite,
							become cachectic, swollen, unseemly to look at, having many
							ulcers on all parts of the body, especially on the legs, where
							the sores are round, livid, hollow, foul, and difficult to heal.
							Wasted thereby, they expire.</p>
						<p>In a small tumour, with hardness and resistance, pain is
							wanting; on this account they live a long time. But if overpowered
							by the affection, dropsy, phthisis, and wasting of
							the body necessarily supervene; and this form of death removes
							them from life.</p>
						<p>Children, then, and young persons are most readily affected,
							and most readily escape from it. Old persons, indeed, do not
							often suffer, but they cannot escape; but certain elderly persons
							have been cut off by latent disease of the spleen; for, even with
							a small swelling, the scale of death has turned with them. A
							protracted and consumptive disease induces these affections, and
							in young persons inactivity especially, when, after contention
							and many exercises, the body has become inactive. As to
							localities, the marshy; as to waters, the thick, saltish, and
							fetid. Of the seasons, autumn is pecularly malignant.</p></div3>
					<pb n="324"/>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="15"><head>CHAPTER XV. ON JAUNDICE, OR ICTERUS.</head>
						
						<p>If a distribution of bile, either yellow, or like the yolk of an
							egg, or like saffron, or of a dark-green colour, take place from
							the viscus, over the whole system, the affection is called Icterus,
							a dangerous complaint in acute diseases, for not only when it
							appears before the seventh day does it prove fatal, but even
							after the seventh day it has proved fatal in innumerable
							instances. Rarely the affection has proved a crisis to a fever
							towards the end, but itself is not readily discussed.</p>
						<p>It is formed not only from a cause connected with the liver,
							as certain physicians have supposed, but also from the stomach,
							the spleen, the kidneys, and the colon. From the liver in
							this manner: if the liver become inflamed or contract scirrhus,
							but remain unchanged with regard to its functional office, it
							produces bile, indeed, in the liver, and the bladder, which is
							in the liver, secretes it; but if the passages which convey the
							bile to the intestine, be obstructed from inflammation or
							scirrhus, the bladder gets over-distended, and the bile regurgitates;
							it therefore becomes mixed with the blood, and the
							blood, passing over the whole system, carries the bile to every
							part of the body, which acquires the appearance of bile. But
							the hardened fæces are white and clayey, as not being tinged
							with bile, because the bowels are deprived of this secretion.
							Hence also the belly is very much dried up; for it is neither
							moistened nor stimulated by the bile. The colour in this
							species is whitish-green.</p>
						<p>If jaundice make its appearance in connection with the
							spleen, it is dark-green, for its nutriment is black, because the
							spleen is the strainer of the black blood, the impurities of
							which it does not receive nor elaborate when diseased, but</p>
						<pb n="325"/>
						<p>they are carried all over the body with the blood. Hence
							patients are dark-green from icterus in connection with the
							spleen; but the colour is darker than usual in the customary
							discharges from the bowels, for the superfluity of the nutriment
							of the spleen becomes recrement from the bowels.</p>
						<p>And icterus also is formed in connection with the colon and
							stomach, provided their powers of digestion be vitiated; for
							digestion takes place even in the colon, and from it a supply of
							nutriment is sent upwards to the liver. Provided, then, the
							liver receive its other food in a cruder state than usual, it
							indeed goes through its own work, but leaves that of the other
							undone; for in distribution it diffuses the blood which carries
							the marks of the inactivity of the colon to all parts of the
							body. The indigestion in this case is connected with the
							formation of the bile in the colon.</p>
						<p>Thus icterus may be formed in any viscus, not only of those
							which send nutriment to the liver, but also of those which receive
							it from the liver. For nature sends nutriment to all parts,
							not only by ducts perceptible to the senses, but much more so
							by vapours, which are readily carried from all parts to all,
							nature conducting them even through the solid and dense
							parts. Wherefore these vapours become tinged with bile, and
							discolour any part of the body in which they get lodged.
							Moreover, in jaundice connected with the colon, the evacuations
							are not white; for the liver is not disordered as regards
							the function of bile, and is not impeded in the transmission of
							bile to the intestines.</p>
						<p>The general system, likewise, is most powerful in producing
							icterus; for the cause is seated in the whole body. It is of
							this nature: in every part there is heat for concoction; in
							every part for the creation and secretion of humours, different
							in different places, but in each that which is peculiar to it: in
							flesh, indeed, sweat; in the eyes, tears; in the joints and nose,
							mucus; in the ears, wax. If the heat, then, fails in the performance</p>
						<pb n="326"/>
						<p>of each of its operations, it is itself converted into
							that which is acrid and fiery; but all the fluids become bile,
							for the products of heat are bitter, and stained with bile. But
							if indigestion happens in the blood, the blood assumes the
							appearance of bile, but is distributed as nourishment to
							all parts, wherefore bile appears everywhere. For it is a
							dire affection, the colour being frightful in appearance, and
							the patients of a golden colour; for the same thing is not
							becoming in a man which is beautiful in a stone. It is
							superfluous in me to tell whence the name is derived, further
							than that it is derived from certain four-footed and terrestrial
							animals, called <foreign lang="greek">I)KTI/DES</foreign>, whose eyes are of this colour.<note n="2">A species of ferret; either the <hi rend="ital">Mustela Erminea</hi> or the <hi rend="ital">M. Furo.</hi></note></p>
						<p>There are two species of the affection; for the colour of the
							whitish-green species either turns to yellow and saffron, or to
							livid and black. The cause of these is the same as the cause
							of the two kinds of bile; for, of the latter, one species--namely,
							the light-coloured--is yellow, thin, and transparent; but this
							species is also sometimes tinged so as to resemble saffron or the
							yolk of an egg. The other is of a darker character, like leeks,
							woad, or wholly black. There are innumerable intermediate
							varieties of colour, these being connected with the heat and
							humours. The viscera, also, co-operate in this; for the viscus
							is either a bright-red, like the liver, or dark-red, like the
							spleen. When, therefore, the icterus is connected with any
							viscus, if from the liver, it bears traces of this viscus, and if
							from the spleen, of it; and so, also, with regard to all the
							others. But if it possesses no appearance of any, it is an affection
							of the general habit. These appear manifest in the white
							of the eyes especially, and in the forehead about the temples;
							and in those naturally of a white complexion, even from a
							slight attack, the increased colour is visible.</p>
						<p>In cases, therefore, of black icterus, the patients are of a</p>
						<pb n="327"/>
						<p>dark-green colour, are subject to rigors, become faintish, inactive,
							spiritless; emit a fetid smell, have a bitter taste, breathe
							with difficulty, are pinched in the bowels; alvine evacuations
							like leeks, darkish, dry, passed with difficulty; urine deeply
							tinged with black; without digestion, without appetite; restless,
							spiritless, melancholic.</p>
						<p>In the whiter species, the patients are of a light-green colour,
							and more cheerful in mind; slow in beginning to take food,
							but eat spiritedly when begun; of freer digestion than those of
							the former species; alvine discharges, white, dry, clayey; urine
							bright-yellow, pale, like saffron.</p>
						<p>In both cases the whole body is itchy; heat at the nostrils,
							small, indeed, but pungent; the bilious particles prickly. The
							taste of bitter things is not bitter; and yet, strange to tell,
							it is not sweet; but the taste of sweet things is bitter. For
							in the mouth the bile lodged in the tongue, prevailing over
							the articles of food, sophisticates the sensation; for the tongue,
							having imbibed the bile, does not perceive them, while, during
							the season of abstinence from food, the bile remains torpid,
							neither is the tongue unpleasantly affected with that to which
							it is habituated; but the bile, if heated up by the tastes of the
							articles of food, impresses the tongue. When, therefore, the
							food is bitter, the sensation is of the bitter things; but when
							sweet, of the bilious. For the sensation of the bile anticipates
							the other, and thus deceives those who suppose that bitter
							things appear sweet; for it is not so, but because it is not exacerbated
							by the bitter lodged in it from being habituated to
							the disease, the phantasy of sweet is created; and there is the
							same condition in sweet and bitter tastes; for the bile is the
							screen of the fallacious tastes.</p>
						<p>When, therefore, it appears without inflammation of any
							viscus, it is usually not dangerous, though protracted; but if
							prolonged, and the viscus gets inflamed, it terminates most
							commonly in dropsy and cachexia. And many have died</p>
						<pb n="328"/>
						<p>emaciated, without dropsy. It is familiar to adolescents and
							young men, and to them it is less dangerous; it is not altogether
							unusual also with children, but in them it is not entirely
							free from danger.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="16"><head>CHAPTER XVI. ON CACHEXIA, OR BAD HABIT OF BODY.</head>
						
						<p>C<hi rend="smallcaps">ACHEXIA</hi> arises as the conversion of nearly all diseases; for
							almost all diseases are its progenitors. But it likewise is formed
							by itself, separately from all others, as an original affection of
							the noxious kind, by deriving its increase from the administration
							of many and improper medicines. And "a bad habit"
							for a season is common to all complaints, with many symptoms;
							and of this its name is significant. There is emaciation, paleness,
							swelling, or whatever else happens for the time to be
							prevalent in the body. But cachexia is the form of one great
							affection, and gives its name to the same. For "the good
							habit of the patient" (<hi rend="ital">Euhexia</hi>) in all respects, as regards digestion,
							the formation of blood for distribution, and every natural
							operation whence arise good breathing, good strength, and
							good colour, constitutes the pristine state of good health. But
							if its nature become changed to the weakness of cacochymy,
							this constitutes cachexia.</p>
						<p>This disease is difficult to cure, and is a very protracted
							illness; for it is engendered during a protracted space of time,
							and not from one infirmity of the body, nor in connection with
							only one viscus; for it is formed by the conversion of all into
							a vitiated state. Wherefore those diseases which are its offspring
							are incurable, as dropsy, phthisis, or wasting; for,
							indeed, the causes of cachexia are akin to those of wasting.</p>
						<pb n="329"/>
						<p>The disease is a protracted and continuous dysentery, and the
							relapses of diseases in certain cases. Generally there is sufficient
							appetite, and plenty of food is taken; but the distribution
							thereof takes place in a crude and undigested condition, for
							the operation of digestion is not performed upon the food.</p>
						<p>The cause of it also may be the suppression of the hemorrhoidal
							discharge, or the omission of customary vomiting,
							inactivity as regards exercises, and indolence as to great
							labours. When each of its attendants has ceased to return,
							there is heaviness of the whole body, now and then paleness,
							flatulence of the stomach, eyes hollow, sleep heavy, and inactivity.
							But these symptoms occurring in an erratic form conceal
							the existence of the disease; but if they remain and strike
							root, nor readily give way, they are significant of a mighty
							illness. When in an erect posture, then they become swollen
							in their feet and legs; but, when reclining, in the parts they
							lay upon; and if they change their position, the swelling
							changes accordingly, and the course of the cold humour is
							determined by its weight. For when the heat evaporates the
							humidity, if it be not diffused, the humidity again runs in a
							liquid state. They have an appetite for much food, and are
							very voracious; the distribution is more expeditious than the
							digestion, of matters that are crude rather than undigested; but
							digestion is not at all performed, nor is it digested in the whole
							body by nature. For the weakness of the heat in the belly
							and in the system is the same, neither is good and well-coloured
							blood formed.</p>
						<p>And when the whole body is filled with crudities, and the
							desire as to food is gone, the cachexy having now extended to
							the stomach, and the affection having now attained its summit,
							they become swollen, inactive, and spiritless towards every exertion.
							The belly is dried up, and, for the most part, the alvine
							discharges are without bile, white, hard, and undigested. They
							are parched in person, without perspiration, troubled with</p>
						<pb n="330"/>
						<p>itchiness; sleep at no time settled, but drowsiness in the
							reclining position; respiration slow; pulse obscure, feeble,
							frequent, and very frequent upon any, even a very small,
							exertion; respiration in these cases asthmatic; veins on the
							temples elevated, with emaciation of the parts around; but at
							the wrists the veins much larger and tumid; blood of a dark-green
							colour. Along with these, <hi rend="ital">phthisis</hi> or <hi rend="ital">tabes</hi> induces anasarca
							or ascites, and from their progeny there is no escape.</p>
						<p>With regard to the ages which induce this disease, in the
							first place, old age, in which there is no recovery; children
							are readily affected, and more readily recover; adults are not
							very much exposed to the affection, but have by no means
							easy recoveries. No one season produces this disease, nor
							does it terminate in any one; but autumn indeed conceives
							it, winter nurses it, spring brings it to its full growth, and
							summer despatches it.</p>

					<head>BOOK II.</head>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="1"><head>CHAPTER I. ON DROPSY.</head>
						<p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">ROPSY</hi> is indeed an affection unseemly to behold and
							difficult to endure; for very few escape from it, and they more
							by fortune and the gods, than by art; for all the greater ills
							the gods only can remedy. For either the disease lurking in
							a vital organ has changed the whole system to cachexy, or
							the general system from some plague that has gone before
							has changed the viscera to a Cacochymy, when both co-operate
							with one another to increase the illness, and no part is
							uninjured from which even a slight assistance might be rendered
							to Nature. It is a cold and dense vapour converted into humidity,
							resembling a mist in the universe; or, it is the conversion
							of a humid and cold cause which changes the patient
							to such a habit. For a fluid rolling about in the lower belly
							we do not call Dropsy, since neither is the affection situated in
							that place; but when the tumour, swelling, colour, and the
							habit melting down to water, conspire in the disease, it both
							is, and is called Dropsy. For, even should the water at any</p>
						<pb n="334"/>
						<p>time burst outwardly, or should one give vent to it, by
							making an incision in the hypochondrium, the dropsical
							affection will still remain confirmed; wherefore the primary
							cause of it is cachexia.</p>
						<p>There are many varieties, each having different names.
							For if the watery suffusion float in the flanks, and, owing to
							its fulness, when tapped it sound like a drum, the disease is
							called <hi rend="ital">Tympanites.</hi> But if the water be confined in large
							quantity in the peritonæum, and the intestines float in the
							liquid, it gets the appellation of <hi rend="ital">Ascites.</hi> But if the lower
							belly contain none of these, but the whole body swell, if in
							connexion with a white, thick, and cold phlegm, the disease
							is called <hi rend="ital">Phlegmatias;</hi> but if the fleshy parts are melted down
							into a sanguineous, watery, or thin humour, then the species
							of dropsy called <hi rend="ital">Anasarca</hi> is formed. The constitution of each
							of them is bad; but the combination of them is much worse.
							For sometimes the variety which forms in the lower belly
							(<hi rend="ital">Ascites</hi>), is associated with that variety in which the fluid
							is diffused all over the body. But the most dangerous is that
							form in which Tympanites is mixed with Anasarca. For of
							the dropsies that form in the lower belly, Tympanites is
							particularly worse than Ascites. But of those affecting the
							whole body, Leucophlegmatia is less than Anasarca. It is
							mild then, so to speak of such hopeless diseases, when a
							smaller affection is combined with another smaller one. But
							it is much worse if one of the smaller enters into combination
							with one of the greater. But if a complete mixture
							of two great affections take place, the product thereof is a
							greater evil.</p>
						<p>The symptoms are very great and very easy to see, to touch,
							and to hear; in Ascites, for example, to see the tumidity of
							the abdomen, and the swelling about the feet; the face,
							the arms, and other parts are slender, but the scrotum and
							and prepuce swell, and the whole member becomes crooked,</p>
						<pb n="335"/>
						<p>from the inequality of the swelling:--To touch--by strongly
							applying the hand and compressing the lower belly; for the
							fluid will pass to other parts. But when the patient turns to
							this side or that, the fluid, in the change of posture, occasions
							swelling and fluctuation, the sound of which may be heard.
							But if you press the finger firmly on any part, it becomes
							hollow, and remains so for a considerable time. These are the
							appearances of Ascites.</p>
						<p>Tympanites may be recognised, not only from the sight of
							the swelling, but also by the sound which is heard on percussion.
							For if you tap with the hand, the abdomen sounds;
							neither does the flatus (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) shift its place with the
							changes of posture; for the flatus, even although that which
							contains it should be turned upwards and downwards, remains
							always equally the same; but should the flatus (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>)
							be converted into vapour and water (for Ascites may supervene
							on Tympanites), it shifts its form, indeed, the one half
							running in a fluid state, if the conversion be incomplete.</p>
						<p>In Anasarca and Leucophlegmatia the lower belly is empty,
							the patients are swelled in the face and arms; and likewise, in
							these cases, whatever parts are empty in the others, in them
							become full. For in Leucophlegmatia there is collected a
							white, cold, and thick phlegm; with it the whole body is
							filled, and the face is swollen, and also the neck and arms;
							but the abdomen is full from the swelling; but the mammæ
							are raised up into a swelling in the case of such youths as are
							still in the happy period of life. But, in Anasarca, there is
							wasting of the flesh to a fleshy humour, and a bloody ichor,
							such as runs from ulcerations of the bowels, and such as flows
							from bruises produced by the fall of weights, if the outer
							skin be scarified. But the combination of the two has the
							symptoms of both.</p>
						<p>In all the species there are present paleness, difficulty of
							breathing, occasional cough; they are torpid, with much languor</p>
						<pb n="336"/>
						<p>and loss of appetite; but if they take any food, however
							small in quantity and free from flatulence, they become flatulent,
							and have distension as if from repletion; skin dry, so
							that it does not become moist even after the bath; they
							are white and effeminate; but in Anasarca they are of a dark-green
							colour, and have dark veins; in Ascites and Tympanites
							these are prominent, both in the face, and in the wrists, and the
							abdomen. But in Anasarca and Leucophlegmatia all the parts
							are concealed by the swelling; sleep heavy; they are torpid,
							with slight dejection of spirit; concern about trifles; fondness of
							life; endurance not from good spirits and good hopes like those
							in prosperity, but from the nature of the affection. It is not
							possible exactly to state the cause; but this is a mighty wonder,
							how in certain diseases, not altogether dangerous, the patients
							are spiritless, dejected, and wish to die, but in others they
							have good hopes and are fond of life. Diseases produce both
							these contraries.</p>
						<p>Dropsy sometimes is occasioned suddenly by a copious cold
							draught, when, on account of thirst, much cold water is swallowed,
							and the fluid is transferred to the peritonæum; by
							which means the innate heat in the cavities is congealed, and
							then the drops which formerly were converted into air and
							dissipated, flow into the cavities. If this, therefore, happen,
							the cure of these cases is easier before any of the viscera or the
							whole person is affected. Moreover flatulent food, indigestion,
							and the Buprestis<note n="1">The <hi rend="ital">Meloe vesicatoria.</hi> See Paulus Ægineta, Syd. Soc. edit., t.iii.
								p. 74; and Dioscorides, ii. 69.</note> have sometimes occasioned dropsies.</p>
						<p>It is an illness common to all, men and women, in every
							period of life, only that certain ages are more exposed to
							certain species of the disease; children to Anasarca and Leucophlegmatia;
							young men until manhood are subject to swelling
							about the lower belly (<hi rend="ital">Ascites?</hi>) Old persons are prone to
							suffer all kinds, as being deficient in heat, for old age is cold;</p>
						<pb n="337"/>
						<p>but they are not exposed to collections of humours, and to
							them, therefore, Tympanites is the familiar form.</p>
						<p>All the species, indeed, are unfavourable; for dropsy, in all
							its forms of disease, is bad. But of these, leucophlegmatia is
							the more mild; for in it there are many and various chances
							of good fortune, such as an evacuation of sweat, of urine, or
							from the bowels, by which the dropsical habit is carried off.
							But tympanites is of a difficult nature, and still more so
							anasarca; for in this affection the physician would require to
							change the whole person, a thing not easy for the gods themselves
							to accomplish.</p>
						<p>Sometimes the dropsy forms in a small space, such as the
							head in hydrocephalus; or in the lungs alone; or in the liver,
							or the spleen; or the womb in women; and this last is easier to
							cure than any of the others, for provided its mouth relax from
							its former constriction, if it contains a fluid, it discharges the
							same outwardly, and if a flatus, it is dissipated. But if the
							uterus suffer at all in anasarca, for the most part the whole
							woman becomes dropsical.</p>
						<p>This other form of dropsy is known: small and numerous
							bladders, full of fluid, are contained in the place where ascites
							is found; but they also float in a copious fluid, of which this
							is a proof; for if you perforate the abdomen so as to evacuate
							the fluid, after a small discharge of the fluid, a bladder
							within will block up the passage; but if you push the instrument
							farther in, the discharge will be renewed. This species,
							then, is not of a mild character; for there is no ready passage
							by which the bladders might escape. It is said, however, that
							in certain cases such bladders have come out by the bowels.
							I have never seen such a case, and therefore write nothing of
							them; for I am unable to tell whether the discharge be from
							the colon, or the stomach. What is the mode of their formation?
							For the passage whereby all matters may be discharged
							by the anus is patent; but the discharge of the water collected</p>
						<pb n="338"/>
						<p>about the loins by the bowels is incredible. For a wounded
							intestine is not free from trouble and danger.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="2"><head>CHAPTER II. ON DIABETES.</head>
						<p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">IABETES</hi> is a wonderful affection, not very frequent among
							men, being a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine.
							Its cause is of a cold and humid nature, as in dropsy. The
							course is the common one, namely, the kidneys and bladder;
							for the patients never stop making water, but the flow is incessant,
							as if from the opening of aqueducts. The nature of
							the disease, then, is chronic, and it takes a long period to form;
							but the patient is short-lived, if the constitution of the disease
							be completely established; for the melting is rapid, the death
							speedy. Moreover, life is disgusting and painful; thirst, unquenchable;
							excessive drinking, which, however, is disproportionate
							to the large quantity of urine, for more urine is
							passed; and one cannot stop them either from drinking or
							making water. Or if for a time they abstain from drinking,
							their mouth becomes parched and their body dry; the viscera
							seem as if scorched up; they are affected with nausea, restlessness,
							and a burning thirst; and at no distant term they
							expire. Thirst, as if scorched up with fire. But by what
							method could they be restrained from making water? Or how
							can shame become more potent than pain? And even if they
							were to restrain themselves for a short time, they become
							swelled in the loins, scrotum, and hips; and when they give
							vent, they discharge the collected urine, and the swellings
							subside, for the overflow passes to the bladder.</p>
						<p>If the disease be fully established, it is strongly marked;</p>
						<pb n="339"/>
						<p>but if it be merely coming on, the patients have the mouth
							parched, saliva white, frothy, as if from thirst (for the thirst
							is not yet confirmed), weight in the hypochondriac region. A
							sensation of heat or of cold from the stomach to the bladder
							is, as it were, the advent of the approaching disease; they now
							make a little more water than usual, and there is thirst, but
							not yet great.</p>
						<p>But if it increase still more, the heat is small indeed, but
							pungent, and seated in the intestines; the abdomen shrivelled,
							veins protuberant, general emaciation, when the quantity of
							urine and the thirst have already increased; and when, at the
							same time, the sensation appears at the extremity of the
							member, the patients immediately make water. Hence, the
							disease appears to me to have got the name of <hi rend="ital">diabetes</hi>, as if

							abstain from drink for a little, he again drinks copiously from

					<div3 type="chapter" n="3"><head>CHAPTER III. ON THE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE KIDNEYS.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> kidneys are of a glandular nature, but redder in colour,
							like the liver, rather than like the mammæ and testicles; for
							they, too, are glands, but of a whiter colour. In shape they
							resemble the testicles, but are broader, and, at the same time,
							curved. Their cavities are small and like sieves, for the percolation
							of the urine; and these have attached to each of them
							nervous canals, like reeds, which are inserted into the shoulders
							of the bladder on each side; and the passage of the urine from
							each of the kidneys to the bladder is equal.</p>
						<p>About it, the kidneys, and those passages, many and complicated
							diseases are formed, partly acute, proving fatal by hemorrhage,
							fevers, and inflammation, as has been described by me;</p>
						<pb n="341"/>
						<p>but partly chronic, others wearing out the patient by wasting,
							and although not of a fatal character, incurable, and persisting
							until death. Wherefore, the chronic are--abscesses, ulcers,
							the formation of stones, and hemorrhoids. The ulcerations from
							abscess in man are all very protracted, and difficult to cure.</p>
						<p>The formation of stones is a long process, the stoppage of
							them painful, for the passage of them is not easily accomplished;
							and in addition to these, the retention of urine is
							formidable. But if several small ones stop together in the
							passage, or a large one be impacted; and if these occur to both
							kidneys, so as to occasion retention of urine and distension of
							the parts, the patients die in a few days. Nature, therefore,
							did well in forming the cavity of the kidneys oblong, and of
							equal size with the ureters, and even a little larger, so that if
							a stone formed above, it might have a ready passage to the
							bladder. On this account, also, the stones have an oblong
							form, because, for the most part, they are consolidated in the
							ureters; and such in that place as are of unequal thickness are
							slender before, owing to the ureters being narrow, but thick
							behind, because the kidneys verge downwards. They are
							formed in the kidneys only, but when in a heated state; for
							the stones have no fixed place in the ureters, but the gravel
							floats downwards with the urine, and thus is both indicative of
							the affection, and furnishes the <hi rend="ital">materiel</hi> of it. But if an unusually
							large one at any time be detained in the pelvis of the kidney,
							pains of the loins, about the regions of the <hi rend="ital">psoœ</hi>, as far as the
							middle of the ribs, take place, and hence, in many cases, the
							pain leads to mistake, as if it proceeded from pleurisy; heaviness
							of the hips; painful flexion about the spine, so that they
							stoop forward with difficulty; very painful tormina; at the same
							time, the pains are heavy with a sense of twisting, for the
							intestine is convoluted. But if the urine be retained in large
							quantity, and with distension, the desire of making water
							resembles the pains of labour; they are troubled with flatulence,</p>
						<pb n="342"/>
						<p>which cannot find vent; the fevers are pungent, and of
							a dry nature. Tongue parched; the belly, also, dried up;
							they are emaciated, and lose appetite; or if they take anything,
							they cannot readily swallow or digest it. But if the
							stone fall down into the ureters, there is shivering, as if from
							rigor, the sensation as if from the passing of a stone with
							violent exertion. And if it fall down into the bladder, there
							is an abundant evacuation of watery urine, flatulent discharges
							from the bowels, the stomach settled, eructations, rest from
							former illnesses; and sometimes blood is poured out along with
							the urine, from excoriation of the passage. Another painful
							operation is the passage through the member; for if the stone
							be larger than the urethra, it is detained for a long time, the
							bladder is filled behind, and the ischuria is very painful, for
							along with the bladder the ureters, also, are filled. The passage
							of crooked stones is most difficult, for I have seen hooked
							protuberances on certain of these concretions. But, for the
							most part, they are oblong, being formed according to the
							shape of the passages. In colour, some are white, clayey, as
							is mostly the case with children; others are yellow, and saffron-coloured
							in old persons, in whom the stones usually form in
							the kidneys, whereas in children it is rather in the bladder.
							The causes of the concretion are two-fold: in old persons, a
							cold body and thick blood. For cold concretes thick fluids
							more readily than heat, the proof of which is seen in the
							Thermal springs; for when congealed, the water gets concreted
							into a sort of chalk-stones. But in children, the copious
							recrement of the blood, being overheated, gives origin to their
							formation, like fire.</p>
						<p>Such are the affections connected with the formation of
							stones. Certain persons pass bloody urine periodically: this
							affection resembles that from hemorrhoids, and the constitution
							of the body is alike; they are very pale, inert, sluggish, without
							appetite, without digestion; and if the discharge has taken</p>
						<pb n="343"/>
						<p>place, they are languid and relaxed in their limbs, but light
							and agile in their head. But if the periodical evacuation do
							not take place, they are afflicted with headache; their eyes
							become dull, dim, and rolling: hence many become epileptic;
							others are swollen, misty, dropsical; and others again are
							affected with melancholy and paralysis. These complaints are
							the offspring of the stoppage of a customary discharge of
							blood. If, then, the blood flow pure and unmixed with urine,
							for the most part the blood of the urine flows from the
							bladder. Sometimes it is discharged in great quantity from
							rupture of the kidneys; sometimes it is coagulated, and a
							thrombus is formed of extravasated blood; sometimes it is
							coagulated in the bladder, when dreadful ischuria comes on.</p>
						<p>After the rupture there succeed ulcers, which are slow and
							difficult to heal; the indication of which is a scab, or red film,
							like a spider's web, or white pus passed in the urine, sometimes
							pure and unmixed, and sometimes mixed up with the urine.
							And by these symptoms we may also diagnose abcesses, if, in
							addition, fevers and rigors supervene towards evening; pains
							about the loins, pruritus; but if it burst, clots of a purulent
							and fleshy nature, and now a discharge of white pus. But
							the ulcers are pungent, sometimes clear, and sometimes foul.
							This is indicated by the pus and the urine, whether fetid or
							free of smell.</p>
						<p>Spring, then, induces hemorrhages and abscesses; winter
							and autumn, stones. But if along with the stones ulcers
							be formed, the diseases indeed are incurable, there is speedy
							emaciation and death.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER IV. ON THOSE IN THE BLADDER.</head>
						<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> the diseases in the bladder no one is mild: the acute
							proving fatal by inflammation, wounds, spasm, and acute
							fevers; while an ulcer, abcess, paralysis, or a large stone, are
							chronic and incurable. For it (<hi rend="ital">a large stone</hi>?) can neither be
							broken by a draught, nor by medicine, nor scraped outwardly,
							nor cut without danger. For the small ones of the bladder
							are to be cut out, but the other proves fatal the same day, or in
							a few days, the patients dying from spasms and fevers; or, if
							you do not cut him, retention of the urine takes place, and
							the patient is consumed slowly with pains, fevers, and wasting.
							But if the stone is not very large, there is frequent suppression
							of urine; for by falling readily into the neck of the bladder, it
							prevents the escape of the urine. Although it be safer to cut
							in these cases than for the large stones, still the bladder is cut;
							and although one should escape the risk of death, still there is
							a constant drain of water; and although this may not be dangerous,
							to a freeman the incessant flow of urine is intolerable,
							whether he walk or whether he sleep; but is particularly disagreeable
							when he walks. The very small ones are commonly
							cut without danger. If the stone adhere to the bladder, it
							may be detected with care; and, moreover, such cases prove
							troublesome from the pain and weight, even when there is no
							dysuria, but yet the patient may have difficulty of making
							water. You may diagnose all cases of stone by the sediments
							of sand in the urine, and, moreover, they have the genital
							parts enlarged by handling them; for when they make water,
							and there is a stone behind, they are pained, and grasp and
							drag the genital parts, as if with the intention of tearing out the
							stone along with the bladder. The fundament sympathises by
							becoming itchy, and the anus is protruded with the forcing</p>
						<pb n="345"/>
						<p>and straining, from the sensation, as it were, of the passage of
							the stone. For the bladder and anus lie close to one another,
							and when either suffers, the other suffers likewise. Wherefore,
							in inflammations of the rectum, the bladder is affected with
							ischuria; and in acute pains of the bladder, the anus passes
							nothing, even when the bowels are not much dried up. Such
							are the sufferings connected with calculi.</p>
						<p>Hemorrhage, although it may not prove fatal very speedily,
							yet in the course of time has wasted many patients. But the
							clots of blood produced by it are quickly fatal by inducing
							ischuria, like as in stones; for even if the blood be thin, of a
							bright colour, and not very coagulable, yet the bladder accumulates
							it for a length of time, and its heating and boiling (as
							it were) coagulates the blood, and thus a thrombus is formed.
							Ischuria, then, is most peculiarly fatal. But on these symptoms
							there supervene acute pain, acrid heat, a dry tongue, and
							from these they die delirious.</p>
						<p>If pain come on from a wound, the wound itself is dangerous;
							but the sore, even if not fatal at first, becomes incurable
							from fever or inflammation; for the bladder is thin, and of
							a nervous nature, and such parts do not readily incarnate nor
							cicatrise. Moreover, the urine is bilious, acrid, and corrosive.
							The ordinary condition of the ulcer is this:--when the bladder
							is filled, it is stretched; but when emptied, it contracts: it is
							in the condition, then, of a joint in extension and flexion, and
							no ulcer in a joint is easy of cure.</p>
						<p>The bladder also suppurates from an abscess. The symptoms
							of an abscess of the bladder are the same as in other cases; for
							the abscess in forming is attended with inflammation, fevers,
							and rigors. The dangers are the same. But if it discharges
							urine which is thick, white, and not fetid, the ulcers from
							them are mild; but if it spread, they pass urine which is feculent,
							mixed with pus, and of a bad smell: of such persons the
							death is not distant. The urine, indeed, is pungent, and the</p>
						<pb n="346"/>
						<p>evacuation thereof painful, and the pain darts to the extremity
							of the member. All things, even those which are opposed to
							one another, prove injurious to them; repletion and inanition,
							inactivity and exercise, baths and abstinence from baths, food
							and abstinence from food, sweet things and acid things; certain
							articles being serviceable in certain cases, but proving
							injurious in others, not being able to agree in any one.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER V. ON GONORRHŒA.</head>
						<p>G<hi rend="smallcaps">ONORRHŒA</hi> is not, indeed, a deadly affection, but one that
							is disagreeable and disgusting even to hear of. For if impotence
							and paralysis possess both the fluids and genital organs, the semen
							runs as if through dead parts, nor can it be stopped even in sleep;
							for whether asleep or awake the discharge is irrestrainable, and
							there is an unconscious flow of semen. Women also have this
							disease, but their semen is discharged with titillation of the parts,
							and with pleasure, and from immodest desires of connection
							with men. But men have not the same prurient feelings; the
							fluid which runs off being thin, cold, colourless, and unfruitful.
							For how could nature, when congealed, evacuate vivifying
							semen? And even young persons, when they suffer from this
							affection, necessarily become old in constitution, torpid, relaxed,
							spiritless, timid, stupid, enfeebled, shrivelled, inactive,
							pale, whitish, effeminate, loathe their food, and become frigid;
							they have heaviness of the members, torpidity of the legs, are
							powerless, and incapable of all exertion. In many cases, this
							disease is the way to paralysis; for how could the nervous
							power not suffer when nature has become frigid in regard to
							the generation of life? For it is the semen, when possessed of</p>
						<pb n="347"/>
						<p>vitality, which makes us to be men, hot, well braced in limbs,
							hairy, well voiced, spirited, strong to think and to act, as the
							characteristics of men prove. For when the semen is not possessed
							of its vitality, persons become shrivelled, have a sharp
							tone of voice, lose their hair and their beard, and become
							effeminate, as the characteristics of eunuchs prove. But if any
							man be continent in the emission of semen, he is bold, daring,
							and strong as wild beasts, as is proved from such of the athletæ
							as are continent. For such as are naturally superior in strength
							to certain persons, by incontinency become inferior to their
							inferiors; while those by nature much their inferiors by continency
							become superior to their superiors: but an animal
							becomes strong from nothing else than from semen. Vital
							semen, then, contributes much to health, strength, courage,
							and generation. From satyriasis a transition takes place to an
							attack of gonorrhœa.</p>

						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> stomach is the president of pleasure and disgust, being
							an important neighbour to the heart for imparting tone, good
							or bad spirits, from the sympathy of the soul. This is the

							described by me in another place. The offspring of pleasure
							are, good digestion, good condition, and good colour of the
							body; of disgust, their contraries, and also sometimes depression
							of spirits, when proper nutrition is wanting; and in
							melancholic patients, loathing of food. If, then, this organ be
							diseased, there is dislike and abomination of articles of food,
							not only if administered, but even if the food is not seen;</p>
						<pb n="348"/>
						<p>nay, the very remembrance of them is attended with nausea,
							distress, water-brash, and heart-ache; and in certain cases
							there is salivation and vomiting. Even when the body wastes,
							provided their stomach remain empty, they bear this pain
							more easily than that produced by the administration of food.
							But if at any time they are compelled by necessity to take
							food, the pain is worse than hunger; the act of masticating
							in the mouth occasions sufferance, and to drink is a still
							greater pain. And it is not that they suffer thus from suitable
							food, and bear more unusual food well; owing to a change
							from that which is natural to the opposite, there is a painful
							sensation as to everything, an aversion to, and dislike of, all
							kinds of food. Along with these there is pain between the
							scapulæ, much greater after the administration of food or
							drink; loathing, distress, sight dull, noises of the ears, heaviness
							of the head, torpidity of the limbs, their joints sink
							under them; palpitation in the hypochondriac region; phantasy,
							as of the spine being moved towards the lower limbs;
							they seem as if carried about, now this way and now that,
							whether they stand, or lie down, like reeds or trees shaken by
							a gale of wind; they belch out a cold and watery phlegm.
							But if there be bile in bilious persons, they have dimness of
							sight, and no thirst, even when owing to the food they appear
							thirsty; are sleepless, torpid, drowsy, not from true sleep, but
							like those in comatose affections; emaciated, very pale, feeble,
							relaxed, imbecile, dispirited, timid, inactive, quick to passion,
							very moody; for such persons at times have fallen into a state
							of melancholy.</p>
						<p>These mental emotions necessarily attend the affection when
							in connection with the stomach; but certain people, recognising
							the parts which sympathise, and from which the most
							dreadful symptoms arise, reckon the stomach as the cause.
							But the contiguity of the heart, which is of all organs the
							first, is a strong confirmation of the truth of what I say; for</p>
						<pb n="349"/>
						<p>the heart is placed in the middle of the lungs, and this intermediate
							space comprehends the stomach; and, moreover, both
							are connected with the spine; and from this vicinity to the
							heart arise the heart-ache, prostration of strength, and symptoms
							of melancholy.</p>
						<p>There are other, and, indeed, innumerable causes of this
							disease; but the principal is, much pus poured forth by the
							belly through the stomach. It is familiar to such persons as
							from their necessities live on a slender and hard diet; and to
							those who, for the sake of education, are laborious and persevering;
							whose portion is the love of divine science, along
							with scanty food, want of sleep, and the meditation on wise
							sayings and doings--whose is the contempt of a full and
							multifarious diet; to whom hunger is for food, water for
							drink, and watchfulness in place of rest; to whom in place of
							a soft couch, is a hammock on the ground without bed-clothes,
							a mean coverlet, a porous mantle, and the only cover to whose
							head is the common air; whose wealth consists in the abundant
							possession and use of divine thought (for all these things they
							account good from love of learning); and, if they take any
							food, it is of the most frugal description, and not to gratify
							the palate, but solely to preserve life; no quaffing of wine to
							intoxication; no recreation; no roving or jaunting about; no
							bodily exercise nor plumpness of flesh; for what is there from
							which the love of learning will not allure one?--from country,
							parents, brothers, oneself, even unto death. Hence, to them,
							emaciation of the frame; they are ill-complexioned; even
							in youth they appear old, and dotards in understanding; in
							mind cheerless and inflexible; depraved appetite, speedy satiety
							of the accustomed slender and ordinary food, and from want
							of familiarity with a varied diet, a loathing of all savoury
							viands; for if they take any unusual article of food, they are
							injured thereby, and straightway abominate food of all kinds.
							It is a chronic disease of the stomach. But inflammations,</p>
						<pb n="350"/>

						<p>Summer brings on this disease, whence springs the complete

						<head>CHAPTER VII. ON THE CŒLIAC AFFECTION.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> stomach being the digestive organ, labours in digestion,
							when diarrhœa seizes the patient. Diarrhœa consists in the
							discharge of undigested food in a fluid state; and if this does
							not proceed from a slight cause of only one or two days' duration;
							and if, in addition, the patient's general system be debilitated
							by atrophy of the body, the Cœliac disease of a chronic
							nature is formed, from atony of the heat which digests, and
							refrigeration of the stomach, when the food, indeed, is dissolved
							in the heat, but the heat does not digest it, nor convert
							it into its proper chyme, but leaves its work half finished,
							from inability to complete it; the food then being deprived
							of this operation, is changed to a state which is bad in colour,
							smell, and consistence. For its colour is white and without
							bile; it has an offensive smell, and is flatulent; it is liquid,
							and wants consistence from not being completely elaborated,
							and from no part of the digestive process having been properly
							done except the commencement.</p>
						<p>Wherefore they have flatulence of the stomach, continued
							eructations, of a bad smell; but if these pass downwards, the
							bowels rumble, evacuations are flatulent, thick, fluid, or</p>
						<pb n="351"/>
						<p>clayey, along with the phantasy, as if a fluid were passing
							through them; heavy pain of the stomach now and then, as
							if from a puncture; the patient emaciated and atrophied, pale,
							feeble, incapable of performing any of his accustomed works.
							But if he attempt to walk, the limbs fail; the veins in the
							temples are prominent, for owing to wasting, the temples are
							hollow; but also over all the body the veins are enlarged,
							for not only does the disease not digest properly, but it does
							not even distribute that portion in which the digestion had
							commenced for the support of the body; it appears to me,
							therefore, to be an affection, not only of the digestion, but
							also of the distribution.</p>
						<p>But if the disease be on the increase, it carries back the
							matters from the general system to the belly, when there is
							wasting of the constitution; the patients are parched in the
							mouth, surface dry and devoid of sweat, stomach sometimes
							as if burnt up with a coal, and sometimes as if congealed with
							ice. Sometimes also, along with the last scybala, there flows
							bright, pure, unmixed blood, so as to make it appear that the
							mouth of a vein has been opened; for the acrid discharge
							corrodes the veins. It is a very protracted and intractable
							illness; for, even when it would seem to have ceased, it relapses
							again without any obvious cause, and comes back upon even a
							slight mistake. Now, therefore, it returns periodically.</p>
						<p>This illness is familiar to old persons, and to women rather
							than to men. Children are subject to continued diarrhœa,
							from an ephemeral intemperance of food; but in their case the
							disease is not seated in the cavity of the stomach. Summer
							engenders the disease more than any other of the seasons;
							autumn next; and the coldest season, winter, also, if the heat
							be almost extinguished. This affection, dysentery and lientery,
							sometimes are engendered by a chronic disease. But, likewise,
							a copious draught of cold water has sometimes given rise

							lose appetite, become emaciated, sleepless, swollen in countenance.
							And if the colon be affected in connection with the
							spleen, they are of a dark-green colour; but of a light-green
							when in connection with the liver, from the sympathy of the
							nearest viscera. And if they take food, even in small quantity,
							and such as is not flatulent, they become very flatulent,
							and have a desire to pass wind, which, however, does not
							find vent: forced eructations upwards, but without effect; or,
							if any should be forcibly expelled, the flatus is fetid and acid
							which escapes upwards. The kidneys and bladder sympathise,
							with pain and ischuria; but in such cases the symptoms interchange
							with one another. But a greater wonder than these,
							--an unexpected pain has passed down to the testicles and cremasters;
							and this sympathetic affection has escaped the observation
							of many physicians, who have made an incision into
							the cremasters, as if they were the particular cause of the

						<p>quench thirst. But also a blow, exposure to cold, and cold
							drink, create ulcerations.</p>
						<p>The dejections and the circumstances attendant on the ulcers
							are different in different cases; for, if superficial, when from
							above, the discharges are thin, bilious, devoid of odour except
							that which they derive from the intestines; those from the
							jejunum are rather more coloured, saffron-like, and fetid.
							Those dejections which contain the food in a dissolved state
							but rough, are sometimes fetid in smell when the ulcers are
							gangrenous, and sometimes have the smell as if from scybala.
							But in the ulcerations from the parts below, the discharges
							are watery, thin, and devoid of smell. But if deeper they are
							like ichor, reddish, of the colour of dark wine, or like the
							washings of flesh; and these are sometimes by themselves and
							sometimes with the fæces, these being dissolved in the surrounding
							fluid, devoid of bile and of smell; or they are
							evacuated in a consistent and dry state, lubricated with the
							surrounding fluid. But if the ulcers be larger and smoother, in
							those above they are bilious, and pinch the parts from which
							they come and through which they pass (they even pinch the
							anus), for the bile is acrid, more especially if from an ulcer;
							and the bile is fatty, like grease. In the deeper ulcers below,
							a thick clot of blood with phlegm, like flesh not very fat, or
							like the scrapings of the bowels: nay, even entire portions are
							mixed up with them; they are discharged white, thick, mucous,
							like chopped tallow, along with the humour in which
							they float: these proceed from the rectum: but sometimes
							they are merely mucous, prurient, small, round, pungent,
							causing frequent dejections and a desire not without a pleasurable
							sensation, but with very scanty evacuations: this complaint
							gets the appellation of <hi rend="ital">tenesmus.</hi> But from the colon
							there are discharged pieces of flesh, which are red, large, and
							have a much larger circumference. If the ulcers become deep,
							and the blood thick and feculent, these are more fetid than</p>
						<pb n="355"/>
						<p>the former; but if the ulcers spread and are phagedænic, and
							if nothing will stop them, above, in addition to being intensely
							bilious, the dejections become saffron-like, frothy, feculent,
							blackish, like woad or like leeks, thicker than the former,
							fetid like a mortification; food now undigested, as if only
							masticated by voracious teeth. But if the under parts are also
							corroded, black clots of blood, thick, fleshy, very red, clotted,
							sometimes, indeed, black, but at other times of all various
							colours, fetid, intolerable; involuntary discharges of fluids.
							And sometimes a substance of considerable length, in many
							respects not to be distinguished from a sound piece of intestine,
							has been discharged, and, to those ignorant of the matter,
							has caused apprehension about the intestine: but the fact is
							this,--the intestines, like the stomach, consist of two coats,
							which lie close to one another in an oblique manner; when,
							therefore, the connection between them is dissolved, the inner
							coat, being separated to some length, protrudes externally,
							while the outer one remains alone, incarnates, and gets cicatrised,
							and the patients recover and live unharmed. It is the
							lower gut alone which suffers thus, owing to its fleshy nature.
							And, if blood be discharged from any vessel, it runs of a bright
							red or black colour, pure, and unmixed with food or scybala;
							and if a concretion is spread over it like broad spiders' webs,
							it coagulates when cold, and no longer would be taken for a
							secretion of blood; but being discharged with much flatulence
							and noise, it has the appearance of being much larger than its
							actual amount. Sometimes, also, a purulent abscess forms in
							the colon, nowise different from the other internal ulcers;
							for the symptoms, the pus, and the mode of recovery are the
							same. But if there be hard secretions of matters resembling
							flesh, as if pounded, and like rough bodies, the abscess is not
							of a mild nature. Sometimes a copious discharge of water
							takes place from the colon in the form of dysentery, which
							has freed many patients from dropsy. In a word, such are</p>
						<pb n="356"/>
						<p>the ulcers in the intestines; and their forms and the secretions
							from them as I have described.</p>
						<p>I will now describe the symptoms accompanying each of
							these states of disease, whether the ulcers be mild or malignant.
							To speak in general terms, then, if the excoriation is
							superficial, whether it be above or below, the patients are free
							from pain and from fever, and get better without being confined
							to bed, in various ways, by merely some slight changes of diet.
							But if ulceration supervene, in the upper bowels there are tormina,
							which are pungent, acrid, as if from the presence of a
							small amount of hot bile; and occasionally there is suppuration:
							indeed, for the most part, there is suppuration, or digestions
							imperfectly performed, though there is no want of appetite.
							But if the ulcers form in the lower part of the bowels, they are
							much less dangerous than in those above, for the bowels there
							are of a much more fleshy nature than those above. But if
							those above become hollow and phagedænic, there are acute
							fevers, of a latent kind, which smoulder in the intestines;
							general coldness, loss of appetite, insomnolency, acid eructations,
							nausea, vomiting of bile, vertigo: but if the discharge
							become copious, and consist of more bilious matters, the tormina
							become permanent, and the other pains increase; sometimes
							there is prostration of strength, feebleness of the knees;
							they have ardent fever, are thirsty, and anxious; black vomiting,
							tongue dry, pulse small and feeble. Akin to these are
							the fatal symptoms I have stated among those of malignant
							ulcers; cardiac affections even to deliquium animi, from which
							some never recover, but thus expire. These dangerous symptoms
							are common also to erosions of the lower intestines if the
							ulcers spread, and the discharge be not checked, only that the
							tormina and pains are below the umbilicus where the ulcers
							are situated. The forms of the secretions are such as I have
							said; but if they be small at first, and there be a postponement
							of their spreading for a long time, various changes take</p>
						<pb n="357"/>
						<p>place in the ulcers, some subsiding, and others swelling up,
							like waves in the sea. Such is the course of these ulcers. But
							if nature stand out, and the physician co-operate, the spreading
							may, indeed, be stopped, and a fatal termination is not apprehended,
							but the intestines remain hard and callous, and the
							recovery of such cases is protracted.</p>
						<p>In hemorrhage from the bowels, if it proceed from a large
							vein or artery, it is sudden death; for neither is it possible to
							introduce the hand so as to reach the ailment, nor to apply any
							medicine to the sore. And even if the hemorrhage were
							restrained by the medicine, the escape from death would not
							be certain; for, in some cases, the falling off of a large eschar
							widens the mouth of the vein, and when clots form within,
							and remain there, the disease is incurable. It is necessary, then,
							to cure hemorrhages in their commencement. Its approach, also,
							for the most part is obvious, although not in all cases quite
							apparent: anxiety attends, with restlessness, heaviness in the
							part where the rupture is to take place, ruddiness of the
							countenance if the blood has not yet burst forth. And if the
							vein has burst lately, for the most part the symptoms are
							alleviated; but if it has been a longer time ago, this takes
							place more slowly, and with more difficulty. Such are the
							ulcers in the intestines.</p>
						<p>They occur in the season of summer; next in autumn; less
							in spring; least of all in winter. Diarrhœa attacks children
							and adolescents, but dysentery adults and young persons. In
							old age convalescence is difficult, and cicatrization protracted.
							Corroding sores are unusual in old persons, but yet hemorrhage
							is in accordance with old age.</p>

						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> many thick and hard cicatrices form after dysenteries, and
							broad and very deep ulcerations of the upper intestines, the
							food passes from them to those below in a fluid state, without
							separation of the nutritious part; for the cicatrix shuts up the
							pores by which the nutriment is carried upwards. The patient,
							therefore, is seized with atrophy, loss of colour and of strength.
							The affection gets the appellation of Lientery, this name being
							applied to a cicatrix of the intestines. And here the affection
							is from ulcers. But sometimes the intestines do not acquire
							cicatrization, but yet usage and habit reconcile the intestines to
							the discharge. For, the heat in these parts, if congealed, neither
							at times performs digestion, nor is the nutriment distributed
							upwards; but being unchanged, owing to weakness, it fails to
							undergo any part of the process. But if the purging, though
							of vitiated matters, be temporary, and not confirmed, a simple
							vomit after food will sometimes remove the disease. But if the
							exciting cause be prolonged, and get confirmed, it does no
							good.</p>
						<p>A chronic disease, and cachexia so mild as not to confine

						<head>CHAPTER XI. ON AFFECTIONS OF THE WOMB, OR HYSTERICS.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> uterus in women is beneficial for purgation and parturition,
							but it is the common source of innumerable and bad</p>
						<pb n="359"/>
						<p>diseases; for not only is it subject to ulcers, inflammation, and
							the fluor, but, if the whole organ be suddenly carried upwards,
							it quickly causes death. The fatal diseases of an acute nature
							connected therewith have been described elsewhere: but the
							chronic affections are, the two species of <hi rend="ital">fluor</hi>; hardness;
							ulcers, part mild, but part malignant; prolapsus of the whole,
							or of part.</p>
						<p>The <hi rend="ital">fluor</hi>, then, is either of a red or white colour; its appearance
							indicates this. It is the red if it consist of bright
							red blood, and the varieties thereof; or livid, or black and
							thin, or thick and coagulated, like a thrombus; or white, like
							water; or a bright ochre colour, like bile: in thickness like a
							thinnish or thin and fetid ichor. The white flux (or <hi rend="ital">fluor
								albus</hi>) is like pus, and the true form like white whey; but a
							clot of blood frequently runs off with the pus. But there is an
							infinite variety of forms of it, as regards more or less quantity.
							Its periods sometimes agree with those of the menstrual purgation,
							but it does not continue the regular time as before; there
							is not much blood, but it flows during many days; the interval
							is for a few days, but is quite free from discharge. Another
							variety as to the period: the first purgation is at the regular
							time, but it occurs two or three times during each month.
							Another variety: a continual flux; small, indeed, every day,
							but by no means small during the whole month; for the
							uterus never closes its mouth, labouring under relaxation, so
							as to permit the flow of the fluid: but if it neither intermits
							nor diminishes, they die of hemorrhage. The symptoms are,
							the woman's colour in accordance with those of the discharge;
							sleepless, loathes food, anxious, relaxed, especially in the red
							flux, and subject to pains; the discharge fetid in both varieties,
							but to a greater and less extent at different times; for the
							white is worse if the putrefaction be unusually great; and
							sometimes the red, if the erosion be exacerbated. In a word,
							the black is the worst of all; the livid next; the pale, the</p>
						<pb n="360"/>
						<p>white, and the purulent, are more protracted, indeed, but less
							dangerous. Of these the pale is worse indeed, but much
							better when mixed with the customary discharge. Now the
							customary discharge is red in all its varieties. But, indeed,
							the red are worse in old women; but the white are not at all
							so to the young; but even to them that which is customary is
							less troublesome. Another white fluor: the menstrual discharge
							white, acrid, and attended with an agreeable pruritus;
							along with which the discharge of a white thick fluid, like
							semen, is provoked. This species we call female gonorrhœa.
							It is a refrigeration of the womb, which therefore becomes
							incapable of retaining its fluids; hence, also, the blood changes
							to a white colour, for it has not the purple colour of fire. The
							stomach, also, is subject to the affection, and vomits phlegm;
							and also the bowels are similarly affected in diarrhœa.</p>
						<p>Ulcers, too, are formed in the womb; some broad and attended
							with tingling, which, being close together, are, as it were, a
							superficial excoriation; pus thick, without smell, scanty. These
							ulcers are mild. But there are others deeper and worse than
							these, in which the pains are slight, pus somewhat more abundant,
							much more fetid, and yet, notwithstanding, these also
							are mild. But if they become deeper, and the lips of the
							sores hard or rough, if there is a fetid ichor, and pain stronger
							than in the former case, the ulcer corrodes the uterus; but
							sometimes a small piece of flesh is cast off and discharged, and
							this sore not coming to cicatrization, either proves fatal after a
							long time, or becomes very chronic. This sore gets the appellation
							of <hi rend="ital">phagedæna.</hi> The sores also are dangerous if in these
							cases the pain gets exacerbated, and the woman becomes
							uneasy. From the sore there is discharged a putrid matter,
							intolerable even to themselves; it is exasperated by touching
							and by medicines, and irritated by almost any mode of treatment.
							The veins in the uterus are swelled up with distension
							of the surrounding parts. To the skilled, it is not difficult to</p>
						<pb n="361"/>
						<p>recognise by the touch, for it is not otherwise obvious. Febrile
							heat, general restlessness, and hardness is present, as in malignant
							diseases; the ulcers, being of a fatal nature, obtain also
							the appellation of cancers. Another cancer: no ulceration
							anywhere, swelling hard and untractable, which distends the
							whole uterus; but there are pains also in the other parts which
							it drags to it. Both these carcinomatous sores are chronic and
							deadly; but the ulcerated is worse than the unulcerated, both
							in smell and pains, in life and in death.</p>
						<p>Sometimes the whole uterus has protruded from its seat,
							and lodged on the woman's thighs; an incredible affliction! yet
							neither has the uterus not been thus seen, nor are the causes
							which produce it such as do not occur. For the membranes
							which are inserted into the flanks, being the nervous (<hi rend="ital">ligamentous</hi>?)
							supporters of the uterus, are relaxed; those at the fundus,
							which are inserted into the loins, are narrow; but those at its
							neck, on each side to the flanks, are particularly nervous and
							broad, like the sails of a ship. All these, then, give way if
							the uterus protrude outwardly, wherefore this <hi rend="ital">procidentia</hi> generally
							proves fatal; for it takes place from abortion, great concussions,
							and laborious parturition. Or if it do not prove
							fatal, the women live for a long time, seeing parts which
							ought not to be seen, and nursing externally and fondling the
							womb. It would appear that, of the double membrane of the
							womb, the internal lining coat is sometimes torn from the
							contiguous one, for there are two transverse plates of the coat;
							this, then, is thrown off with the flux, and in abortion and
							laborious parturition, when it adheres to the placenta. For if
							it be forcibly pulled, the coat of the uterus being stretched,
							..... But if the woman do not die, it is either restored to
							its seat, or but a small part appears externally, for the woman
							conceals it with her thighs. Sometimes the mouth of the
							womb only, as far as the neck, protrudes, and retreats inwardly
							if the uterus be made to smell to a fetid fumigation; and the</p>
						<pb n="362"/>
						<p>woman also attracts it if she smells to fragrant odours. But
							by the hands of the midwife it readily returns inwards when
							gently pressed, and if anointed beforehand with the emollient
							plasters for the womb.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter" n="12">
						<head>CHAPTER XII. ON ARTHRITIS AND SCHIATICA.</head>
						<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">RTHRITIS</hi> is a general pain of all the joints; that of the
							feet we call Podagra; that of the hip-joint, Schiatica; that of
							the hand, Chiragra. The pain then is either sudden, arising
							from some temporary cause; or the disease lies concealed
							for a long time, when the pain and the disease are kindled
							up by any slight cause. It is, in short, an affection of all
							the nerves, if the ailment being increased extend to all; the
							first affected are the nerves which are the ligaments of the
							joints, and such as have their origin and insertion in the
							bones. There is a great wonder in regard to them; there is
							not the slightest pain in them, although you should cut or
							squeeze them; but if pained of themselves, no other pain
							is stronger than this, not iron screws, nor cords, not the
							wound of a sword, nor burning fire, for these are often had
							recourse to as cures for still greater pains; and if one cut
							them when they are pained, the smaller pain of the incision
							is obscured by the greater; and, if it prevail, they experience
							pleasure in forgetting their former sufferings. The teeth and
							bones are affected thus.</p>
						<p>The true reason of this none but the gods indeed can truly
							understand, but men may know the probable cause. In a
							word, it is such as this; any part which is very compact is
							insensible to the touch or to a wound, and hence it is not</p>
						<pb n="363"/>
						<p>painful to the touch or to a wound. For pain consists in an
							exasperated sense, but what is compact cannot be exasperated,
							and hence is not susceptible of pain. But a spongy part is
							very sensible, and is exasperated by an injury. But since
							dense parts also live by their innate heat, and possess sensibility
							by this heat, if then the exciting cause be material,
							such as either a sword, or a stone, the material part of the
							patient is not pained, for it is dense by nature. But if an
							intemperament of the innate heat seize it, there arises a
							change of the sense; the heat therefore is pained by itself,
							being roused within by the impression on the sense. The
							pains then are from nature's being increased, or a redundance
							thereof.</p>
						<p>Arthritis fixes itself sometimes in one joint and sometimes
							in another; sometimes in the hip-joints; and for the most part
							in these cases the patient remains lame in it; and the other
							joints it affects little, and sometimes does not go to the small
							joints, as the feet and hands. If it seizes the greater members
							which are able to contain the disease, it does not go beyond
							these organs; but if it begin from a small one, the attack is
							mild and unexpected. The commencement of ischiatic
							disease is from the thigh behind, the ham, or the leg. Sometimes
							the pain appears in the cotyloid cavity, and again extends
							to the nates or loins, and has the appearance of anything
							rather than an affection of the hip-joint. But the joints begin
							to be affected in this way: pain seizes the great toe; then the
							forepart of the heel on which we lean; next it comes into the
							hollow of the foot, but the ankle swells last; and they blame
							a wrong cause; some, the friction of a new shoe; others, a long
							walk; another again, a stroke or being trod upon; but no one
							will of his own accord tell the true one; and the true one
							appears incredible to the patients when they hear of it. On
							this account the disease gets to an incurable state, because at
							the commencement, when it is feeble, the physician is not at</p>
						<pb n="364"/>
						<p>hand to contend with it; but if it has acquired strength from
							time, all treatment is useless. In some, then, it remains in the
							joints of the feet until death, but in others it spreads over the
							compass of the whole body. For the most part, it passes from
							the feet to the hands. For to the disease there is no great
							interval between the hands and the feet, both being of a
							similar nature, slender, devoid of flesh, and very near the external
							cold, but very far from the internal heat; next the
							elbow and the knee, and after these the hip-joint; which is the
							transition to the muscles of the back and chest. It is incredible
							how far the mischief spreads. The vertebræ of the
							spine and neck are affected with the pain, and it extends to
							the extremity of the os sacrum: there is a general pain of all
							the parts of the groin, and a pain peculiar to each part thereof.
							But likewise the tendons and muscles are intensely pained; the
							muscles of the jaws and temples; the kidneys, and the bladder
							next in succession. And, what a wonder! at last the nose,
							the ears, and the lips, suffer; for every where there are nerves
							and muscles. A certain person had pains in the sutures of
							the head, and not knowing why he was pained there, he
							pointed out the shapes of the sutures--the oblique, the straight,
							the transverse--both behind and before, and stated that the
							pain was narrow and fixed in the bones; for the disease spreads
							over every commissure of the bones, in the same manner as
							in the joints of a foot or of a hand. Callosities also form in
							the joints; at first they resemble abscesses, but afterwards they
							get more condensed, and the humour being condensed is
							difficult to dissolve; at last they are converted into hard,
							white tophi, and over the whole there are small tumours, like
							vari and larger; but the humour is thick, white, and like hailstones.
							For it is a cold disease of the whole (body), like hail;
							and there appears to be a difference in regard to heat and
							cold; for in certain cases there is delight in things otherwise
							disagreeable. But, I fancy, that the cause is a refrigeration</p>
						<pb n="365"/>
						<p>of the innate heat, and that the disease is single; but if it
							speedily give way, and the heat re-appears, there is need of refrigeration
							and it delights in such things; this is called the hot
							species. But if the pain remain internally in the nerves, and
							the part not becoming heated subside, nor get swollen, I
							would call this variety cold, for which there is need of hot
							medicines to restore the heat, of which those very acrid are
							most necessary. For heat excites the collapsed parts to
							swelling, and calls forth the internal heat, when there is need
							of refrigerants. In proof of this, the same things are not
							always expedient in the same cases, for what is beneficial at
							one time proves prejudicial in another; in a word, heat is
							required in the beginning, and cold at the conclusion. Wherefore
							Gout does not often become unremitting; but sometimes it
							intermits a long time, for it is slight; hence a person subject
							to Gout has won the race in the Olympiac games during the
							interval of the disease.</p>
						<p>Men then are more readily affected, but more slightly the
							women; women more rarely than men, but more severely.
							For what is not usual nor cognate, if from necessity it gets
							the better engenders a more violent ailment. The most
							common age is after thirty-five; but sooner or slower according
							to the temperament and regimen of every one. The pains
							then are dreadful, and the concomitants worse than the pains;
							fainting even upon touch, inability of motion, loss of appetite,
							thirst, restlessness. But, if they recover partly, as if escaped
							from death, they live dissolutely, are incontinent, open-handed,
							cheerful, munificent, and luxurious in diet; but partly, as if
							they would (not?) again escape from death, they enjoy the
							present life abundantly. In many cases the gout has passed
							into dropsy, and sometimes into asthma; and from this succession there is no escape.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER XIII. ON ELEPHAS, OR ELEPHANTIASIS.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HERE</hi> are many things in common as to form, colour, size,
							and mode of life between the affection Elephas and the wild
							beast the elephant; but neither does the affection resemble
							any other affection, nor the animal any other animal. The
							wild beast, the elephant, indeed, is very different from all
							others; in the first place then, he is the greatest and the
							thickest of animals; in size, he is as great as if you were to
							put one animal on another, like a tower; in bulk, he is as
							large as if you should place several other very large animals
							side by side. But neither in shape is he much like unto any
							other. Then, as to colour, they are all intensely black, and
							that over their whole body. One horse, indeed, is very white,
							like "the Thracian steeds of Rhesus"; others white-footed,
							like "the white-footed horse of Menelaus"; and bay, like
							"one hundred and fifty"; others are tawny, as "assuming the
							shape of a horse having a tawny mane, he lay down with
							her." And so it is with oxen, and dogs, and all other reptiles
							and animals which live on the earth. But elephants are only
							of a lurid colour, "like to night and death." With regard
							to shape, they have a very black head, and unseemly face of
							no marked form, upon a small neck, so that the head appears to
							rest upon the shoulders, and even then it is not very conspicuous.
							For the ears are large, broad, resembling wings, extending to
							the collar-bone and breast-bone, so as to conceal the neck with
							the ears, like ships with their sails. The elephant has wonderfully
							white horns on a very dark body--others call them
							teeth--these alone are most white, such as is nothing else of
							even any other white animal; and these are not above the
							forehead and temples, as is the nature of other horned
							animals, but in the mouth and upper jaw, not indeed quite</p>
						<pb n="367"/>
						<p>straight forwards but a little bent upwards, so that it might
							swallow in a straight direction, and lift a load in its flat teeth.
							Moreover the horns are large, the medium length being as
							much as a fathom, and some much larger; that is to say, as
							long as two fathoms. And the upper jaw from its lip has a
							long, ex-osseous, crooked, and serpent-like protuberance; and
							there are two perforations at the extremity of this protuberance;
							and these by nature are perforated all the way to the
							lungs, so as to form a double tube, so that the animal uses this
							pipe as a nostril for respiration, and likewise as a hand; for it
							could take a cup if it please with this protuberance, and
							can grasp it round and hold it firmly, and none could it
							take by force from the animal, except another stronger
							elephant. And with this also it seeks herbage for food; for
							neither does it live by eating flesh with its mouth and small
							teeth. For, its feet being long, raise the animal considerably
							above the ground; but its neck also, as I have said, is small,
							and therefore it cannot browse on the earth with its mouth;
							and moreover the excrescence of the horns in front of the
							mouth prevents the mouth from touching the herbage.
							Wherefore it raises a great load with its protuberance; then
							as if with a binder having bound the same with it, he can
							convey it to his mouth; whence the ancients properly call
							it <hi rend="ital">proboscis</hi>, for it collects food in front of the animal. But
							neither is it able to drink from a lake or river with its mouth,
							for the same reason. But, if it is thirsty, it introduces into the
							water the extreme nostril of the proboscis, and then, as if
							inhaling, it draws in much water, instead of air; and when it
							has filled its nose, as it were a cup, it pours the same as a
							stream of water into its mouth, and then it draws anew and
							discharges again, until it fills its belly, as it were a vessel of
							burden. It has a rough and very thick skin, containing
							fissures with prominent edges, long channels, and other
							hollow clefts, some transverse, others oblique, very deep, like</p>
						<pb n="368"/>
						<p>in all respects to a furrowed field. Other animals have naturally
							hairs for a mane, but in the elephant this is merely
							down. There are also innumerable other differences between
							it and other animals; for, like man, it bends its leg backward
							at the knee; and like woman, it has its dugs at the arm-pits.
							But there is no necessity for me now to write concerning the
							animal, except in so far as there is any discrepancy between
							the animal and the disease, and in so far as the symptoms of
							the patient resemble the nature of the animal. The disease
							is also called <hi rend="ital">Leo</hi>, on account of the resemblance of the eyebrows,
							as I shall afterwards explain; and <hi rend="ital">Satyriasis</hi>, from the
							redness of the cheeks, and the irresistible and shameless impulse
							<hi rend="ital">ad coitum.</hi> Moreover it is also called the <hi rend="ital">Heracleian</hi> affection,
							insomuch as there is none greater and stronger than
							it.</p>
						<p>Wherefore the affection is mighty in power, for it is the
							most powerful of all in taking life; and also it is filthy and
							dreadful to behold, in all respects like the wild animal, the
							elephant. And from the disease there is no escape, for it
							originates in a deadly cause; it is a refrigeration of the innate
							heat, or rather a congelation like a great winter, when the
							water is converted into snow, or hail, or ice, or frost. This is
							the common cause of death, and of the affection.</p>
						<p>But the commencement of the disease gives no great indication
							of it; neither does it appear as if any unusual ailment
							had come upon the man; nor does it display itself upon the
							surface of the body, so that it might be immediately seen, and
							remedies applied at the commencement; but lurking among
							the bowels, like a concealed fire it smolders there, and having
							prevailed over the internal parts, it afterwards blazes forth on
							the surface, for the most part beginning, like a bad signal-fire,
							on the face, as it were its watch-tower; but in certain
							cases from the joint of the elbow, the knee, and knuckles of
							the hands and feet. In this way the patient's condition is</p>
						<pb n="369"/>
						<p>hopeless, because the physician, from inattention and ignorance
							of the patient's ailment, does not apply his art to the commencement
							when the disease is very feeble. For, indeed,
							they are merely torpid, as if from some light cause, drowsy,
							inactive, dry in the bowels, and these symptoms are not very
							unusual even in healthy persons. But upon the increase of
							the affection, the respiration is fetid from the corruption within
							of the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>). The air, or something external, would
							seem to be the cause of this. Urine thick, muddy, like that
							of cattle; the distribution of crude undigested food; and yet
							of these things there is no perception nor regard; for neither
							are they aware whether or not they digest, thus digestion or
							indigestion is all one to them, since, for anything useful
							and proper to them, digestion is not usual with them. The
							distribution, however, is easy, the disease, as it were, greedily
							attracting the food for its own nourishment; for this reason
							the lower belly is very dry. Tumours prominent, not continuous
							with one another anywhere, but thick and rough, and
							the intermediate space cracked, like the skin of the elephant.
							Veins enlarged, not from abundance of blood, but from thickness
							of the skin; and for no long time is the situation of them
							manifest, the whole surface being elevated equally in the
							swelling. The hairs on the whole body die prematurely, on
							the hands, the thighs, the legs, and again on the pubes; scanty
							on the chin, and also the hairs on the head are scarce. And
							still more frequently premature hoariness, and sudden baldness;
							in a very short time the pubes and chin naked of hair, or if
							a few hairs should remain, they are more unseemly than
							where they are gone. The skin of the head deeply cracked;
							wrinkles frequent, deep, rough; tumours on the face hard,
							sharp; sometimes white at the top, but more green at the
							base. Pulse small, dull, languid, as if moved with difficulty
							through the mud; veins on the temples elevated, and also
							those under the tongue; bowels bilious; tongue roughened</p>
						<pb n="370"/>
						<p>with <hi rend="ital">vari</hi>, resembling hailstones; not unusual for the whole
							frame to be full of such (and thus also in unsound victims, the
							flesh is full of these tubercles resembling hail). But if the
							affection be much raised up from the parts within, and appear
							upon the extremities, <hi rend="ital">lichens</hi> occur on the extremities of the
							fingers; there is pruritus on the knees, and the patients rub
							the itchy parts with pleasure.<note n="1"><p>Our author in this place evidently
								alludes to <hi rend="ital">mentagra</hi>, a malignant
								disease of the face, very
								prevalent in Rome in his time,
								that is to say, towards the end
								of the first and the beginning of
								the second century. The first
								description of it which we possess,
								is contained in Pliny's <hi rend="ital">Nat. Hist.</hi>
								xxvi., at the beginning, and is to
								the following effect: That it was
								one of the new diseases of the
								face, which at one time had spread
								over most parts of Europe, but
								was then mostly confined to Rome:
								That it had been called by the
								Greeks, <hi rend="ital">lichen</hi>, but that latterly
								the Latin term <hi rend="ital">mentagra</hi> had been
								applied to it. He further asserts,
								that it was unknown in former
								times, and made its first appearance
								in Italy during the reign of
								Tiberius: that the men of the
								middle and lower classes, and
								more especially women, were exempt
								from it, the ravages of the
								disease being confined principally
								to the nobility, among whom it
								was propagated by kissing. He
								adds respecting it, that it was
								cured by caustics, the effects of
								which often left unseemly scars
								on the face. That the disease had
								come originally from Egypt, the
								mother of all such distempers.</p>
								<p>Another very interesting account
									of the disease, under the
									names of <hi rend="ital">lichen</hi> and <hi rend="ital">mentagra</hi>, is
									given by Marcellus, the Empiric,
									in chap. cxix., wherein elephantiasis,
									lepra, and other inveterate
									diseases of the skin are described.
									He says that the distemper (vitium)
									when neglected is apt to
									spread all over the face, and to
									contaminate many persons. He
									prescribes various caustic and stimulant
									applications for it. Along
									with it, he gives a very good account
									of elephantiasis, which, he
									remarks, also generally begins in
									the face with vari and other appearances,
									similar to those described
									by our author. He states
									decidedly that the disease is
									endemical in Egypt, attacking not
									only the lower ranks, but even
									kings themselves.</p>
								<p>Now it is worthy of remark,
									that beyond all question this is
									the disease to which frequent allusion
									is made by the poet Martial
									as prevailing extensively in
									Rome, and as being propagated by
									the fashionable practice of persons
									saluting one another, by kissing,
									in the streets. The following
									passages evidently allude to it--<hi rend="ital">Epigr.</hi>
									xi.,8; xii. 59.</p>
								<p>From all these descriptions, we
									cannot entertain a doubt, that the
									disease, then so prevalent in Rome,
									was of a malignant and contagious
									nature, which attacked principally
									the face, and was propagated by
									kissing ; and, further, that it was
									a disease of the same class as elephantiasis.
									Taking all these circumstances
									into account, one may
									venture to decide pretty confidently,
									that it was a disease akin
									to the <hi rend="ital">Sivvens</hi> of Scotland, which
									it strikingly resembles in all its
									characters as described above.
									<hi rend="ital">Sivvens</hi>, in short, is a species or
									variety of syphilis, which is readily
									communicated both by the mouth,
									as in kissing, and <hi rend="ital">per coitum.</hi> Further,
									that Syphilis, and its congener
									<hi rend="ital">Sivvens</hi>, are the brood of the
									ancient elephantiasis, no one at
									all acquainted with the history of
									the latter in ancient, mediæval, and
									modern times, will entertain a
									doubt. See the note to Paulus
									Ægineta, t. ii., 14, 15, 16, and the
									authorities there referred to: also,
									the History of Syphilis, as given
									in Sprengel's and in Renouard's
									History of Medicine.</p>
								<p>The importance of this subject,
									which has never been satisfactorily
									illustrated elsewhere, will be my
									apology for embracing the present
									opportunity of endeavouring to
									throw some additional light on it.</p></note> And the <hi rend="ital">lichen</hi> sometimes</p>
						<pb n="371"/>
						<p>embraces the chin all round; it reddens the cheeks, but is
							attended with no great swelling; eyes misty, resembling bronze;
							eye-brows prominent, thick, bald, inclining downwards, tumid
							from contraction of the intermediate space; colour livid or
							black; eye-lid, therefore, much retracted to cover the eyes, as
							in enraged lions; on this account it is named <hi rend="ital">leontium.</hi> Wherefore
							it is not like to the lions and elephants only, but also in
							the eye-lids "resembles swift night." Nose, with black protuberances,
							rugged; prominence of the lips thickened, but lower
							part livid; nose elongated; teeth not white indeed, but
							appearing to be so under a dark body; ears red, black,
							contracted, resembling the elephant, so that they appear to
							have a greater size than usual; ulcers upon the base of the
							ears, discharge of ichor, with pruritus; shrivelled all over the
							body with rough wrinkles; but likewise deep fissures, like
							black furrows on the skin; and for this reason the disease has
							got the name of <hi rend="ital">elephas.</hi> Cracks on the feet and heels, as far
							as the middle of the toes; but if the ailment still further
							increase, the tumours become ulcerated, so that on the cheeks,</p>
						<pb n="372"/>
						<p>chin, fingers, and knees, there are fetid and incurable ulcers,
							some of which are springing up on one part, while others
							are subsiding on another. Sometimes, too, certain of the
							members of the patient will die, so as to drop off, such as
							the nose, the fingers, the feet, the privy parts, and the whole
							hands; for the ailment does not prove fatal, so as to relieve
							the patient from a foul life and dreadful sufferings, until he
							has been divided limb from limb. For it is long-lived, like
							the animal, the elephant. But if there be a sudden pain of
							the limbs, it attacks much more grievously, spreading sometimes
							to this part, and sometimes to that. Appetite for food
							not amiss; taste indiscriminate, neither food nor drink affords
							pleasure; aversion to all things from a painful feeling; atrophy;
							libidinous desires of a rabid nature; spontaneous lassitude;
							the figure of each of the limbs heavy, and even the small
							limbs are oppressive to the patient. Moreover, the body is
							offended with everything, takes delight neither in baths nor
							abstinence from them, neither in food nor in abstinence from
							it, neither in motion nor in rest, for the disease has established
							itself in all the parts. Sleep slight, worse than insomnolency,
							from its fantasies; strong dyspnœa, suffocation as if from
							strangling. In this way certain patients have passed from life,
							sleeping the sleep which knows no waking, even until death.</p>
						<p>When in such a state, who would not flee;--who would
							not turn from them, even if a father, a son, or a brother?
							There is danger, also, from the communication of the ailment.
							Many, therefore, have exposed their most beloved relatives in
							the wilderness, and on the mountains, some with the intention
							of administering to their hunger, but others not so, as wishing
							them to die. There is a story that one of those who had come
							to the wilderness, having seen a viper creep out of the earth,
							compelled by hunger, or wearied out with the affection, as if
							to exchange one evil for another, ate the viper alive, and did
							not die until all his members had become putrid and dropped</p>
						<pb n="373"/>
						<p>off: and that another person saw a viper creep into a cask of
							new wine, and after drinking of the same to satiety, vomit it
							up, and discharge a great deal of its venom along with the
							new wine; but when the viper was smothered in the new
							wine, that the man drank of it largely and greedily, seeking
							thus to obtain a rescue from life and the disease; but when he
							had carried the drinking to satiety and intoxication, he lay
							down on the ground, at first as if about to die; but when he
							awoke from his sleep and intoxication, first of all his hair fell
							off, next the fingers and nails, and all the parts melted away in
							succession. But as the power was still in the semen, nature
							formed the man again, as if from the act of generation: it
							made other hairs to grow, and made new nails and clean flesh,
							and put off the old skin, like the slough of a reptile; and
							he was called back, like another new man, to a growth of
							life. Thus goes the fable; not very probable, indeed, nor yet
							entirely incredible; for that one ill should be overcome by
							another is credible. And that from the existing spark nature
							should renew the man, is not so incredible as to be held to be
							a prodigy.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER I. THE CURE OF PHRENITICS.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> patient ought to be laid in a house of moderate size, and
							mild temperature--in a warm situation, if winter, and in one
							that is cool and humid, if summer; in spring and autumn, to
							be regulated according to the season. Then the patient himself,
							and all those in the house, are to be ordered to preserve quiet;
							for persons in phrensy are sharp of hearing, are sensitive to
							noise, and easily become delirious. The walls should be smooth,
							level, without projections, not adorned with frieze<note n="1">The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">A)/XNAI</foreign> would
								appear to have been applied like
								<hi rend="ital">frieze</hi> in English, both to the nap
								on woollen cloth, and in architecture,
								to ornaments of sculpture on
								a flat face. Our author evidently
								uses it in the latter sense; but I
								suspect the translators fail to recognise
								it. For the former meaning,
								see Erotian, and Föes Œc.
								Hippocr. Modern lexicographers
								do not seem acquainted with this
								use of the term. See Liddel and
								Scott's; and Dunbar's Lexicons.</note> or paintings;
							for painting on a wall is an excitant. And, moreover, they
							catch at certain false appearances before their eyes, and grope
							about things which are not projecting, as if they were so; and
							any unreal occasion may be a cause sufficient to make them
							raise their hands. Length and breadth of the couch moderate,
							so that the patient may neither toss about in a broad one, nor
							fall out of a narrow bed. In plain bed clothes, so that there
							may be no inducement to pick at their nap. But on a soft
							bed, for a hard one is offensive to the nerves; as in phrenitics,
							above all others, the nerves especially suffer, for they are subject
							to convulsions. Access of their dearest friends is to be permitted;
							stories and conversation not of an exciting character;
							for they ought to be gratified in everything, especially in cases
							where the delirium tends to anger. Whether they are to be
							laid in darkness or in light must be determined by the nature
							of the attack; for if they are exasperated by the light, and</p>
						<pb n="379"/>
						<p>see things which exist not, and represent to themselves things
							not present, or confound one thing with another, or if strange
							images obtrude themselves upon them; and, in a word, if they
							are frightened at the light, and the things in the light, darkness
							must be chosen; but if not, the opposite state. It is a good
							symptom, too, when they become of a sound mind, and their
							delirium abates, on exposure to the light. Abstinence from
							food should not be prolonged; food should be rather liquid,
							scanty, and frequently administered, for food soothes the soul:
							the proper time for giving it is during the remissions, both of
							the fever and of the delirium. But if they have become
							delirious from want of food, and if the fever do not remit, we
							are to give food that does not do much harm in fever. It is a
							favourable circumstance, when the fever and the delirium agree
							both as to the paroxysms and intermissions.</p>
						<p>If, therefore, the time for the administering of food be come,
							in the first place, it must be enquired whether it be necessary
							to abstract blood. If, then, the delirium have come on with
							fever at the commencement, in the first or second day, it will
							be proper to open a vein at the elbow, especially the middle.
							But if the delirium supervene on the third or fourth day, we
							are to open a vein up to the first period of critical days. But
							if it was past the proper time for bleeding, on the sixth or
							seventh day, it will be proper to evacuate considerably before
							the crises in acute diseases, either by giving purgative medicines,
							or by using other stimulants. But when opening a
							vein you must not abstract much, even if you open the vein
							at the commencement; for phrenitis is an ailment easily convertible
							into syncope. But if the patient be plethoric and
							youthful, and if the ailment be connected with fulness in
							eating and drinking, those indications have nothing to do with
							the phrenitis; for even without the delirium, it would be proper
							to abstract much blood in such circumstances; but much less
							is to be abstracted, if such persons labour under phrenitis.</p>
						<pb n="380"/>
						<p>But we may open a vein the more boldly in these cases, if the
							disease proceed from the præcordia, and not from the head; for
							there (in the præcordia) is the origin of life. But the head is
							the seat of sensation, and of the origin of the nerves; and it
							attracts more blood from the heart than it imparts to the
							others. If it therefore suffer, it is not proper to open the vein
							at the elbow; for these affections are such that it is no small
							injury to evacuate in them. And if the strength be sufficient
							to withstand the evacuation, we must abstract only once, lest
							during the interval between the acts of evacuation, the proper
							season for food be lost. The fevers, in cases of phrenitis, are
							of a continual type, neither have they long intermissions,
							but experience short and ill-marked remissions. But if the
							patient give way before a sufficient quantity has been abstracted,
							it must be put off until another remission, unless it
							occur at a distant period; but, if not, having resuscitated the
							patient by odours, stroking the face, and pricking the feet, we
							are immediately to abstract blood. The measure of sufficiency
							is the strength.</p>
						<p>Liquid food is proper in all febrile diseases, but especially in
							phrenitic cases, for these are more arid than mere fevers. The
							mulse is to be given, unless they are bilious, for it is indigestible
							in patients who are subject to bitter bile. Alica<note n="2">As this term is of frequent
								occurrence in the works of our
								author, as in those of Hippocrates,
								it may be proper to mention, once
								for all, that the <foreign lang="greek">XO/NDROS</foreign> of the
								Greeks and the <hi rend="ital">alica</hi> of the Romans
								was the species of grain called Spelt
								(<hi rend="ital">Triticum Spelta</hi>) broken down into
								rough granules; that is to say, it
								was coarsely ground Spelt.</note> washed
							with water, or mulse, is a good thing; also it is good to give
							pottages of a plain kind, such as decoctions of savory, of parsley,
							or of dill, for these are beneficial to the respiration, and
							are diuretic, and a free discharge of urine is beneficial in
							phrenetics. All kinds of pot-herbs, especially melons, for their
							gluten is good for lubricating the tongue, the trachea, and for</p>
						<pb n="381"/>
						<p>the alvine evacuations; but the best of all are beet, blite, cress,
							gourd in season, and whatever else is best in its own season.
							The juice of ptisan in a very liquid state, and containing little
							nourishment, is most proper at first, being made always thicker
							as the disease progresses. But the quantity of nourishment is
							to be diminished at the crises, and a little before them. And,
							if the disease be protracted, the customary food must not be
							abstracted, but we must give nourishing articles from the
							cereals, in order to support the patient; and when there is need,
							of the flesh of the extremities of beasts and fowls, mostly dissolved
							in the soups: these ought to be completely dissolved
							during the process of boiling. The rock fishes are preferable
							to all others;<note n="3">All the Greek and Arabian
								authorities on dietetics hold, that
								fishes caught among rocks are particularly
								excellent. See Paulus
								Ægineta, t. i. p. 159.</note> but on the whole we must choose the best in
							the country, for countries are believed to differ as to the kinds
							of fish which are best in them. Fruit containing wine must
							be given restrictedly, for it is apt to affect the head and præcordia;
							but if required by the state of the strength and of
							the stomach, we must give such articles as apples boiled in
							mulse or roasted in suet. Of other things, each is to be diluted
							with hot water, if you give it solely for the refreshment of the
							stomach; but if it is wanted also for strength, you must not
							dilute the vinous part much. In a word, the food must be
							such as I have described.</p>
						<p>For the sake of refrigeration, the head is to be damped with
							the oil of the unripe olive pounded; for in phrenitics the head
							is not fond of being kept warm. But if restlessness and false
							visions be present, we must mix equal parts of rose-oil at first;
							and the rose-oil is to be increased for the astringing and cooling
							of the head. But if they become disordered in understanding,
							and their voice change, the hair (<hi rend="ital">capillary leaves</hi>?) of
							the wild thyme must be boiled in oils, or the juice of ivy or</p>
						<pb n="382"/>
						<p>of knot-grass is also to be infused. But if the delirium get
							more violent, hog's-fennel and cow-parsnip are to be boiled in
							the oils, and some vinegar poured in; for these things dissipate
							the vapours and heat, and are solvents of the thick humours
							which contribute to the delirium. But care must be taken
							that the moist application do not extend to the neck and the
							tendons, for it is prejudicial to tendons and nerves. Every
							season is suitable for the damp application, except the commencement
							of a paroxysm; it should be used more rarely
							during the increase, but most frequently at the acme; and
							whenever they are delirious, then, in particular, it will be
							proper to use a cold application, made still more cold in the
							season of summer, but in winter tepid. To soothe the delirium
							it is well to foment the forehead with oxycrate, or the decoction
							of fleabane, by means of a sponge, and then to anoint
							with the oil of wild vine or of saffron, and also to anoint the
							nose and ears with them.</p>
						<p>These things, moreover, also induce sleep. For if they lay
							awake all night, nor sleep during the day, and the eyes stand
							quite fixed like horns, and the patients toss about and start up,
							we must contrive to procure sleep and rest for them; first, by
							fomentations to the head, with unmixed rose-oil, or oil of
							marjoram with the juice of ivy, or the decoction of wild thyme
							or of melilot. But poppy boiled in oil is particularly soporific
							when applied to the fontenelle of the head, or with a sponge
							to the forehead. But the poppies, if recently plucked and
							green, may be applied whole under the pillows; for they
							thicken and humectate the spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), which is dry and
							attenuated, and diffuse over the senses fumes which prove the
							commencement of sleep. But if greater applications are needed,
							we may rub in the meconium (<hi rend="ital">expressed juice of poppy</hi>) itself
							on the forehead with water, and also anoint the nostrils with
							the same, and pour it into the ears. Gentle rubbing of the
							feet with oil, patting of the head, and particularly stroking of</p>
						<pb n="383"/>
						<p>the temples and ears is an effectual means; for by the stroking
							of their ears and temples wild beasts are overcome, so as to
							cease from their anger and fury.<note n="4"><p>This passage savours much of magnetical manipulation. The following
								verses of Solon have been quoted as referring to the same

							familiar to any one is to him a provocative of sleep. Thus, to the sailor,
							repose in a boat, and being carried about on the sea, the
							sound of the beach, the murmur of the waves, the boom of
							the winds, and the scent of the sea and of the ship. But to
							the musician the accustomed notes of his flute in stillness; or
							playing on the harp or lyre, or the exercise of musical children
							with song. To a teacher, intercourse with the tattle of
							children. Different persons are soothed to sleep by different
							means.</p>
						<p>To the hypochondria and region of the stomach, if distended
							by inflammation, hardness, and flatulence, embrocations and
							cataplasms are to be applied, with the addition of the oil of the
							over-ripe olive, for it is thick, viscid, and calefacient; it therefore
							is required in inflammation: let dill or flea-bane be boiled
							in it, and it is a good thing to mix all together; but if flatulence
							be present also, the fruits of cumin and parsley, and
							whatever other things are diuretic and carminative, along
							with sifted natron, are to be sprinkled on the application.
							But if the liver experience suffering and pain, apply unwashed
							wool just taken from the ewe, oil from the unripe olive, or
							rose-oil; but we must mix also Hellenic or Cretan rob, and
							boil in it melilot, and mixing all these things into one juice,
							foment the liver therewith. To the spleen the oil must be</p>
						<pb n="384"/>
						<p>mixed with vinegar; or if it should appear to be enlarged in
							bulk, oxycrate, and instead of the wool a soft sponge; for the
							spleen delights in and is relieved by such things. But if the
							hypochondria be collapsed and retracted upwards, and the
							skin be stretched, it will be best instead of the oil, or along
							with it, to use thick butter in equal quantity, and let fleabane
							and rosemary be boiled in the decoction, and dill is not
							unsuitable.</p>
						<p>But if it be the proper time for cataplasms, we may use the
							same oils to the same places, the ingredients of the cataplasms
							being linseed, fenugreek, or fine barley-meal; beans and vetches,
							also, are proper if the abdomen be swelled. Roasted millet,
							also, in bags, makes a light and soft fomentation; when ground
							it makes, along with honey, oil, and linseed, an excellent cataplasm
							for the hypochondria. Also let the same flowers, herbs,
							and seeds which I have described among the embrocations be
							used for the cataplasms. Honey, also, is useful along with
							these things, to give consistency to the dry things, and for the
							mixing of the toasted things, and for the preservation of the
							heat; it is a good thing, likewise, by itself; also a cataplasm
							half-boiled, and an embrocation dissolved in some of the
							liquids, is effectual as an emollient, calefacient, carminative,
							and diuretic, and to moderate the inflammations. These
							effects are produced also by mulse when drunk, and even
							more and greater effects when conveyed internally to the
							trachea, the lungs, the thorax, and the stomach.</p>
						<p>The bowels, also, are to be frequently stimulated by suppositories
							or liniments (for they are generally constipated), in
							order to act as derivatives from the head, and also for the
							evaporation of the vapours in the chest, and for the evacuation
							of the matters in the belly; but, if the belly be confined for
							several days, it must be opened by a clyster of mulse, oil, and
							natron.</p>
						<p>But if the distension of the inflammation do not properly</p>
						<pb n="385"/>
						<p>subside, we must apply a cupping-instrument with scarificators
							where the inflammation points and is greatest, on the
							first or second day, according as the inflamed parts may indicate,
							and the strength direct; and from those the amount of
							the evacuation of the blood must be determined, for excess
							occasions syncope. During the first and second day the
							fomentation should be the same; but, on the third, cerate with
							some of the oils used in the embrocations is to be applied:
							then, if they be still in a state of inflammation, epithemes,
							consisting of hyssop, fenugreek boiled in mulse, the resin of
							the turpentine plant, and wax; the oils the same for these
							places. If by these means the delirium do not at all abate, it
							will be necessary to have recourse to cropping of the head,
							provided the hairs be very long, to the extent of one half;
							but, if shorter, down to the skin: then, in the meantime
							having recruited the strength, to apply a cupping-instrument
							to the vertex, and abstract blood. But dry-cupping is first to
							be applied to the back.</p>
						<p>But since in all the acute diseases the chest must be remedied,
							this part generally suffering with the heart and lungs,
							more especially from the difficulty of the respiration, which is
							sometimes hot, at other times cold; and, moreover, from ardent
							fever, cough, badness of the humours, and sympathy of the
							nerves, and complaint of the stomach, and illness of the pleura
							and of the diaphragm (for the heart, if it suffer from any dreadful
							illness, never recovers),--in cases of phrenitis these parts in
							particular must be soothed. For, indeed, the delirium in certain
							cases arises from some of the parts in the chest; respiration hot
							and dry; thirst acrid; febrile heat not easily endured, as being
							determined from all parts to the chest; and illness from the perversion
							of its native heat, but greater and more intolerable the
							communication of the same from the other parts to the chest:
							for the extremities are cold--the head, the feet, and the
							hands; but, above these last, the chest. It is to be remedied,</p>
						<pb n="386"/>
						<p>then, by humectation and refrigeration. For bathing, oil
							boiled with camomile or nard; in summer, also, Hellenic rob.
							But if it be necessary also to apply epithemes, dates moistened
							with austere wine, then levigated and pounded into a mass with
							nard, barley meal, and flower of the wild vine, form a soothing
							cataplasm for the chest: a cooling one is formed of apples
							bruised with mastich and melilot; all these things, however, are
							to be mixed up with wax and nard. But if the stomach be
							affected with torpor and loathing of food, the juice or hair of
							worm-wood are mixed up with them; and the hypochondriac
							region is to be fomented with this boiled up in oil. The
							infusion or the juice of it may be drunk before food to the
							amount of two cupfuls of the infusion, or one cupful of the
							bitter juice with two cupfuls of water. But if the stomach
							be affected with heartburn, not from the constitution of the
							disease, but of itself from acrid and saltish humours, or from
							being pinched with bile, or from being parched with thirst, we
							must give in the food milk mixed with water to the amount
							of half a hemina of milk in one cupful of water; the patient
							should swallow the most of it, but he may take a small portion
							of it with bread.</p>
						<p>But if the patient be also affected with Causus, and there be
							thirst, restlessness, mania, and a desire of cold water, we must
							give less of it than in a case of Causus without phrenitis, for
							we must take care lest we injure the nerves; we are to give
							them as much as will prove a remedy for the stomach, and a
							little is sufficient, for phrenitics are spare drinkers.</p>
						<p>But if converted into syncope, and this also happens (the
							powers of life being loosened, the patient being melted in
							sweat, and all the humours being determined outwardly, the
							strength and spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) being also dissolved), we must disregard
							the delirium, and be upon our guard lest the patient be
							resolved into vapours and humidity. Then the only support
							is wine, to nourish quickly by its substance, and to penetrate</p>
						<pb n="387"/>
						<p>everywhere, even to the extremities; to add tone to tone, to
							rouse the torpid spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), warm that which is cold,
							brace what is relaxed, restrain those portions which are flowing
							and running outwards, wine being sweet to the senses of smell
							so as to impart pleasure; powerful to confirm the strength for
							life; and most excellent to soothe the mind in delirium. Wine,
							when drunk, accomplishes all these good purposes; for they
							become composed by the soothing of their minds, are spontaneously
							nourished to strength, and are inspired with
							pleasure.</p>
						<p>But when the fever has become protracted and feeble, and
							the delirium is converted into fatuity, but the hypochondrium
							is not much injured by swelling, flatulence, or hardness,
							and the head is the part principally affected, we must
							boldly wash the head, and practise copious affusions on it; for
							thus will the habit of body be moistened, the respiration of the
							head and exhalation over the whole body will be restored;
							and thus will that which is dry become diluted, and the sense
							purified of its mist, while the understanding remains sound
							and firm. These, indeed, are the indications of the removal
							of the disease.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER II. THE CURE OF LETHARGICS.</head>
						<p>L<hi rend="smallcaps">ETHARGICS</hi> are to be laid in the light, and exposed to the
							rays of the sun (for the disease is gloom); and in a rather
							warm place, for the cause is a congelation of the innate heat.
							A soft couch, paintings on the wall, bed-clothes of various
							colours, and all things which will provoke the sense of sight;
							conversation, friction along with squeezing of the feet, pulling,
							tickling. If deep sleep prevail, shouting aloud, angry reproach,</p>
						<pb n="388"/>
						<p>threats regarding those matters which he is accustomed
							to dread, announcement of those things which he
							desires and expects. Everything to prevent sleep--the reverse
							of that which is proper for phrenitics.</p>
						<p>With regard to the depletion of lethargics this should be
							known:--If the obliviousness be the sequela of another disease,
							such as phrenitis, we must not open a vein, nor make a great
							evacuation of blood in any way, but inject the belly, not
							solely for the evacuation of its contents, but in order to produce
							revulsion from above, and to determine from the head:
							there should be a good deal of salts and natron in it, and it
							answers very well if you add a sprinkling of castor to the
							clyster; for in lethargics the lower intestine is cold, and dead,
							as it were, to evacuation. But, if the lethargy is not the consequence
							of another disease, but is the original affection, and
							if the patient appear to be plethoric, provided it be with blood,
							we must open a vein at the elbow; but, if with a watery
							phlegm, or other humours, we must purge by means of cneoros<note n="1">Daphne Cneorum L.</note>
							with the ptisan, or by black hellebore with honeyed-water, in
							the beginning, if you wish to do so moderately; but if to a
							greater extent, you must give to the patient when fasting of the
							medicine called Hiera, to the extent of two drams with three
							cupfuls of honeyed-water; and, having waited until it purges,
							then give food, if it be the proper season; but otherwise
							nourishment is to be given the next day. It will be seasonable
							then to give in the evening a dram of the hiera, dissolved
							either in two cupfuls of water or of honeyed-water.</p>
						<p>Total abstinence from food is bad, as is also much food. It
							is proper, then, to administer a little food every day, but not
							to withdraw food altogether; for the stomach to be reminded
							of its duties and fomented, as it were, during the whole day.
							Also the food must be attenuant and laxative, rather in the
							form of soups than roasted, such as hens or shell-fish; and the</p>
						<pb n="389"/>
						<p>herb mercury is to be boiled with it, and some vinegar added.
							And we may add to the juices, if it be proper to use the juice
							of ptisan, something to promote exhalation and the discharge
							of urine, such as fennel, parsley--the pot-herbs themselves, or
							their fruits. Horehound, also, by its acrid qualities, does good;
							and likewise colewort with oil, and the brine of fish (<hi rend="ital">garum</hi>).
							The sweet cumin is a most excellent medicine for the flatulence
							and urine; for the stomach and bladder are to be stimulated
							during the whole time of the disease.</p>
						<p>The moist applications to the head the same as in the case
							of phrenitics; for in both the senses are filled with vapours,
							which must either be expelled by refrigerants and astringents,
							such as the oil of roses or the juice of ivy, or dissipated into
							exhalation by attenuants, such as wild thyme in vinegar, with
							the rose-oil. But if there be pain of the nerves, and coldness of
							the whole body, but more especially of the extremities, we
							must besmear and bathe the head and neck with castor and
							oil of dill, and anoint the spine with the same along with
							Sicyonian oil, the oil of must, or old oil; at the same time, we
							must rub both the arms from the shoulders and both the legs
							from the groins. With these, moreover, the bladder is to be
							soothed, which suffers, as being of a nervous nature, and is
							stressed as being the passage for the urine; and also is irritated
							by the acrimony of the humours, for the urine is bilious. But
							if the trembling increase, and there be danger of a convulsion,
							we must necessarily use Sicyonian oil to the head, but use it
							in small quantity. But if there be inflammation of the hypochondria,
							and fulness thereof, flatulence, and tension of the
							skin, or if there be a hollow there from retraction inwards of
							the hypochondria, we must apply the embrocations and cataplasms,
							described by us under Phrenitics.</p>
						<p>The cupping-instrument is by no means to be used if the
							disease be the consequence of phrenitis, but this may be done
							more boldly if it be the original disease. If the tongue be</p>
						<pb n="390"/>
						<p>black, and a swelling point in the hypochondria, the cupping-instrument
							must necessarily be used. When in the course of
							time the senses have been evacuated, and the patient is otherwise
							more tolerant of the disease, we may apply the cupping-instrument
							to the top of the head, since we can evacuate from
							it without injury to the strength.</p>
						<p>Flatulence is to be expelled both upwards and downwards;
							for lethargy produces collections of flatus both in the cavities
							and in the whole frame, from inactivity, torpor, and want of
							spirit, which motion and watchfulness dissipate; wherefore,
							having rubbed up green rue with honey and natron, we anoint
							therewith; it will expel the wind more effectually if one part
							of the resin of turpentine be added to these things. A fomentation
							also will expel flatus, either with hot unwashed wool,
							or with rough old rags, or a sponge with water in which hyssop,
							marjoram, penny-royal, or rue, have been boiled. The
							potions<note n="2">Propomata, or whets. See
								Paulus Ægineta, vol. iii. p. 544.

							also which are taken before food expel flatus, and these also
							bring away phlegm and bile in the stomach and bowels; such
							are hyssop, boiled mulse, Cretan dictamny, or marjoram:
							maiden-hair and agrostis<note n="3">Probably the <hi rend="ital">Triticum repens.</hi></note>
							are
							acrid, but possessed of expulsive
							qualities, for indeed they evacuate flatus and urine.</p>
						<p>If there be trembling of the hands and head, he may take
							a draught, consisting of castor with three cupfuls of honeyed-water,
							for some days; or if he will not drink this, we may
							melt down the castor in a sufficient quantity of oil, wherein
							rue has been boiled, to the amount of three cupfuls; and a
							double amount of this is to be injected into the lower bowel,
							and is to be repeated for several days; and after the benefit
							derived from it (for it brings off flatus upwards and downwards,
							and, in certain cases, urine and fæces), if it should</p>
						<pb n="391"/>
						<p>be diffused over the whole system in any way, the nerves
							recover from their tremblings and become strong, and it
							changes the habit of body to the hot and dry, and alters the
							constitutions of diseases. It is also a very excellent thing to
							blow it into the nostrils, for in this way it expels flatulence by
							sneezing; for as the bladder secretes urine, so does the nose
							mucus. It effects these things by its gentle heat, in which respect
							it is superior to the other sternutatories, pepper, hellebore,
							soap-wort, and euphorbium; for these things, both at their first
							and last impression are harsh, and disorder the head and the sense,
							whereas castor gradually creates a gentle heat. To the head
							it is also otherwise suitable, because the nerves everywhere
							derive their origin from it; and castor is a remedy for the
							diseases of the nerves; but to mix it with some one or more
							of the medicines described will not be disagreeable, for if it
							be mixed, it will not immediately disorder the head, even in
							a moderate degree, but after a time it will stir up the heat.</p>
						<p>The nose is to be moistened by tickling; by odours acrid
							indeed to the sense, but possessed of heating powers, such as
							the castor itself, or savory, or penny-royal, or thyme, either
							in a green state, or in a dried, moistened well with vinegar.</p>
						<p>Anointing with acrid medicines is proper to the feet and
							knees. The <hi rend="ital">materiel</hi> thereof should be heating and pungent
							by degrees; for there is need of both in cases of lethargy to
							induce warmth and watchfulness. In the first place, it is
							proper to whip the limbs with the nettles, for the down
							thereof sticking to the skin does not endure long, but imparts
							no disagreeable tingling and pain; it also moderately stimulates,
							induces swelling, and provokes heat. But if you desire
							to have these effects produced more powerfully, rub in equal
							parts of lemnestis<note n="4">An efflorescence collecting
								about reeds in salt lakes. The
								same as <foreign lang="greek">A)DA/RKH</foreign>, for which see
								the Appendix to Dunbar's Greek
								Lexicon.</note> and euphorbium, with oil of must. It is</p>
						<pb n="392"/>
						<p>also a very good thing to rub with raw squill pulverised; but
							it is necessary to rub off the oily matter of the limb (for
							everything acrid loses its stimulant properties with oil) --
							unless it be medicinal -- either the oil of privet, or that
							of must, or the Sicyonian. But if after these things a deep
							coma prevail, it will be proper, having pounded the wild
							cucumber with vinegar, and mixed it with an equal quantity
							of a cake of mustard, to apply this as an acrid cataplasm,
							and one which will speedily occasion redness, and will also
							quickly produce swelling. But if there be danger of blistering
							and of wounds, it will be proper to raise the cataplasm
							frequently, and see that none of these effects be produced.
							These things, therefore, are to be done to relieve the torpor
							and insensibility of the parts at all seasons, except at the
							commencement of the paroxysms.</p>
						<p>But if the patient have already recovered his sensibility,
							but there is still some heaviness of the head, noise, or ringing
							thereof, it will be proper to evacuate phlegm by the mouth,
							first by giving mastich to chew, so that he may constantly
							spit, then again stavesacre, the granum cnidium,<note n="5">Probably the fruit
								of the <hi rend="ital">Daphne cnidium.</hi></note> but more
							especially mustard, because it is a common article, and also
							because it is more of a phlegmagogue than the others. And
							if the patient drink it willingly, it will be sufficient to dissolve
							the matters in the stomach, it will also be able to moisten the
							stomach and expel flatulence; for this once fortunately happened
							to myself in the case of a man who drank it by my
							directions; for experience is a good teacher, one ought, then,
							to try experiments, for too much caution is ignorance.</p>
						<p>The head, then, after the hair has been clipped to the skin,
							if much good is not thereby accomplished, is to be shaven to
							procure insensible perspiration, and also to allow the anointing
							with acrid medicines, such as that from lemnestis (or <hi rend="ital">adarce</hi>),</p>
						<pb n="393"/>
						<p>or thapsia,<note n="6"><hi rend="ital">Thapsia Garganica L.</hi>, a species
							of deadly carrot.</note> or mustard moistened with water; these things,
							with double the quantity of bread, are to be rubbed on an old
							piece of skin, and applied to the head, taking good care at the
							expiry of an hour to foment the parts with hot sponges.</p>
						<p>It will also not be devoid of utility, when all, or most at
							least, of the fatal symptoms of the disease are gone, but the
							languor remains, to bathe; and then also gestation, friction,
							and all gentle motion will be beneficial.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER IV. THE CURE OF APOPLEXY.</head>
						<p>. . . . . should indeed the apoplexy be severe, for by all
							means the patients are, as it were, dead men whenever one is
							old, to whom this affection is congenial, and they cannot
							survive the greatness of the illness, combined with the misery
							of advanced life. It has been formerly stated by me, how the
							magnitude of the disease is to be estimated. If the patient be
							young, and the attack of apoplexy weak, it is still no easy
							matter to effect a cure; it must, however, be attempted. The
							equivalent remedy, then, as being the great assistance in a
							a great disease, is venesection, provided there be no mistake
							as to quantity; but the amount is difficult to determine, since
							if you take a little too much, you despatch the patient at
							once; for to them a little blood is most potent, as being that
							which imparts the vital heat to the frame itself, and to the
							food. But, if the quantity be inferior to the cause, you do
							little good with this the great remedy, for the cause still
							remains. But it is better to err on the side of smallness; for,
							if it should seem to have been deficient, and the appearance
							of the eyes, as seen from below, be favourable, we can open a
							vein again. We must open the vein at the hollow of the
							elbow, for the blood flows readily from it in the left arm.
							But in smaller attacks of apoplexy, it is necessary to consider
							whether the paralytic seizure be on the left side or the right.
							In a word, the abstraction is to be made from the healthy
							parts, for there the blood flows more freely, and thither the
							revulsion is made from the parts affected. When, therefore,
							the patient is seized with apoplexy without any obvious cause,
							we should decide thus concerning the abstraction of the blood.
							But if the attack happen from a blow, a fall from a high place,</p>
						<pb n="395"/>
						<p>or compression, there must be no procrastination, for in certain
							cases this alone is sufficient for the cure and to save life.</p>
						<p>But if it is not thought expedient to open a vein, owing to
							the patient's having been seized with much coldness, torpor,
							and insensibility, an injection must be given for the evacuation
							of the engorgement in the bowels (for very generally persons
							are seized with apoplexy from the immoderate use of food and
							wine), and for the revulsion of the humours seated in the head.
							The clyster should be acrid; and an evacuant of phlegm and
							bile, consisting not only of natron, but also of euphorbium, to
							the amount of three oboli, added to the usual amount of a
							clyster, also the medullary part of the wild cucumber,
							or the decoction of the hair (<hi rend="ital">leaves</hi>) of centaury in oil or
							water. The following is a very excellent clyster: To the
							usual amount of honey add rue boiled with oil and the resin
							of the turpentine tree, and some salts, instead of natron, and
							the decoction of hyssop.</p>
						<p>And if by these means the patient be somewhat aroused,
							either from being moved by the supervention of fevers, or
							having recovered from his insensibility, or the pulse has
							become good, or if the general appearance of the face has
							become favourable, one may entertain good hopes, and apply
							the remedies more boldly. Wherefore, when the strength is
							confirmed, the purgative hiera may be given to the patient
							fasting, and particularly a full dose. But, if the strength be an
							objection, it is to be given, to the amount of one-half, with
							honeyed-water. And we are to move him about, after having
							laid him stretched on a couch; and those who carry him must
							do so gently, he being allowed to rest frequently, to avoid inducing
							lassitude. And if there be a copious evacuation from
							the bowels, we are to permit it; but if not, give water, or
							honeyed-water, to the amount of two cupfuls, for drink. And
							if nausea supervene upon the purging, we are not to interfere
							with it; for the exertions of the body have some tendency to</p>
						<pb n="396"/>
						<p>resuscitate the patient, and the vomiting of the bile carries off
							the cause of the disease. The medicine hiera is a purger of
							the senses, of the head, and of the nerves. Enough, indeed,
							has been said respecting evacuation of every kind at the
							commencement.</p>
						<p>But having wrapped the whole of his person in wool, we
							are to soak it with some oil -- the Sicyonian, oil of musk
							(<hi rend="ital">gleucinum</hi>), or old oil, either each of these separately, or all
							mixed together; but it is best to melt into it a little wax, so
							as to bring it to the thickness of ointments; and it is to be rendered
							more powerful by adding some natron and pepper: these
							are to be reduced to a powder, and strained in a sieve. But
							castor has great efficacy in cases of palsy, both in the form of
							a liniment with some of the fore-mentioned oils, and it is still
							more potent when taken in a draught with honeyed-water, the
							quantity being to the amount we have stated under lethargics;
							but, at the same time, we must consider the age and disposition
							of the patient, whether he be ready to take the drink for several
							days. Inunctions are more powerful than fomentations, as
							being more easily borne, and also more efficacious; for the
							ointment does not run down so as to stain the bed-clothes (for
							this is disagreeable to the patient), and adheres to the body
							until, being melted by the heat thereof, it is drunk up. Moreover,
							the persistence of their effects is beneficial, whereas liquid
							applications run off. The ingredients of the ointments are
							such as have been stated by me; but along with them castor,
							the resin of the turpentine-tree, equal parts of euphorbium, of
							lemnestis, and of pellitory; of pepper, and of galbanum one-half,
							with triple the amount of Egyptian natron; and of wax,
							so as to bring it to a liquid consistence. But a much more
							complex mode of preparing these medicines has been described
							by me on various occasions, and under a particular head.
							Cataplasms are to be applied to the hardened and distended
							parts; their ingredients are linseed, fenugreek, barley-meal, oil</p>
						<pb n="397"/>
						<p>in which rue or dill has been boiled, the root of mallows
							pounded and boiled in honeyed-water, so as to become of the
							consistence of wax. They should be of a soft and agreeable
							consistence. These things are to be done if the patient still
							remains free of fever, or if the fever be slight, in which case
							no regard need be had to the heat.</p>
						<p>But if the fevers be of an acute nature, and the remaining
							disease appear to be of minor consequence, and if these induce
							urgent danger, the diet and the rest of the treatment must be
							accommodated to them. Wherefore, the patients must use
							food altogether light and of easy digestion; and now, most
							especially, attention ought to be paid to the proper season for
							eating, and, during the paroxysms, the whole of the remedial
							means must be reduced; and, altogether, we must attend to
							the fevers.</p>
						<p>But if the disease be protracted, and if the head be at fault,
							we must apply the cupping-instrument to the back of the head,
							and abstract blood unsparingly; for it is more efficacious than
							phlebotomy, and does not reduce the strength. But, dry-cupping
							is to be first applied between the shoulders, in order
							to produce revulsion of the matters in the occiput.</p>
						<p>Sometimes, also, the parts concerned in deglutition are
							paralysed, which is the sole help and safety of persons in
							apoplexy, both for the swallowing of food and for the transmission
							of medicines. For not only is there danger of want
							of nourishment and hunger, but also of cough, difficulty of
							breathing, and suffocation; for if one pour any liquid food
							into the mouth it passes into the trachea, neither the tonsils
							coming together for the protrusion of the food, nor the epiglottis
							occupying its proper seat where it is placed by nature,
							as the cover of the windpipe; we must, therefore, pour
							honeyed-water or the strained ptisan into a piece of bread resembling
							a long spoon, and passing it over the trachea, pour
							its contents into the stomach; for in this way deglutition is</p>
						<pb n="398"/>
						<p>still accomplished. But if the patient be in the extremity of
							danger, and the neck with the respiration is compressed, we
							must rub the neck and chin with heating things and foment.
							They effect nothing, and are unskilful in the art, who apply
							the cupping-instrument to the throat, in order to dilate the
							gullet; for distension, in order to procure the admission of
							food, is not what is wanted, but contraction of the parts for
							the purposes of deglutition. But the cupping-instrument
							distends further; and, if the patient wish to swallow, it prevents
							him by its expansion and revulsion, whereas it is necessary
							to pass into a state of collapse, in order to accomplish the
							contraction of deglutition; and in addition to these, it stuffs
							the trachea so as to endanger suffocation. And neither, if
							you place it on either side of the windpipe, does it any good;
							for muscles and nerves, and tendons and veins, are in front
							of it.</p>
						<p>The bladder and the loose portion of the rectum are sometimes
							paralysed, in regard to their expulsive powers, when the
							bowels are constantly filled with the excrements, and the
							bladder is swelled to a great size. But sometimes they are
							affected as to their retentive powers, for the discharges run
							away as if from dead parts. In this case one must not boldly
							use the instrument, the catheter, for there is danger of inducing
							violent pain of the bladder, and of occasioning a convulsion
							in the patient. It is better to inject with no great
							amount of strained ptisan; and if the bowel be evacuated of
							the fæces, it will be proper to inject castor with oil. But the
							sole hope, both of general and partial attacks of paralysis,
							consists in the <hi rend="ital">sitz</hi> bath of oil. The manner of it will be described under the chronic diseases.</p>

							namely, venesection, clysters, anointings, the cupping instrument;
							these means being the most powerful for the purpose of
							arousing. But I will now describe the peculiar remedies for
							an attack of the falling sickness. In children, then, to whom,
							owing to dyspepsia, or from excessive cold, the disease is
							familiar, vomiting, either of food, or of phlegm, or of any
							other humour, is beneficial. Feathers, then, dipped in the
							ointment of iris, excite vomiting; and the unguentum irinum
							is not inapplicable for smearing the tonsils with. But having
							first laid the child on his belly (this is the easiest position for
							vomiting), we must press gently on his lower belly. But if
							the lower jaw be convulsed or distorted, or if the hands and
							legs be tossed about, and if the whole face be fixed, the limbs
							are to be soothed by gentle rubbing with oil, and the distortions
							of the countenance rectified; the straight parts are to
							be gently bound, so that they may not become distorted. The</p>
						<pb n="400"/>
						<p>cold parts are to be fomented with unscoured wool, or with
							old rags. The anus is to be rubbed with honey along with
							the oil of rue, or with natron and liquid resin along with these
							things; and they are to be gently pushed within the anus, for
							they expel flatus, and children pass flatus in this disease. But
							if they can swallow, we may give them of this medicine: Of
							cardamom, one part; of copper, one siliqua. These things
							are to be drunk with honeyed-water; for either it is vomited
							up along with the matter annoying the stomach, or the bowels
							are opened. This is a very excellent linctus: Of cardamom, of
							mustard, and of the hair of hyssop equal parts; of the root of
							iris, one part, with a double quantity of natron; of pepper, to
							the amount of one-third. Having mixed up all these things
							together, and having separated the jaw, pour into the mouth,
							and even beyond the tonsils, so that the things may be swallowed.
							These things are proper for infants, and for young
							persons the same are applicable. But the more powerful
							emetics are to be taken: the bulbous root of narcissus; of
							mustard and of hyssop, equal parts; of copper and pepper,
							one-half the proportion of the former things. They are to be
							mixed with honey and given. These things are proper, in
							order to rouse from the paroxysm; but those calculated to
							produce the resolution of the disease will be described under
							the chronic diseases.</p>

						<pb n="401"/>
						<p>and rough, is stretched; and the eye-lids, formerly so mobile, can
							scarcely wink; the eyes are fixed and turned inwards; and likewise
							the joints are contracted, not yielding to extension. Let
							the house also be in a tepid condition; but, if in the summer
							season, not to the extent of inducing sweats or faintness; for
							the disease has a tendency to syncope. We must also not
							hesitate in having recourse to the other great remedies; for it
							is not a time for procrastination. Whether, then, the tetanus
							has come on from refrigeration, without any manifest cause,
							or whether from a wound, or from abortion in a woman, we
							must open the vein at the elbow, taking especial care with
							respect to the binding of the arm, that it be rather loose; and
							as to the incision, that it be performed in a gentle and expeditious
							manner, as these things provoke spasms; and take away
							a moderate quantity at first, yet not so as to induce fainting
							and coldness. And the patient must not be kept in a state of
							total abstinence from food, for famine is frigid and arid.
							Wherefore we must administer thick honeyed-water without
							dilution, and strained ptisan with honey. For these things do
							not press upon the tonsils, so as to occasion pain; and, moreover,
							they are soft to the gullet, and are easily swallowed, are
							laxative of the belly, and very much calculated to support
							the strength. But the whole body is to be wrapped in wool
							soaked in oil of must or of saffron, in which either rosemary,
							fleabane, or wormwood has been boiled. All the articles are
							to be possessed of heating properties, and hot to the touch.
							We must rub with a liniment composed of lemnestis, euphorbium,
							natron, and pellitory, and to these a good deal of
							castor is to be added. The tendons also are to be well wrapped
							in wool, and the parts about the ears and chin rubbed with
							liniments; for these parts, in particular, suffer dreadfully, and
							are affected with tension. Warm fomentations, also, are to be
							used for the tendons and bladder, these being applied in bags
							containing toasted millet, or in the bladders of cattle half</p>
						<pb n="402"/>
						<p>filled with warm oil, so that they may lay broad on the
							fomented parts. Necessity sometimes compels us to foment
							the head, a practice not agreeable to the senses, but good for
							the nerves; for, by raising vapours, it fills the senses with
							fume, but relaxes the nervous parts. It is proper, then, to use
							a mode of fomentation the safest possible, and materials not of
							a very heavy smell; and the materials should consist of oil
							devoid of smell, boiled in a double vessel,<note n="1">A double vessel was a
								smaller

							bladders; or of fine salts in a bag: for millet and linseed are
							pleasant indeed to the touch, but gaseous, and of an offensive
							smell. The patient having been laid on his back, the fomentations
							are to be spread below the tendons, as far as the vertex;
							but we must not advance further to the bregma, for it is the
							common seat of all sensation, and of all remedial and noxious
							means it is the starting-point. But if it be necessary to apply
							cataplasms to the tendons, it must be done below the occiput;
							for if placed higher, they will fill the head with the steam of
							the linseed and fenugreek. After the cataplasms, it is a good
							thing to apply the cupping-instrument to the occiput on both
							sides of the spine; but one must be sparing in the use of heat,
							for the pressure of the lips of the instrument is thus painful,
							and excites contractions. It is better, then, to suck slowly
							and softly, rather than suddenly in a short time; for thus the
							part in which you wish to make the incision will be swelled
							up without pain. Your rule in regard to the proper amount
							of blood must be the strength. These are the remedies of
							tetanus without wounds.</p>
						<p>But if the spasm be connected with a wound, it is dangerous,</p>
						<pb n="403"/>
						<p>and little is to be hoped. We must try to remedy it,
							however, for some persons have been saved even in such cases.
							In addition to the other remedies, we must also treat the
							wounds with the calefacient things formerly described by me,
							by fomentations, cataplasms, and such other medicines as excite
							gentle heat, and will create much pus: for in tetanus the
							sores are dry. Let the application consist of the manna of
							frankincense, and of the hair of poley, and of the resins of
							turpentine and pine-trees, and of the root of marsh-mallow and
							of rue, and of the herb fleabane. These things are to be
							mixed up with the cataplasms, melting some of them, sprinkling
							the others upon them, and levigating others beforehand
							with oil; but the mallow, having been pounded, is to be boiled
							beforehand in honeyed-water. We are to sprinkle, also, some
							castor on the ulcer, for no little warmth is thereby communicated
							to the whole body, because the rigors proceeding from
							the sores are of a bad kind. Rub the nostrils with castor
							along with oil of saffron; but also give it frequently, in the
							form of a draught, to the amount of three oboli. But if the
							stomach reject this, give intermediately of the root of silphium
							an equal dose to the castor, or of myrrh the half of the silphium:
							all these things are to be drunk with honeyed-water.
							But if there be a good supply of the juice of the silphium

							honey,
							and give to swallow. It is best given in this way, as it slips
							unperceived through the palate; for it is acrid, and occasions
							disagreeable eructations, being a substance which has a bad
							smell. But if it cannot be swallowed thus, it must be given
							dissolved in honeyed-water; for it is the most powerful of all
							the medicines given to be swallowed, which are naturally</p>
						<pb n="404"/>
						<p>warming, diluent, and can relax distensions and soothe the
							nerves. But if they can swallow nothing, we must inject it
							into the anus with the oil of castor; and thus the anus is to be
							anointed with oil or honey. With this, also, we must anoint
							the fundament, along with oil or honey. But if they will
							drink nothing, we must make an injection of some castor with
							the oil. With this, also, we are to anoint the fundament,
							along with fat or honey; and also foment the bladder; and
							use it as an ointment, having melted it with a sufficiency of
							wax to bring it to the proper consistence. But if it be the time
							for evacuating flatulence and fæces, we are to inject two drams
							of the purgative hiera along with honeyed-water and oil, since,
							along with the expulsion of these, it warms the lower belly;
							for hiera is both a compound and heating medicine.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER VII. THE CURE OF QUINSEY.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HERE</hi> are two forms of quinsey. The one is attended with
							heat, and great inflammation of the tonsils, and swelling outwardly;
							moreover, the tongue, uvula, and all the parts there,
							are raised up into a swelling. The other is a collapse of these
							parts, and compression inwardly, with greater sense of suffocation,
							so that the inflammation appears to be determined to the
							heart. In it, then, particularly, we must make haste to apply
							our remedies, for it quickly proves fatal.</p>
						<p>If, then, it proceed from taking too much food and wine,
							we must inject the bowels on the day of the attack, and that
							with two clysters: the one a common clyster, so as to bring off
							the feculent matters; and the other for the purpose of producing
							revulsion of the humours from the tonsils and chest.</p>
						<pb n="405"/>
						<p>It will therefore be, but not undiluted . . . . . . . and the
							decoctions of centaury and hyssop; for these medicines also
							bring off phlegm. And if the patient has been on a restricted
							diet, we open the vein at the elbow, and make a larger incision
							than usual, that the blood may flow with impetuosity and in
							large quantity; for such a flow is sufficient to mitigate the
							heat most speedily, is able to relieve the strangulation, and
							reduce all the bad symptoms. It is no bad practice, likewise,
							to bring the patient almost to fainting, and yet not so as that
							he should faint altogether, for some from the shock have died
							of the fainting . . . . . . . . or binding them with ligatures
							above the ankles and knees. It is a very good thing, likewise,
							to apply ligatures to the forearms above the wrists, and
							above the forearms to the arms. And if deglutition be easy, we
							are to give elaterium with honeyed-water, and the whey of
							milk, as much as will be sufficient to purge the patient. In
							these cases, elaterium is preferable to all other cathartics; but
							cneoros and mustard are also suitable, for both these purge the
							bowels. If the inflammations do not yield to these means,
							having bent the tongue back to the roof of the mouth, we
							open the veins in it; and if the blood flow freely and copiously,
							it proves more effectual than all other means. Liquid
							applications to the inflamed parts, at first of an astringent
							nature, so as to dispel the morbid matters: unwashed wool,
							then, with hyssop, moistened in wine, and the ointment from
							the unripe olive. But the cataplasms are similar to the liquid
							applications,--dates
							soaked in wine, and levigated with rose-leaves.
							But in order that the cataplasm may be rendered glutinous
							and soft, let flour or linseed, and honey and oil be added, to
							produce the admixture of all the ingredients. But if it turn
							to a suppuration, we are to use hot things, such as those used
							in the other form of synanche. Let fenugreek be the powder,
							and manna and resin the substances which are melted; and let
							the hair of poley be sprinkled on it, and a hot fomentation</p>
						<pb n="406"/>
						<p>be made with sponges of the decoction of the fruit of the bay
							and of hyssop. And the powdered dung of pigeons or of dogs,
							sifted in a sieve, is most efficacious in producing suppuration,
							when sprinkled on the cataplasm. As gargles, honeyed-water,
							with the decoction of dried lentil, or of hyssop, or of
							roses, or of dates, or of all together. We are also to smear the
							whole mouth, as far as the internal fauces, either with Simples,
							such as the juice of mulberries, or the water of pounded pomegranates,
							or the decoction of dates; or with Compound preparations,
							such as that from mulberries, or that from <hi rend="ital">besasa</hi>,<note n="1">The wild
								rue, or <hi rend="ital">Peganum harmala.</hi> See Dioscorides, iii. 46.</note> or
							that from the juice of pomegranates, and that from swallows.
							But if the ulcers proceed from eschars, these gargles, and
							washes for the mouth, the decoction of hyssop in honeyed-water,
							or of fat figs in water, and along with them starch dissolved
							in honeyed-water, or the juice of ptisan, or of tragus
							(<hi rend="ital">spelt</hi>?).</p>
						<p>But in the species of synanche attended with collapse, we are
							to make a general determination from within outwardly, of the
							fluids, of the warmth, and of all the flesh, so that the whole may
							swell out. Let the liquid applications then be of a hot nature,
							with rue and dill, natron being sprinkled upon them; and along
							with them the cataplasms formerly mentioned. It is a good thing
							also to apply a cerate with natron and mustard for inducing heat;
							for heat determined outwardly is the cure of such complaints; and
							thus swelling takes place in the neck, and an external swelling
							rescues from peripneumonia; but in cases of synanche, the evil
							when inwardly is of a fatal nature. But those who, in order to
							guard against suffocation in quinsey, make an incision in the
							trachea for the breathing, do not appear to me to have proved
							the practicability of the thing by actual experiment; for the
							heat of the inflammation is increased by the wound, and thus
							contributes to the suffocation and cough. And, moreover, if
							by any means they should escape the danger, the lips of the</p>
						<pb n="407"/>
						<p>wound do not coalesce; for they are both cartilaginous, and
							not of a nature to unite.<note n="2">On the Ancient History of

						<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> the affections which form about the <hi rend="ital">columella</hi>, some
							require
							to be treated by excision; but the surgical treatment of such
							cases does not come within the design of this work. Some
							are to be treated as acute affections; for some of them readily
							prove fatal by suffocation and dyspnœa. These are the diseases
							which we call <hi rend="ital">uva</hi> and <hi rend="ital">columella</hi>; for both are attended
							with inflammation and increase in thickness and length, so
							that the parts hang down, and come into the <hi rend="ital">arteria aspera.</hi>
							The <hi rend="ital">columna</hi> is of equal thickness from the base to the extremity
							in the palate: the <hi rend="ital">uva</hi> is of unequal thickness; for its base
							at the palate is slender, whereas at its extremity it is rounded
							and thick, with redness and lividity, whence it gets the appellation
							of <hi rend="ital">uva.</hi> These, then, must be speedily relieved; for the
							death from suffocation is very speedy.</p>
						<p>If, then, the patients be young, we must open the vein at the
							elbow, and evacuate copiously by a larger incision than usual;</p>
						<pb n="408"/>
						<p>for such an abstraction frees one from suffocation, as it were,
							from strangulation. It is necessary, also, to inject with a mild
							clyster, but afterwards with an acrid one, again and again,
							until one has drawn from the parts above by revulsion; and
							let ligatures be applied to the extremities above the ankles
							and knees, and above the wrists and forearms to the arms.
							But if the suffocation be urgent, we must apply a cupping-instrument
							to the occiput and to the thorax, with some scarifications,
							and also do everything described by me under
							synanche; for the mode of death is the same in both. We
							must also use the same medicines to the mouth, both astringents
							and emollients, with fomentation of the external parts,
							cataplasms, and liniments to the mouth. For the forms named
							<hi rend="ital">columella</hi> and <hi rend="ital">uva</hi>, as an astringent medicine take the juice of
							pomegranate, acacia dissolved in honey or water, hypocistis,
							Samian, Lemnian, or Sinopic earth, and the inspissated juice
							of sour grapes. But if the diseased part be ulcerated, gum
							and starch moistened in the decoction of roses or of dates, and
							the juice of ptisan or of spelt (<hi rend="ital">tragus</hi>). But in <hi rend="ital">columella</hi> let

						<head>CHAPTER IX. CURE OF THE PESTILENTIAL AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE

						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> some respects, the treatment of these is the same as that of
							the
							other affections in the tonsils, and in some peculiar. In inflammation
							and suffocation, the remedies are clysters, venesection,
							liquid applications, cataplasms, fomentation, ligatures, cupping;
							and all these are applicable here. But anointing with more potent
							medicines is proper; for the ulcers do not stop, nor do eschars
							form on the surface. But if a sanies from them run inwardly,
							the parts, even if before in a healthy state, very soon become
							ulcerated, and very soon the ulcers spread inwardly, and prove
							fatal. It might be beneficial to burn the affection with fire,
							but it is unsuitable owing to the isthmus. But we must use
							medicines resembling fire to stop the spreading and also for
							the falling off of the eschars: these are alum, gall, the flowers
							of the wild pomegranate, either in a dried state or with
							honeyed-water. And the same medicines may be blown in
							by means of a reed, or quill, or a thick and long tube, so that
							the medicines may touch the sores. The best of these medicines
							is calcined chalcitis,<note n="1">Native Sulphate of Copper.

							Let there be a double proportion of the cadmia, and of the

							guard against their pressure, for the ulcers thus get moist and
							spread farther. We must, therefore, sprinkle them in a dry
							state with a quill. But the liquid medicines, having been
							much diluted, are to be injected upon the columella. But if
							the eschars be already loosened, and the ulcers become red,</p>
						<pb n="410"/>
						<p>there is then most danger of convulsion; for generally the
							ulcers are dried up, and thereby tonic contractions of the
							nerves are induced. It is necessary then to soften and moisten
							by means of milk, with starch, and the juice of ptisan, or of
							tragus, or linseed, or the seed of fenugreek. In certain cases
							also the uvula has been eaten down to the bone of the
							palate and the tonsils to their base and epiglottis; and in
							consequence of the sore, the patient could neither swallow
							anything solid nor liquid; but the drink regurgitating has cut him off by starvation.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER X. CURE OF PLEURISY.</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> cases of Pleurisy there is no time for procrastination, nor
							for putting off the great remedy. For the fever, being very
							acute, hastens to a fatal termination; the pain also of the
							<hi rend="ital">succingens</hi> hurries on to the worse; and moreover coughs which
							agitate the chest and head exhaust the powers. Wherefore
							then, on the selfsame day we must by all means open a vein.
							But if it be in connection with repletion of food and drink,
							having kept the patient fasting for one day, we are to abstract
							blood from the vein in the hollow of the elbow, in a line
							with the opposite side, (for it is better to take it from a very
							great distance); but not to the extent of deliquium animi,
							for there is danger of Peripneumonia supervening if the body,
							being congealed, should leave the soul; for the fluids rush inward
							when deprived of their external heat and tension. For the
							Lungs are of loose texture, hot, and possessed of strong powers
							of attraction; the lungs also are the neighbours of the ribs,</p>
						<pb n="411"/>
						<p>and their associates in suffering; and this succession of disease
							is not readily recovered from; whereas in Pleuritis from
							Peripneumonia, recovery readily takes place, this combination
							being milder. It is necessary, therefore, after a moderate
							flow of blood, to recruit the patient for a time, and afterwards
							abstract again; if matters go on well, the same day, provided
							the remission be long; but if not, on the day following. But if
							there is no remission of the fever (for generally the fever
							prevails and increases for one day), we are to abstract blood
							the third day during the second remission, when also food is
							to be given--after having anointed the patient freely, having
							also applied to the side soft oil with the heating ointment of
							rue, or the decoction of dill. A very soothing fomentation
							is also to be applied to the side. In certain cases, the pain
							and inflammation are determined outwardly, so as to make it
							appear an affection of the parts there; but it is merely an exacerbation
							of the internal symptoms.</p>
						<p>Let us now treat of regimen, in order that, respecting all
							the system of treatment, there may be no mistake. "For in
							food will consist the medicines, but also the medicines in
							food." In kind, then, it is to be hot and humid, smooth and
							consistent, detergent, solvent, having the power of dissolving
							and attenuating phlegm. Of all kinds of food, therefore,
							ptisan is to be preferred; at the commencement, then, strained
							to its juice, so that the solid part of it may be separated; and
							made with honey only; and let the usual articles added to it
							for seasoning and variety be absent (for now the juice alone
							is sufficient). It will be calculated to moisten and warm, and
							able to dissolve and clear away phlegm, to evacuate upwards
							without pain such matters as should be brought up, and also
							readily evacuate the bowels downwards. For its lubricity
							is agreeable and adapted to deglutition. Moreover, its glutinous
							quality soothes heat, purges the membranes, concocts
							coughs, and softens all the parts. These are the virtues of</p>
						<pb n="412"/>
						<p>barley. The next place to it is held by chondrus,<note n="1">Spelt, <hi rend="ital">Triticum spelta</hi>, deprived
							of its husks and broken down into
							granules. See Paul. Ægin. t. i. p.123,
							Syd. Soc. Edit.</note> being
							possessed of some of the good qualities of ptisan. For in
							regard to its glutinous quality, its lubricity, and its appropriateness
							for deglutition, it is equal to the other, but in other
							respects inferior. They are to be made plain, with honey
							alone. The tragus also is excellent.<note n="2">The <hi rend="ital">tragus</hi> (called <hi rend="ital">tragum</hi> by
								Pliny, H. N. xviii. 10) was a culinary
								preparation frym Spelt, and
								would seem to have been much
								the same as the <hi rend="ital">chondrus.</hi> See
								Galen, Comment. in lib. de ratione
								victus in morb. acut.</note> But rice is worse than
							these, inasmuch as it has the property of drying, roughening,
							and of stopping the purgation of the sides, rather than of
							making it more fluid. A very excellent thing is dry bread,
							broken into pieces, passed through a sieve, gently warmed,
							well concocted, which with honeyed-water is sufficient nourishment.
							But if the disease have already progressed, and the
							patient have given up his food, the ptisan of barley is to be
							administered in a soft state, and well boiled. Dill and salts
							are to be the condiments of the ptisan, and oil which is thin,
							without quality, without viscidity, without asperity; it is
							better, however, not to boil much of the oil with the ptisan;
							for thus the draught becomes fatty, and the oil loses its
							badness, and with much boiling is no longer perceptible, being
							drunk up by the juice. And let leek with its capillary leaves,
							and bitter almonds, be boiled with the juice of ptisan; for the
							draught thus promotes perspiration, and becomes medicinal,
							and the leeks eaten out of the juice are beneficial and very
							delicious. Now also is the season for using wholesome eggs;
							but if the expectoration be fluid and copious, sprinkle on them
							some native sulphur and natron. But the best thing of all
							is to give new-laid eggs which have never been subjected to
							the fire; for the heat of the hen is more humid than fire, and</p>
						<pb n="413"/>
						<p>more congenial to the patient, as proceeding from one animal
							to another. But if the phlegm be glutinous and viscid,
							pour oil into the eggs, and sprinkle some of the dried resin
							of pine--so that the sulphur may be more powerful; melting
							also with them some of the resin of turpentine; pepper also
							and all cognate substances are beneficial in eggs, and in all
							kinds of food; the extremities of animals melted down in
							soups, pigeons, boiled hens; the brains of swine roasted with
							the cawl, but without it they are not savoury. If the patient
							has no <hi rend="ital">râle</hi>, we must give him fish from the depth of the sea,
							or rock fish, the best which the country produces. And that
							the patient may not transgress in regimen, owing to his

						<p>Wool fumigated with sulphur and moistened with oil

						<pb n="414"/>
						<p>and if the patients have a feeling as if the internal parts were
							cold, some vinegar may be poured into it. The heat of the
							cataplasms should be of a strong kind, that it may last the
							longer; for this is better than having the heat kept up by
							renewal of the cataplasms. Let the fomentations consist of
							salts and millet in bags, or of warm oil in bladders. Every
							apparatus used for fomentation should be light, so that the
							weight may not add to the pain. These things moreover are
							to be used also after the food, if the pain be urgent.</p>
						<p>And, in addition to these means, now also should be the
							time of cupping; but it is best after the seventh day: before
							this you should not be urgent with it, for the diseases are not
							of a favourable character which require cupping before the
							seventh day. Let the instrument be large, broad every way,
							and sufficient to comprehend the place which is pained; for
							the pain does not penetrate inwardly, but spreads in width.
							There should be plenty of heat below the cupping-instrument,
							so as not only to attract, but also to warm before the extinction
							of the fire. And after the extinction, having scarified, we are
							to abstract as much blood as the strength will permit; much
							more than if you had to take away blood from the hypochondria
							for any other cause. For the benefit from cupping is
							most marked in cases of Pleurisy. But salts or natron are to
							be sprinkled on the scarifications, a pungent and painful practice
							indeed, but yet a healthful one. But we must estimate the
							powers and habits of the patient. For if strong in mind and
							robust in body, we must sprinkle some of the salts, not indeed so
							as to come into immediate contact with the wounds themselves,
							but they are to be sprinkled on a piece of linen-cloth damped
							with oil, and it is to be spread over the place; for the brine
							which runs from the melting of the salts is less stimulant than
							the salts themselves. We must also pour in much of the oil, that
							by its soothing properties it may obtund the pain occasioned by
							the acrimony of the other. On the second day it will be a very</p>
						<pb n="415"/>
						<p>good rule to apply the cupping-instrument again, so as that a
							thin sanies may be abstracted from the wounds. This, indeed,
							is much more effectual than the previous cupping, and much
							less calculated to impair the strength; for it is not blood, the
							nutriment of the body, but sanies that runs off. This then
							you are to do after having made a previous estimate of the
							strength. On the third day we are to apply cerate with the
							ointments of privet and of rue. But if the sputa still require
							purging, we are to melt into the cerates some resin, or mix
							some native sulphur therewith, and again the part is to have
							a fomentation. With regard to the form of the cupping-instrument,
							it should either be an earthen vessel, light, and adapted
							to the side, and capacious; or, of bronze, flat at the lips, so as
							to comprehend the parts affected with pain; and we are to
							place below it much fire along with oil, so that it may keep
							alive for a considerable time. But we must not apply the lips
							close to the skin, but allow access to the air, so that the heat
							may not be extinguished. And we must allow it to burn a
							long while, for the heat within it, indeed, is a very good fomentation,
							and a good provocative of perspirations.</p>
						<p>And we must not overlook purging downwards, in men
							injecting oil of rue into the gut, and, in women, also into the
							womb. And let something be constantly drunk and swallowed;
							for this purpose, honeyed-water, with rue and juice of ptisan,
							if there is a constant cough, as being a medicine in the food.
							But if it is not the season of administering food, let it be one
							of the compound preparations, such as butter boiled with
							honey to a proper consistence. Of this, round balls the size
							of a bean are to be given to hold under the tongue, moving
							them about hither and thither, so that they may not be
							swallowed entire, but melted there. The medicine also from
							poppies with honey and melilot is agreeable, being possessed
							of soothing and hypnotic properties. This is to be given
							before the administration of food, after it, and after sleep. To
							the patient when fasting, the following medicinal substances are</p>
						<pb n="416"/>
						<p>to be given: of nettle, of linseed, of starch, and of pine fruit in
							powder, of each, a cupful (<hi rend="ital">cyathus</hi>), and of bitter almonds twenty-five
							in number, and as many seeds of pepper. These things
							being toasted and triturated with honey, are to be mixed up
							into a linctus; of these the dose is one spoonful (<hi rend="ital">cochleare</hi>).
							But if he expectorate thin and unconcocted matters, two
							drams of myrrh, one of saffron, and fifteen grains of pepper to
							be mixed with one pound of honey. This medicine should be
							given also before the administration of food to the amount of
							half a spoonful. It is good also in chronic cases, when
							oxymel likewise is to be given if the dyspnœa be urgent.</p>
						<p>Such physicians as have given cold water to pleuritics, I
							cannot comprehend upon what principle they did so, nor can
							I approve the practice from experience; for if certain patients
							have escaped the danger from having taken cold water, these
							would appear to me not to have been pleuritic cases at all.
							But by the older physicians, a sort of congestion was called
							pleuritis, being a secretion of bile with pain of the side,
							attended with either slight fever or no fever at all. This
							affection, indeed, got the name of pleurisy, but it is not so in
							reality. But sometimes a spirit (or <hi rend="ital">wind, pneuma</hi>) collecting
							in the side, creates thirst and a bad sort of pain, and gentle
							heat; and this ignorant persons have called pleurisy. In
							them, then, cold water might prove a remedy through the
							good luck of the person using it; for the thirst may have
							been extinguished, and the bile and wind expelled downwards,
							while the pain and heat have been dissipated. But in inflammation
							of the side and swelling of the <hi rend="ital">succingeus</hi>, not only
							cold water but also cold respiration is bad.</p>
						<p>If, then, owing to the treatment formerly described persons
							affected with pleurisy survive the attack, but have still a
							short cough, and now and then are seized with heat, we must
							hasten to dissipate these symptoms; for the residue of the
							disease either produces a relapse, or it is converted into a suppuration.</p>

						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">NFLAMMATION</hi> and swelling of the lungs, and along with them
							a sense of suffocation, which does not long endure, constitute a
							very acute and fatal ailment. The remedies opposed to it, therefore,
							ought to be of equal power and speedily applied. We are
							to open instantly the veins at the elbow, and both together,
							on the right and on the left side, rather than abstract blood
							from one larger orifice, so that revulsion of the humours may
							take place from either side of the lungs: but we must not
							carry it to the extent of <hi rend="ital">deliquium animi</hi> for the <hi rend="ital">deliquium</hi> cooperates
							with the suffocation. But when even a small respite
							has been obtained, we must suppress the flow and abstraet
							more afterwards; for, if the exciting causes be from blood,
							the venesection carries them away; and if phlegm, or froth,
							or any other of the humours be the agent, the evacuations of the</p>
						<pb n="420"/>
						<p>veins widen the compass of the lungs for the passage of the
							breath.</p>
						<p>We must expel the fluids and flatus downwards, by anointing
							the anus after the venesection with natron, honey, rue,
							and the liquid resin from turpentine. Instead of the venesection,--provided
							there be a greater impediment,--we must
							give a clyster of acrid juice, namely, of salts, in addition to
							the natron, and turpentine resin with the honey; and rue
							boiled in the oil, and hyssop boiled in the water; and the
							fleshy parts of the wild cucumber, boiled with water, are
							very excellent.</p>
						<p>Dry-cupping applied to the back, the shoulder, and the
							hypochondria, is altogether beneficial. And if the chest be
							fleshy, so that the cupping-instrument may not by its pressure
							bruise the skin about the bones, it is to be also applied there;
							for if the humours be attracted from all parts of the body, and
							the spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) be determined outwardly, in those cases
							in which the lungs are, as it were, choked, there will be respite
							from the mischief; for peripneumonia is to be attacked in
							every possible way.</p>
						<p>But, likewise, neither are we to neglect any of the medicines
							which prove useful when swallowed by the mouth, for
							the lungs attract fluids whether they be in health or diseased.
							We must, therefore, give such medicines as attenuate the
							fluids so as to promote their perspiration, and such as will
							lubricate and render them adapted for expectoration. For
							speedy relief, then, natron is to be drunk with the decoction
							of hyssop, or brine with vinegar and honey; or mustard
							moistened with honeyed-water; and we may confidently
							sprinkle on each some of the root of iris and pepper. But
							also these things, having been sifted, are to be given in a
							powder along with honey. But if the patients get no sleep
							during the day, and remain sleepless also during all the night,
							it is to be feared lest they become delirious, and there will be</p>
						<pb n="421"/>
						<p>need of various soporific medicines unless the disease give
							way, so that the seasonable administration of these medicines
							may lull the suffering, for these things are usually
							soporific. But if you give a medicine at the acme of the
							suffocation, or when death is at hand, you may be blamed for
							the patient's death by the vulgar.</p>
						<p>The food also must be suitable, acrid, light, solvent of thick
							matters, detergent: of pot-herbs, the leek, or the cress, or the
							nettle, or the cabbage boiled in vinegar; of austere things
							(<hi rend="ital">frumentacea?</hi>) the juice of ptisan, taking also of marjoram,
							or of hyssop, and of pepper, and more natron instead of the
							salts. Also spelt in grains well boiled with honeyed-water: in
							the course of the boiling, they should all be deprived of their
							flatulence, for flatulent things are hurtful to persons in peripneumonia.
							If they are free from fever, wine is to be given
							for drink, but not such as is possessed of much astringency,
							for astringency condenses bodies; but in these the parts are
							rather to be relaxed. We must also promote the expulsion of
							the sputa. On the whole the drink should be scanty, for
							drenching is prejudicial to the lungs, because the lungs attract
							from the stomach and belly.</p>
						<p>Let the chest be covered up in wool, with oil, natron, and
							salts. The best ointment is that prepared of the lemnestis,
							and dried mustard with liquid cerate; and, on the whole, we
							are to determine outwardly the fluids, the heat, and the spirit
							(<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>). And smelling to acrid things is beneficial, also
							anointings, and ligatures of the extremities. When these
							things are done, if the disease do not yield, the patient is in a hopeless condition.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER II. CURE OF THE BRINGING UP OF BLOOD.</head>
						<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">LL</hi> the forms of the bringing up of blood are of an unmild
							character, not only as to mode, whether the flow proceed from
							rupture, erosion, or even rarefaction; and whether it come
							from the chest, the lungs, the stomach, or the liver, which are
							the most dangerous cases; but also from the head, although it
							occasions less mischief. For the flow is of blood; and blood
							is the food of all parts, the heat of all parts, and the colour of
							all parts. It is dreadful to see it flowing from the mouth in
							any way; but bad indeed if it proceed from an important
							viscus, and still worse if it proceed from rupture and erosion.</p>
						<p>It is necessary, therefore, that the physician should make
							the more haste in bringing assistance to this affection; and, in
							the first place, the patient must get coldish air to breathe, a
							chamber on the ground, and a couch firmly fixed, so that he
							may not be shaken (for all shaking is stimulant); the bed
							should be solid, not very yielding, nor deep, nor heated; his
							position erect; rest from speaking and hearing; tranquillity of
							mind, cheerfulness, since depression of spirits especially accompanies
							these cases; for who is there that does not dread death
							when vomiting blood?</p>
						<p>If, therefore, the patient be full of blood, and have large
							veins, in every form of rejection we must open a vein; whether
							it proceed from rupture, or erosion, venesection is very
							suitable; and even, if from rarefaction, there is danger, lest
							the fulness of blood burst forth.<note n="1">It is to be understood that
								by <hi rend="ital">rarefaction</hi> our author means
								exhalation; that is to say, increased
								action of the exhalants.</note> And we are to open the
							hollow vein at the elbow (for the blood flows readily from it,
							and it is easily opened, and the orifice can be safely kept open</p>
						<pb n="423"/>
						<p>for several days). In a word, then, in all the diseases of all
							the vital organs, this is the outlet of the blood. For the one
							higher up and this are both branches of the humeral, so that
							the one above can have no more remedial power than the
							mesal. They are ignorant of these divisions who have connected
							the upper vein with the stomach and liver. But if the
							flow proceed from the spleen, they direct us to open the vein
							of the left hand, which runs between the little finger and the
							one next the middle; for certain physicians held it to terminate
							in the spleen; but it is a branch of the vein below those at
							the elbow. Why, then, should we rather open the vein at the
							fingers than the one at the elbow? for there it is larger, and
							the blood flows readily from it. Altogether, then, we are to
							stop before coming to <hi rend="ital">deliquium animi.</hi> Yet neither, also, is
							much blood to be abstracted; for the hemorrhage itself is calculated
							to enfeeble the patient; but, after abstracting a small
							quantity, repeat the bleeding the same day, the next, and the
							day following. But if the patient be thin, and scantily supplied
							with blood, we must not open a vein. So much respecting
							the abstraction of blood.</p>
						<p>We are also to assist by means of ligatures to the extremities.
							Above the feet to the ankles and knees, and above the hands
							to the wrists and arms, a broad band is to be used, so that the
							constriction may be strong, and yet not produce pain. To the
							regions, also, from which the blood flows, we are to apply unwashed
							wool from the sheep; but moisten it with a liquid,
							such as austere wine, and the oils of roses and of myrtles.
							But if the hemorrhage be of an urgent nature, instead of the
							wool we are to use sponges, and vinegar instead of the wine,
							and let the part be anointed with myrtle oil; and we are to
							dust upon the sponges some of the dry inspissated juices, such
							as that of acacia, or of hypocistis, or else of aloes. The juice
							of the unripe grape, dissolved in vinegar, is also a very excellent
							thing. But if the liquid application be troublesome or</p>
						<pb n="424"/>
						<p>disagreeable, we are to use plasters; for these stretch the skin
							around, and press it, as it were, with the hand, and they are
							possessed of very strong powers as astringents and desiccants.
							In addition to these, there are very many others of tried
							efficacy; but the best are those which contain vinegar, and the
							expressed juice of ivy leaves, and asphaltos, and verdigris,
							alum, frankincense, myrrh, calcined copper, the squama æris,
							and such of the plasters as resemble these; or unscoured wool,
							or sponges damped in a small quantity of vinegar. But if the
							patients cannot bear the distension of the plasters, we are to
							make these things into an epitheme: fat dates, damped in dark
							austere wine, are pounded into a cake; then we are to sprinkle
							on it acacia in a soft state, and the rinds of pomegranate;
							these things having been all rubbed upon a rag, are applied to
							the chest. Barley-meal, moistened in wine or vinegar, or the
							fine flour of the dried lentil, sifted in a sieve, and made up
							with cerate or rose ointment, is to be applied; we are also to
							mix some of the root of the comfrey sifted. Another: Boil
							the roots of the wild prunes in vinegar, and having pounded
							into a cake, mix a little of sumach, and of gum, and of myrtle.
							These are to be mixed with one another differently, according
							as the strength of the medicines, mildness, or smell thereof is
							wanted. For we must also gratify the sick. These are the
							external remedies.</p>
						<p>But a more important part of the treatment lies in things
							drunk and swallowed, since these remedies come nearest the
							injured parts. Of these there are three distinct kinds: either
							they are calculated by the contraction or compression of the
							vessels to bind the passages of the flux; or to incrassate and
							coagulate the fluid, so that it may not flow, even if the passages
							were in a state to convey it; or to dry up the outlets, by
							retaining the blood in its pristine state, so that the parts may
							not thus remain emptied by the flux, but may regurgitate
							where the effusion is. For rarefaction of the veins, astringency</p>
						<pb n="425"/>
						<p>is sufficient, for it runs through the pores like a fluid when
							poured into a water-cask newly wetted. And also in the
							division of vessels stypticity is the remedy, by producing contraction
							of the lips; but for this purpose we must use the
							greater and more powerful medicines. But if the form of
							hemorrhage be that from erosion, and if the lips of the ulcer
							do not coalesce by the action of the astringents, but the wound
							gapes, and cannot be brought together by compression, we must
							produce congelation of the blood, and also of the heat; for the
							flow is stopped by the immobility and coagulation of these.
							To the rare parts, then, oxycrate is sufficient for producing
							astriction; for the fluid is not pure blood, but the sanies thereof
							from small orifices; and even of this medicine, there is no
							necessity of much being given, or frequently; and in certain
							cases, the external treatment is sufficient. So, likewise, the
							decoction of dates and of edible carobs, when drunk, has by
							itself proved sufficient. Let the vinegar be from wines of an
							astringent nature, and if not by pharmaceutical preparation,
							at all events let it be such as by time has become acrid and
							astringent. But in dilatations of the wounds, in addition to
							the oxycrate, let there be given the simple medicines at first,
							such as the juice of plantain, of knot-grass, or of endive; of
							each an equal part with the oxycrate. But if the flow increase,
							sprinkle on it one dram of the dried hypocistis, or of acacia,
							on three cupfuls of the oxycrate. The juice, also, of the wild
							grape is very excellent. But if the ailment prevail over this,
							sprinkle on it triturated gall, and the dried root of the bramble,
							and the sea stone, the coral, triturated and dried. But the
							root of rhubarb is more powerful than these to cool, to dry,
							to astringe; in short, for every purpose. But it is used with
							the oxycrate alone; or, if more powerful things are required,
							as a remedy. To the juices of endive with plantain we add
							some of the root, namely, three oboli of it to three or four
							cyathi of the fluid. But in crosions, we must produce astringency</p>
						<pb n="426"/>
						<p>even in it, so as to induce coagulation of the blood that
							flows, and also for the sake of the containing vessels, so that
							the veins which have sustained a large wound may shut their
							mouths. But the medicines which are drunk should be strong,
							and capable of inducing coagulation. Wherefore, give the
							juice of coriander with vinegar, and the rennet of a hare, or
							of a hind, or of a kid, but not in great quantity (for certain of
							these have proved fatal in a large dose); but of the juice of
							the coriander give not less than half a cyathus to three of the
							oxycrate, and of the rennet three oboli, or at most four. For
							such modes of the flow, the Samian earth is very excellent, and
							the very white Aster, and the Eretrian, and the Sinopic, and the
							Lemnian seal: of these, at least, one dram weight, and at most
							three, with some of the decoctions, as of dates, or of edible
							carobs, or of the roots of brambles. But if there be roughness
							of the windpipe, and cough along with it, we must sprinkle
							these things on Cretic rob. Starch, dissolved in these, is a
							most excellent thing for lubricating the windpipe; for along
							with its power of lubricating, it also possesses that of agglutinating.
							If, therefore, the flow of blood be not urgent, it must
							be given once a day, before the administration of food; but if
							it be urgent, also a second and third time in the evening. And
							from the medicines are to be made draughts of the dried substances
							with honey, boiled to the proper consistence; galls pulverised:
							and a very good thing is sumach for the condiments,
							also grape-stones, and the fruit of the sharp dock, either each
							by itself, or all together. These things, moreover, are good
							to be kept below the tongue during the whole time of melting;
							but likewise common gum with the plant, (?) and the gum
							tragacanth. The compound medicines of tried efficacy are
							infinite; and various are the usages of trochisks--of that from
							Egyptian thorn, of another from amber, and another named
							from saffron, of which the composition has been described
							separately.</p>
						<pb n="427"/>
						<p>In the absence of fevers, everything is to be attempted in
							regard to medicines, giving them copiously and frequently.
							But if fever come on--and most frequently fever takes place,
							along with inflammations of the wounds--we must not stop
							the flow suddenly, nor give medicines during the paroxysms,
							for many die sooner of the fevers than of the flow of blood.</p>
						<p>The articles of food are various in kind like the medicines,
							but also "the medicines are in the food;" for neither would it be
							easy to find all the good properties of food in any one article,
							nor even if a solitary thing were sufficient for the cure, should
							one only be used, as one would thus readily produce satiety;
							but we must grant variety if the disease should prove prolonged.
							Let the food, then, be astringent and refrigerant in
							properties, as also to the touch, for heat encourages bleeding.
							Washed alica; rice added to oxycrate; but if the vinegar
							excite coughing, the decoction of dates; baked bread which
							has been dried and pounded down to meal, and sifted. Of
							all these things a draught is to be made with oil; savory
							seasoned with salts, and sumach to be sprinkled upon it. And
							if you wish to gratify the patient's palate, let coriander be
							added, for this purpose, whenever it is agreeable, or any of the
							diuretic and diffusible seeds. Lentil, then, with the juice of
							plantain, if the hemorrhage be urgent, but if not, we should
							spare the juice, for neither is it of easy digestion, nor pleasant
							to the taste; for in these cases we must not give indigestible
							things. But if you apprehend death from the hemorrhage,
							you must also give what is unpalatable and indigestible; nay,
							let even harsh things be given if they will preserve life;
							wherefore, let galls, dried and pulverised, be sprinkled when
							dry, and cold lentil: eggs thick from boiling, with the seeds
							of pomegranate or galls, for the food necessarily consists in
							the medicines. The drink altogether should be scanty, since
							liquids are incompatible with a dry diet. These are the proper
							things, provided you wish to astringe and cool. But if</p>
						<pb n="428"/>
						<p>you wish also to thicken the blood and spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), milk
							along with starch and granulated spelt (<hi rend="ital">chondrus</hi>), the milk
							being sometimes given with the starch, and sometimes with
							the <hi rend="ital">chondrus</hi>; they should be boiled to such a consistence as
							that the draught may not be liquid. But if you wish to
							incrassate and astringe still more, let the <hi rend="ital">chondrus</hi> be boiled
							with dates, and for the sake of giving consistence, let there be
							starch and milk; and the Tuscan <hi rend="ital">far</hi> is a very excellent thing,
							being thick, viscid, and glutinous when given along with the
							milk; the rennet of the kid is to be added to the liquid
							decoctions for the sake of coagulation, so that with the milk,
							it attains the consistency of new cheese: still thicker than these
							is millet boiled with milk like the <hi rend="ital">far</hi>, having gall and pomegranate
							rind sprinkled on it as a powder. But we must look to
							the proportions of the desiccants and incrassants, for all these
							things provoke coughing, and in certain cases, from excess of
							desiccant powers, they have burst the veins. But if things
							turn out well, and the blood is stopped, we must gradually
							change to the opposite plan of treatment, "and nothing in
							excess," for these cases are apt to relapse, and are of a bad
							character. We must also strive to put flesh and fat on the
							patient by means of gestation, gentle frictions, exercise on
							foot, recreation, varied and suitable food.</p>
						<p>These are the means to be used if, after the flow of blood,
							the wound adhere and the part heal properly. But if the
							ulcer remain and become purulent, another plan of treatment
							is needed, for a discharge of different matters succeeds. This, however, will be treated of among the chronic diseases.</p>

							at the commencement.</p>
						<p>Unless, then, when everything is against it, the habit, the
							age, the season, the timidity of the patient, we must open a
							vein, and even if many symptoms contra-indicate it, but an
							especial one require it, such as the tongue rough, dry, and
							black (for it is indicative of all the internal parts). And in</p>
						<pb n="430"/>
						<p>all cases we must form an estimate of the strength, whether
							or not it has failed owing to the pains of the disease and the
							regimen; for the loss of strength takes place, not only from
							deficiency, but also from smothering; and if the syncope arise
							from redundancy, and if inflammation of the hypochondria,
							or of the liver strongly indicate, there is no necessity for deferring
							the bleeding. We are to open the hollow vein at the
							elbow, and abstract the blood by a small orifice, that it may
							not have a marked effect on the strength; for sudden depletion
							tries the natural strength: and we must take away much less
							than if from any other cause; for in syncope, even a slight mistake
							readily sends a man to the regions below. We must,
							therefore, immediately give food for the restoration of the
							strength; for Nature delights in the removal of the old, and
							in the supply of new things.</p>
						<p>But if the strength reject venesection, and inflammations be
							present, we must apply the cupping-instrument to the seat
							thereof a considerable time previous to the crisis of the disease;
							for the crisis takes place at the critical periods; since at
							the same periods Nature brings on a favourable crisis, and
							diseases prove fatal. And if the patient should come to such
							a state as to require wine, it is not very safe to take wine
							in inflammations; for, wine to persons labouring under inflammation
							is an increase of the pains, but to those free from inflammation
							it is an increase of the natural strength. A day or
							two before the cupping there is need of cataplasms, both in
							order to produce relaxation of the parts and to procure a flow
							of blood; and in certain cases, after the cupping, we are to
							apply a cataplasm on the next day. In this, too, let there be
							moderation; for there is the same danger from the abstraction
							of too much blood by cupping. Use clysters only for removing
							scybala which have long lodged in the bowels; but
							spare the strength.</p>
						<p>Cold lotions to the head, such as have been directed by me</p>
						<pb n="431"/>
						<p>under Phrenitis, but somewhat more liberally. Pure air,
							rather cooler than otherwise, for respiration. The delight of
							the sight is to be studied as to plants, painting, waters, so that
							everything may be regarded with pleasure. The conversation
							of attendants cheerful; silence and cheerfulness on the
							part of the patient. Smells fragrant, not calculated to prove
							heavy to the senses in the head. And let the articles of food
							also possess a fragrant smell, such as flour moistened with
							water or vinegar; bread hot, and newly baked. The mouth
							not to be very often rinsed with wine, nor is it to be altogether
							rejected.</p>
						<p>Drink to be given more frequently and more copiously than
							in other complaints. Food every day, light, digestible, mostly
							from grain, and that which is pleasant, even if somewhat less
							suitable. For, in these cases, rather than in any other, the
							palate is to be gratified, since not unusually the disease is
							generated in the stomach, so as to occasion resolution thereof.
							Abstinence or famine by no means; for the disease is sufficient
							to devour up all. But if the period be already come to a
							crisis, if there be a dew on the clavicle and forehead, the
							extremities cold; the pulse very small and very frequent, as
							if creeping, and feeble in tone, the patient must take a little
							food, and partake of wine effectually. The head, too, is to
							be strengthened by lotions, as also the bladder. These remedies
							have been described by me under Phrenitis. We are
							to give wine, not copiously nor to satiety, for certain patients
							by unseasonable repletion have died of anorexia, and inability
							to eat and drink; and to many patients having a good appetite,
							when the natural powers were dissolved, the abundant
							supply of food was of no avail; the food descending, indeed,
							into the stomach, but not ascending from the belly to recruit
							the strength. Let the food, therefore, be diversified,
							for the most part from grain, so as that it may be supped
							rather than masticated; or if solid, let it be made easy to</p>
						<pb n="432"/>
						<p>swallow. Eggs, not quite consistent nor roasted whole, but
							deprived of their solid portion; two or three pieces of bread
							soaked in wine, at first hot; but, after these, everything cold,
							unless there be latent inflammations. The wine is to be fragrant,
							and not very astringent; but by no means thick. Of
							the Greek wines, the Chian or Lesbian, and such other of the
							insular wines as are thin; of the Italian, the Surrentine, or
							Fundan, or Falernian, or Signine, unless it be very astringent;
							but of these we must reject such as are very old or very young.
							It is to be given at first hot, to the amount of not less than
							four cyathi, before the crisis, nor more than a hemina even if
							the patient be accustomed to drink. But after these things,
							having given food, if the symptoms of inflammation be past,
							we are again to give it cold as if for a remedy of the thirst;
							but this from necessity, and not by itself, but along with the
							food. We must also take care that the wine do not affect the
							brain; and after this, abstain. And if after an interval, he
							wish to sleep, quiet is to be enforced. But if much sweat
							flow, the pulse come to a stop, the voice become sharp, and
							the breast lose its heat, we are to give as much wine as the
							patient can drink. For those who are cold, wine is the only
							hope of life. Wine, therefore, if the patient be accustomed
							to it, is sometimes to be taken in drink, and sometimes food
							is to be eaten with the wine, after an interval, as a respite
							from the fatigue induced by the disease and the food, for
							when the strength is small, they are much fatigued, even
							by the act of taking food. Wherefore the patient must be
							stout-hearted and courageous, and the physician must encourage
							him with words to be of good cheer, and assist with
							diversified food and drink.</p>
						<p>The other treatment is also to be applied energetically for
							restraining the sweats, and for resuscitating the spark of life.
							Let, therefore, an epitheme be applied to the chest on the
							left mamma,--dates triturated in wine along with aloes and</p>
						<pb n="433"/>
						<p>mastich,--and let these things be mixed up with a cerate
							composed of nard.<note n="2">No doubt the Indian nard, namely, <hi rend="ital">Patrinia
								Jatamansi</hi>, Don.</note> And if this become disagreeable, we
							may apply another epitheme, made by taking the seed, and
							whatever is hard out of the apples, and having bruised them
							down, mix up with some fragrant meal; then we are to mix
							together some of the hair of wormwood, and of myrtle, and of
							acacia, and of the manna of frankincense, all sifted; which being
							all rubbed up together, are to be added to the cerate of wild vine.
							But if the sweat be not thereby restrained, the juice of the
							wild grape is to be added to the mixture, and acacia, and
							gum, and the edible part of sumach, and alum, and dates,
							and the scented juice of roses. All these things along with
							nard and oil of wild vine are to be applied to the chest; for
							this at the same time cools and is astringent. Let him lie in
							cool air, and in a house having a northern exposure; and if the
							cool breeze of Boreas breathe upon him, "it will refresh his
							soul sadly gasping for breath." The prospect should be to-wards
							meadows, fountains, and babbling streams, for the
							sweet exhalations from them, and the delightful view, warm
							the soul and refresh nature. And, moreover, it is also an
							incentive to eat and to drink. But if from want one is not
							fortunate enough to possess these things, we must make an
							imitation of the cool breeze, by fanning with the branches of
							fragrant boughs, and, if the season of spring, by strewing
							the ground with such leaves and flowers as are at hand. The
							coverlet should be light and old, so as to admit the air, and
							permit the exhalation of the heat of the chest; the best kind
							is an old linen sheet. We are to sprinkle the neck, the region
							of the clavicle and chest with flour, so that it may nourish by
							its fragrance, and restrain by its dryness; and the spongy parts
							of the body are to be dusted with meal, but the face with
							the Samian earth, which is to be passed through a sieve; and</p>
						<pb n="434"/>
						<p>having been bound into a spongy cloth, it is to be dusted on
							the part, so that the finer particles may pass through the
							pores to the forehead and cheeks. And slaked lime and
							roasted gypsum, sifted in a small sieve, are to be applied to
							the moist parts. A sponge out of cold water applied to the
							face has sometimes stopped the sweats, by occasioning congelation
							of the running fluids, and by condensation of the
							pores. The anus is to be anointed, so that the flatus arising
							from the cold and food may be discharged. And we are to
							recall the heat of the extremities by gleucinum,<note n="3">A fragrant oil
								prepared from
								must. See Paulus Ægineta, t.iii.
								p. 596.</note> or Sicyonian
							oil, along with pepper, castor, natron, and cachry,<note n="4">The fruit of the

							melting into them a little wax, so that the liniment may
							stick. And we are to resuscitate the heat by means of the
							ointment of lemnestis, and of euphorbium, and of the fruit of
							the bay. The small red onions raw, along with pepper, and
							the powdered lees of vinegar, make an excellent cataplasm
							to the feet; but it is to be constantly raised from the place
							every hour, for there is danger of ulceration and blisters.
							From these things there is hope that the patient may thus
							escape.</p>
						<p>And if the physician should do everything properly, and if
							everything turn out well, along with the syncope the inflammations
							that supervene are resolved; and sweat, indeed,
							is nowhere, but a restoration of the heat everywhere, even at
							the extremities of the feet and the nose; but the face is
							of a good colour; pulse enlarged in magnitude, not tremulous,
							strong; voice the same as customary, loud, and in every
							respect lively. Lassitude not out of place, but the patient
							is also seen sleeping: and, if sleep seize him, he digests his
							food, recovers his senses, and sprouts out into a new nature;
							and if roused from sleep, the breathing is free, he is light</p>
						<pb n="435"/>
						<p>and vigorous; and here calls to his memory the circumstances
							of the disease like a dream.</p>
						<p>But in other cases obscure fevers are left behind, and sometimes
							slight inflammations, and a dry tongue: they are parched,
							have rigors, are enfeebled, and relaxed, in which cases there
							is a conversion to marasmus; when we must not waste time
							with rest and a slender diet, but have recourse to motions,
							by gestation, and to friction and baths, so that the embers of
							life may be roused and mended. We are to give milk, especially
							that of a woman who has just borne a child, and that a
							male child; for such persons require nursing like new-born
							children. Or if it cannot be obtained, we must give the
							milk of an ass which has had a foal not long before, for such
							milk is particularly thin;<note n="4">The author appears to refer

						<head>CHAPTER IV. CURE OF CHOLERA.</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> Cholera, the suppression of the discharges is a bad thing, for
							they are undigested matters. We must, therefore, readily permit
							them to go on, if spontaneous, or if not, promote them by
							giving some tepid water to swallow, frequently indeed, but in
							small quantity, so that there may be no spasmodic retchings
							excited in the stomach. But if there also be tormina and
							coldness of the feet, we are to rub the abdomen with hot oil,
							boiled with rue and cumin, to dispel the flatulence; and we
							are to apply wool. And, having anointed the feet, they are to</p>
						<pb n="436"/>
						<p>be gently rubbed, stroking them rather than pinching them.
							And these things are to be done up to the knees for the
							restoration of the heat; and the same is to be practised until
							the fæces pass downwards, and the bilious matters ascend
							upwards.</p>
						<p>But if all the remains of the food have been discharged
							downwards, and if bile be evacuated, and if there still be
							bilious vomiting, retchings, and nausea, uneasiness and loss of
							strength, we must give two or three cupfuls (<hi rend="ital">cyathi</hi>) of cold
							water, as an astringent of the belly, to stop the reflux, and in
							order to cool the burning stomach; and this is to be repeatedly
							done when what even has been drunk is vomited. The cold
							water, indeed, readily gets warm in the stomach, and then
							the stomach rejects it, annoyed as it is both by hot and cold:
							but it constantly desiderates cold drink.</p>
						<p>But, if the pulse also fall to a low state, and become exceedingly
							rapid and hurried, if there be sweat about the forehead
							and region of the clavicles, if it run in large drops from all
							parts of the body, and the discharge from the bowels is not
							restrained, and the stomach still vomits, with retchings and
							deliquium animi, we must add to the cold water a small
							quantity of wine, which is fragrant and astringent, that it
							may refresh the senses by its <hi rend="ital">bouquet</hi>, contribute to the
							strength of the stomach by its spirit, and to the restoration
							of the body by its nutritious powers. For wine is swiftly distributed
							upwards over the system, so as to restrain the reflux;
							and is subtil, so that when poured into the frame it strengthens
							the habit, and it is strong so as to restrain the dissolving
							powers. We are also to sprinkle on the body some fresh
							and fragrant meal. But if the bad symptoms become urgent,
							with sweating, and strainings, not only of the stomach, but
							also of the nerves, and if there be hiccups; and if the feet are
							contracted, if there be copious discharges from the bowels,
							and if the patient become dark-eoloured, and the pulse is</p>
						<pb n="437"/>
						<p>coming to a stop, we must try to anticipate this condition beforehand;
							but if it be come on, we must give much cold water
							and wine, not indeed wine slightly diluted, for fear of intoxication,
							and of hurting the nerves, and along with food, namely,
							pieces of bread soaked in it. We are likewise to give of other
							kinds of food, such as have been described by me under syncope,
							autumnal fruit of an astringent nature, services, medlars,
							quinces, or the grape.</p>
						<p>But if everything be vomited, and the stomach can contain
							nothing, we must return again to hot drink and food, for in
							certain cases the change stops the complaint; the hot things,
							moreover, must be intensely so. But if none of these things
							avail, we are to apply the cupping-instrument between the
							shoulder-blades, and turn it below the umbilicus; but we are
							to shift the cupping-instrument constantly, for it is painful
							when it remains on a place, and exposes to the risk of blistering.
							The motion of gestation is beneficial by its ventilation,
							so as to recreate the spirit (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), stay the food in the
							bowels, and make the patient's respiration and pulse natural.</p>
						<p>But if these symptoms increase, we must apply epithemes
							over the stomach and chest; and these are to be similar to
							those for syncope--dates soaked in wine, acacia, hypocistis,
							mixed up with rose cerate, and spread upon a linen cloth, are
							to be applied over the stomach; and to the chest we are
							to apply mastich, aloe, the pulverised hair of wormwood,
							with the cerate of nard, or of wild vine, as a cataplasm to the
							whole chest; but if the feet and muscles be spasmodically distended,
							rub into them Sicyonian oil, that of must, or old oil with
							a little wax; and also add in powder some castor. And if the
							feet also be cold, we are to rub them with the ointment containing
							lemnestis and euphorbium, wrap them in wool, and
							rectify by rubbing with the hands. The spine also, the
							tendons, and muscles of the jaws are to be anointed with the
							same.</p>
						<pb n="438"/>
						<p>If, therefore, by these means the sweat and discharges from
							the bowels are stopped, and the stomach receives the food
							without vomiting it again, the pulse becomes large and strong,
							and the straining ceases; if the heat prevails everywhere, and
							reaches the extremities, and sleep concocts all matters, on the
							second or third day the patient is to be bathed, and remitted
							to his usual course of living. But if he vomit up everything,
							if the sweat flow incessant, if the patient become cold and
							livid, if his pulse be almost stopped and his strength exhausted,

						<head>CHAPTER V. CURE OF ILEUS.</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> Ileus it is pain that kills, along with inflammation of the
							bowels, or straining and swelling. A most acute and most disgusting
							form of death! For others, when in a hopeless state of
							illness, fear nothing except their impending death; but those
							in ileus, from excess of pain earnestly desire death. The
							physician, therefore, must neither be inferior to the affection,
							nor more dilatory; but, if he find inflammation to be the cause,
							open a vein at the elbow by a large orifice, so that blood,
							which is the pabulum of the inflammation, may flow copiously;
							and it may be carried the length of deliquium animi, for this
							is either the commencement of an escape from pain, or of a
							torpor ending in insensibility. For in ileus a breathing-time
							for a short space, even from loss of sensibility, will prove an
							interval from pain; since, also, to persons enduring these
							pains, to die is happiness, but to impart it is not permitted to
							the respectable physician; but at times it is permitted, when</p>
						<pb n="439"/>
						<p>he foresees that present symptoms cannot be escaped from, to
							lull the patient asleep with narcotics and anæsthetics.</p>
						<p>But if the ileus arise without inflammation, from corruption
							of the food or intense cold, we are to abstain from bleeding,
							but at the same time to do all the other things, and procure
							vomiting frequently by water, and drinking plenty of oil;
							then, again, we are to procure vomiting, and produce the expulsion
							of the flatus downwards, by stimulant medicines.
							Such a stimulant is the juice of sow-bread, and natron, or
							salts. Cumin and rue are carminatives. Wherefore we must
							rub in together all these things with turpentine resin, and
							foment with sponges; or we must inject with these things and
							oil, honey, hyssop, and the decoction of the fleshy parts of the
							wild cucumber. And if feculent matter be evacuated, we
							are again to inject hot oil with rue; for, if this remain inwardly,
							it proves a grateful fomentation to the bowels: and
							apply to the suffering parts lotions composed of oil which has
							been strongly boiled with rue and dill. And the fomentation
							is also to be applied, either by means of earthen or brazen
							vessels, or with millet and roasted salts. In addition to the
							ordinary cataplasms, one may be made of the flour of darnel
							and cumin, and the hair of hyssop and of marjoram. Cupping,
							without the abstraction of blood, indeed, but frequently
							applied, sometimes to one place, and sometimes to another--to
							the epigastric region, and to the loins as far as the groins,
							and behind to the ischiatic region as far as the kidneys and
							spine; for it is expedient to produce revulsion of the pain by
							all means. They should also get whetters (<hi rend="ital">propomata</hi><note n="1">See
								Bekker's Charicles, p. 248;
								and Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 546.</note>) of the

						<pb n="440"/>
						<p>many of tried efficacy. The medicine from vipers is also a
							good one, when drunk to a larger amount than usual. But if
							neither the pain remit, nor the flatulence nor fæces pass, we
							must necessarily give of the purgative hiera; for either the
							medicine is rejected with phlegm and bile, or it passes downwards,
							bringing off flatus, scybala, phlegm, and bile, which
							occasion the intensity of the evil. Laxative food: soups of
							hens, of shell-fish; the juice of ptisan boiled with much oil
							poured in at first before the boiling; boil along with it cumin,
							natron, leek with its hair. Or the cure is to be made with
							some laxative soup: snails much boiled, and their gravy, or
							that of limpet. Water is to be taken for drink, if there be
							fever, boiled with asarabacca, or nard, or cachry. For these
							things dispel flatus, are diuretic, and promote free breathing.
							But if he be free from pain, wine also is beneficial for the
							heat of the intestines, and for the restoration of the strength;
							and likewise the decoction of fennel-root, in a draught, and
							maiden-hair and cinnamon.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER VI. CURE OF THE ACUTE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE LIVER.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> formation of the blood is in the liver, and hence the
							distribution of it over the whole system. And the entire liver
							is, as it were, a concretion of blood. Wherefore the inflammations
							there are most acute; for nutrition is seated in this</p>
						<pb n="441"/>
						<p>place. If, therefore, inflammation form anywhere else, it is not
							remarkably acute; for it is an influx of blood that is inflamed;
							but in the liver there is no necessity for its coming from
							another quarter. For if any obstruction shut the outlets, the
							liver becomes inflamed by being deprived of its efflux, since
							the entrance of the food to the liver still continues patent;
							for there is no other passage of the food but this from the
							stomach and intestines to the whole body.</p>
						<p>It is necessary, therefore, to make a copious evacuation, by
							opening the veins at the elbow, and taking away blood frequently,
							but not in large quantity at a time. Total abstinence
							from food at first, but restricted diet afterwards, so that the
							liver may be devoid of its customary ingesta. It is necessary,
							also, by external applications to dispel the matters impacted in
							the liver. Lotions, therefore, with aloe or natron are proper,
							and unwashed wool is to be applied. There is need, then, of
							cooling means, because the liver is inflamed by the blood; for
							the blood is hot. The cataplasms, also, should be of such a
							nature, consisting of the meal of darnel, or of hedge-mustard,
							or of barley, or of linseed; and of liquid substances, such as
							acid wine, the juice of apples, of the tendrils of the vine, or of
							the leaves of the vine in season, or of the oil prepared with
							it. Fomentations are to be applied on sponges, of the decoction
							of the fruit of bays, of the lentisk, of penny-royal, and of
							iris.</p>
						<p>When you have soothed by these means, you must apply a
							cupping-instrument, unusually large, so as to comprehend the
							whole hypochondriac region, and make deeper incisions than
							usual, that you may attract much blood. And, in certain
							cases, leeches are better than scarifications; for the bite of the
							animal sinks deeper, and it makes larger holes, and hence the
							flow of blood from these animals is difficult to stop. And
							when the animals fall off quite full, we may apply the cupping-instrument,
							which then attracts the matters within. And</p>
						<pb n="442"/>
						<p>if there be sufficient evacuation, we are to apply styptics to
							the wounds; but these not of a stimulant nature, such as
							spiders' webs, the manna of frankincense, and aloe, which are to
							be sprinkled in powder on the part; or bread boiled with rue
							or melilot, and the roots of marsh-mallow; but on the third
							day a cerate, made with nut-ben, or the hairy leaves of wormwood
							and iris. The malagmata should be such as are calculated
							to attenuate, rarify, or prove diuretic. Of these the
							best is that "from seeds" (<hi rend="ital">diaspermatôn</hi>) well known to all
							physicians from experience. That also is a good one of which
							marjoram and melilot are ingredients.</p>
						<p>The food should be light, digestible, possessed of diuretic
							qualities, and which will quickly pass through the bowels;
							such as granulated seeds of spelt (<hi rend="ital">alica</hi><note n="1">See, in particular,
								Dr. Daremberg's
								elaborate dissertation on
								the <foreign lang="greek">XO/NDROS</foreign>, ap. Oribasium, t.i.
								p. 559.</note>) with honeyed-water,
							and a draught of these articles with salts and dill. The juice
							of ptisan, also, is detergent; and if you will add some of the
							seeds of carrot, you will make it more diuretic: for it evacuates
							by the passages which lead from the liver to the kidneys; and
							this is the most suitable outlet for matters passing out from
							the liver, owing to the wideness of the vessels and the straightness
							of the passage. We must also attract thither by cupping,
							applying the instrument to the region of the kidneys in the
							loins. To these parts, lotions are also to be applied, prepared
							with rue, the juncus, or calamus aromaticus. By these means,
							it is to be hoped that the patient may escape death.</p>
						<p>But when it is turning to a suppuration, we must use the
							suppurative medicines which will be described by me under
							the head of colics. But if pus is formed, how the collection is
							to be opened, and how treated, will be explained by me in
							another place. The same observations apply to the spleen, in

						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> inflammation of the <hi rend="ital">vena cava</hi> and large artery, which
							extend along the spine, was called a species of Causus by
							those of former times. For in these cases the affections are
							similar: febrile heat acute and acrid, loathing of food, thirst,
							restlessness; a palpitating pulsation in the hypochondriac
							region and in the back, and the other symptoms described by
							me under this head. Moreover, the febrile heat tends to syncope,
							as in cases of causus. For, indeed, the liver is formed
							by the roots of the veins, and the heart is the original of the
							artery. You may suppose, then, that the upper portions of
							these viscera are subject to fatal ailments; for it is the heart
							which imparts heat to the artery, and the liver which conveys
							blood to the vein; and being both mighty parts, the inflammations,
							likewise, which spring from them are great.</p>
						<p>Wherefore we are to open the veins at the elbow, and
							abstract a considerable amount of blood; not all at once, however,
							but at two or three times, and on a different day, so that
							the strength may recruit during the interval. Then we are to
							apply a cupping-instrument and cataplasms to the hypochondrium,
							where is the pulsation of the artery; and also between
							the scapulæ, for there, too, there are pulsations. We are to
							scarify unsparingly, and abstract much blood; for from this
							sort of evacuation the patients are not much prone to deliquium.
							The bowels, also, are apt to be unusually confined, and emollient
							clysters are to be used to lubricate them, but not on any
							account acrid ones; for they suffer an increase of fever from
							brine and the melting of the natron. The juice, therefore, of

							before the administration of food, we must give draughts to
							promote the urinary discharge, containing spignel, asarabacca,
							and wormwood, to which some natron in powder is to be
							added. But of all such medicines the strongest are cassia and
							cinnamon, provided one has plenty of it. In such cases, milk
							is both food and medicine; for they stand in need of refrigeration,
							a sort of fire being wrapped up within; and also of sweet
							food, and of that a copious supply in small bulk. Such virtues
							milk possesses as an article of food. Plenty of the milk of an
							ass which has just had a foal is to be given, and to two cupfuls
							of the milk one of water is to be added. That of the cow is
							also very good; and, thirdly, that of a goat. The articles of
							food should be of easy digestion; for the most part juices,
							such as that from the juice of the fennel; and let parsley seed
							be added to it, and honey. And the water which is drunk
							should contain these things.</p>

							such as in syncope. To lie in bed with the head elevated, so
							that everything may be alike as in causus. Gestation to a
							small extent, so as to provoke sweats; a bath, also, if he be

						<head>CHAPTER VIII. CURE OF THE ACUTE DISEASE IN THE KIDNEYS.</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">NFLAMMATION</hi> in the kidneys is of an acute nature; for the
							veins passing from the liver to the kidneys are inflamed at the
							same time, and with these the liver; for these veins are not
							very long, but are very broad, so as to give the kidneys the
							appearance of being suspended near the liver. But suppression
							of urine takes place along with the inflammation, thereby
							contributing to the intensity of the inflammation; for the
							cavity of the kidneys is filled by the overflow of the urine
							which fails to escape. The same happens also with stones,
							provided one larger than the breadth of the ureters be formed
							in the kidneys: it then becomes seated there, and, not passing
							through, it occasions a stoppage of the urine. But we will
							treat of the formation of calculi among the chronic diseases;
							how they may either be prevented from forming, or how they
							may be broken when formed. With regard to heat and obstruction,
							such of these affections as prove quickly fatal will be
							described by me in this place.</p>
						<p>Whether it be impaction of stones, or whether it be inflammation,
							we must open the vein at the elbow, unless a particular
							period of life prove an obstacle, and blood must be taken in a
							full stream and in large quantity. For not only are inflammations
							alleviated by evacuation, but also impacted stones are
							slackened by the evacuation of the vessels, and thus the stones
							escape during the passing of the urine. Then the parts are
							to be relaxed by bathing them with oil of must or of privet,
							and by fomentations and cataplasms. The herb southernwood,
							the schœnus, and calamus aromaticus, should form the
							ingredients of the cataplasms. Then we are to apply
							the cupping-instrument over the kidneys, in the loins, more</p>
						<pb n="446"/>
						<p>especially if the evacuation from this place has been of service.
							The bowels are to be softened by lubricating clysters, rather of
							a viscid than of an acrid nature, such as the juiees either of
							mallows or of fenugreek. Sometimes, also, diuretic medicines
							are to be given before food, such as are described respecting
							the liver, and also similar food of easy digestion: for in such
							cases indigestion is bad. Milk is a most excellent article, especially
							that of an ass; next, of a mare; even that of an ewe or a
							goat is useful, as being a kind of milk. If, then, they be free
							of fever, it is better also to prescribe the bath; but if not, they
							are to be placed in a sitz-bath formed of the decoction of herbs,
							filling the vessel up to their navel. But if it be turned to
							suppuration, what cataplasms and other medicines we are to
							use have formerly been laid down by us on many occasions.</p>
						<p>But, if the stone stick, we are to use the same fomentations
							and cataplasms, and try to break the stones with medicines
							taken in the form of drink. The simples are the herbs waterparsnip
							and <hi rend="ital">prionitis</hi>,<note n="1">I am at a loss to decide what

							the juice of it taken for drink: the compound ones are, that
							named from Vestinus, that from vipers and the reptile the
							skink, and such as from experience appear to be best. Gestation
							and succussion are calculated to promote the movement
							and protrusion of the calculi; for the passage of calculi into
							the bladder is very painful. But if the stones drop out, the
							patients become free from pain, which they have not been
							accustomed to be, not even in their dreams; and, as if escaped
							from inevitable evils, they feel relieved both in mind and in
							body.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER IX. CURE OF THE ACUTE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE BLADDER.</head>
						<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">CUTE</hi> affections, resembling those of the kidneys, form also
							in the bladder; namely, inflammations, ulcerations, calculi,
							and the obstructions from clots, and, along with these, suppression
							of urine and strangury. But in this part the pain is
							more acute, and death most speedy; for the bladder is a broad
							nerve, whereas the kidneys are like a concretion of blood, of
							the same species as the liver. But, moreover, the sufferings
							are most dreadful and most lamentable:</p>
						<p>for there, by far,</p>
						<p>On wretched men most cruel pains inflicts the god of war.</p>
						<p>We must, therefore, straightway make an incision in the
							flanks, and soothe the bladder by means of a fomentation of
							much oil, with rue and dill. But if grumous blood be the
							cause of the pains and stoppage of the urine, we are to give
							oxymel to drink, or a little quantity of lime with honeyedwater
							for the solution of the clots, and also such other things,
							both herbs and seeds, as promote the secretion of urine. But
							if there be danger from hemorrhage, it is to be stopped without
							delay, more than in the other cases; for the danger from
							it is not small. We must remedy it by the medicines which
							stop bleeding. In this case refrigeration of the bladder is
							beneficial; bathing with rose-oil and wine, and wrapping the
							parts in cloths made of unwashed wool.<note n="1">This process is very
								circumstantially
								described by Oribasius
								under the name of <foreign lang="greek">KATEI/LHSLS</foreign> Med.

								it, <hi rend="ital">l'enroulement avec les

							be formed with dates soaked in wine, with pomegranate or the
							juice of sumach. But if the patient is averse to the weight of</p>
						<pb n="448"/>
						<p>the epithemes and the great cooling, they must both be given
							up; for we must not cool greatly a part naturally thin and
							cold like the bladder. But we are to anoint the parts with
							oil of must, or acacia, or hypocistis with wine. But we must
							not use sponges, unless the hemorrhage be very urgent. The
							food should be farinaceous, of easy digestion, wholesome,
							diuretic, such as have been described by me under the head of
							the kidneys; milk, sweet wine, the Theræan and Scybelitic.
							Medicines should be drunk which are diuretic, fragrant, and
							diffusible, and other such things. A very excellent thing for
							the bladder is <hi rend="ital">cicad&oelig;</hi>; roasted, in season, as an article of
							food;
							and out of season, when dried and triturated with water. Let
							also a little of the root of nard be boiled up with the <hi rend="ital">cicadœ.</hi>
							The same things may be used for preparing a bath to sit in for
							relaxation of the bladder.</p>
						<p>But, if it be the impaction of calculi which stops the urine,
							we must push away the calculus and draw off the urine, with
							the instrument, the catheter, unless there be inflammations;
							for, in inflammations, neither do the passages well admit the
							instrument, and in addition they are hurt by the catheter.
							But if this treatment be inadmissible, and the patient is nearly
							killed with the sufferings, we must make an incision in the
							part under the <hi rend="ital">glans penis</hi>, and the neck of the bladder, in
							order to procure an outlet for the stone and the expulsion of
							the urine. And we must particularly endeavour to cure the
							part by bringing the wound to cicatrization. But if not, it is
							better that the patient should have a flux of urine for the
							remainder of his life, than that he should die most miserably
							of the pain.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER X. CURE OF THE HYSTERICAL CONVULSION.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> uterus in women has membranes extended on both sides
							at the flanks, and also is subject to the affections of an animal
							in smelling; for it follows after fragrant things as if for pleasure,
							and flees from fetid and disagreeable things as if for dislike.
							If, therefore, anything annoy it from above, it protrudes even
							beyond the genital organs. But if any of these things be
							applied to the os, it retreats backwards and upwards. Sometimes
							it will go to this side or to that,--to the spleen and
							liver, while the membranes yield to the distension and contraction
							like the sails of a ship.</p>
						<p>It suffers in this way also from inflammation; and it protrudes
							more than usual in this affection and in the swelling of
							its neck; for inflammation of the fundus inclines upwards; but
							if downwards to the feet, it protrudes externally, a troublesome,
							painful and unseemly complaint, rendering it difficult
							to walk, to lie on the side or on the back, unless the woman
							suffer from inflammation of the feet. But if it mount upwards,
							it very speedily suffocates the woman, and stops the
							respiration as if with a cord, before she feels pain, or can
							scream aloud, or can call upon the spectators, for in many
							cases the respiration is first stopped, and in others the
							speech. It is proper, then, in these cases, to call the physician
							quickly before the patient die. Should you fortunately
							arrive in time and ascertain that it is inflammation, you must
							open a vein, especially the one at the ankle, and pursue the
							other means which prove remedial in suffocation without inflammation:
							ligatures of the hands and feet so tight as to
							induce torpor; smelling to fetid substances--liquid pitch, hairs
							and wool burnt, the extinguished flame of a lamp, and castor,</p>
						<pb n="450"/>
						<p>since, in addition to its bad smell, it warms the congealed
							nerves. Old urine greatly rouses the sense of one in a death-like
							state, and drives the uterus downwards. Wherefore we
							must apply fragrant things on pessaries to the region of the
							uterus--any ointment of a mild nature, and not pungent to
							the touch, nard, or Ægyptian bacchar, or the medicine from
							the leaves of the malabathrum, the Indian tree,<note n="1">A species of wild
								cinnamon or
								cassia-tree. See Edinburgh Greek
								Lexicon, Appendix, under the term.</note> or cinnamon
							pounded with any of the fragrant oils. These articles are to
							be rubbed into the female parts. And also an injection of
							these things is to be thrown into the uterus. The anus is to
							be rubbed with applications which dispel flatus; and injections
							of things not acrid, but softening, viscid, and lubricant, are
							to be given for the expulsion of the fæces solely, so that the
							region of the uterus may be emptied,--with the juice of
							marsh-mallow, or of fenugreek, but let melilot or marjoram
							be boiled along with the oil. But, if the uterus stands in
							need of support rather than evacuation, the abdomen is to be
							compressed by the hands of a strong woman, or of an expert
							man, binding it round also with a roller, when you have
							replaced the part, so that it may not ascend upwards again.
							Having produced sneezing, you must compress the nostrils;
							for by the sneezing and straining, in certain cases, the uterus
							has returned to its place. We are to blow into the nostrils
							also some of the root of soapwort,<note n="2">The <hi rend="ital">Saponaria
								officinalis.</hi></note> or of pepper, or of castor.
							We are also to apply the instrument for dry-cupping to the
							thighs, loins, the ischiatic regions, and groins, in order to
							attract the uterus. And, moreover, we are to apply it to the
							spine, and between the scapulæ, in order to relieve the sense
							of suffocation. But if the feeling of suffocation be connected
							with inflammation, we may also scarify the vein leading along
							the pubes, and abstract plenty of blood. Friction of the</p>

							drink of castor, and a little quantity of the hiera with the
							castor. And if relieved, she is to bathe, and at the proper

							similar things, such as cicuta with water, or wine, or vinegar;

							Then the patient is to have a sitz bath medicated with worm-wood,
							and the decoction of sage, and of flea-bane. But when
							the affection is protracted for a considerable time without
							any corresponding intermission, there is danger of a convulsion
							(for in this affection the patients are liable to convulsions),
							we must change the system of treatment to calefacients, there
							is need of oil of must or of Sicyonian oil instead of oil of roses,

						<head>CHAPTER II. CURE OF CEPHALÆA.</head>
						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> head, inasmuch as it is necessary towards life, so is it
							also very dangerous in disease. And the onset of diseases
							about it is quite tolerable, being attended with slight pain,
							noises in the ears, and heaviness; but if they acquire increase,
							they become fatal at last. Wherefore even slight pains should
							not be overlooked, and, in certain cases, they have been cured
							by slight remedies. But if prolonged for a longer space, as
							greater sufferings supervene, we must open the vein at the
							elbow. But, for two days previous, the patient must get wine
							to drink, and the quantity of blood abstracted must be regulated
							by the strength; and it is best not to make the whole
							evacuation at once, so that the strength may bear the amount
							thereof; and the disease is rather removed by the repetition of
							the means. The same rule applies to all chronic diseases.
							During an interval of three or four days, a fuller diet is to be
							given, and then the purgative hiera is to be taken in a
							draught; for it, in an especial manner, draws the pabulum of
							the disease from the head. The quantity of the medicine
							given is to be to the amount of four or five drams. And if
							well purged, we are to administer the bath, give wine, and
							improve the strength. Then again we are to open the straight
							vein (<hi rend="ital">temporal?</hi>) on the forehead, for abstraction by it is most
							efficacious; the amount, about a hemina (<hi rend="ital">half-pint?</hi>) or a little
							more. But we must not evacuate further, for we must avoid
							emptying the vessels. Then, having removed the hair with a
							razor, we are first to apply one cupping-instrument to the
							vertex, and another between the scapulæ, without drawing
							blood; but along with the instrument applied to the vertex,</p>
						<pb n="459"/>
						<p>we are to scarify unsparingly, for the purpose of attracting the
							redundant fluid and of making an incision in the deep-seated
							parts. For remedial means applied even to the bones are beneficial
							in cephalæa. When the wounds are cicatrised, we are to
							excise a portion of the arteries;<note n="1">See Paulus Ægineta, b. vi.
								5.</note> (of these there are two, one
							behind the ears, at a little distance from them, being obvious
							from their pulsations; the others in front of the ear, and close
							to it, for they lie close to the antitragus; and these also are
							discovered by their pulsations); we are to incise the larger
							ones at the bones, for they afford relief. Adjacent to them are
							others, very slender, which there is no benefit from excising.
							The mode of operating has been described under operative
							surgery. This is the great remedy in cephalæa, epilepsy,
							vertigo, and, in fine, in all the diseases of the head.</p>
						<p>In all cases we are to bring off phlegm, first evacuating the
							bowels, either by a purgative draught, or by a clyster; and
							sometimes from the nostrils by sternutatories; and sometimes
							from the mouth by sialogogues. Among the kinds of sternutatories
							are pepper, the root of soapwort, and the testicle of
							the beaver; these may all be used together; having levigated
							and sifted them, we are to blow the powder in, either with a
							reed or the thick stalk of a goose quill. Euphorbium is more
							active and stronger than these when mixed with any of them.
							It is also mixed up with the oils, such as <hi rend="ital">gleucinum</hi>, the
							Sicyonian, or the ointment from storax. It is made into a
							liquid form as an injection, and it is injected by means of a
							nasal pipe; the instrument consists of two pipes united
							together by one outlet, so that we can inject by both at the
							same time. For to dilate each nostril separately is a thing
							which could not be borne, as the head gets quickly filled, and
							thus contracts a sharp pain. The medicines which evacuate
							phlegm from the mouth are, mustard, the <hi rend="ital">granum cnidium</hi>,</p>
						<pb n="460"/>
						<p>pepper, stavesacre, these either together or separately; and
							one may masticate these substances and spit out constantly;
							and give them mixed up with water or honeyed-water, rinse
							the mouth, and press them back to the tonsils with stretching
							of the neck, thus wash out along with the breath in expiration;<note n="2">This
								is rather an obscure description
								of the simple process of
								<hi rend="ital">gargling.</hi> See the note of Petit.</note>
							and when you have evacuated phlegm as much as you
							think proper, you must bathe and foment the head with a
							very large quantity of hot water to promote perspiration, for
							the obstructions become strong.</p>
						<p>Supper should be spare; but wine also is to be given, to
							restore the tone of the stomach, for it also suffers in this
							complaint. When, in the meantime, you have re-established
							the strength, you will require to give a common clyster having
							sprinkled upon it much natron, or dissolving it in two drams
							of the resin of the turpentine tree. On the next day we are
							to abstract blood from the inside of the nostrils, and for this
							purpose push into them the long instrument named <hi rend="ital">Katidion</hi>,
							or the one named <hi rend="ital">Toryne</hi>, or, in want of these, we must take
							the thick quill of a goose, and having scooped the nervous
							part of it into teeth like a saw, we are to push it down the
							nostrils as far as the ethmoid cells, then shake it with both
							hands so that the part may be scarified by its teeth. Thus we
							shall have a ready and copious flow of blood; for slender
							veins terminate there, and the parts are soft and easily cut.
							The common people have many modes of scarification, by
							rough herbs, and the dried leaves of the bay, which they
							introduce with the fingers and move strongly.<note n="3">On this practice, see
								Paulus
								Ægineta, tom. i. p. 326, Syd. Soc.
								Edit.</note> Having
							evacuated to a sufficient amount--say to the amount of half a
							hemina--we are to wipe the parts with sponges and oxycrate,
							or blow in some styptic powder, gall, fissil alum, or the
							flower of the wild pomegranate.</p>
						<pb n="461"/>
						<p>Whether the pain remain, or cease after these things, we
							must go on to the conclusion of the system of treatment;
							for the mischief is apt to return, and frequently lurks in the
							seat of the disease. Wherefore, having removed the hair
							with a razor (and this also is beneficial to the head), we are to
							burn with heated cauteries, superficially, down to the muscles;
							or if you wish to carry the burning to the bone, you must
							avoid the muscles, for the muscles when burnt occasion convulsions.
							And if you burn superficially you must foment the
							part with plenty of fragrant sweet wine, along with rose-oil;
							a linen cloth wetted with this is to be spread over the eschars
							until the third day. But, if the eschars be deep, having
							pounded the hairy leaves of leeks with salt, and spread upon
							a linen rag, we are to apply it. On the third day, we are to
							put the cerate from rose-oil upon the superficial eschars, and
							lentil with honey upon the deeper. The medicinal applications
							to be made to the wound will be described in another place.
							Some have made an incision in the skin above the forehead,
							at the coronal suture, down to the bone, and having scraped it,
							or cut out a portion down to the diploe, have afterwards
							brought the part to incarnation. Some have perforated
							the bone, even to the meningx. These are bold remedies,
							but are to be used, if, after all, the cephalæa continue,
							and the patient be courageous, and the tone of the body
							good.<note n="4">On this <hi rend="ital">heroic</hi> method of treating

							The juice of thapsia, and the medicines made with it which
							produce swelling of the skin, and an eruption resembling vari,
							are beneficial both for allaying present pain and contributing
							to eradicate the evil.</p>
						<p>The diet in both kinds of the complaint should be light;
							little drink, water for drink, especially before giving any
							medicine; complete abstinence from acrid things, such as
							onions, garlic, the juice of silphium, but not altogether from
							mustard, for its acrimony, in addition to its being stomachic,
							is not unpleasant to the head, dissolving phlegm, and exhaling
							or discharging downwards. Of pulse, the worst is the common
							bean and its species, the common peas, and the species
							called <hi rend="ital">ochrys</hi>,<note n="7">The <hi rend="ital">pisum ochrys.</hi></note> and the common
							kidney-beans; next to them
							are the lentils, which have indeed certain good properties for
							promoting digestion and secretion, but induce fulness of the
							head and occasion pain; only when boiled with pepper they
							are not to be rejected. Granulated spelt (<hi rend="ital">alica</hi>) when washed,
							is pleasant along with wine and honey, so as to sweeten, and,
							in like manner, their soups, and with plain broths. The seeds
							of carui, coriander, anise, and parsley, in the Lydian sauce<note n="8">See
								Hesychius, under <foreign lang="greek">KHRUKEI/A</foreign>
								and -- <foreign lang="greek">KH</foreign>, Athen. Deip. p. 516, Ed.
								Casaub.</note>
							are excellent. But, of these articles, the best are the herbs
							mint and penny-royal, with the fragrant things which have
							some diuretic and carminative properties. Of fleshes, all such</p>
						<pb n="463"/>
						<p>as are old are bad; of the recently killed, that of the hen is
							good; of birds, the wood pigeon, the common pigeon, and
							such others as are not very fat; the extremities of the swine;
							the roasted hare; that of the ox and of the sheep is incrassant
							and fills the head; the kid is not altogether bad. Milk and
							cheese occasion headache. Of fishes, those found among
							rocks, and those things that are best in each particular
							country. Of potherbs, such as promote the urinary and alvine
							discharges, the mallow, the blite, the beet, and asparagus; but
							the kale is also acrid. Among raw articles, the lettuce is the
							best of all. Roots are bad, even when boiled, such as radishes,
							navews, and parsnips, which are diuretic, but occasion repletion;
							the garden parsnip indeed is flatulent and swells up
							the stomach. Wine which is white, thin, and sweet, is to be
							admitted, if it have some astringency, so as not to bind the
							bowels. All articles of the dessert occasion headache, except
							dates of every species. In autumn the fig and grape are
							wholesome, and whatever other fruit is very good at any
							particular season. Repletion of all things, even of such as are
							proper, is bad; and so, also, indigestion is bad. Lassitude is
							less injurious than indigestion, but still it is hurtful. The
							morning walk after evacuation of the bowels, but so as not to
							affect the breathing nor induce weariness; and it is also very
							good after supper. Prolonged gestation, not exposed to wind
							or sun, is good for the head; but the dog-star is bad for it.
							Sexual intercourse is a self-inflicted evil to the head and
							nerves. A journey from a cold to a warmer climate, or from
							a humid to a drier, is proper; also a sea-voyage, and passing
							one's life at sea; and if one lives by the sea-side it is a good
							thing to bathe in the sea-water, to tumble on the sands, and to
							reside close by the sea.</p>
						<p>The remedies for <hi rend="ital">heterocrania</hi> are the same; for it is well to
							apply to a portion of the head the same remedies as are proper
							for the whole of it. In all cases in which the disease is not</p>
						<pb n="464"/>
						<p>removed by these means, we are to use hellebore, as being the last and most potent of all methods of treatment.</p>

						<head>CHAPTER III. CURE OF VERTIGO.</head>
						<p>V<hi rend="smallcaps">ERTIGO</hi> arises as the successor of cephalæa; but also
							springs
							up as a primary affection from certain causes, as the suppression
							of the hemorrhoidal flux; and if blood which used to flow
							from the nose has ceased to flow; or if the body has not
							perspired properly, either by sweating, or labour, when it had
							been used to labour. If then it arise as the consequence of
							cephalæa, we must do for its cure those things which have been
							described under cephalæa; and I will afterwards state certain
							other more powerful means which must be tried ultimately.
							But if the disease happen from the suppression of any of the
							humours, we must excite the customary secretion; for the
							recurrence of nature promotes recovery. If it be delayed, and
							the disease increases, in the other suppressions, those by the
							nose or sweats, we are to open the vein at the elbow; but in
							plethora of the liver, spleen, or any of the viscera in the
							middle of the body, cupping affords relief, but as much blood
							as is taken from a vein, so much is to be thus abstracted from
							them; for it is the nutriment of the exciting cause, in like
							manner as the belly. After this the remedies of the head are
							to be applied, opening the straight vein on the forehead, or
							those at the canthi on either side of the nose; a cupping-instrument
							is to be fastened to the vertex, the (<hi rend="ital">temporal?</hi>)
							arteries are to be excised, the head shaven, rubefacients applied
							to it, phlegm evacuated from the nostrils by sternutatories, or
							from the mouth as I have stated--all these things are to be</p>
						<pb n="465"/>
						<p>done in the order described under cephalæa, except that the
							juice of sow-bread or of pimpernel is to be used as an injection
							into the nose.</p>
						<p>But when you have exhausted all the remedies for cephalæa,
							the more violent means which are applicable for vertigo are
							to be used; we must use the emetics after supper, and those
							from radishes, which is also required as a preparation for the
							hellebore; for the stomach is to be trained beforehand to the
							more violent emetics. But the phlegm now becomes thinner,
							and fit for solution in the hellebore. There are several modes
							of giving the hellebore; to the stronger sort of patients it is to
							be given to the size of a <hi rend="ital">sesame</hi>,<note n="1">The <hi rend="ital">sesamum
								orientale</hi>, or oily-grain of the East. See Appendix to
								the Edinburgh Greek Lexicon.</note> or a little larger; or, in slices,
							with washed chondrus or lentil, the dose, about two drams.
							In the case of feebler and more slender persons, the decoction
							with honey, to the amount of two or three spoonfuls, is to be
							given. The manner of preparing it will be described else-where.
							In the interval between each remedy, the patient is to
							be supported, in order that he may be able to endure what is
							to be given in the intermediate periods.</p>
						<p>The patient is to be assisted during the paroxysms thus:--The
							legs are to be bound above the ankles and knees; and the
							wrists, and the arms below the shoulders at the elbows. The
							head is to be bathed with rose-oil and vinegar; but in the oil
							we must boil wild-thyme, cow-parsnip, ivy, or something such.
							Friction of the extremities and face. Smelling to vinegar,
							penny-royal, and mint, and these things with vinegar. Separation
							of the jaws, for sometimes the jaws are locked together;
							the tonsils to be tickled to provoke vomiting; for by the discharge
							of phlegm they are sometimes roused from their gloom.
							These things, then, are to be done, in order to alleviate the
							paroxysm and dispel the gloomy condition.</p>
						<pb n="466"/>
						<p>With regard to the regimen during the whole period of the
							treatment and afterwards, I hold as follows:--Much sleep is
							bad, and likewise insomnolency; for truly much sleep stupefies
							the senses of the head. From a redundance of vapours
							there is disinclination to every exertion; and these are also
							the cause of the weight in the head, the noises, and the
							flashes of light, which are the marks of the disease. Insomnolency
							induces dyspepsia, atrophy, and wearies out the body;
							the spirits flag, and the understanding is unsettled; and for
							these reasons such patients readily pass into mania and melancholy.
							Moderate sleep is suitable for the proper digestion of
							the food and refreshment from the labours of the day; care
							and perseverance in these respects; and particular attention is
							to be paid to the evacuation of the bowels, for the belly is the
							greater source of the bodily perspiration. Next, friction of
							the limbs, by means of rough towels, so as to produce rubefaction;
							then, of the back and sides; last, of the head. Afterwards,
							exercise in walking, gentle at first and in the end;
							carried to running in the middle; rest and tranquillity of the
							breathing (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) after the walking. They are to practise
							vociferation, using grave tones, for sharp occasion distension
							of the head, palpitation of the temples, pulsatory movements
							of the brain, fulness of the eyes, and noises in the ears. Sounds
							of medium intensity are beneficial to the head. Then the season
							of gestation should be regulated so as to promote the expulsion
							of the weight in the head; it should be prolonged, yet not so
							as to induce fatigue; neither should gestation be made in
							tortuous places, nor where there are frequent bendings of the
							road, for these are provocative of vertigo. But let the walks
							be straight, long, and smooth. If then the patients have been
							in the habit of taking lunch, we must only allow of a little
							bread, so as to be no impediment to the exercises; for digestion
							should take place previously. The head and the hands,
							and the frictions thereof, are to be attended to; in the latter it</p>
						<pb n="467"/>
						<p>is to be gently performed for the restoration of the heat, for
							plumpness, and strength. Then the head is to be rubbed while
							the patient stands erect below a person of higher stature than
							himself. Gymnastics skilfully performed which tend to distension
							of the neck, and strong exercise of the hands. It is proper,
							also, by raising the head, to exercise the eyes at <hi rend="ital">chironomy</hi>, or
							at throwing the quoit, or contending at boxing. The exercise
							both with the large and the small ball is bad, for the rolling of
							the head and eyes, and the intense fixing of them, occasion
							vertigo. Leaping and running are very excellent; for everything
							that is keen is beneficial to the limbs, and gives tone to
							the general system.<note n="2">For an account of most of the
								ancient exercises mentioned by
								our author, see Paulus Ægineta,
								t. i. p. 22--27, Syd. Soc. Edit.</note> The cold bath is better than no bath at
							all; no bath at all is better than the hot bath: the cold bath is
							very powerful as an astringent, incrassant, and desiccant of the
							head, which is the condition of health; while the warm bath
							is most powerful to humectate, relax, and create mistiness; for
							these are the causes of disease of the head, and such also are
							south winds, which occasion dulness of hearing. There should
							be rest after exercises, to allay the perturbation. Pinching of
							the head, even to the extent of producing excoriation of the
							skin.</p>
						<p>Whetters made of water, or of wine diluted with water,
							should be given before a meal. Lunch should be slight: laxatives
							from the capillary leaves of pot-herbs,--of mallow, of beet,
							and of blite. A condiment of a stomachic nature, which is pleasant
							to the mouth, laxative of the bowels, and not calculated to
							induce heaviness of the head, is made of thyme, or of savory,
							or of mustard. Eggs, hot in winter, and cold in summer,
							stripped of their shell, not roasted; olives, dates, pickled meat
							in season. Granulated spelt washed, with some of the sweet
							things, so as to give it a relish, is to be chosen; and, with</p>
						<pb n="468"/>
						<p>these, salts. Solitude, rest as regards hearing and speaking.
							Promenades in a well-ventilated place, rendered agreeable by
							trees or herbs. But if it be come to supper-time, they are
							again especially to take the cold bath, having been slightly
							anointed with oil; or, otherwise, the limbs only. The supper
							should be of frumentaceous articles, such as pastry, or a soup
							from chondrus (granulated spelt), or a carminative ptisan,
							rendered easy of digestion by boiling. The medicines used
							for seasoning of the ptisan, pepper, penny-royal, mint, a small
							proportion of onions or of leeks, not so much as to float on
							the stomach; the acrid part of vinegar is suitable; of fleshes,
							the parts of fat animals which are not fat; of swine, the feet
							and head; all winged animals--you must select from the great
							variety of them what is suitable; the hare and the other kinds
							of venison are proper; the hen is easily procured, and suitable.
							All articles of the dessert create headaches, except the date, or
							figs in the summer season, or the grape if the patient be free
							from flatulence; and of sweetmeats, such as are well seasoned,
							without fat, and light. Walking, exhilaration; in solitude,

						<head>CHAPTER IV. CURE OF EPILEPSY.</head>
						<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> remedies, whatever is great and most powerful is needed
							for epilepsy, so as to find an escape not only from a painful
							affection, and one dangerous at each attack, but from the disgust
							and opprobrium of this calamity. For it appears to me,
							that if the patients who endure such sufferings were to look at
							one another in the paroxysms, they would no longer submit to
							live. But the want of sensibility and of seeing conceals from</p>
						<pb n="469"/>
						<p>every one what is dreadful and disgusting in his own case. It
							is best that the method of cure should follow the alleviation of
							nature, when, with the changes of age, she changes greatly
							the man. For if the diet akin to the ailment, and on which
							the disease subsisted, be changed, the disease no longer seizes
							the man, but takes its departure along with that in which it
							delighted.<note n="1">See Hippocrat. Aph. ii. 45.</note></p>
						<p>If, then, it seize on the head, it settles there; to it, therefore,
							we are to do those things which have been described by
							me under cephalæa, regarding the abstraction of blood (and
							also the purgings) from the veins at the elbow, the straight
							vein at the forehead, and by cupping; but the abstraction is
							not to be carried the length of deliquium animi; for deliquium
							has a tendency to induce the disease; we are to open
							all the ordinary arteries before and behind the ears, and we are
							also to practise purgings, which are more potent than all these
							things, by the purgative <hi rend="ital">hiera</hi> and those medicines which
							draw off phlegm from the head; but the medicines should be
							particularly powerful, for the habit of such persons renders
							them tolerant of pains, and their goodness of spirits and good
							hopes render them strong in endurance. It is necessary, also,
							to apply heat to the head, for it is effectual. In the first
							place, we must perforate the bone as far as the diploe, and
							then use cerates and cataplasms until the meninx separate
							from the bone. The exposed bones are to be perforated with
							the trepan if still any small portion prevent its spontaneous
							removal, when the meninx there is found black and thickened;
							and when, having gone through the process of putrefaction
							and cleansing under the bold treatment of the physician,
							the wound comes to complete cicatrization, the patients escape
							from the disease. In all cases we are to use rubefacient applications
							to the head; namely, the common ones, as described by</p>
						<pb n="470"/>
						<p>me formerly; and a still more powerful one is that from cantharides,
							but for three days before using it the patient must
							drink milk as a protection of the bladder, for cantharides are
							very injurious to the bladder. These are the remedies when
							the head is the part affected.</p>
						<p>But if the cause be seated in the middle parts, and if these
							induce the disease (this, however, very rarely happens, for, as
							in a mighty ailment, the middle parts of the body rather sympathise
							with the head, which is the origin of the disease), but
							however it may be, we must open the vein at the elbow in
							these cases also; for the flow by it is from the viscera. But
							such patients, more than the others, are to be purged with the
							<hi rend="ital">hiera, cneoron</hi>,<note n="2">The rock-rose, or <hi rend="ital">Daphne cneorum</hi>,
								L.</note> and the <hi rend="ital">granum cnidium</hi>,<note n="3">Seed of the <hi rend="ital">Daphne
									cnidium.</hi>
									See Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 179.</note> for these are phlegmagogues.
							But the most suitable remedy in these cases is
							cupping. Of epithemes and cataplasms the components are
							well known, and it would be superfluous to describe them on
							all occasions, except in so far as to know the powers of them;
							namely, that by such means we must attenuate, promote exhalation,
							and render the secretions and perspirations healthy.
							We are also to use digestive, heating, desiccant, and diuretic
							articles, both in food and in medicine. But the best of all
							things is castor, taken frequently during the month in honeyed-water,
							and the compound medicines which possess the same
							powers, as the compound medicine from vipers, and the still
							more complex one of Mithridates, and also that of Vestinus;
							for these things promote digestion, form healthy juices, and
							are diuretic; for whatever simple medicines you could describe
							are contained in these powerful compositions -- cinnamon.
							cassia, the leaves of melabathrum, pepper, and all the varieties
							of seseli; and which of the most potent medicines will you not
							find in them? It is told, that the brain of a vulture, and the
							heart of a raw cormorant, and the domestic weasel, when</p>
						<pb n="471"/>
						<p>eaten, remove the disease; but I have never tried these things.
							However, I have seen persons holding a cup below the wound
							of a man recently slaughtered, and drinking a draught of the
							blood! O the present, the mighty necessity, which compels
							one to remedy the evil by such a wicked abomination! And
							whether even they recovered by this means no one could tell
							me for certain. There is another story of the liver of a man
							having been eaten. However, I leave these things to be
							described by those who would bear to try such means.</p>
						<p>It is necessary to regulate the diet, in respect to everything
							that is to be done either by others or by the patient himself.
							Now nothing must be omitted, nor anything unnecessarily
							done; and more especially we must administer everything
							which will do the slightest good, or even that will do no
							harm; for many unseemly sights, sounds, and tastes, and multitudes
							of smells, are tests of the disease. Everything, therefore,
							is to be particularly attended to. Much sleep induces
							fatness, torpor, and mistiness of the senses, but moderate sleep
							is good. An evacuation of the bowels, especially of flatulence
							and phlegm, is very good after sleep. Promenades long, straight,
							without tortuosities, in a well ventilated place, under trees of
							myrtle and laurel, or among acrid and fragrant herbs, such as
							calamint, penny-royal, thyme, and mint; so much the better
							if wild and indigenous, but if not, among cultivated; in
							these places, prolonged gestation, which also should be
							straight. It is a good thing to take journeys, but not by a
							river side, so that he may not gaze upon the stream (for the
							current of a river occasions vertigo), nor where he may see
							anything turned round, such as a rolling-top, for he is too weak
							to preserve the animal spirits (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) steady, which are,
							therefore, whirled about in a circle, and this circular motion is
							provocative of vertigo and of epilepsy. After the gestation,
							a gentle walk, then rest so as to induce tranquillity of the
							agitation created by the gestation. After these, the exercises</p>
						<pb n="472"/>
						<p>of the arms, their extremities being rubbed with a towel
							made of raw flax. Not much oil to be used in the inunction.
							The friction to be protracted, and harder than usual for condensation,
							since most of them are bloated and fat: the head
							to be rubbed in the middle of the process, while the patient
							stands erect. The exercises of the neck and shoulders,
							<hi rend="ital">chironomy</hi>, and the others mentioned by me under the
							treatment of Vertigo, with sufficient fulness of detail; only
							the exercises should be sharper, so as to induce sweat and
							heat, for all these attenuate. During the whole of his life he
							should cultivate a keen temper without irascibility.</p>
						<p>All kinds of food derived from gross pulse are bad; but we
							are to give frumentaceous things, the drier sorts of bread,
							washed alica, and the drinks prepared from them. The
							medicines added for relish the same as before; but there
							should be more of acrid things, such as pepper, ginger, and
							lovage. Sauces of vinegar and cumin are both pleasant and useful.
							From fleshes in particular the patient is to be entirely restricted,
							or at least during the cure; for the restoration, those things
							are to be allowed which are naturally light, such as all sorts of
							winged animals, with the exception of the duck, and such as
							are light in digestion, such as hares, swines' feet, and pickled
							fish, after which thirst is good. A white, thin, fragrant, and
							diuretic wine is to be drunk in small quantity. Of boiled
							pot-herbs, such as are possessed of acrid powers, attenuate and
							prove diuretic, as the cabbage, asparagus, and nettle; of raw,
							the lettuce in the season of summer. The cucumber and ripe
							melon are unsuitable to a strong man; but certain persons may
							have just a tasting of them. But being of a cold and humid
							nature, much of them is bad. The seasonable use may be
							granted of the green fig and the grape. Promenades; after
							these, recreation to dispel grief.</p>
						<p>Passion is bad, as also sexual enjoyment; for the act itself
							bears the symptoms of the disease. Certain physicians have</p>
						<pb n="473"/>
						<p>fallen into a mistake respecting coition; for seeing that the
							physical change to manhood produces a beneficial effect, they
							have done violence to the nature of children by unseasonable
							coition, as if thus to bring them sooner to manhood. Such
							persons are ignorant of the spontaneous law of nature by
							which all cures are accomplished; for along with every age
							she produces that which is proper for it in due seasons. At a
							given time there is the maturity of semen, of the beard, of
							hoary hairs; for on the one hand what physician could alter
							Nature's original change in regard to the semen, and, on the
							other, the appointed time for each? But they also offend
							against the nature of the disease; for being previously injured
							by the unseasonableness of the act, they are not possessed of
							seasonable powers at the proper commencement of the age
							for coition.</p>
						<p>The patients ought to reside in hot and dry places, for the
							disease is of a cold and humid nature.</p>

					<div3 type="chapter" n="5">
						<head>CHAPTER V. CURE OF MELANCHOLY.</head>
						<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> cases of melancholy, there is need of consideration in
							regard to the abstraction of blood, from which the disease
							arises, but it also springs from cacochymy in no small amount
							thereof. When, therefore, the disease seizes a person in early
							life, and during the season of spring we are to open the
							median vein at the right elbow, so that there may be a
							seasonable flow from the liver; for this viscus is the fountain
							of the blood, and the source of the formation of the bile,
							both which are the pabulum of melancholy. We must open
							a vein even if the patients be spare and have deficient blood,
							but abstract little, so that the strength may feel the evacuation</p>
						<pb n="474"/>
						<p>but may not be shaken thereby; for even though the blood
							be thick, bilious, coagulated, and black as the lees of oil,
							yet still it is the seat and the pabulum of Nature. If, then,
							you abstract more than enough, Nature, by the loss of nourishment,
							is ejected from her seat. But if the patient has much
							blood, for the most part in such cases it is not much vitiated,
							but still we must open a vein, and not abstract all the blood
							required the same day, but after an interval, or, if the whole
							is taken the same day, the strength will indicate the amount.
							During the interval, the patient is to be allowed a fuller diet
							than usual, in order to prepare him for enduring the evacuation;
							for we must assist the stomach, it being in a state of
							disease, and distress from the black bile lodging there. Wherefore,
							having kept the patient on a restricted diet for one day
							previously, we must give black hellebore to the amount of
							two drams with honeyed-water, for it evacuates black bile.
							And likewise the capillary leaves of Attic thyme, for it also
							evacuates black bile. But it is best to mix them together, and
							give a part of each, to the amount of two drams altogether.
							After the purging we are to administer the bath, and give a little
							wine and any other seasoner in the food; for purging fatigues
							the powers of the stomach. We are, then, to come down to
							the middle parts, and having first relaxed by cataplasms and
							bathing, we are to apply a cupping-instrument over the liver
							and stomach, or the mouth of it; for this evacuation is
							much more seasonable than venesection. We are also to apply
							it to the back between the scapulæ, for to this place the
							stomach is adjacent. Then again we are to recruit; and if
							the strength be restored by the regimen, we are to shave the
							head, and afterwards apply the cupping-instrument to it, for
							the primary and greatest cause of the disease is in the nerves.
							But neither are the senses free from injury, for hence are
							their departure and commencement. Wherefore these also
							are changed, by participating in the affection. Some, likewise,</p>
						<pb n="475"/>
						<p>from alienation of the senses have perverted feelings. It
							is necessary, then, especially to cure the stomach as being
							disordered of itself, and from black bile being lodged in it.
							Wherefore we must give to drink continuously of the juice of
							wormwood from a small amount to a cupful (<hi rend="ital">cyathus</hi>), for it
							prevents the formation of bile. Aloe also is a good thing, for
							it brings down the bile into the lower gut. If, then, the
							disease be of recent origin, and the patient be not much
							changed, he will require no other treatment in these circumstances.
							There is a necessity, however, for the remaining
							part of the regimen to the restoration of the habits, and the
							complete purification of the affection, and the strengthening of
							the powers, so that the diseases may not relapse. I will explain
							afterwards the course of life during convalescence.</p>
						<p>But if the disease, having yielded a little to these means,
							should be seen relapsing, there will be need of greater
							remedies. Let there, then, be no procrastination of time, but
							if the disease appear after suppression of the catamenial discharge
							in women, or the hemorrhoidal flux in men, we must
							stimulate the parts to throw off their accustomed evacuation.
							But if it is delayed and does not come, the blood having
							taken another direction, and if the disease progress rapidly,
							we must make evacuations, beginning from the ankles. And
							if you cannot get away from this place so much blood as you
							require, you must also open the vein at the elbow. And
							after pursuing the restorative process for three or four days,
							we are to give the purgative medicine, the hiera. Then we
							are to apply the cupping-instrument to the middle parts of
							the body, bringing it near to the liver, and do those things
							which speedily prove effectual; for melancholy does not yield
							to small remedies, and, if long continued, it remains fixed in
							a spot. And if the disease lodge in all parts of the
							body,--in the senses, the understanding, the blood, and the
							bile,--and if it seize on the nerves, and turn to an incurable</p>
						<pb n="476"/>
						<p>condition, it engenders in the system a progeny of other
							diseases,--spasms, mania, paralysis. And if they arise from
							melancholy, the newly-formed diseases are incurable. Wherefore
							we are to use hellebore for the cure of the ailment.
							But before the administration of the hellebore, we must train
							the stomach to vomiting, attenuate the humours, and render
							the whole system freely perspirable; emetics will accomplish
							these things sometimes those which are given with an
							empty stomach, and sometimes those which consist of radishes.
							I will describe the mode and materials of it; and I will also
							describe the species of hellebore and the modes of using it;
							and how we ought to judge of everything beforehand, and
							how to render assistance during the operation of the emetics.
							It cannot be doubted that by these means the disease has

							would thus be superior to a god; but the physician can produce
							respite from pain, intervals in diseases, and render them
							latent. In such cases, the physician can either decline and

							of the disease, or continue to the last to render his services.
							The hiera from aloe is to be given again and again; for this
							is the important medicine in melancholy, being the remedy
							for the stomach, the liver, and the purging of bile. But experience
							has proved, that the seed of mallow, to the amount of
							a dram, when taken in a drink with water answers excellently.

							For the strength of nature produces health, but her

							of restoration by frequenting the natural hot baths; for the
							medicinal substances in them are beneficial, such as bitumen,
							or sulphur, or alum, and many others besides these which are
							possessed of remedial powers. For, after the parching heat of
							the disease, and the annoyance of the treatment, dilution is a
							good thing. Moreover, rare and soft flesh most readily throws

						<p>. . . in the liver the ulcer may be dangerous. But the most
							troublesome is a defluxion of pus on the stomach, when it
							makes the stomach its route in the course of being distributed
							upwards. For the food is the cause of life, but the stomach is</p>
						<pb n="480"/>
						<p>the leader in the process of nutrition, and it also sometimes
							conveys medicines to the internal parts. If, then, in addition
							to all the other evils, a difficulty of deglutition come on, the
							patient must speedily die of disease and famine. But the indications
							by which it is discovered in what direction the pus
							will be diverted are diversified. If it pass by the intestines,
							there are tormina, watery discharges from the bowels, phlegm,
							and bile; then clots of blood floating in a fluid, or a thin
							discharge like the washings of raw flesh. But, if it pass
							by the bladder, there is a weight in the kidneys and loins;
							at first, therefore, the evacuations are copious, and tinged with
							bile; then turbid, which do not deposit their sediment, nor
							get settled. In all cases the sediment should become white.
							But if it be determined upwards to the stomach, nausea, loss
							of appetite, vomitings of phlegm or of bile, deliquium, and
							vertigo supervene, until it burst.</p>
						<p>This, then, is to be especially avoided, as being a bad
							course. But if the defluxion of pus be more violent, we
							must take every means, assisting the stomach by food, and
							medicines, and regimen, all in a mild way. We must administer
							the medicines for bursting the abscess; give to
							drink of the herb hyssop with honeyed-water, and the juice
							of the hair of horehound, and this with honeyed-water and
							the juice of the wormwood. These things must be given
							before food to dilute the fluids, to lubricate the parts, and
							facilitate the rupture of the abscesses. We are also to give
							the milk of an ass, which is soft, not bilious, nutritious, does
							not admit of being made into cheese, which is the perfection of
							milk. We should gratify the patient in regard to food and
							drink. And we are even to give things inferior to other more
							beneficial articles (for we thereby afford a passage to the fluid
							which occasions nausea and loathing of food, and many are
							hurt by the transit of the pus), lest they should come to loathe
							their food. And if they should take anything, they readily</p>
						<pb n="481"/>
						<p>vomit. It is necessary, also, in the other defluxions, to have
							especial care of the stomach, for it is the passage to all sorts of
							medicine. It is necessary to keep in mind the liver, which is
							the root of the ulcerations.<note n="1">See the note on the text. The
								sense would be evidently much
								improved by reading "blood-vessels"
								in place of "ulcerations."</note> But if the defluxion be to the
							bladder, we are to promote it by diuretics, as the root of

							things are to be given to drink in honeyed-water. The compound
							medicine of Vestinus is also very good, and that from

							But if you determine to draw off the discharge by the
							bowels, you can do this with milk, especially that of the ass, or
							otherwise of the goat or sheep. Give, also, juices of a lubricating
							nature and detergent, as the juice of ptisan; condiments,

						<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> affection of diabetes is a species of dropsy, both in cause
							and in condition, differing only in the place by which the
							humour runs. For, indeed, in ascites the receptacle is the
							peritonæum, and it has no outlet, but remains there and accumulates.
							But in diabetes, the flow of the humour from the
							affected part and the melting are the same, but the defluxion
							is determined to the kidneys and bladder; and in dropsical
							cases this is the outlet when the disease takes a favourable
							turn; and it is good when it proves a solution of the cause,
							and not merely a lightening of the burden. In the latter
							disease the thirst is greater; for the fluid running off dries
							the body.</p>
						<pb n="486"/>
						<p>But the remedies for the stoppage of the melting are
							the same as those for dropsy. For the thirst there is need
							of a powerful remedy, for in kind it is the greatest of
							all sufferings; and when a fluid is drunk, it stimulates the
							discharge of urine; and sometimes as it flows off it melts and
							carries away with it the particles of the body. Medicines,
							then, which cure thirst are required, for the thirst is great with
							an insatiable desire of drink, so that no amount of fluid would
							be sufficient to cure the thirst. We must, therefore, by all
							means strengthen the stomach, which is the fountain of the
							thirst. When, therefore, you have purged with the hiera, use
							as epithemes the nard, mastich, dates, and raw quinces; the
							juice of these with nard and rose-oil is very good for lotions;
							their pulp, with mastich and dates, form a cataplasm. And the
							mixture of these with wax and the nard ointment is good;
							or the juice of acacia and of hypocistis, both for lotions and
							cataplasms.</p>
						<p>But the water used as drink is to be boiled with autumn
							fruit. The food is to be milk, and with it the cereals, starch,
							groats of spelt (<hi rend="ital">alica</hi>), gruels. Astringent wines to give tone
							to the stomach, and these but little diluted, in order to dissipate
							and clear away the other humours; for thirst is engendered
							by saltish things. But wine, which is at the same
							time astringent and cooling, proves beneficial by inducing a
							change and good temperament; for to impart strength, sweet
							wine is like blood, which also it forms. The compound
							medicines are the same, as that from vipers, the Mithridate,
							that from autumn fruit, and the others which are useful in
							dropsy. But the whole regimen and course of life is the
							same.</p>

						<p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HATEVER</hi> relates to inflammation, hemorrhage, and such
							other affections about the kidneys as quickly prove fatal, has
							been treated of under the Acute Diseases. But regarding
							ulceration thereof, and the formation of stones, and the many
							other affections which accompany old persons until death, I
							am now especially to treat, mostly in order to effect their cure;
							but, if not, to show how they may be alleviated.</p>
						<p>Wherefore, then, it is impossible to eradicate the disposition
							to form stones. It were easier to render the uterus
							unfruitful, than to destroy the tendency to engender stones
							in kidneys wherein it is already formed. We must strive,
							then, to facilitate the passage of them. If, therefore,
							the calculi be fixed in a place, I will tell what the
							remedies are which facilitate their passage; for they are
							attended with great pain, and sometimes patients die with
							tormina, volvulus of the colon, and retention of urine; for
							the kidneys and colon are adjacent to one another. Wherefore
							if there be a stoppage of the stones, and, along with it,
							retention of urine and tormina, we are to open the vein at the
							ankle, on the same side as the kidney affected; for the flow of
							blood from the kidneys relieves the constriction of the calculi,
							for inflammation detains them by binding all the parts; and
							an evacuation of the vessels produces resolution of the inflammation.
							We are also to bathe the loins where the region
							of the kidneys is placed. Let the oil which is used either be
							old, or if recent, let rue be boiled in it. The hair of dill is
							also diuretic, and rosemary, and marjoram. With these you are
							to bathe the parts as if with plain water; for mere inunction
							is a small affair. But you are also to foment with these things,</p>
						<pb n="488"/>
						<p>by means of the bladders of cattle filled with the oil of
							camomile. The materials of the cataplasms along with meal
							are to be the same. Dry-cupping also has sometimes removed
							the stoppage of the stones; but in the case of inflammation, it
							is best to have recourse to scarifications. If, when you have
							done these things, the calculi still remain fixed, you must
							place the patient in a bath of oil: for this at once fulfils every
							indication, it relaxes by its heat, in so far lubricates; while
							its acrimony stimulates to a desire of making water. These
							are the means which contribute to the expulsion of calculi.
							The patient is to take drinks prepared from the roots of certain
							simple medicines, as valerian, spignel, and asarabacca;
							and herbs, the <hi rend="ital">prionitis</hi>, parsley, and water-parsnip: and of
							compounds such ointments as contain nard, cassia, myrrh,
							cinnamon * * * * * *
							* * * for the cicatrization mustard, and eschars
							produced by fire, and epithemes as formerly described by me.

							forefathers, the disease sticks to him until death. But for the
							paroxysms in the joints, we are to do this: let unscoured
							wool from the sheep be applied; bathe with rose-oil and wine;
							and in certain case sponging with oxycrate has done good.
							Then as a cataplasm, bread with the cooling parts of gourd
							and pompion, and simple cucumber, and the herb plantain

							And, moreover, there is a danger in living or associating with
							it no less than with the plague, for the infection is thereby
							communicated by the respiration. Wherefore what sufficient
							remedy for it shall we find in medicine? But yet it is proper
							to apply every medicine and method of diet, -- even iron
							and fire, -- and these, indeed, if you apply to a recent
							disease there is hope of a cure. But if fully developed,
							and if it has firmly established itself in the inward parts, and,
							moreover, has attacked the face, the patient is in a hopeless
							condition.</p>
						<p>Wherefore we are to open the veins at the elbow, and on
							both sides; and also those at the ankles, but not the same
							day, for an interval is better both in order to procure a greater
							flow of blood, and for the resuscitation of the strength; for it
							is necessary to evacuate the blood frequently and copiously, as
							being the nutriment of the disease, but the good portion of it
							which is the natural nourishment is small. Wherefore while
							abstracting the vitiated portion, consisting of melted matters,
							we must form an estimate of the suitable part mixed up with
							it, until the disease has given way from want of pabulum;
							for the new part being incorporated with the body, in the
							course of a long time, obliterates the old. Then we are to</p>
						<pb n="495"/>
						<p>give the hiera in a potion not once only, but let everything
							be done several times after recovery and recurrence. And let
							the other medicinal purgation by the food be practised; and
							let the treatment be that which I have described under
							Ischiatic disease, and let the patient drink undivided milk--and
							that in great quantity--for opening the bowels. Let it
							receive the fifth part of water, so that the whole of the milk
							may pass through. They are quickly to be treated with
							emetics, at first those given when fasting, next, those after
							food, then those by radishes. Let all things be done frequently
							and continuously; administering the hellebore at all seasons,
							but especially in spring and autumn, giving it every alternate
							day, and again next year. And if the disease has acquired
							strength, we must give whatever liquid medicines any one has
							had experience of; for it is a good thing to administer medicines
							frequently as a remedy. And I will now describe those
							with which I am acquainted. Mix one cyathus of cedria<note n="1">Probably
								<hi rend="ital">gum vernix.</hi> See
								Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 452.</note>
							and two of brassica, and give. Another: Of the juice of
							sideritis,<note n="2">Probably the <hi rend="ital">sideritis scordioides
								L.</hi> See Appendix to Dunbar's
								Lexicon <hi rend="ital">in voce.</hi></note> of trefoil one cyathus, of wine and honey two
							cyathi. Another: Of the shavings of an elephant's tooth
							one dram with wine, to the amount of two cyathi. But likewise
							the flesh of the wild reptiles, the vipers, formed into
							pastils,<note n="3">Or Troches. See Paulus Ægineta
								t. iii. p. 535.</note> are taken in a draught. From their heads and tail
							we must cut off to the extent of four fingers' breadth, and
							boil the remainder to the separation of the back-bones; and
							having formed the flesh into pastils, they are to be cooled in
							the shade; and these are to be given in a draught in like
							manner as the squill. The vipers, too, are to be used as a
							seasoner of food at supper, and are to be prepared as fishes.
							But if the compound medicine from vipers be at hand, it is to</p>
						<pb n="496"/>
						<p>be drunk in preference to all others, for it contains together
							the virtues of all the others, so to cleanse the body and
							smooth down its asperities. There are many other medicines
							. . . . . . of the Celts, which are men called Gauls, those
							alkaline substances made into balls, with which they cleanse
							their clothes, called soap, with which it is a very excellent
							thing to cleanse the body in the bath. And purslain and
							houseleek with vinegar, and also the decoction of the roots of
							dock with the sulphur vivum proves an excellent detergent.

							rubbed in. For the callous protuberances of the face, we
							are to rub in the ashes of vine branches, mixed up with the
							suet of some wild animal, as the lion, the panther, the bear;
							or if these are not at hand, of the barnacle goose;<note n="5">See Appendix to

								observations of Petit.</note> for like in
							the unlike, as the ape to man, is most excellent. Also the
							ammoniac perfume with vinegar and the juice of plantain, or
							of knot-grass, and hypocistis and lycium.<note n="6">An electuary from the

							the evacuation of the humours. But if you wish to soothe
							the parts excoriated by the acrid defluxions, the decoction of
							fenugreek, or the juice of ptisan, will form an excellent detergent
							application; also the oil of roses or of lentisk. Continued</p>

							all
							these with well-regulated intensity, but not so as to induce
							lassitude. Let vociferation also be produced, as being a seasonable
							exercise of the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>). The clothing should
							be clean, not only to gratify the sight, but because filthy things
							irritate the skin. While fasting, the patients are to drink the
							wine of wormwood. Barley-bread is a very excellent thing,
							and a sausage in due season, and a little of mallows or cabbage
							half-boiled, with soup of cumin. For supper, the root of
							parsnip and granulated spelt (<hi rend="ital">alica</hi>), with wine and old honey
							adapted for the mixing; and such marine articles as loosen the
							bowels--the soups of limpets, oysters, sea-urchins, and such
							fishes as inhabit rocky places. And of land animals, such as
							are wild, as the hare and the boar. Of winged animals, all
							sorts of partridges, wood-pigeons, domestic-pigeons, and the
							best which every district produces. Of fruits, those of summer;
							sweet wines are preferable to such as are strong. The
							natural hot-baths of a sulphureous nature, a protracted residence
							in the waters, and a sea-voyage.</p>
						<p><hi rend="ital">Courses of Hellebore:</hi>--White hellebore is purgative of the

							can accomplish--nor from the retching and violence attending
							the vomitings, for in this respect sea-sickness is preferable;
							but from a power and quality of no mean description, by
