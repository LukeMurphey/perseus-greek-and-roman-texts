						<div2 type="section" n="1"><head>The Political Condition of Italy in the First Century B.C.</head>
							
							<p>The Roman state was in form and name a commonwealth or republic. While Rome was a small agricultural community and her citizens a body of patriotic, sturdy, and independent freeholders, the task of government was easy and the constitution well adapted to its purpose. The wars that followed for the establishment and extension of her power at first fostered unity and soundness of national life. But in course of time Rome became an imperial state and took upon herself the guardianship of every country in the world. Wealth flowed into her coffers from every quarter of the earth, her citizens became corrupt, and the rule of the people became the rule of a rich landed aristocracy, whose principal ambition was to perpetuate its mischievous power. The organ of this aristocracy was the senate, a body of six or seven hundred men, who became members of it nominally by virtue of holding certain high offices, and who remained senators for life. In theory, therefore, the senate was elective, and rested on the popular will; but the members really became such on account of
								noble blood, wealth, or political, social, or other influence. Moreover, the great offices of the state came to be bought and sold openly and without shame, and opposing factions contended not with ballots alone, but with iron and <pb n="xiv"/>steel, so that the election place was frequently stained with the blood of the slain. It became increasingly difficult for one not possessing and willing to use such means to be elected to any office.
							</p>
							<p>Opposed to the landed aristocracy was a class of wealthy capitalists known as <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign>, the "Equestrian Order." Many of these were as rich as the senators, but their wealth &mdash; most of it gained by usury, state contracts, slave-dealing, and tax-gathering &mdash; consisted of money instead of land. They took no active interest in politics excepting so far as they could influence legislation to their advantage by lobbying and bribing.
							</p>
							<p>There was no industrious middle class among the free citizens of Rome. Manufacture on a large scale, as a means of wealth, was absolutely unknown; while all mechanical industries were carried on by slaves. The poorer class of citizens, the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign>, were wholly influenced in their votes by their wealthy patrons or by scheming demagogues. The freedmen were the only class who could become rich by industry.
							</p>
							<p>The rural portions of Italy were for the most part held in large plantations (<foreign lang="la">latifundia</foreign>), owned by nobles and cultivated by slaves, or, more frequently, occupied by great droves of cattle. This plantation system had crowded out the free peasant proprietors in almost all parts of the peninsula. After throwing up their farms, which foreign competition had made unprofitable, they flocked to Rome to swell the idle mob that lived on what their votes would bring. There still remained, especially in Northern Italy, a considerable body of small land owners; and the municipal towns (<foreign lang="la">municipia</foreign>), about four hundred in number, whose territories comprised, politically speaking, the whole area of Italy, were still the home of a fairly prosperous middle class. These had all received Roman citizenship after the social war (<date value="-90">B. C. 90</date>) and might, by their substantial character and intelligence, have served as a strong opposition to the corrupt aristocracy at Rome; but they lacked organization and leadership, and when they went to Rome to vote, they were wholly powerless against the turbulent political clubs of the metropolis, whose violence was a regular feature of all public proceedings. Yet in this class alone was the oldRoman virtue to be found, and in it lay whatever hope there was to redeem the state.
							</p>
							<p>
								<pb n="xv"/>Another menace to the government was in the constitution of the armies. After a man had been consul, he was given charge of a province and was put in command of several legions. While abroad he was not amenable to the government at home, and when he returned he used his old soldiers to further his political schemes, and rewarded them at the expense of the opposing faction, often by wholesale spoliation and murder.
							</p>
							<p>Partisans of the nobility were known as <foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign>; those opposed to them as <foreign lang="la">Populares</foreign>.  Before Caesar, the most conspicuous leader of the former had been Sulla, of the latter, Marius, Caesar's uncle by marriage. These two men by their thirst for power and mutual hatred filled all Italy with bloodshed and terror for years. Under the established <foreign lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</foreign> there was no continuity in government, but a perpetual see-saw between rivals. Rome was kept in a constant electioneering excitement accompanied by the worst forms of demoralization. All the vast interests of the Roman world were sacrificed to the luxury and ambition of a governing class wholly incompetent for its task; and the only resource against anarchy appears to have been that some one man, by craft or by force, should get all the reins of power into his single hand. That man was destined to be Julius Caesar.
								
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>Caesar's Earlier Career.</head>
							<epigraph><cit><quote><l>Better be first, he said, in a little Iberian village,</l>
								<l>Than be second in Rome.</l></quote>

							<p>Caius Julius Caesar (<name>Gaius Iulius Caesar</name>) was born July 12th, <date value="-100">B. C. 100</date>, or, according to some authorities, two years earlier. Assuming the later date, he was six years younger than Pompey, his great rival, and Cicero, the distinguished orator. His ancestry was of the noblest, and was supposed to reach back on his mother's side to Ancus Marcius, the Roman king, and on the father's to Aeneas, the founder of the Roman nation and reputed to be the son of a goddess.
							</p>
							<p>The time of his birth was during the great ascendancy of the <foreign lang="la">Populares</foreign> under Marius, his uncle; and his childhood was passed amid the horrors of the proscriptions that marked Marius's dictatorship. Though Caesar was connected by blood with the oldest and <pb n="xvi"/>proudest houses of Rome, he early showed his predilection for the party of the people; and the sturdy Marius, with all his defects, doubtless exercised a marked influence over the life and destinies of his young nephew. Caesar lost his father early in life, so that most of the responsibility for his education and bringing up rested upon his mother, Aurelia. She was a typical matron of the old school, managing her house with simplicity and frugality, and holding to the traditions and virtues of the ancient Romans. Tacitus, the Roman historian, couples her name with that of Cornelia, the famous mother of the Gracchi. Caesar owed much of his future greatness to her influence, and his love and reverence for her are highly honorable to both.
							</p>
							<p>In the year <date value="-86">86</date>, when Caesar was still a boy, he was appointed a priest of Jupiter. This office was a perfunctory one and had little real religious significance. In <date value="-83">83</date> he married Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna, an act which identified him thus early with the <foreign lang="la">Populares</foreign>; for Cinna was a very prominent leader of that party. It was soon after this that Sulla, the leader of the<foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign>, returned from Asia Minor with a victorious army, prepared to take a terrible revenge for the proscription of Marius. Caesar soon fell under his displeasure because of his relationship to Marius. He was ordered to divorce his young wife because she was Cinna's daughter. In this crisis Caesar showed a prominent trait of his character, a trait which led him during all his life to brave every danger rather than allow himself to be controlled. Though but a youth, he refused to obey Sulla's command. A price was set on his head and he was obliged to flee for his life. Often he was in great peril, and once he was taken, and escaped only by bribing his captor. His friends interceded for him, pleading his youth, and finally obtained hispardon, Sulla saying, " Take him, since you will have it so; but I would have you know that the youth for whom you are so earnest, will one day overthrow the aristocracy. I see in him many Mariuses."
							</p>
							<p>Caesar thinking it safer to leave Italy for a time went to Asia Minor, where he gained some military experience and distinguished himself for valor by saving a comrade's life. Sulla died in <date value="-78">78</date> and Caesar returned to his family and resumed his studies. He was a diligent and thorough student and doubtless followed the usual course <pb n="xvii"/>of Greek, rhetoric, grammar, philosophy, and oratory. To be a good speaker was essential to political success, and Caesar was especially anxious to excel in that direction. He gave some public exhibitions of his skill and won much applause; but anxious to perfect himself still farther he went to Rhodes in <date value="-76">76</date>, to study under Apollonius Molon, the most famous teacher of oratory and rhetoric of the day. On this journey, when near Miletus, he was captured by pirates and held for a heavy ransom. He spent some time among them while waiting for the money, arid joined in their sports and games with the greatest freedom, at the same time assuring them that he would hang them all as soon as he was free. They seem to have regarded him with mingled awe and admiration. The ransom was paid. Caesar was released, went at once to Miletus, where he hastily collected a few ships and made a descent on the pirates before they dreamt of danger. He recovered the ransom money and punished the pirates as he had threatened.
							</p>
							<p>On his return to Rome, he began his political career (<date value="-68">B. C. 68</date>) by serving as quaestor, an office connected with the public treasury and the first step toward the consulship. This was followed in 65 by the aedileship. The taking of this office, which was one of the chief magistracies, though it involved only the care of the public buildings and the oversight of the great festivals and games, was considered a direct bid for a future consulship, and a man's claims upon that higher office were determined in large measure by the lavishness and splendor of his aedileship. Caesar was poor, but with characteristic boldness he played for the highest political stakes and did not hesitate to incur enormous debts, in fact so enormous that those who had not the most perfect confidence in his capacity and his powers believed him irretrievably ruined. His aedileship surpassed all before it in magnificence; but he left it &mdash; as he remarked with grim humor &mdash; worth more than a million dollars less than nothing.
							</p>
							<p>After his aedileship he identified himself more and more with the popular faction, and even dared to restore some of the statues and trophies of Marius, which had been banished from sight seventeen years before by the order of Sulla. The people began to hope for a successful revival of the Marian party and to look to Caesar as its leader.
							</p>
							<p><pb n="xviii"/>In <date value="-63">B. C. 63</date> he was elected <foreign lang="la">pontifex maximus</foreign> against the strong opposition of the <foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign>. This office was one of great political power and dignity, though not formally a civil office. Caesar held it for the rest of his life. In 62 he was elected praetor, an office of a judicial character, and this was followed by a year of command in Spain as propraetor. Before leaving for Spain, his creditors became insistent and threatened to detain him unless he paid them. Caesar then obtained a large loan from the richest man in Rome, Crassus, who was ambitious for office and doubtless hoped to make good use in turn of Caesar's brilliant abilities to further his own ends.
							</p>
							<p>In Spain Caesar gained valuable military experience and made his administration so profitable to himself, as was usual with provincial governors, that, though he left Rome owing millions of sesterces, he returned in the year 60 with enough money to pay all his debts. His design was to run for the consulship, the highest office in the gift of the people. To secure his election he effected a union of interests between himself and Crassus and Pompey. These were the two most powerful men in Rome, &mdash; Crassus because of his wealth, Pompey because of his fame as a general and his popularity with the army. The latter was, in fact, really the first man in the state. He had but recently returned from Asia Minor laden with the spoils of the Mithridatic war, and might easily have seized the dictatorship had he so chosen; but he disbanded his army and preferred to appear as a private citizen, but with almost autocratic power. He had quarreled with Crassus, but Caesar reconciled them, and the three formed a sort of offensive and defensive alliance known as the first triumvirate &mdash; what we should call a political deal. This was for Caesar, who was at that time quite their inferior in fame and influence, a master stroke of craft and diplomacy.
							</p>
							<p>In 59 Caesar was elected consul almost without opposition. He well understood the critical condition of affairs and saw clearly the dangers that threatened the state, and instituted valuable reforms looking to its regeneration and salvation. The army and the moneyed classes represented by Pompey and Crassus were with him, and he could do almost as he pleased. His first act was the passage of an agrarian law, by which thousands of acres were to be distributed to the poor. This was not a mere act of bribery, but an attempt to <pb n="xix"/>restore the peasant freeholders, who had been dispossessed by the rich. Then he passed the excellent body of laws known as the <foreign lang="la">Leges Juliae</foreign>, which mark an epoch in Roman jurisprudence, and which were devised in the interests of individual rights, purity of justice, morality, and good government. All that one man could do in a single year to save his country from anarchy, Caesar did.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar was now forty-three years of age. With the exception of the time spent in Spain, his life had been employed in petty miserable contests with Roman factions. He longed for a new and larger field where he might have freedom to perform deeds worthy of his surpassing abilities and unbounded ambition. This opportunity came to him when, as proconsul, he was entrusted with the protection of the northern frontier against the Gauls, and was assigned the provinces of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul and Illyricum. It was a most hazardous post and doubtless many of the <foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign> thought that they were well rid of him.

						<div2 type="section" n="3"><head>Caesar in Gaul.</head>
							
							<epigraph><cit><quote>What security men derive from a resolute spirit.</quote> <bibl><author>Caesar</author>.</bibl></cit></epigraph>
							
							<p>By the 'deal' of the triumvirate, Caesar was to have the government of Gaul for five years, while Crassus and Pompey were to remain in the city to look after the interests of the coalition. The bond was farther strengthened by the marriage of Pompey with Julia, Caesar's young and beautiful daughter.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar, as we have seen, was over forty when he went to Gaul. He was more of a civilian than a soldier and was far more at home in the Forum than in the camp. Alexander, Hannibal, and Napoleon had been trained in war from childhood. The qualities that are most potent in war &mdash; hope, confidence, audacity, and pugnacity &mdash; are qualities that belong to youth. So Caesar is an anomaly in military history. In spite of his years and his comparative inexperience, he leaped at once to the highest place, and is counted to-day among the three or four greatest generals in history, if not the greatest of them all. He never lost a set battle and he showed infinite versatility in adapting means to ends, always doing the right thing at the <pb n="xx"/>right time. He never admits the possibility of defeat and overcomes the most stupendous difficulties with such ease that he rarely speaks of them. His promptness of decision and rapidity of execution were such that the enemy were constantly overwhelmed with awe and were led to regard him as a supernatural being. 'Forced marches,' 'continuous marching day and night,' 'as quickly as possible' are phrases that recur again and again in his narrative. Only a natural ruler of men could get things done with such swiftness. He carried out his plans with the greatest audacity and, at the same time, without recklessness. No one could be more minute and thorough in preparations than he. No one left less chance for luck, good or bad, to enter into the result. In all that was done, his was the masterful and presiding genius, and the legions rarely accomplished much in his absence. His relations with his soldiers were most cordial. They idolized him and he respected and admired them and constantly labored for their safety and comfort. He allows them to share in the glory of his victories and in his story lingers with delight over their heroic exploits. He shared all their dangers and privations, he excelled personally in deeds of arms, and he allowed himself no luxury but a favorite horse. It is not strange that when trouble came upon their master, his soldiers were true to him, and even volunteered to serve without pay. Only three of his officers, two of them Gauls, went over to the enemy, while thousands came to him from the other side.
							</p>
							<p>After two successful campaigns in Gaul, in the spring of <date value="-56">B. C. 56</date>, Caesar met his two confederates at Luca, in Etruria, to arrange their future schemes. The conference was held with great display, almost like a royal court. More than two hundred senators were present, and one hundred and twenty lictors were in attendance, attached to the several magistrates. At this conference it was agreed that Pompey and Crassus should hold the consulship the following year, and, after their term of office, should receive by popular vote a similar command to that held by Caesar, &mdash; namely, that Pompey should command in Spain and Crassus in Syria for five years each; also that when Caesar's five years were up, he should receive in the same way a second term of five years. His ten years' administration would then close at the end of <date value="-49">B. C. 49</date>; after which time
								<pb n="xxi"/>&mdash; an interval of ten years having elapsed &mdash; he would be eligible again as consul.
							</p>
							<p>The programme was duly carried out. Crassus departed (<date value="-54">B. C. 54</date>) to his province, where he was defeated the next year by the Parthians in the battle of Carrhae, and shortly after entrapped and killed. Pompey put his province into the hands of one of his subordinates, and remained in the neighborhood of Rome, unwilling to remove from the seat of his personal influence.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar served eight campaigns in Gaul, an account of which is contained in the eight books of his Commentaries. Seven of these he wrote himself. The eighth was written by his friend and staff-officer, Hirtius. During these years he stormed more than 800 towns and subdued 300 tribes, engaged with more than 3,000,000 men, swept over a million human beings from the earth, and took a million more prisoners to be sold into slavery. "He was the first to lead an army into interior Gaul, the first to cross the Rhine into Germany, the first to bring a navy into the Western Ocean or to sail into the Atlantic with an army to make war." He left a magnificent country for the Romans to appropriate and retain until their increasing corruption left it in turn an easy prey to the Germans. He inspired such terror of the Roman arms that the tide of barbarian invasion was stayed for centuries.

							<p>Meanwhile events had been moving on at Rome. With Crassus dead, Caesar and Pompey were left in the enjoyment of almost absolute authority. They had been friends from youth, but none the less rivals, and the death of Julia (<date value="-54">B. C. 54</date>) sundered the last ties that bound them together. In 52 Pompey had been made sole consul and found himself at the head of a party which, under cover of the constitution, was determined to destroy Caesar that it might retain the power which his reforms threatened to place in worthier hands.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar's proconsulship of Gaul would expire at the end of <date value="-49">B. C. 49</date>. He wished to run for a second consulship in <date value="-48">B. C. 48</date>. The senate <pb n="xxii"/>resolved to prevent this, and commanded him to resign his office and disband his army several months before the expiration of his term. If they could once get him to Rome as a private citizen without an army, they knew they could crush him. Caesar knew this too, and refused to obey the decree unless Pompey should also disband his troops. Pompey would have been willing to agree to this fair proposition, but his friends would not permit him, and were bent on destroying Caesar. Naturally the charge of false play was made on both sides, and the strife continued until Caesar was finally declared a public enemy. He therefore crossed the Rubicon, a small stream which formed the boundary of his province and the limit of his authority, and began to march towards Rome. He took but a single legion with him and continued his efforts to come to an understanding with the<foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign>, having hopes of a compromise. He made a speech to his soldiers, explaining the situation, and was assured of their enthusiastic support. Labienus alone deserted him, corrupted, it is said, by Roman gold.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar's march through Italy was like a triumphal procession; the cities opened their gates to him and he was everywhere hailed with enthusiasm. Among the <foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign> there was nothing but consternation and fear. They had pinned their faith to Pompey, who had boasted that he had but to stamp his foot on the ground and legions would spring from the earth ready to obey him. He had vastly overrated himself (as was his wont), and had no conception of Caesar's power and genius. Cicero well sums up the situation in a letter to his friend Atticus: "The consuls are helpless. There has been no levy. With Caesar pressing forward and our general doing nothing, the men will not come to be enrolled. Pompey is prostrate, without courage, without purpose, without force, without energy." Pompey had been looked upon by his partisans as almost divine.  He had been peculiarly fortunate throughout his career and had made a great military reputation by assuming the laurels that others had won. Mommsen says of him: "He was radically a commonplace man, formed by nature to make a good corporal, but forced by circumstances to be a general." Now that he was confronted by a really serious difficulty and by a really able man, he was paralyzed.
							</p>
							<p>Pompey with his forces and accompanied by the senators fled in <pb n="xxiii"/>a panic to Brundisium and sailed across the Adriatic to Epirus. Caesar meanwhile continued his victorious advance, and in sixty days was master of Italy. Then he went to Spain, and before autumn closed had met and defeated all opposition there. Returning to Rome he made preparations to follow Pompey. Many prominent<foreign lang="la">Optimates</foreign> had fallen into his hands, but he let them all go free, to their own great amazement and to Caesar's eternal praise. In a letter he says: "I will conquer after a new fashion and fortify myself in the possession of the power I acquire by generosity and mercy."
							</p>
							<p>Caesar followed Pompey across the sea from Brundisium, transporting his army in two divisions. He encountered considerable difficulty on account of storms and the lack of ships. After much skirmishing, anxiety, and suffering (on Caesar's part), owing to scarcity of food and supplies, he fought a battle at Pharsalia in Thessaly on Aug. 9, <date value="-48">B. C. 48</date>. Before the battle Pompey's officers felt so sure of victory that a rich banquet was spread awaiting their return from the field. In numbers and equipment Pompey was much superior, and with him was all the wealth and respectability of Rome. He had 45,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry against Caesar's 22,000 and 1000, respectively; but he was overwhelmingly defeated and the battle ended in a terrible panic and great slaughter, in which 15,000 men lost their lives. As Caesar viewed the slain he said sadly: "They would have it so. After all that I had done for my country, I, Gaius Caesar, should have been condemned as a criminal if I had not appealed to my army."

							<p>Pompey fled for his life and took ship to Egypt and was there murdered by the king, who hoped thus to win Caesar's favor. When Caesar arrived there, however, a few days later, and Pompey's head was presented to him, he is said to have turned away from the sight with horror and grief. He now overcame all remaining opposition in several short and brilliant campaigns. The first of these was in Asia Minor, where he conquered so easily that he reported it to the senate in the words that have since become famous: <foreign lang="la">"Veni, vidi, vici."</foreign>  By the battle of Thapsus in Africa (<date value="-46">B. C. 46</date>) and that of Munda in Spain (<date value="-45">B. C. 45</date>), the Pompeian party was finally crushed.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar now returned to Rome, where he was made <foreign lang="la">imperator</foreign> &mdash;  possessing the entire <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>, or military dominion of Rome, not <pb n="xxiv"/>of a single colony or province merely &mdash; and perpetual dictator (<foreign lang="la">dictator perpetuo</foreign>), which offices clothed him with all the political authority of the state. By the powers thus conferred he laid the foundations of the Imperial constitution, which was afterwards (<date value="-30">B. C. 30</date>) set in operation by his grand-nephew and adopted son, Octavianus, later known as Augustus. This scheme of government eventually became (as was possibly foreseen from the start) an hereditary monarchy, under the name and form of a republic. During the short period of Caesar's rule he continued the good work of his first consulship and carried a series of measures of wise and practical statesmanship, such as the reform of the calendar, the regulation of the administrative system, and the policy of checks upon the abuses of the money power. He also planned extensive military expeditions against Parthia, Scythia, and Germany, and large public works and improvements, such as draining the Pomptine marshes and cutting through the isthmus of Corinth. With characteristic energy he accomplished much in a very short time.
							</p>
							<p>But the possession of this exalted authority involved the utter overthrow of the constitution and necessarily excited alarm and jealousy among patriots and demagogues alike. Rumors were abroad that Caesar was seeking to be king, a name detested at Rome since the foundation of the republic. His rivals were jealous, and not a few friends were disappointed at not having received as large favors as they thought they deserved. Many of his former enemies were bitter against him, because he had been magnanimous enough to forgive them. These feelings culminated in a conspiracy against his life. The leaders were Cassius, aviolent and fearless man driven mad by jealousy and baffled ambition; and Marcus Brutus, who had no better friend than Caesar, but who fancied that he must emulate his ancestor, Brutus the first consul, who expelled the Tarquins. Caesar received many warnings of what was going on, but disregarded them all with his usual indifference to danger. The deed was consummated in the senate-house on the Ides of March, <date value="-44">B. C. 44</date>. The great dictator was struck down by false friends and fell, pierced with wounds, at the foot of Pompey's statue. This dastardly act received the condemnation it deserved, and few have dared to defend it on the ground of patriotism. Those concerned in it all <pb n="xxv"/>died violent deaths soon after.
								Both Brutus and Cassius committed suicide, the latter stabbing himself with the very dagger which he had used against Caesar.<note anchored="yes" n="1">For a vivid imaginative account of the conspiracy, see Shakespeare's <title>Julius Caesar.</title></note></p></div2>

							<p>Suetonius <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 45">(ch. 45)</bibl> describes Caesar when a youth as tall, slight, and handsome, with dark piercing eyes, a sallow complexion, large nose, lip full, features refined and intellectual, neck sinewy and thick. He adds further that he was neat to effeminacy about his dress and appearance. Fond of athletics, he excelled in all manly sports, especially in riding. In danger he knew no fear and often performed acts of great personal daring. His health was vigorous until his later years, and he could endure an apparently unlimited amount of labor and hardship. Added years gave him a majestic and commanding presence without detracting from the grace and courtesy of his bearing. We judge him to have been a man of singular charm and of unusual personal magnetism.
							</p>
							<p>Thanks to the peculiar skill possessed by the ancients in the art of portraiture, we have good reason to believe that we may see the great dictator as he was, from existing statues and busts. Two of the most noted of these are the busts in the British Museum (Fig. <xref n="fig.047" targOrder="U">47</xref>) and that in the Louvre (Fig. <xref n="fig.001" targOrder="U">1</xref>). The one in the Naples Museum (Fig. <xref n="fig.078" targOrder="U">78</xref>) is judged by competent critics to be conventional and not modelled after the living man. Those first mentioned are thought to be true to life. The one in the British Museum shows us Caesar the statesman, the man of peace; the one in the Louvre, Caesar the man of action, the martial hero.<note anchored="yes" n="2">On the portraits of Caesar, see an illustrated article by Mr. John S. Ropes in <title>Scribner's Magazine </title>for February, 1887, and S. Baring-Gould's" Tragedy of the Caesars," Vol. I.</note>
							</p>
							<p><pb n="xxvi"/>What Alexander was to the Greeks, and Hannibal to the Carthaginians, that and much more was Caesar to the Romans. The two former excelled all men of their times in war only; but Caesar had such extraordinary abilities in widely different directions that many regard him as the most remarkable man that history records. In whatever he did, he always did the best possible. He had the greatest diversity of gifts: as a student of language, he composed a treatise on grammar while crossing the Alps; as an orator, Quintilian says he would have rivalled Cicero had he devoted his time to this art; as a general, he has had no superior and hardly a peer; and, above all, he was the greatest politician and statesman of his time. To his statecraft all his other acts are subordinate, and by this they should be interpreted.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar was too great a man to be without enemies. He has been accused of being a traitor to his country, who by a deep-laid scheme overthrew its constitution. He was undoubtedly ambitious for power, and he used it in making such changes in the constitution as were sorely needed to keep it from going to pieces; but how far the acts by which he accomplished this desirable end were the result of a plan to further his personal ambition, and how far they were compelled by the stress of circumstances, we cannot judge. We do know, however, that he professed an earnest desire for peace, until he was driven into war by the hatred and perversity of his opponents.
							</p>
							<p>He has also been accused of immorality, cruelty, and irreligion. It would be vain to maintain that Caesar was a model of virtue in an age that was notoriously and openly wicked and profligate. We know that Caesar was a man of perfect self-control, and that he was remarkable for extreme abstemiousness in eating and drinking. As for the rest, he was probably no worse than the average.
							</p>
							<p>Doubtless he was cruel, judged by modern standards. He butchered without mercy thousands of defenceless men, women, and children. But we must remember that Caesar was a Roman, of a people naturally cruel and careless of bloodshed, and, again, that he was dealing with Gauls and Germans, whom the Romans despised, and for whom he had not, nor could have, any feelings of sympathy or kindness. The doctrine of human brotherhood is something he never beard of. But, on the other hand, contrast with this his constant care <pb n="xxvii"/>and anxiety for the welfare of his soldiers, his patience and forbearance with their mistakes, such as no modern commander has exhibited in his memoirs, and, above all, recall his mercy to his opponents in the Civil War, whom he freely pardoned and restored to honor and favor. Contrast Caesar's dictatorship with the horrors of Marius and Sulla, and we cannot wonder that his clemency became famous.
							</p>
							<p>That Caesar was a skeptic is no doubt true. The age was skeptical and the learned classes no longer believed in the gods of their forefathers.  What Caesar's real beliefs were, or if he had any, we do not know. He often speaks of fortune as ruling in the affairs of men and probably had some vague and dimly defined belief in a supreme power.
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="6"><head>Caesar's Literary Work.</head>
							
							<p>As a man of letters Caesar is hardly less eminent. His vast and massive intellect could hold in its grasp a great variety of subjects. He wrote on many different themes, such as philosophy, language, astronomy, and divination. Of all his books only his Commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars have come down to us in complete form. They stand as the best military history that was ever written. Their ulterior purpose was to justify him in the eyes of the world for the course he took in opposing the senate and the government. He does this rarely by argument, but by such a tactful and masterful collocation of facts that the unthinking reader feels himself persuaded that Caesar could hardly have done otherwise.
							</p>
							<p>The style of these memoirs is remarkable for directness, terseness, and simplicity. Cicero, one of the greatest masters of style, says of them, "I pronounce them indeed to be very commendable, for they are simple, straight-forward, agreeable, with all rhetorical ornament stripped from them as one strips off a garment." While the language is lucid, it is packed full of meaning, and even a good Latinist needs to read slowly and with deliberation that the full thought of each sentence may be gathered. Sometimes a whole sentence is crammed into an adjective or a participle. To translate into good English requires, therefore, frequent amplification.
							</p>
							<p>Like all great men, Caesar rarely speaks of himself. In his works he refers to himself in the third person and with such modesty and <pb n="xxviii"/>impartiality that you would never suspect him to be the writer. He betrays his identity by three slips of the pen where he uses the first person. He never struts or poses for effect, not even when he is narrating sublime deeds of heroism.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar wrote his Commentaries in the midst of intense activity. They were
								jotted down as he journeyed fought; mere notes, as it were, for future
								amplification. Hirtius says, "While others know how faultlessly they are
								written, I know with what ease and rapidity he dashed them off."
							</p>
							<p>For us the Gallic War has a peculiar interest because it treats of the peoples with whom we are most familiar and from whom most of us derive our ancestry. It marks, in a sense, the beginning of modern history. Active, keen-sighted, and truthful, Caesar gives us such insight into these nations as serves to explain many of their present political and social peculiarities.

						<div2 type="section" n="1"><head>The Army and Its Divisions.</head>
							
							<div3 type="subsection" n="1"><head>The Legions.</head>
								
								<p>The Roman legion corresponded to a modern Division, but was more an organic whole, since it was the smallest unit that had separate line officers. What its normal strength was in Caesar's time we have no means of knowing; but a probable estimate puts it at 5000 men. The actual effective strength in the field, however, was usually much less, falling to 3000 men, as at the battle of Pharsalia (on Caesar's own authority). This variation in number was due to the many absences from duty which always occur in a military organization, and to the losses incurred by the individual legions in previous campaigns. Losses in old legions were not usually made good by new recruits, but the latter were formed into new legions; hence the older the legion, the smaller usually its enrollment. The average effective strength of the legion in the Gallic War was probably near 3600 men.
								</p>
								<p>
									<pb n="xxx"/>The subdivisions of the legions were as follows:
									
									<table>
										<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">1 legion</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">10 cohorts of about 360 men each.</cell></row>
										<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">1 cohort</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">3 maniples of 120 men each.</cell></row>
										<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">1 maniple</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">2 centuries of 60 men each.</cell></row>
									</table>
									
									There were, therefore, 10 cohorts, 30 maniples, and 60 centuries in each legion. These divisions did not, however, like our companies, have special "commissioned officers," but were commanded by centurions who came from the ranks. The legions constituted the main body of the army and did most of the fighting, but there were other arms employed for various purposes (see below). The legions were designated by numbers, given in the order of their enlistment.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="2"><head>The Cavalry.</head>
								<p>The cavalry (<foreign lang="la">equitatus</foreign>), originally of Roman citizens, was in Caesar's time composed almost exclusively of recruits from subject or allied states. In Caesar's army it was composed of Gauls, Spaniards, and Germans. There was no fixed ratio between the number of legionaries and cavalry. In the campaign against the Helvetians, Caesar had 4000 <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign>, in the battle  Pharsalia, 1000; but the number of legions was the same in both.
								</p>
								<p>The cavalry was divided into regiments (<foreign lang="la">alae</foreign>) of about 330 horsemen each; these were subdivided into 10 squadrons (<foreign lang="la">turmae</foreign>) of 33 horsemen each; and these again into 3 squads (<foreign lang="la">decuriae</foreign>) of 11 each.  See Figs. <xref n="fig.012" targOrder="U">12</xref>, <xref n="fig.013" targOrder="U">13</xref>.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="3">
								<head>The Auxiliaries.</head>
								
								<p>The auxiliaries (<foreign lang="la">auxilia peditum</foreign>) were infantry forces from allied and subject states. Caesar nowhere gives the number of his <foreign lang="la">auxilia</foreign>,  and it was doubtless as various as that of his cavalry. They were the light-armed soldiers (<foreign lang="la">milites levis armaturae</foreign>), the archers (<foreign lang="la">sagittarii</foreign>),  and the slingers (<foreign lang="la">funditores</foreign>).  See Figs. <xref n="fig.030" targOrder="U">30</xref>, <xref n="fig.104" targOrder="U">104</xref>, <xref n="fig.105" targOrder="U">105</xref>, <xref n="fig.115" targOrder="U">115</xref>. The best slingers came from the Balearic Islands, the best archers from Crete and Numidia. The light-armed soldiers wore no heavy armor and carried a light round shield (<foreign lang="la">parma</foreign>).  The archers had neither corselet, helmet, nor shield. The latter they could not carry on account of their bows.
								</p>
								<p><pb n="xxxi"/>Caesar placed little reliance on his <foreign lang="la">auxilia</foreign> for actual fighting, but used them for the most part to make a show of force and frighten the enemy (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.51">Bk. i. 51</bibl>), and to assist in building fortifications. In engagements the bowmen and slingers were usually stationed on the wings (<foreign lang="la">alae</foreign>), and from this were called <foreign lang="la">alarii</foreign>.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="4"><head>The Engineers and Artisans.</head>
								
								<p>The engineers and artisans (<foreign lang="la">fabri</foreign>) sometimes formed a separate corps under the command of a chief engineer (<foreign lang="la">praefectus fabrum</foreign>), and sometimes they were called from the ranks of the legions when their services were needed. Caesar had a chief engineer, but no special body of men (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.11">Bk. v. 11</bibl>). They were employed in building bridges, ships, winter quarters, and in
									repairing weapons andequipments.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="5"><head>The Artillery.</head>
								
								<p>Engines of war were not often used on the battlefield, where modern artillery forms such an important branch of the service, but mainly in the defence and assault of fortified cities or camps. They had a limited use also in the fleet (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 4.25">Bk. iv. 25</bibl>).
								</p>
								<p>We have no exact account of the construction of these engines. Caesar almost
									always calls them <foreign lang="la">tormenta</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="la">torquere</foreign>, <gloss>to twist</gloss>), a name which clearly points to the elasticity of twisted rope, sinew, or hair, for the source of their energy. They were of three kinds: <foreign lang="la">catapultae</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">ballistae</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">scorpiones</foreign> (see Figs. <xref n="fig.061" targOrder="U">61</xref>, <xref n="fig.075" targOrder="U">75</xref>, <xref n="fig.095" targOrder="U">95</xref>). The <foreign lang="la">catapultae</foreign> shot great arrows in a horizontal direction, like a cannon; the <foreign lang="la">ballistae</foreign> hurled great stones or heavy blocks of wood through the air in a high curve, as a mortar throws shells. The range of these weapons was from 1500 to 2000 ft. A <foreign lang="la">scorpio</foreign> was a small catapult having a range of about 350 ft. It was an accurate and deadly weapon. Caesar tells of one at the siege of Avaricum that marked and killed man after man in the same spot (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.25">Bk. vii. 25</bibl>). The <foreign lang="la">tormenta</foreign> were usually served and kept in repair by the <foreign lang="la">fabri</foreign>,  but as Caesar had no such corps, they were probably in his army served by legionaries.
									
									<pb n="xxxii"/></p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="6"><head>The Baggage Train.</head>
								
								<p>The baggage of the army, except the packs corresponding to knapsacks
									which the soldiers themselves carried (<foreign lang="la">sarcinae</foreign>), was borne by horses and mules (<foreign lang="la">iumenta</foreign>), and in wagons. The latter, however, were used mainly by the traders (<foreign lang="la">mercatores</foreign>) and sutlers (<foreign lang="la">lixae</foreign>) that followed the legion. The baggage of each legion was by no means inconsiderable. It consisted of tents, blankets, tools, the <foreign lang="la">tormenta</foreign>, provisions, etc., and required no less than 500 pack-animals to a legion. The inconvenience and delay occasioned by the care of so much
									baggage caused the Romans to call it <foreign lang="la">impedimenta</foreign>  (<gloss>incumbrances</gloss>), and a legion marching with its baggage was called <foreign lang="la">legio impedita</foreign>; when without, <foreign lang="la">legio expedita</foreign>. Along with the baggage train went a multitude of drivers, grooms, officers' servants, and other menials, all of whom are included in the general term <foreign lang="la">calones</foreign>.  Most or all of these were slaves. See Figs. <xref n="fig.014" targOrder="U">14</xref>, <xref n="fig.055" targOrder="U">55</xref>.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="7"><head>The Officers and their Staff.</head>
								
								<p>The superior officers were: (1) the commander-in-chief (<foreign lang="la">imperator</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">dux belli</foreign>). He possessed the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> or supreme military authority by virtue of his office, but by etiquette first received the name <foreign lang="la">imperator</foreign> from his soldiers after his first victory. In Caesar's case it was bestowed after his victory over the Helvetii.
								</p>
								<p>(2) The <foreign lang="la">legati</foreign>. These were men of senatorial rank (i.e. who had once held a curule magistracy). They were appointed by the senate or the people on the nomination of the proconsul. The senate also determined the number that a general should have; Caesar had ten. They often acted as ambassadors and made treaties, but their chief duties were military. Their powers were in no way independent, but derived from the general, who might put them in command of one or more legions or confer upon them the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> in his absence (<foreign lang="la">legatus pro praetore</foreign>). In his battle with Ariovistus Caesar placed a <foreign lang="la">legatus</foreign> at the head of each of his legions (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.53">Bk. i. 53</bibl>), thus giving them an independent command, a practice which he afterwards continued to the great advantage of the service.
								</p>
								<p>(3) The <foreign lang="la">quaestores</foreign> were officers elected by the people annually to administer the financial affairs of the provinces, one for each <foreign lang="la">imperator</foreign>. <pb n="xxxiii"/>They had charge of the military chest, and saw to the pay, clothing, shelter, and general equipment of the legions serving in their respective provinces. On occasion they exercised the military authority of a <foreign lang="la">legatus</foreign> (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.53">Bk. i. 53</bibl>); they were the ancient equivalent of a modern quartermaster. Besides these general officers, there were attached to each legion six <foreign lang="la">tribuni militum</foreign>, who were probably originally in command of the legion. They were
									divided into three pairs, each pair taking command in its turn. In Caesar's time they were no longer trained soldiers, but chiefly young men of equestrian rank, who went into the army for a year or two to get some military experience and thus begin their public career (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.39">Bk. i. 39</bibl>), so that ordinarily the legion had no proper commanding officers. Caesar was not slow to see that these political and social favorites were not the men to lead his legions into battle, and he therefore introduced the lasting reform of transferring this duty to the<foreign lang="la">legati</foreign>, as mentioned above (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.20">Bk. ii. 20</bibl>: v. I, 25, 47). Thereafter the duties of the tribunes became mainly administrative and judicial; they cared for the levying, the discharge, and the equipment of the troops, and for the army supplies, under the orders of the<foreign lang="la">quaestor</foreign>; and they presided at courts-martial and took part in the councils of war. Sometimes they led the legions on the march and received subordinate military commands (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.47">Bk. vii. 47</bibl>, <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.52">52</bibl>).
								</p>
								<p>Surrounding the superior officers there was always a large number of young men,
									forming a kind of staff, who acted as orderlies and body-guards. The only officers "of the line" were the tribunes, and, as appears above, their command was limited.
								</p>
								<p>The real leaders of the men were the inferior ("non-commissioned") officers, the centurions. Corresponding to sergeants and corporals, these were always plebeians, often of the lowest birth, who were promoted from the ranks entirely on account of their fighting qualities, and could never rise higher. There were two centurions in each maniple, making six for each cohort and sixty for the legion. The six centurions of the first cohort outranked the others and
									were called <foreign lang="la">centuriones primorum ordinum</foreign>, and were the only ones that ordinarily sat with the superior officers in the council of war. The first cohort always contained the flower of the legion, and the men in the first century of this cohort excelled all the others. Their leader, <pb n="xxxiv"/>the first centurion of the whole cohort (<foreign lang="la">primus</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">primi-pilus</foreign>) and so of the whole legion, must needs be a man of great personal prowess and skill, an actual fighter, one to whom all could look as to a model soldier. Such was, for example, Publius Sextius Baculus, who repeatedly deserved the praise of his general (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.25">Bk. ii. 25</bibl>; iii. 5; vi. 38), and Titus Balventius (<foreign lang="la">vir fortis et magnae virtutis</foreign>, <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.35">Bk. v. 35</bibl>). As a badge of his office the centurion carried a short staff (<foreign lang="la">vitis</foreign>), but he was armed much like the other soldiers (see Fig. <xref n="fig.040" targOrder="U">40</xref>).
								</p>
								<p>The chief distinction in dress between the officers and men was the red<foreign lang="la">tunica militaris</foreign> worn by the legates and tribunes, and the purple cloak (<foreign lang="la">paludamentum</foreign>) worn by the general (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.88">Bk. vii. 88</bibl>). The officers wore also coats-of-mail of gilded bronze (see Fig. <xref n="fig.086" targOrder="U">86</xref>).
								</p>
								<p>Between the centurions and common soldiers in rank were the <foreign lang="la">speculatores</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">evocati</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">beneficiarii</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">aquiliferi</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">signiferi</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">bucinatores</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">tubicines</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">cornicines</foreign>.  The <foreign lang="la">speculatores</foreign> or scouts obtained news of the enemy and carried despatches. The<foreign lang="la">evocati</foreign> were veterans who had completed their term of service, but remained in the army at the request of their commander. The<foreign lang="la">beneficiarii</foreign> were soldiers that had received some gift or privilege for meritorious service. The <foreign lang="la">signiferi</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">aquiliferi</foreign> were the standard bearers: soldiers selected for their courage and fidelity. The <foreign lang="la">bucinatores</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">tubicines</foreign> were the musicians. All of these had rights and exemptions not enjoyed by the common soldiers. See Figs. <xref n="fig.039" targOrder="U">39</xref>, <xref n="fig.084" targOrder="U">84</xref>, <xref n="fig.114" targOrder="U">114</xref>.
								</p></div3></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>The Standards.</head>
							
							<p>The term <foreign lang="la">signa</foreign> is applied in a general sense to all the standards of the army. That of the legion was an eagle (<foreign lang="la">aquila</foreign>), usually of silver or bronze, about the size of a dove, on a wooden staff. It was sometimes carried by the chief centurion (<foreign lang="la">primipilus</foreign>) of the legion. Sometimes it had below it a little red or white banner (<foreign lang="la">vexillum</foreign>), inscribed with the number or name of the legion. See Figs. <xref n="fig.013" targOrder="U">13</xref>, <xref n="fig.121" targOrder="U">121</xref>, <xref n="fig.123" targOrder="U">123</xref>.
							</p>
							<p>In a narrower sense, <foreign lang="la">signum</foreign> was used for the standard of the cohort or the maniple. Each cohort had its own <foreign lang="la">signum</foreign> (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.21">Bk. ii. 21</bibl>), and in earlier times each maniple, but probably not in Caesar's day.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>
								<pb n="xxxv"/>The cavalry and light-armed troops and all separate detachments carried only the <foreign lang="la">vexillum</foreign> (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.36">Bk. vi. 36</bibl>). The general's flag at headquarters was also called <foreign lang="la">vexillum</foreign>.  It was a large white banner with an inscription in red, giving the name of the general and that of his army. A large red <foreign lang="la">vexillum</foreign> displayed at headquarters was the signal for battle (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.20">Bk. ii. 20</bibl>). See Fig. <xref n="fig.070" targOrder="U">70</xref>.
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="3"><head>The Music.</head>
							
							<p>The difficulty of carrying the voice through the din of battle early led the Romans to use the penetrating tones of brass instruments for giving orders. The four instruments used by them were the bugle (<foreign lang="la">bucina</foreign>), the trumpet (<foreign lang="la">tuba</foreign>), the cavalry trumpet (<foreign lang="la">lituus</foreign>), and the horn (<foreign lang="la">cornu</foreign>).  See Figs. <xref n="fig.036" targOrder="U">36</xref>, <xref n="fig.037" targOrder="U">37</xref>, <xref n="fig.038" targOrder="U">38</xref>, <xref n="fig.084" targOrder="U">84</xref>.
							</p>
							<p>The <foreign lang="la">bucina</foreign>, whose shape and appearance are uncertain, sounded the changes of the night-watch and the reveille in the morning. The <foreign lang="la">tuba</foreign>,  a straight trumpet of brass more than three feet long, with a bellshaped mouth, gave the signal for attack or retreat, the signal being taken up and repeated by the <foreign lang="la">cornu</foreign>. The latter was a circular-shaped instrument which the performer often placed about his neck. The<foreign lang="la">tuba</foreign> had a deep tone; the <foreign lang="la">cornu</foreign> a sharper one. The general's call to an assembly (<foreign lang="la">contio</foreign>) was the <foreign lang="la">classicum</foreign>, sounded by all the instruments at once.
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="4">
							<head>The Legionary.</head>
							
							<div3 type="subsection" n="a"><head>Enlistment.</head>
								
								<p>The legion was composed of Romans only. Citizens were
									liable to conscription between the ages of seventeen and forty-six. The recruit must be of sound health and of suitable height. The Romans, as a rule, were rather undersized. Caesar expressly mentions the small stature of his troops as compared with that of the Germans (Bk. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.39">1.39</bibl>; <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.30">2.30</bibl>); but the Romans had learned the lesson of civilization, &mdash; that victories are gained not by huge bones and big bodies, but by trained skill and scientific tactics. Man for man, the Germans were doubtless more than a match for the Romans; but against the organized and disciplined legion &mdash; the most effective machine for battle that the world had yet seen &mdash; they were almost <pb n="xxxvi"/>powerless. The term of service was twenty years, and after this the veteran was discharged with enough to provide for his old age. Often he re-enlisted for farther service (<foreign lang="la">evocatus</foreign>).
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="b"><head>Clothing.</head>
								
								<p>All the legionaries were clothed alike. Next the skin was a nearly or quite sleeveless woollen shirt (<foreign lang="la">tunica</foreign>), reaching nearly to the knees; over this a leathern coat strengthened by bands of metal across the breast, back, and shoulders (<foreign lang="la">lorica</foreign>).  In cold or wet weather the soldier wore about him a wide woollen mantle (<foreign lang="la">sagum</foreign>), which was fastened by a clasp (<foreign lang="la">fibula</foreign>) on the right shoulder, leaving the right arm free. At night the <foreign lang="la">sagum</foreign> served as a blanket. About his waist was a leather belt (<foreign lang="la">cingulum militiae</foreign>), bound with metal and with strips of metal hanging from the front as a protection to the lower part of the body. His feet were covered with strong half-boots (<foreign lang="la">caligae</foreign>).  This might be called his undress uniform. See Figs. <xref n="fig.107" targOrder="U">107</xref>, <xref n="fig.115" targOrder="U">115</xref>, <xref n="fig.126" targOrder="U">126</xref>, etc
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="c"><head>Armor. </head>
								
								<p>The defensive armor consisted of a coat-of-mail (<foreign lang="la">lorica</foreign>, described above), a helmet, and a shield. The helmet (<foreign lang="la">galea</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">cassis</foreign>), of iron or of leather strengthened with brass, was open in front and adorned with a white crest, which was one of the <foreign lang="la">insignia</foreign> put on at the beginning of a battle (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.21">Bk. ii. 21</bibl>). See Fig. <xref n="fig.087" targOrder="U">87</xref>, etc. The shield (<foreign lang="la">scutum</foreign>) was rectangular, about four feet long and two feet wide; it was made of wood slightly curved, and covered with linen and heavy leather. About the rim it was bound with metal, and also in the centre. There was a single handle on the inside and opposite it on the outside a boss or knob (<foreign lang="la">umbo</foreign>) of metal, to divert missiles and to strengthen the whole. A common device on the outside was a winged thunderbolt. See Figs. <xref n="fig.116" targOrder="U">116</xref>, <xref n="fig.117" targOrder="U">117</xref>, etc.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="d"><head>Weapons.</head>
								<p>The weapons of offence were the sword and spear. The sword (<foreign lang="la">gladius Hispanus</foreign>)  was about two feet long, straight and two-edged. It was used more for thrusting than for striking, and was not usually hung from the body-belt, but from a belt passing over the left shoulder to the right hip (<foreign lang="la">balteus</foreign>). See Figs. <xref n="fig.017" targOrder="U">17</xref>, <xref n="fig.115" targOrder="U">115</xref>, etc.
								</p>
								<p>The spear (<foreign lang="la">pilum</foreign>) of Caesar's soldiers was between six and seven feet long. The shaft was of wood and about four feet long. Into this was fitted the slender iron shank that ended in a barbed head. From monuments and from remains that have been found in various places, the weight is estimated at about three pounds and the <pb n="xxxvii"/>hurling distance
									about 100 feet. Each legionary had one of these weapons. See Figs. <xref n="fig.015" targOrder="U">15</xref>, <xref n="fig.107" targOrder="U">107</xref>.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="e"><head>Baggage (Packs).</head>
								
								<p>Besides his arms and armor, the legionary carried tools for digging, cooking utensils (<foreign lang="la">vasa</foreign>), food for at least two weeks (<foreign lang="la">cibaria</foreign>), his cloak or blanket (<foreign lang="la">sagum</foreign>), and usually one or two stakes (<foreign lang="la">valli</foreign>) for the rampart of the camp. The weight of the whole was about sixty pounds. For convenience in carrying, the  vasa, cibaria,and other small articles were tied in a compact bundle to the end of a forked stick and carried over the shoulder. During a halt this rested on the ground and the soldier could lean on it for support. Upon a sudden call to battle he could quickly lay it down and be ready (<foreign lang="la">expeditus</foreign>) for the fray. The forked sticks were named Marius's mules (<foreign lang="la">muli Mariani</foreign>), after the great Marius who introduced their use. The collective personal baggage of the legionary was called his <foreign lang="la">sarcina</foreign> (see Figs. <xref n="fig.014" targOrder="U">14</xref>, <xref n="fig.115" targOrder="U">115</xref>).
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="f"><head>Food.</head>
								
								<p>The food provided for the legionary was coarse flour or unground wheat or barley. This he must grind for himself. The ration of food for one day was about two pounds. Every fifteen days he received two <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign>, &mdash; about two pecks. This monotonous diet was varied occasionally by meat and such food as he could find by foraging; and there was always the chance of bartering his rations for the greater variety carried by the traders (<foreign lang="la">mercatores</foreign>), who followed the army in large numbers and did a thriving business with the soldiers.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="g"><head>Work.</head>
								
								<p>It has been truthfully said that Caesar conquered Gaul as much with the spade and shovel as with the sword and spear. The legionary was above all a skilful digger, and besides the actual fighting, no small part of his labor was the almost daily task of fortifying the camp (<foreign lang="la">castra munire</foreign>). At least three hours were needed for this work. After this there were the watches to keep, the arms to burnish, and all the other busy routine of camp life.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="h"><head>Pay.</head>
								
								<p>Caesar paid his legionaries 12 1/2 cents a day or about $45 a year. This was nearly the same amount that a day laborer could earn at Rome. The soldier was better off than the laborer merely by his shelter and by the certainty of employment. A deduction from the pay was made for food and equipments furnished by the state. Food, however, was very cheap, and a soldier in active <pb n="xxxviii"/>service could always expect a considerable increase in his income from booty and from the gifts of his general.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="i"><head>Discipline.</head>
								
								<p>The martial spirit of the soldiers and their attention to duty were maintained and increased by appropriate rewards and punishments. Among the latter the most usual were withholding of wages, degradation in rank, corporal punishment, dismissal from the service, and, in cases of flagrant offences, death. A minor offence committed by a company of soldiers was punished by putting them on barley rations and giving them extra work on the fortifications. Among rewards may be mentioned public praise in the presence of, the army, promotion in rank, increase in wages, or the presentation of a crown of leaves or grasses, which corresponded to the bestowal of a modern military decoration.
									
								</p></div3></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="5"><head>The Camp</head>
							
							<p>The success of Roman arms in hostile and barbarous countries was largely due to the custom of guarding against surprise by making fortified camps. The summer camp (<foreign lang="la">castra aestiva</foreign>) and the winter camp (<foreign lang="la">castra hiberna</foreign>) seem to have been alike in all essential features. In the latter, however, more provision was made for the comfort and convenience of the men. Instead of tents, huts of timber and earth, thatched with straw or covered with hides, here provided for them. The camp was regularly in the form of a square, often with rounded corners, but the lay of the land necessitated many variations from the regular plan (see Fig. <xref n="fig.119" targOrder="U">119</xref>). Of all the camps of Caesar that have been discovered, but one, that on the Aisne (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.5">Bk. ii. 5</bibl>), approaches a square form. The site was chosen with great care, and was always on high ground and near wood and water. An ideal spot was the slope of a hill with some kind of natural defence on the sides and rear, and with sufficient ground in front for the array of the legions. Such a position would give the Romans an opportunity for their favorite onslaught <foreign lang="la">e superior loco</foreign> (cf.<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.8">Bk. ii. 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.50">Bk. v. 50</bibl>).
							</p>
							<p>A small force of soldiers under centurions was sent ahead to select the site for the camp and stake it out. Two bisecting lines were drawn at right angles to each other to mark the four gates (see Fig. <xref n="fig.119" targOrder="U">119</xref>): the<foreign lang="la">porta praetoria</foreign>, facing the enemy; the <foreign lang="la">porta decumana</foreign>, <pb n="xxxix"/>in the rear; the <foreign lang="la">porta principalis dextra</foreign>, on the right side; the <foreign lang="la">porta principalis sinistra</foreign>, on the left. Between the gates on the right and left ran a broad street, the<foreign lang="la">via principalis</foreign>. The forward half of the camp was allotted to the soldiers, the rear half to the officers and their attendants. All about the inside of the fortifications ran a broad space, at least one hundred feet wide, left vacant for baggage, evolutions of troops, and to protect the tents within from missiles that the enemy might hurl over the walls. Near the middle of the camp was an open square
								(<foreign lang="la">praetorium</foreign>), in which stood the general's tent (<foreign lang="la">tabernaculum ducis</foreign>).  Before this was the altar on which he sacrificed, and on the left was a sodded mound of earth (<foreign lang="la">tribunal</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">suggestus</foreign>;  cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.3">Bk. vi. 3</bibl>), from which he pronounced judgment and addressed the assembled soldiers. The full details of the interior arrangement of Caesar's camp are not known; but every officer, every cohort, every maniple, every man had his appointed place.
							</p>
							<p>No night passed that the army was not housed in such a camp, fortified by wall and ditch. As soon as the soldiers arrive at the spot marked out for them, laying aside helmet, shield, and spear, they begin to dig the ditch (<foreign lang="la">fossa</foreign>), the earth from which is used in constructing the wall (<foreign lang="la">vallum</foreign>).  If time permits, the sides of the embankment are covered with sods to hold the earth, or with bundles of brush (fascines). The ditch was usually nine feet wide and seven feet deep, the wall six to ten feet high, and wide enough on the top to afford good standing room for a soldier in action An ordinary camp for a night's sojourn could be fortified in about three hours. If the camp was intended for more than one night (<foreign lang="la">castra stativa</foreign>), the fortifications were made stronger. The earth was made firmer by imbedding in it several lines of fascines parallel to the length, and on its top was set a breastwork of stakes (<foreign lang="la">valli</foreign>  or <foreign lang="la">sudes</foreign>; cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.40">Bk. v. 40</bibl>; <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.72">Bk. vii. 72</bibl>). This breastwork was about four feet high (see Fig. <xref n="fig.118" targOrder="U">118</xref>). Often wooden towers were erected on the walls (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.40">Bk. v. 40</bibl>; <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.72">Bk. vii. 72</bibl>), connected by galleries
								(<foreign lang="la">pontes</foreign>). The wall was made easy of access on the inner side by steps of brush. Sometimes small redoubts (<foreign lang="la">castella</foreign>) were built at a distance from the main camp. These were made on the same general plan.
							</p>
							<p>After the camp had been fortified and the leathern tents (<foreign lang="la">tentoria, pelles</foreign>) put up in their assigned places, guards were set at the gates, and the regular routine of camp life began.
								
								<pb n="xl"/></p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="6"><head>The March.</head>
							
							<p>When the trumpet gave the signal  (<foreign lang="la">signum profectionis</foreign>) to break up camp  (<foreign lang="la">castra movere</foreign>),  the soldiers struck their tents and packed their baggage  (<foreign lang="la">vasa conligere</foreign>);  at the second signal the baggage (<foreign lang="la">impedimenta</foreign>)  was put on the pack-animals and in the wagons; at the third signal the army  (<foreign lang="la">agmen</foreign>)  began its march. The start was made usually at sunrise, but it might be made earlier on special occasion. The ordinary day's march lasted about seven hours, and covered about 15 miles; a forced march  (<foreign lang="la">magnum iter</foreign>) about 25. Caesar made many such, his men travelling immense distances with incredible swiftness.
							</p>
							<p>When marching in the enemy's country, the main body of troops  (<foreign lang="la">agmen</foreign>) protected itself by a vanguard  (<foreign lang="la">agmen primum</foreign>)  of cavalry, light-armed infantry, and scouts  (<foreign lang="la">exploratores</foreign>),  and by a rear guard  (<foreign lang="la">agmen novissimum</foreign>).  Sometimes individual spies  (<foreign lang="la">speculatores</foreign>)  were sent far in advance to reconnoitre the country and the movements of the enemy's forces.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> 
								The order of march of the main body depended on the nearness of the enemy. When no enemy was near, each legion marched in a single column and was followed by its baggage train (see <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.17">Bk. ii. 17</bibl>). In the neighborhood of the enemy, a single column of troops in fighting trim  (<foreign lang="la">expediti</foreign>),  i.e. without packs  (<foreign lang="la">sarcinae</foreign>),  followed directly after the vanguard; then came the baggage of the whole army, while the remaining forces acted as a rear guard (cf. Bk.
								ii. 19). Sometimes, for additional security against flank attacks, columns of infantry marched on each side of the baggage train, forming a hollow square (<foreign lang="la">agmen quadratum</foreign>;  see Fig. <xref n="fig.073" targOrder="U">73</xref>). If, when marching in this order, the army was compelled to halt and defend itself, the soldiers, by facing about, presented to the foe a complete circle  (<foreign lang="la">orbis</foreign>)  of armed men. When the foe was near and the ground level and open, the march was sometimes made in three parallel columns, which, by a simple evolution, could be quickly changed to the triple battle line  (<foreign lang="la">acies triplex</foreign>),  the regular formation for an engagement.
							</p>
							<p>Streams were crossed either by fords or bridges. Romans could cross deeper fords than we, for they had no powder to keep dry <pb n="xli"/>(cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.18">Bk. v. 18</bibl>). Sometimes a line of cavalry was sent across the stream to break the force of the current (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.56">Bk. vii. 56</bibl>). Bridges were usually very simple affairs of logs covered with earth and brush, or of boats, but Caesar's masterpiece of military engineering was his roadway forty feet wide with which he twice spanned the Rhine (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 4.17">Bk. iv. 17</bibl>; <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.9">Bk. vi. 9</bibl>; see Figs. <xref n="fig.059" targOrder="U">59</xref>, <xref n="fig.080" targOrder="U">80</xref>).
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="7">
							<head>The Battle.</head>
							
							<p>As has been said (V), the camp was so chosen that the ground in front of it would be suitable for battle. The usual order of battle was <foreign lang="la">triplex acies.</foreign>The first line of the legion was formed of four cohorts and each of the others of three. In each cohort the three maniples stood side by side, and in each maniple the two centuries stood one behind the other, varying in formation according to the depth of the line. As to the distance between the lines we have no definite information; nor even as to whether spaces were left between the cohorts. There were probably spaces between the different legions and doubtless between the centre (<foreign lang="la">media acies</foreign>), where the legionaries stood, and the wings (<foreign lang="la">cornua</foreign>), composed of auxiliaries and cavalry. Caesar's lines were probably eight men deep. That would give each legion, estimated at 3600 men, a front of 180 legionaries, 45 for each cohort. When standing in open order for fighting, giving to each man the space necessary for the free use of
								his weapons, the front of each legion covered probably about 1000 feet, supposing the cohorts to stand close together; all this, however, is very uncertain.
							</p>
							<p>When an attacking enemy had reached the right distance, the bugle sounded the charge, and the legions rushed forward, sword in sheath, and the front ranks with spears uplifted ready to hurl. When within range, the spears were thrown in a shower, the swords drawn, and a fierce charge made upon the mass of the foe, more or less disordered by the volley of spears. Along the front of the cohort rages a series of combats. The rear ranks press forward, throw their spears over the heads of their comrades, and take their places as the latter are wounded or weary. When the first line of cohorts has done its best, it makes room for the second line, re-forms, and gets breath for a new onset. Thus the battle goes on with the two <pb n="xlii"/>lines in almost constant motion. The enemy are given no rest and are worn out by the repeated charges of the cohorts. The third line, however, is held in reserve, and is brought into action only in case the other two prove insufficient.
							</p>
							<p>The cavalry in the rear, or on the wings, stand ready when the enemy break and flee to ride down the fugitives and cut them to pieces.
							</p>
							<p>There were times when troops had to be arranged in special formations. The most important of these were the <foreign lang="la">cuneus</foreign>, or wedge, the <foreign lang="la">testudo</foreign>, or tortoise, and the <foreign lang="la">orbis</foreign>, or circle. The first was an attack in column instead of in line, and was of use in cutting through and dividing an opposing battle line. The second, in which the shields overlapped above like shingles on a roof, was used especially in approaching and storming walls, or whenever the enemy were to be driven from a higher position (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 2.6">Bk. ii. 6</bibl>; see Fig. <xref n="fig.068" targOrder="U">68</xref>). The last formation was like a modern hollow square with officers in the centre &mdash; except that from the character of ancient fighting it was rather circular than rectangular. It was necessary when the attack came from all sides at once (see <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 4.37">Bk. iv. 37</bibl>).
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="8"><head>The Siege.</head>
							
							<p>The Romans excelled in the art of taking walled cities, and this skill gave them an immense advantage in their warfare with semi-barbarous and ignorant peoples. There were three methods of doing this: first, by an
								immediate attack (<foreign lang="la">oppugnatio repentina</foreign>); second, by an active siege,
								brought to a close by an assault  (<foreign lang="la">expugnatio</foreign>); third, by investment and blockade (<foreign lang="la">obsidio</foreign>).
							</p>
							<p>If there seemed to be a chance of success, a city was stormed at once with no formal preparation (<foreign lang="la">ex itinere</foreign>). Its defenders were driven from the walls by a shower of missiles (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 3.25">Bk. iii. 25</bibl>); the moat was filled with brush and earth; the assaulters with shields locked in a <foreign lang="la">testudo</foreign>attempted to break open the gates or scale the walls with ladders.
							</p>
							<p>If this method proved unsuccessful or impossible, a regular siege was begun. The work of a regular siege centred about the mound or<foreign lang="la">agger</foreign>, and to its construction everything else was subordinated. <pb n="xliii"/>It was begun at a distance from the wall, very nearly out of reach of the missiles of the enemy. It was then gradually extended in the direction of the point to be attacked, and was at the same time gradually increased in height until on a level with the top of the wall, or even higher. At Avaricum the mound was 80 feet high (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.23">Bk. vii. 23-28</bibl>.)  Its width was possibly 40 or 50 feet. It was made of earth and timber, and hadconnected galleries running through its various stories, through which the
								soldiers could move under cover (see Fig. <xref n="fig.120" targOrder="U">120</xref>). The men engaged in constructing the <foreign lang="la">agger</foreign> had to be protected from the enemy. Those who were building worked behind lines of <foreign lang="la">plutei</foreign> (see Figs. <xref n="fig.130" targOrder="U">130</xref>, <xref n="fig.131" targOrder="U">131</xref>), large standing shields which were moved forward from time to time as the <foreign lang="la">agger</foreign> progressed. Those bringing material for the builders walked under rows of sheds called <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign> (see Figs. <xref n="fig.033" targOrder="U">33</xref>, <xref n="fig.120" targOrder="U">120</xref>), extending the length of the <foreign lang="la">agger</foreign>. The workmen were protected also by archers and slingers and by
								engines of war (<foreign lang="la">tormenta</foreign>) standing behind lines of <foreign lang="la">plutei</foreign> or upon movable towers (<foreign lang="la">turres</foreign>).  The latter stood on the <foreign lang="la">agger</foreign> or on either side of it, and advanced with it, and as they advanced increased in height story by story. As the workmen get nearer the wall the <foreign lang="la">plutei</foreign> will no longer protect them. Then they find refuge under strong sheds of wood called <foreign lang="la">testudines</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">musculi</foreign>, placed at the ends of lines of <foreign lang="la">vineae.</foreign>
							</p>
							<p>When the mound has reached the wall, a breach is made through it for the final assault  (<foreign lang="la">expugnatio</foreign>). Sometimes this was accomplished by undermining the wall, or it was pulled down from the top with huge iron hooks (<foreign lang="la">falces murales</foreign>). But the most common and most effective means was the battering ram (<foreign lang="la">aries</foreign>), a huge swinging beam from 60 to loo feet long with a heavy mass of metal at one end, often shaped like a ram's head. This under a <foreign lang="la">testudo</foreign>, or in the lowest story of a tower, was brought with tremendous force against the opposing masonry. When the final assault was made, soldiers rushed in from every quarter, over the mound, through the breach, and from the movable towers, from whose highest stories drawbridges stretched to the walls.
							</p>
							<p>Against these forms of assault the inhabitants used such means of resistance as they could. The most effective were masses of stone, thrown from the wall upon the works, and fire. To guard against <pb n="xliv"/>the latter, the besiegers had to cover all exposed woodwork with green hides. Battering rams and mural hooks were caught in slings and held fast, or drawn into the city, and mines were met by countermines. See Figs. <xref n="fig.092" targOrder="U">92</xref>, <xref n="fig.093" targOrder="U">93</xref>, <xref n="fig.127" targOrder="U">127</xref>.
							</p>
							<p>When the location of the place was such that it could not be taken by such a siege as that described above, it was invested on every side (<foreign lang="la">obsidio</foreign>) and the inhabitants starved into submission. Among sieges of this kind were those of Gergovia (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.44">Bk. vii. 44-53</bibl>) and Alesia (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.72">Bk. vii. 72-80</bibl>), of which the last was one of the most remarkable of ancient times see Figs. <xref n="fig.097" targOrder="U">97</xref>,<xref n="fig.102" targOrder="U">102</xref>.
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="9">
							<head>The Fleet.</head>
							
							<p>Caesar mentions two principal classes of ships: <foreign lang="la">naves longae</foreign>,  or war galleys, and <foreign lang="la">naves onerariae</foreign>, or freight and transport vessels. As compared with the former, the latter were shorter, broader, and deeper; hence could carry greater burdens and were more seaworthy. They depended mainly on their sails, but often had rowers in addition. The <foreign lang="la">naves actuariae</foreign> of <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.1">Bk. v. 1</bibl> were a special class of transport vessel, with both sails and oars. Caesar used them to carry troops, horses, and munitions of war to Britain. See Figs. <xref n="fig.048" targOrder="U">48</xref>, <xref n="fig.051" targOrder="U">51</xref>, <xref n="fig.052" targOrder="U">52</xref>.
							</p>
							<p>The war galley was long, low, and narrow; armed at the prow with a sharp beam (<foreign lang="la">rostrum</foreign>) shod with bronze, for ramming the enemy's ships; and propelled
								by one or two sails and a large force of rowers. The seamen (<foreign lang="la">nautae</foreign>) attended to the steering and the managing of the sails, and were freemen.  The rowers (<foreign lang="la">remiges</foreign>) were usually slaves. Galleys in Caesar's time mostly had three banks of oars. The steering apparatus was two broad-bladed oars near the stern, one on each side. The speed of these vessels was remarkable, almost equalling that of a modern steamship.
							</p>
							<p>The fighting men were the legionaries embarked for the purpose. In fact, there was no distinct naval service, as with us. A fleet was simply an army afloat, and was commanded by military officers. Before going into action <foreign lang="la">tormenta</foreign> are placed on the deck, and also a <foreign lang="la">turris</foreign>; the mast was taken down and the sails and tackle housed.

					<div1 type="chapter" n="3"><head>Gaul and the Gauls.</head>
						
						<p></p>
						<div2 type="section" n="1"><head>I. THE GALLIC PROVINCE.</head>
							
							<p>The district upon whose government Caesar entered in the spring of <date value="-58">B. C. 58</date> consisted primarily of the two Gallic provinces, Cisalpine and Transalpine. Cisalpine Gaul was the northern portion of Italy, which several centuries earlier had been occupied by invaders from Gaul proper, and was not yet reckoned politically as a part of Italy; it was a wealthy, populous, and orderly country, the proconsul's main dependence for troops and supplies, and his regular winter residence. Transalpine or Narbonnese Gaul received its name from its capital, the Roman colony Narbo. It contained some thriving cities and peaceful districts; but as a whole it had been but recently brought under the authority of Rome, and was still essentially a foreign country. It comprised the whole coast of the Mediterranean from the Pyrenees to the Alps, having for its northern boundary an irregular and uncertain line, which separated the territory of the conquered nations of Gaul from the states which were still free. To these two provinces was added also Illyricum, which was a source of strength, but did not receive much of his attention.
							</p>
							<p>The authority of the governor over his province was that of a military commander, whose power was not limited by the laws which protected the citizens of Rome. A few privileged cities or nations such as the old Greek city Massilia, were wholly exempted from his authority; but all other parts of theprovince, including Roman colonies like Narbo, were liable to tribute and under the jurisdiction of the governor, though the rights of Roman citizens were secured to them. A consular army consisted regularly of two legions; to these were added auxiliaries, both foot and horse, but the governor had power to levy new legions as he required them. Thus we find that Caesar had six legions in his campaign against the Nervii.
							</p>
							<p>The free territories adjoining a Roman province were in no respect under the authority of the governor; but they were regarded as a legitimate field for his ambition, if there was any excuse for war, and <pb n="xlvi"/>of such excuses there was usually no lack. The Roman policy was to enter into friendly relations with one of the parties or tribes in the free territory, load this with favors and privileges, and make use of it to overcome its rivals; in Gaul the Haedui, attached to Rome through some local rivalries, very well served this purpose.
							</p>
							<p>Caesar's province, at its western extremity, reached to Spain, a country which had belonged to the empire for more than a hundred and fifty years. To the north lay four great nationalities, with all of which he was ultimately brought in contact. These were the Gauls proper, the Belgians, the Germans, the Britons.
							</p>
							<p>Free Gaul (<foreign lang="la">Libera Gallia</foreign>) at that time consisted of all the unsubdued
								territory between the Pyrenees and the ocean on the one side, and the Rhine and the Alps on the other, thus comprising, in general, modern France and Belgium, with parts of Holland, Germany, and Switzerland. The central portion of this territory, fully a half of it in extent and population, was occupied by the Gauls proper, or, as they called themselves, Celts, no doubt originally the same word. Southwest of these were the Aquitani, a separate people of Iberian race, cognate to the Spanish; of these, the Basques of the present day are the representatives. To the northeast lived the Belgians, whose ethnic affinities are much disputed; all that can be considered certain is that they were largely mixed with Germans. The Belgians occupied more territory than is now known as Belgium, including a considerable part of Holland on the one hand, and the northern belt of France on the other.
							</p></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>The Gallic People.</head>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="a"><head>Origin and Early History.</head>
								
								<p>The Gauls were a branch of the great nations of the Indo-European family that in prehistoric times occupied parts of Asia and the greater part of Europe. They were known to the ancients as Celts or Gauls, and this name was applied without discrimination to all the barbarous peoples of the unknown west of Europe. The term was rather geographical than racial. The Romans, though they had been brought into contact with the barbarians of the north by war and commerce for many centuries, made no distinction, before Caesar's time, between German and Gaul.
								</p>
								<p><pb n="xlvii"/>The Phoenicians, those pioneer traders and intrepid sailors of antiquity, had had commercial dealings with the Gauls at a very remote period. Several centuries later, but still at an early date (about <date value="-600">B. C. 600</date>), the Greeks had made a settlement near the mouth of the Rhone, which afterwards grew into the prosperous city of Massilia (Marseilles), and opened up some trade routes into the interior. Both Phoenicians and Greeks found the most powerful part of the Celts already well established in western Europe, and showing evidence of previous possession for a period going back of any assignable date.
								</p>
								<p>The Celts had been for centuries a migratory and always a warlike people. These characteristics led them into many countries where they made settlements of more or less importance. Besides those who occupied Gaul proper, there were Iberian Celts (Celtiberi) in Spain, British Celts, Belgic Celts, Italian Celts in northern Italy, Celts in the Alps (notably the Helvetii), Illyrian Celts, and Asiatic Celts, who had settled in Asia Minor and were known as Galatians. It was to them, after they were Christianized, that Paul wrote his well-known epistle.
								</p>
								<p>What knowledge the Greeks and Romans had of this powerful nation of barbarians was extremely vague. They had long hung like a dark storm-cloud on the northern frontier of both countries, and at intervals poured forth in overwhelming and destructive numbers. Once they spread desolation and dismay through Greece, and all but succeeded in plundering the rich temple of Delphi. In <date value="-390">B. C. 390</date> Rome was destroyed by these same barbarians, and in <date value="-102">B. C. 102</date> it was only the military genius of C. Marius that spared Italy a similar visitation.
								</p>
								<p>Long before the time of Caesar, the Romans had succeeded in subduing the Gauls south of the Alps, making the prosperous and orderly province of Cisalpine Gaul, as related above. Transalpine Gaul and Illyricum were more recent additions to the empire, and were less thoroughly subdued and civilized. They had been finally conquered by Q. Fabius Allobrogicus. All to the north had as yet been unexplored and uninvaded by Roman arms. The Gauls, according to circumstances and location, showed at this time various degrees of civilization. Those to the south and west, being nearer to the refinement of the province, had made rapid strides, had built many <pb n="xlviii"/>flourishing cities, enjoyed prosperous and on the whole peaceful community life, and practiced the arts and commerce. But those farther removed in the east and north, and the Britons, were still in a semi-savage condition. Caesar's expeditions among these are somewhat like similar military expeditions that nations are sending in our day to explore and subdue unknown Africa; and the trading posts established among them by the enterprising Greek merchants of Massilia, like the business ventures formerly sent among the Indians.
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="b"><head>Character and Customs.</head>
								
								<p>The Gauls are described as tall and of great physical strength, with a fair skin and blonde hair, which they often reddened by artificial means. Men of rank and of authority wore the hair andbeard long. The more barbarous tribes gave themselves a terrible aspect by painting hideous devices on their half-naked bodies. Their voices were rough and harsh, their words few, and their language obscure and figurative. Disparaging others, boastful of themselves, arrogant, fond of idleness, they were very quarrelsome and always ready to fight, to relieve the monotony of their existence, if for no other reason. They were,
									however, high-spirited and brave to utter recklessness and contempt for death.
								</p>
								<p>The Gallic women are described by an ancient writer as the most beautiful of all barbarian women and as thrifty housewives. He adds that, aided by his wife, who is much more formidable than he, the Gaul will hold his own in any conflict. The Roman invaders were often witnesses of the heroism of these veritable Amazons.
								</p>
								<p>The Gauls lacked stability of character, and are often criticized by Caesar for their fickleness; they were also very avaricious and given to superstitions. On the other hand, they were not vicious, but naturally of a simple and teachable disposition. They were very quick to learn and adopt whatever useful arts their neighbors brought to them. Their love of freedom was passionate; but their long years of wandering had not developed in them that feeling of national unity and that love of the soil that we include under the term patriotism.
								</p>
								<p>The life of the less civilized tribes was rude in the extreme. Their houses were little more than huts of clay and wood, thatched with straw and branches. The dwelling was open to daylight by the door <pb n="xlix"/>alone, and had little or no furniture. Their beds were heaps of straw or furs. War was their principal occupation. They gave some attention to agriculture, raising the coarser grains, the better sort of fruits and vegetables being unknown to them. They also had large flocks and herds. They ate but little bread, but large quantities of meat, which they are described as cutting with their swords and eating in a ravenous manner.
								</p>
								<p>The Gauls knew something of the arts and sciences. They did some weaving, and those on the coast had skill in shipbuilding and in navigation, and the Aquitanians were skilful miners Their attempts at art were mainly imitations of what other lands brought to them. For example, they made more or less successful attempts to imitate the artistic coins of the Greeks and Romans. Several illustrations of Gallic coins may be found in the text (see Figs. <xref n="fig.029" targOrder="U">29</xref>, <xref n="fig.064" targOrder="U">64</xref>, <xref n="fig.066" targOrder="U">66</xref>, <xref n="fig.081" targOrder="U">81</xref>, etc., etc.). Caesar was the first to bring to the world authentic information about most of these matters, and the student is referred for farther interesting details to his narrative (see especially Bk. vi).
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="c"><head>Dress.</head>
								
								<p>The details of Gallic dress are not fully known. Like most semi-civilized
									or savage people, they were very fond of bright colors and finery. They wore much jewelry &mdash; both men and women &mdash; of gold, if they could afford it, otherwise of bronze. Especially characteristic was the heavy collar of twisted gold (<foreign lang="la">torquis</foreign>, see Fig. <xref n="fig.077" targOrder="U">77</xref>), worn about the neck. The principal garments were a short; bright-colored tunic, either with or without sleeves, confined by a girdle of silver or gold, and trousers (<foreign lang="la">bracae</foreign>).  Over the shoulders was worn a short cloak (<foreign lang="la">sagum</foreign>)  often of fine material and of gorgeous color. The character of the costume depended upon the rank and wealth of the wearer. The feet were protected by shoes or by soles of wood strapped on with leathern thongs. See Fig. <xref n="fig.028" targOrder="U">28</xref>.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="d"><head>Arms and Military Tactics.</head>
								
								<p>As has been said, a Gaul's chief business was war. He was always a soldier and, whether in youth or in old age, hastened to war with the same ardor. His principal weapon was a long two-edged sword, hanging from an iron or steel chain at the right side. It was adapted for striking and cutting, but not so much for thrusting, and was but poorly tempered. This in itself gave the Romans a great advantage through the superiority of their arms. The Gallic bronze sword came into use later, <pb n="l"/>and was a much better weapon. In Caesar's time the iron sword probably still predominated. They had also various kinds of pikes, lances, and javelins, some made with peculiar waving and
									twisted blades to cause an uglier wound. Many weapons are mentioned with special names, but they are not capable of identification. Bows and slings,too, were used by them.
								</p>
								<p>Ordinarily the Gaul wore no defensive armor. In fact, the common soldier went into battle with body almost bare. But the principal warriors wore chain mail (see Fig. <xref n="fig.086" targOrder="U">86</xref>), which is said to be a Gallic invention. At first this was made of iron. Later, better and lighter suits were made of bronze, and were sometimes adorned with silver and gold. The usual means for defence were the helmet and the shield. Shields were of various shapes and sizes and were adorned with figures of animals, etc., to suit the caprice or wealth of the owner, but the designs were of ancient origin. The helmets were surmounted with great horns, forms of birds or beasts, etc., designed to terrify the enemy (see Fig. <xref n="fig.011" targOrder="U">11</xref>). These also were, no doubt, survivals of earlier barbarism.
								</p>
								<p>In battle they placed much reliance on their cavalry and in Northern Gaul and Britain on their war chariots. The infantry was arranged in great masses of men in close order, like the old Greek phalanx, with a line of shields before and on the sides, and sometimes with a roof of shields overhead, something like the <foreign lang="la">testudo</foreign> formation of the Romans. When they had drawn near, champions were accustomed to leave the ranks, and, brandishing their arms, challenge the foe to single combat. The first onset of the Gallic phalanx was terrific and often swept everything before it; but if that could be withstood, the advantage
									lay with the open and pliable order of the legion. In the latter every soldier was called into action, but in the former the great bulk of the Gallic warriors was practically imprisoned in the mass, and only those on the outside could use their arms.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="e"><head>Government.</head>
								
								<p>The Gauls were not a single nation, but a group of nations or tribes, about sixty in number, united by a very slight bond of consanguinity and common religion. These tribes, which may be loosely compared to those of the North American Indians, though most of them were at a very much higher degree of civilization, varied greatly in extent and power, the smaller ones often maintaining <pb n="li"/>only a nominal independence under the protection of some larger one. They were for the most part ruled by a turbulent and oppressive aristocracy, sometimes with an elected chief magistrate But sometimes an ambitious leader, like Orgetorix, succeeded in establishing for a time a kingly power. Thus the several states were torn by hostile parties, and were at the same time grouped into national factions, under the lead of the more powerful states. At the time of Caesar, royalty had been almost abolished, and yearly magistrates (<emph>vergobrets</emph>) were elected instead. Every year representatives from the different states met in assembly, and questions of national policy were discussed. Owing to the violent and excitable natures of the Gauls, these assemblies often ended in tumultuous scenes of disorder.
								</p>
								<p>At the commencement of war, a call to arms was sounded, to which old and young responded. The last man to appear was put to death with tortures in the presence of the assembled people.
									
								</p></div3>
							<div3 type="subsection" n="f"><head>Religion. &mdash; The Druids.</head>
								
								<p>Caesar says that the Gauls were devoted to religious matters. They were under the control of a class of priests known as Druids, who acted not only as priests, but also as arbiters and judges. By them was treasured the religious and philosophic lore of the Gauls, and to them the Gallic youth went for instruction, some of them remaining in training as long as twenty years. One of their most important doctrines was that of the transmigration of souls. Belief in immortality gave the Gauls a contempt for
									death which enabled them to face the greatest dangers without flinching.
								</p>
								<p>The Druids gave their instructions and performed their bloody sacrifices in the depths of the forest. The oak and the mistletoe were sacred in their eyes. The mysterious rites of their worship are not well known, but many cruel and horrible practices are attributed to them by ancient writers, among them human sacrifices. Caesar mentions these, but did not know of their actual occurrence from personal observation.
								</p>
								<p>The principal religious observances of the Gauls were gradually abolished under Roman rule, but many of them were 'baptized' into Christianity and survive to-day in various modified forms as a part of the popular religion.
									<pb n="lii"/></p>
								<p>The strange monuments of stone found in many lands, called 'cromlechs' and 'menhirs,' popularly supposed to be Druidic monuments, are far older than the Druids and have nothing to do with their religion.
								</p>
								<p>Caesar gives the first authentic information about the Druids in his narrative (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.13">Bk. vi. 13-16</bibl>).
									
								</p></div3></div2>
						<div2 type="section" n="3"><head>SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF GAUL.</head>
							
							<p>Caesar left Gaul subdued and open to Roman occupation and greed. The country was rapidly colonized and civilized. Augustus divided it into four provinces and established the Roman authority on a firm basis. Only one great patriotic uprising occurred after Caesar's time, though the Gauls took part in the contests later for the imperial throne. In course of time the very language of Gaul became Latin, and this became the parent of modern French. In the fifth century tribes of Germans began to make inroads on the Roman domain, and the Franks, under Clovis as king, firmly established themselves in the north. Their power spread; they subjugated the inhabitants, and gave their name to the country, which it bears to this day, &mdash; France, the lands of the Franks. There were many social and political changes after this time, but the same life flowed on from Roman Gaul to modern France. The French still display many of the characteristics of the ancient Gauls; they live in substantially the same limits; many of their mountains, cities, and streams still bear the old names.
							</p></div2></div1>
					<div1 type="chapter" n="4"><head>The Britons.</head>
						
						<p>With Caesar begins the history of England. He found there a Celtic people, differing but little from those on the continent, save that they were more barbarous. What the condition or history of the British Isles was before Caesar's invasion is wrapped in obscurity. A few Greek writers refer vaguely to them, and there was an equally vague knowledge of the smaller islands Iying near. Even Caesar <pb n="liii"/>gained but little detailed and accurate knowledge of the country, and after him the Romans did not go there for nearly one hundred years. Subsequently it was subdued and brought under Roman dominion. England still shows many traces of the Roman occupation. Many of her cities were founded by the Romans and bear Roman names. After the Romans came the northern invaders, who drove out or destroyed most of the original Celtic population. Those that survived are represented to-day by the Irish, the Welsh, and the Highland Scotch, among whom a branch of the Celtic language is still spoken to a considerable extent.
							
						</p></div1>
					<div1 type="chapter" n="5"><head>The Germans.</head>
						
						<p>The Germans first appear in history in the campaigns of the Cimbri and Teutones (<date value="-113">B. C. 113</date>-101), the latter of whom were undoubtedly of Germanic origin. The Romans obtainedtheir first considerable knowledge of the country from Caesar. The ancient limits assigned to it were less on the west and south, but indefinitely greater
							on the east and north, than the modern. In those directions it was <foreign lang="la">terra incognita</foreign> to the Romans, and always remained so. They never did more than subdue the border tribes along the Rhine and Danube. Caesar had relatively little to do with the Germans, but made such investigations as he could, the results of which are succinctly given in his narrative (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 4.1">Bk. iv. 1-3</bibl>; <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.21">Bk. vi. 21-28</bibl>). The next account, in greater detail, was given by Tacitus in his "Germania," who corroborates Caesar in all important particulars.
						</p>
						<p>The Germans were much less civilized than most of the Gauls. They were just at the end of the nomadic stage, and were settling down and beginning community life. Their last onward nomadic movement was that under Ariovistus, which it was Caesar's fortune to arrest (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.31">Bk. i. 31-54</bibl>). They were a more manly and vigorous race than the Gauls, warlike, independent, and virtuous. The country is described as a dismal land, covered for the most
							part with forests and swamps, procuring little food. and subject to almost constant winter.
							
							<pb n="liv"/></p></div1>
					<div1 type="chapter" n="6"><head>The Campaigns in Gaul.</head>
						
						<p>The campaigns of Caesar in Gaul lasted through eight seasons (<date value="-58">B. C. 58</date>-<date value="-51">51</date>.), and are told in eight books, &mdash; the last written by Hirtius, an officer of Caesar, &mdash; each book containing the operations of a single year. The following is a brief outline:
						</p>
						<p>Book I. <date value="-58">B. C. 58</date>. Caesar checks the attempt of the Helvetians to settle in Western Gaul, and, after a bloody defeat, forces the remnant to return to their own territory. He then engages with a powerful tribe of Germans, who had made a military settlement in Eastern Gaul, and drives them, with their chief, Ariovistus, back across the Rhine.
						</p>
						<p>Book II. <date value="-57">B. C. 57</date>. A formidable confederacy of the northern populations of Gaul is suppressed, with the almost complete extermination of the bravest Belgian tribe, the <foreign lang="la">Nervii</foreign>, in a battle which seems to have been one of the most desperate of all that Caesar ever fought. In this campaign the coast towns of the west and northwest (Brittany) also are reduced to submission.
						</p>
						<p>Book III. <date value="-56">B. C. 56</date>. After a brief conflict with the mountaineers of the Alps, who attacked the Roman armies on their march, the chief operations are the conquest of the coast tribes of Brittany (<foreign lang="la">Veneti</foreign>, etc.), in a warfare of curious naval engineering in the shallow tidewater inlets and among the rocky shores. During the season, the tribes of the southwest (<foreign lang="la">Aquitani</foreign>), a mining population, allied to the Iberians or Basques, are reduced by one of Caesar's officers.
						</p>
						<p>Book IV. <date value="-55">B. C. 55</date>. An inroad of the Germans into Northern Gaul is repulsed, and Caesar follows them by a bridge of timber hastily built across the Rhine. Returning, he crosses to Britain in the early autumn for a visit of

						<head>Directions for Reading.</head>
						
						<p>As "Caesar," though in many respects a book for advanced students, is often the first Latin classic put into the learner's hands, it may be well to give a few hints as to the method of study.
						</p>
						<p>1. Before beginning to read, the learner should be familiar with the forms of Inflection, the simpler rules of Agreement and Construction of Cases and Moods (A. &amp; G. Grammar, pp. 381 ff.; G., pp. 437 ff.; H. 558), and the Definitions contained in &sect; 171-180; G. 201-209; H. 345-361.
						</p>
						<p>2. Notice at once the inflectional terminations, so that the number, case, tense, person, etc., &mdash; which show the corresponding relations of the words and ideas to each other, &mdash; may be present to your mind. If the form of the word gives several possibilities, hold them all in your mind, so far as may be, till something occurs in the progress of the sentence to settle the doubt.
						</p>
						<p>3. Always try to take in the ideas in that order in which the Latin presents them. Read every word as if it were the last on a page and you had to turn over without being able to turn back. The mind soon becomes accustomed to the order of any language, as we see by the constant and almost unnoticed inversions of common speech and poetry. If, however, you are obliged to turn back, begin again at the beginning of the sentence and proceed as before. The greatest difficulty to a beginner is his inability to remember the first parts of a complex idea. This difficulty can often be lessened by jotting down, in a loose kind of English, the words as they come in the Latin. In this way it is often easy to see what a string of words <emph>must</emph> mean, though we should never say anything like it in English.
						</p>
						<p>4. Don't try to <emph>translate formally</emph> until you have got a complete <emph>idea</emph> of some <emph>integral part</emph> of the sentence. It makes nonsense <pb n="lviii"/>to render words mechanically, without thinking the corresponding ideas.
							
							<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>
							5. From the outset, notice that the emphatic position of words plays a most important part in Latin writing, and try to feel the emphasis Of position as you read. (See Grammar, ch. 6, p. 386, and compare G. 671-687; H. 559-573.)
							
							<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>
							As an illustration of &sect; 5 we append a translation of the first chapter of Book II with especial reference to the emphasis indicated by the order. As the translation is made expressly to bring out explicitly the force of order, it should not be taken as a model of desirable translation. Such a translation as is here given forces the emphasis on the attention more than is perhaps natural in English. The force is all present in the Latin, but in English it may often he left to be brought out by the context or by some kindred emphasis which the English substitutes. A short, easy passage from Book V is also given without comment for study and practice.

They were hemmed in by the great natural barriers of the Alps, the Lake of Geneva, and the Jura Mountains on the south and west; and pressed on the north by great hordes of Germans, who kept up a continual border war. Their fields were scant, their harvests insufficient, their people hardy and fearless. Their ambitious chief, Orgetorix, had prepared them so well for this enterprise that his flight and death &mdash; when he was charged with guilty conspiracy, and put on trial for his life &mdash; caused no delay. The attempt was held in check by Caesar, during a fortnight's parley till sufficient earthworks had been thrown up along the Rhone to withstand their advance across the river; the advance was then made in force along the narrow pass between that river and the Jura. But the Helvetians did not succeed in getting more than fifty miles beyond the frontier, when they were overtaken by Caesar; who, by a few light skirmishes and two bloody battles, forced them back to their own territories, with the loss of more than 200,000 lives. This brief campaign, lasting only from March to June, is called the Helvetian War.

							<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">incolunt</lemma>:  in translation &lpar;not in reading the Latin to make out  the sense&rpar;, change the voice to the passive in order to preserve the emphasis  in the English idiom. It is well to acquire the habit of making such changes. The natural English form would be: <gloss>of which one is inhabited by the Belgians,</gloss>  etc., but the Latin uses the active voice. The moment you find an accusative beginning a sentence, if it seems from its meaning to be a direct object, you can at once think of it as a subject in the nominative <emph>&lpar;at the same time noticing that the Latin does not make it such&rpar;. </emph>The verb can then be instantly thought of as a passive and the subject as agent. This inversion is so common in Latin for purposes of rhetoric that such a device is a very helpful one, and if properly used from the start need not obscure the Latin construction. The Latin plays upon the position of words to produce all sorts of shades of rhetorical expression, and it is never too early to observe these shades and try to render them in our own idiom.&mdash; <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Belgae</lemma>: probably of the Cymric branch of the Celtic race, allied to the Britons and the modern Welsh; they inhabited the modern Belgium and northern France, and were considerably mixed with Germans &lpar;see <bibl n="Caes.

In English we have to supply a demonstrative <emph>&lpar;those&rpar; who.</emph> So here <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tertiam qui</lemma> =  <foreign lang="la">tertiam partem ei incolunt , qui</foreign> &lpar;see <bibl n="AG 307">&sect; 307.c (200.c)</bibl>; <bibl n="Gildersleeve grammar 619">G. 619</bibl>; <bibl n="Harkness grammar 445. 6">H. 445. 6</bibl>&rpar;. &mdash; <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ipsorum</lemma>, etc.: notice that the position of words is so significant in Latin, through its indicated emphasis, that it may allow words to be omitted which must be supplied in the thought. In this case the English idiom is the same: in <emph>their own</emph> tongue &hellip; in  <emph>ours.</emph>

This undoubtedly means that, after the five accessible points were strengthened by artificial defences, the entire left bank of the Rhone, from Geneva to <foreign lang="fr">Pas-de-l'Ecluse</foreign> &lpar;17 1/2 English miles&rpar;, formed a continuous barrier against the Helvetians. The construction of any one of the fortifications may be described as follows: Along the crest of the ridge facing the river the slope was cut so as to be vertical, or nearly so, and then a trench was hollowed. The earth dug out was partly thrown up to increase the height of the wall, and quite likely in part thrown down the hill. At all events, it seems probable that the measure of 16 feet is the distance from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the wall. Thus the work formed really little more than a trench with scarp higher than the counterscarp. Then the crest was fortified with a breastwork of palisades, behind which the soldiers were protected while hurling their missiles at the enemy. This entire series of works, with the force at Caesar's command, could not have occupied more than two or three days. See <xref n="fig.104" targOrder="U">Map, p. 5</xref>.

								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> This discourse, as well as Caesar's answer, is confused by a partial identification of Caesar and the Roman people. Hence, many of the forms might be either third person as referring to the Roman people, or second or first as addressed to Caesar, or spoken by him.
								
								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> The indirect discourse is found in almost all languages, and each one has its own methods of change from the direct. In English it is regularly introduced by <emph>that</emph>. This word, however, is often omitted, in which case only the <emph>persons</emph> and the <emph>tenses</emph> are changed to fit the new relations. Dependent clauses keep their connectives, but change, like others, their <emph>persons</emph> and <emph>tenses.</emph> In long passages, if <emph>that</emph> is omitted, parenthetical phrases are frequently introduced to keep the connection of the thought, like 'he said,' 'he asked,' 'he urged,' 'he begged.' The passage here may be translated: 'If the Roman people would make peace, etc. &lpar;that&rpar; the Helvetii would go &hellip; and remain where Caesar should settle them and desire them to be; but if they &lpar;the Roman people&rpar; should persist in pursuing them, etc., let him remember &lpar;he said&rpar; &lpar;or he begged him to remember&rpar;, etc. As to the fact that &lpar;because&rpar; he had attacked, etc., he should <pb n="272"/>not ascribe it, etc., or despise them &lpar;the Helvetians&rpar;. &lpar;That&rpar; they had &lpar;he said&rpar; been taught rather to contend, etc. Let him therefore not allow that place &hellip; to be,' etc. So in <xref n="s12.8" targOrder="U">12 8</xref>, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">num &hellip; posse</lemma>,  'could they, he asked.'

							</p><div3 type="overview"><p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARIOVISTUS. &mdash; The latter half of this Book is taken up with the expulsion of a military settlement of Germans, which had been made a few years before under Ariovistus, a chief of the Suevi.
								
								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> The occasion of this new campaign was the following: The Haedui, jealous of the Sequani, who lived a little to the north, had laid excessive tolls on their trade, which consisted chiefly in the export of salted meats for the southern market. This led to a war, in which the Sequani had invited the aid of the Germans under Ariovistus, about three years before the campaign of Caesar. The Germans, once in Gaul, had exacted a large share of territory and proved to be grasping and oppressive masters. Meanwhile the Helvetian war began to threaten. The Roman Senate, to make safe, passed the decrees before mentioned, promising favor and friendship to the Haedui &lpar;<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1. 11">ch. 11</bibl>&rpar;; and at the same time sent messengers to Ariovistus, saluting him as king and friend &lpar;<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1. 35">ch. 35</bibl>&rpar;, recognizing his claims on Gaul, and, it was said, inviting him to Rome. This was the year before, in Caesar's consulship. Now, however, that the fear of the Helvetians was passed, Caesar found himself obliged to take sides in the old quarrel.

In that vicinity he held a council of the Gallic chiefs &lpar;<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1. 30">ch. 30</bibl>&rpar;, but whether he remained there is not stated. He probably came towards the north in the direction of Langres.

								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> This speech, one of the most remarkable, if not of the most famous, of antiquity, stamps Caesar as a consummate orator as well as an able general. His whole fortunes may be said to have depended on this campaign, at the outset of which he is confronted with a mutiny. By this skillfully contrived address, in which he glosses over the difficulties of the undertaking, which he must have known well; he contrives to inspire in his soldiers the Roman spirit, which was invincible whenever it was really roused. Caesar's marvellous conquest of Gaul depended quite as much on the devotion of his soldiers as on his unequalled ability as a general.

The account of Caesar's march would seem to point to some place from thirty to fifty miles beyond Belfort, and accordingly it has been located by some near Cernay and by others near Gemar, twenty miles farther down the valley. Perhaps it may have been even nearer the gap than Cernay. The plan in the text, that of Col. Stoffel, must be taken, therefore, only as a supposable arrangement. The country is nearly the same in all that region, and a few miles can make no difference. The great point is that for the first time a Roman army ventured beyond one of the natural bounds of Gaul into the valley of the Rhine and defeated a German horde on its own ground, as it were. The campaign against <pb n="311"/>Ariovistus settled the question of sovereignty over Gaul for several centuries to come. The Germans did not gain possession of it until after the fall of the western Roman empire.

						<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>THE BELGIAN CONFEDERACY.  &mdash;  The people of Northern Gaul, including Flanders and the Netherlands, were far remote from any country hitherto occupied by the Roman arms. They lived amid forests and swamps hard to penetrate; they claimed kindred with the German tribes rather than with the more fickle and effeminate Celts; and they had a fierce and resolute spirit of independence, like that whichtheir descendants, the Dutch, exhibited long after in the same regions against the armies of Spain. The Belgian tribes, andparticularly the Nervii, appear to have offered to Caesar a more formidable and desperate resistance than any he met elsewhere until the great rising of B.C. 52. When their spirit was once broken, the conquest of the whole country was simply a question of time.

							<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Caesar, after addressing the tenth legion, passed to the right wing. Here he saw his men were hard pressed. The standards were all huddled together and the soldiers of the twelfth, massed in a solid body, were in each other's way. All the centurions of the fourth cohort had fallen, the standard-bearer was killed, and the standard lost. In the other cohorts almost all the centurions were either killed or wounded. Among these the first centurion, P. Sextius Bacuius, one of the bravest of soldiers, was disabled by many severe wounds so that he could no longer stand on his feet. The rest were showing no spirit, and some in the rear had abandoned the fight and were drawing back to get out of range of the missiles. The enemy meanwhile continued to come up in front from below without cessation, and to press them hard also on both flanks. The situation was desperate. Seeing this, and realizing that there were no reserves that could be sent in, Caesar snatched a shield from a man in the rear rank &mdash; he had happened to come there without a shield himself  &mdash; and advanced to the front.

					<pb n="360"/><div1 type="Book" n="4"><head>BOOK FOURTH. &mdash; B.C. 55.</head><p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE GERMANS. &mdash; The year B.C. 55 appears to have been marked by a general movement in the migration of the German tribes. An advance, consisting of two tribes, tile Usipetes and Tencteri, crowded forward by the more powerful Suevi, crossed the lower Rhine into northern Gaul. Caesar assumed the defence of the country he had just conquered, drove them back across the Rhine, followed them up by an expedition into their own territories, and fully established the supremacy of the Roman arms. Another brief campaign in Germany two years later confirmed this success, and the Rhine became the military frontier, recognized for many centuries, between the Roman Empire and the barbarian world.

The width of the river  at either place is about 1400 feet, and its depth is very variable. It is now crossed in these parts by floating bridges of boats.

The brief description which Caesar gives of his rough and ready but very serviceable engineering may be made clearer by giving its different points as follows &lpar;see Fig. <xref n="fig.059" targOrder="U">59</xref>&rpar;:
								
								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> 1. A pair of unhewn logs, a foot and a half thick &lpar;<foreign lang="la">tigna bina sesquipedalia</foreign>&rpar;, braced two feet apart and sharpened at the end, are set up by derricks and driven with pile drivers &lpar;<foreign lang="la">fistucis</foreign>&rpar; into the bottom, sloping a little with the stream.
								
								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> 2. A similar pair is driven in opposite, 40 feet below, sloping a little in the other direction against the stream ; the upper ends of the two pairs would thus be some 25 or 30 feet apart, the width of the roadway. It is possible, as Rustow thinks, that the 40 feet refer to the top and not to the bottom of the piles.
								
								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> 3. A beam of square timber, two feet thick &lpar;<foreign lang="la">trabs bipedalis</foreign>&rpar;, and about 30 feet long, is made fast at the ends by ties &lpar;<foreign lang="la">fibulis</foreign>&rpar; between the logs of each pair, &mdash; which are thus kept at a proper distance apart, while they are strongly braced against the current.
								
								<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> 4. A suitable number &lpar;probably about 60&rpar; of these trestles, or timber-arches, having been built and connected by cross-ties,&mdash;this part of the structure must be taken for granted,&mdash;planks are then laid lengthwise of the bridge &lpar;<foreign lang="la">directa materia</foreign>&rpar;, resting on the heavy floor-timbers ; and upon these, again, saplings and twigs &lpar;<foreign lang="la">longurii</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">crates</foreign>&rpar; are spread, to prevent the jar and wear of the carts and hoofs of the pack-animals on the flooring.
								
								<pb n="368"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> 5.

						<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><head>FIRST INVASION of BRITAIN.</head><p>What is called the First Invasion of Britain though it marks an interesting date in history, gave fresh stimulus to Roman curiosity and ambition, and had a significant moral effect, was in itself an affair of stroll account. It was, in fact, only meant for a reconnaissance, or, perhaps, to open the way to further schemes. Towards the end of summer, Caesar sailed across to the cliffs of Dover, coasted a few miles towards the west, and established a camp <pb n="370"/>on the British coast.  His cavalry, meanwhile, had been weatherbound in their transports, and then, after crossing, were driven back by rough winds, so that they did not even come to land. After holding an uneasy and perilous position for about three weeks, he returned to Gaul, without accomplishing anything beyond a barren display of daring. This expedition was, in fact, only intended for a 'demonstration.' Yet, as the beginning of the national history of England, the event assumes great interest and importance, so that it has given rise to volumes of comment and discussion both in France and England.

					<div1 type="Book" n="5"><head>BOOK FIFTH.&mdash;B.C. 54.</head><p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> SECOND INVASION OF BRITAIN.&mdash;The landing of the previous year had been only a reconnaissance.  Caesar now determines upon a regular advance and occupation. The earlier part of the season was chiefly taken up with naval preparations. The ships were apparently built on the inland streams, and the rigging and outfit brought from Spain, which was considerably in advance of Gaul in civilization. It abounded in metals, and, in particular, furnished the <emph>esparto</emph>, or Spanish grass, whose long, tough fibre made the best of cordage. Caesar sails &lpar;by the reckoning of Napoleon III&rpar; on the 20th of July from <foreign lang="la">Portus Itius</foreign>, at or near Boulogne, drifting first with wind and tide some distance to the northeast, then making his way to his former landing.

Though immersed up to his chin in water, he was expert in plying his hatchet against the stakes which opposed his progress, while he held his buckler over his head not less steadily than on dry land. Behind him a constant storm of stones and darts was impelled against the enemy from the engines which always accompanied the Roman armies."

They serve, besides, to bring out in very marked relief the personal qualities of his several lieutenants. As a series of episodes, this Book is, in fact, the most interesting of the eight. The Romans did not visit Britain again till A.D. 43, in the reign of Claudius.

BOOK SIXTH.&mdash;B.C. 53.</head><p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> SECOND PASSAGE OF THE RHINE.&mdash;The last campaign, includingthe unsuccessful expedition to Britain and the slaughter of the division of Sabinus, must have been in the eyes of the Gauls as least as good as a drawn battle, and have given them fresh hope in the struggle. The strength of their resistance was in the north and east, where they had the support of raids from across the Rhine,&mdash;a danger which it was especially the business of Caesar to check by a daring blow; hence the policyof this new, but idle, advance into Germany. It may be borne in mind that this campaign was the more critical, as it followed closely upon the defeat and destruction of the Roman armies under Crassus in the East.

					<div1 type="Book" n="7"><head>BOOK SEVENTH.&mdash;B.C. 52.</head><p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> WAR OF VERCINGETORIX.&mdash;The last three campaigns had been conducted wholly in the north, with a view either to crush the bolder and more restless northern populations, or to overawe the more barbarous Britons and Germans beyond the frontier. It is not quite clear why the discontented spirits of the south did not seize the occasion to join forces with the formidable Belgian revolt. At all events, they seemed quiet and submissive after their defeats in the earlier campaigns, and might have continued so but for the execution of Acco &lpar;<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6. 44">Bk. vi. ch. 44</bibl>&rpar;, which had aroused the spirit of all the Gallic nobility, and the news from Rome, where the hostile aristocracy had long been waiting for some opportunity to check Caesar in his career of conquest and call him home.
						
						<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This opportunity seemed to offer in the disorders which followed the death of Clodius. Clodius was a bully and professional politician belonging to the popular party, a bitter enemy of Cicero, whom he had succeeded, a few years before, in driving into exile. He was killed in a street brawl on the 20th of January of this year by Milo, a ruffian of the senatorial or aristocratic party. For the time, all regular and orderly government was at an end, till at length Pompey was invested with dictatorial powers, and quiet was restored. The news of these events coming to Gaul gave the native leaders reasonable ground to hope that a new uprising might be successful. Their plan, it will appear, was, by a sudden movement, to cut off Caesar's communications with his military posts in the north, which would thus be speedily starved into surrender. This plan Caesar foiled by striking, with his usual rapidity, through their line, and through the neutral or hostile populations of Central Gaul, and so advancing upon his assailants with the support of his legions from the north.

It lies between two small rivers, both of which fall into the Brenne, and thence into the Seine. Into this peninsula, witih the rivers on each side of him, Vercingetorix had thrown himself with 80,000 men. Alesia as a position was impregnable except to famine.  The water supply was secure. The position was of extraordinary strength.  The rivers formed natural trenches. Below the town, to the west, they ran parallel for three miles through an open alluvial plain before they reached the Brenne. In every other direction rose rocky hills of equal height with the central plateau, originally perhaps one wide tableland, through which the water had ploughed out the valley. To attack Ver-<pb n="440"/>cingetorix where he had placed himself was out of the question; but to blockade him there, to capture the leader of the insurrection and his whole and so in one blow mal;e an end with it, on a survey of the situation seemed not impossible."&mdash;<bibl>Froude's "Caesar."</bibl> See plan, Fig. <xref n="fig.103" targOrder="U">103</xref>.

							<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From 1862 to 1865 careful excavations were made under direction of the emperor Napoleon III on the site of the works at Alesia. The discoveries that resulted were most interesting. There were found the remains of Caesar's four infantry camps and of his four cavalry camps. Of the twenty-three redoubts, remains of only five could be traced. It is likely that the rest were mostly of wood, so that they had crumbled entirely away. <pb n="447"/>The trench twenty feet wide remains in its entirety. Of the pits &lpar;<foreign lang="la">scrobes</foreign>&rpar; in which the sharp stakes were buried, more than fifty were discovered.  They are all three feet deep, two feet wide at the top, and one foot wide at the bottom. Of course they do not retain the original dimensions. In the trenches were found a great number of coins, lkoman and Gallic, swords, daggers, spear-heads, and the like. The result of these researches was a very striking corroboration of Caesar's narrative.

						<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Caesar's own narrative closes with the great and decisive victory at Alesia. The short remainder of the story is told by his faithful officer and friend, Hirtius Pansa, in the Eighth Book. A rising of the Carnutes and Bituriges in the west, undeterred by the fate of Avaricum, was crushed by  a rapid winter march across the Loire. The Remi in the north, who alone of the Gauls had been steadily true to Rome, were attacked in retaliation by the Bellovaci under Commius, but were crushed in a single battle, and Commius fled to Germany. The final rally of the patriot party was made at the stronghold of Uxellodunum, on a branch of the Garonne, in the southwest; but this was also reduced by a siege of extreme difficulty, and the one act of vindictive barbarity which stains Caesar's record was  inflicted after its fall by cutting off the hands of the desperate defenders who  had held out to the last for the independence of Gaul. Caesar then "invited the chiefs of all the tribes to come to him. He spoke to them of the future which lay open to them as members of a splendid imperial state. He gave them magnificent presents. He laid no impositions either on the leaders or their people; and they wells to their homes personally devoted to their conqueror, contented with their condition, and resolved to maintain the peace which was now established,&mdash;a unique experience in political history."</p>
