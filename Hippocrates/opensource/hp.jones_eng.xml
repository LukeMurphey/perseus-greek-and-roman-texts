				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> works, some seventy in all, which in any
					of our manuscripts are assigned to Hippocrates,
					comprise what is called the " Hippocratic collection."
					During nearly three centuries there appeared
					many editions, of some or of all of these works,
					intended to instruct medical students or practitioners.
					The birth of modern medical science
					in the nineteenth century stopped finally this
					long series, but a few scholars still worked at
					the treatises from an historical standpoint. The
					literary merit, however, of the Hippocratic writings,
					at least of the majority, is not great, and it is
					only within the last few years that they have been
					subjected to the exact scholarship which has thrown
					such a flood of new light upon most of the classical
					authors. Even now very little has been done for
					text, dialect, grammar and style, although the
					realization of the value of the collection for the
					history of philosophy is rapidly improving matters.
					So for the present a translator must also be, in part,
					an editor. He has no scholarly tradition behind
					him upon which to build, but must lay his own
					foundations.</p>
				<p>It will be many years before the task is finished,
					but in the meanwhile there is work for less ambitious
					students. My own endeavour has been to make as
					clear and accurate a translation as the condition of</p>
				<pb id="p.viii"/>
				<p>the text permits, introducing as few novelties of my
					own as possible, and to add such comment as may
					bring out the permanent value of the various treatises.
					They are no longer useful as text-books, but all of
					us, whether medical or lay, may learn a lesson from
					the devotion to truth which marked the school of
					Cos, and from the blunders committed by theorizers
					who sought a short cut to knowledge without the
					labour of patient observation and careful experiment.</p>
				<p>The present volume has been in preparation since
					1910, and the actual writing has occupied all my
					leisure for the past three years. The time would
					have been longer, had it not been for the great kindness
					of Dr. E. T. Withington, whose name will
					probably appear on the title-page of one of the
					succeeding volumes.</p>
				<p>My thanks are also due to the Rev. H. J. Chaytor
					for his helpful criticisms.</p>

			<div1 type="text" n="intro"><head>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</head>
				<div2 type="chapter"><head>1.  Greek Medicine and Hippocrates</head>
					<p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> have learned to associate, almost by instinct,
						the science of medicine with bacteria, with chemistry,
						with clinical thermometers, disinfectants, and all the
						apparatus of careful nursing. All such associations,
						if we wish even dimly to appreciate the work of
						Hippocrates and of his predecessors, we must endeavour
						to break ; we must unthink the greater part
						of those habits of thought which education has made
						second nature. The Greek knew that there were
						certain collections of morbid phenomena which he
						called diseases ; that these diseases normally ran a
						certain course ; that their origin was not unconnected
						with geographical and atmospheric environment ;
						that the patient, in order to recover his health, must
						modify his ordinary mode of living. Beyond this he
						knew, and could know, nothing, and was compelled
						to fill up the blanks in his knowledge by having
						recourse to conjecture and hypothesis. In doing so
						he was obeying a human instinct which assures us
						that progress requires the use of stop-gaps where
						complete and accurate knowledge is unattainable,
						and that a working hypothesis, although wrong, is
						better than no hypothesis at all. System, an organized
						scheme, is of greater value than chaos. Yet
						however healthy such an instinct may be, it has</p>
					<pb id="p.x"/>
					<p>added considerably to the difficulties of the historian
						in his attempts so to reconstruct the past as to make
						it intelligible to modern readers.</p>
					<p>Primitive man regards everything he cannot
						explain as the work of a god. To him the abnormal,
						the unusual, is divine. The uncharted region of
						mysterious phenomena is the peculiar realm of
						supernatural forces. "It is the work of heaven"
						is a sufficient answer when the human intelligence
						can give no satisfactory explanation.</p>
					<p>The fifth century <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi> witnessed the supreme effort
						of the Greeks to cast aside this incubus in all spheres
						of thought. They came to realize that to attribute
						an event to the action of a god leaves us just where
						we were, and that to call normal phenomena natural
						and abnormal divine is to introduce an unscientific
						dualism, in that what is divine (because mysterious)
						in one generation may be natural (because understood)
						in the next, while, on the other hand, however
						fully we may understand a phenomenon, there
						must always be a mysterious and unexplained element
						in it. All phenomena are equally divine and equally
						natural.</p>
					<p>But this realization did not come all at once,
						and in the science of medicine it was peculiarly
						slow. There is something arresting in the spread of
						an epidemic and in the onset of epilepsy or of a
						pernicious fever. It is hard for most minds, even
						scientific minds, not to see the working of a god in
						them. On the other hand, the efficacy of human
						means to relieve pain is so obvious that even in
						Homer, our first literary authority for Greek
						medicine, rational treatment is fully recognized.</p>
					<p>As the divine origin of disease was gradually</p>
					<pb id="p.xi"/>
					<p>discarded, another element, equally disturbing, and
						equally opposed to the progress of scientific medicine,
						asserted itself. Philosophy superseded religion.
						Greek philosophy sought for uniformity in the
						multiplicity of phenomena, and the desire to find
						this uniformity led to guesswork and to neglect of
						fact in the attempt to frame a comprehensive theory.
						The same impulse which made Thales declare that
						all things are water led the writer of a treatise<note>The <foreign lang="greek">PERI\ FUS1W=N</foreign>.</note> in
						the Hippocratic <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> to maintain that all diseases
						are caused by air. As Daremberg<note><hi rend="ital">Histoire des sciences m&eacute;dicales</hi>, p. 82.</note> says, " the
						philosophers tried to explain nature while shutting
						their eyes." The first philosophers to take a serious
						interest in medicine were the Pythagoreans.
						Alcmaeon<note>A young man in the old age of Pythagoras. See Aristotle
							<hi rend="ital">Meta.</hi> A 986 a 30. Alcmaeon was more interested in medicine
							than in philosophy, but does not seem to have been a
							" general practitioner."</note> of Croton, although perhaps not strictly
						a Pythagorean, was closely connected with the sect,
						and appears to have exercised considerable influence
						upon the Hippocratic school. The founder of empirical
						psychology and a student of astronomy, he held
						that health consists of a state of balance between
						certain " opposites," and disease an undue preponderance
						of one of them.<note><foreign lang="greek">*)ALKMAI/WN TH=S2 ME\N U(GIEI/AS2 EI)NAI S1UNEKTIKH\N TH\N I)S1ONOMI/AN
							TW=N DUNA/MEWN</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">U(GROU=</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">CHROU=</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">YUXROU=</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">QERMOU=</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">PIKROU=</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">GLUKE/OS2</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">KAI\

									GA\R E(KATE/ROU MONARXI/AN</foreign>.--A&eacute;tius V. 30. 1.</note> Philolaus, who flourished
						about 440 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi>, held that bile, blood, and phlegm
						were the causes of disease. In this case we have a
						Pythagorean philosopher who tried to include medical</p>
					<pb id="p.xii"/>
					<p>theory in his philosophical system.<note>For the medical theories of Philolaus see the extracts
						from the recently discovered <hi rend="ital">Iatrica</hi> of Menon, discussed by
						Diels in <hi rend="ital">Hermes</hi> XXVIII., p. 417 foll.</note> Empedocles,
						who flourished somewhat earlier than Philolaus, was
						a " medicine-man " rather than a physician, though
						he is called by Galen the founder of the Italian
						school of medicine.<note>Galen X. 5.</note> The medical side of his teaching
						was partly magic and quackery.</p>
					<p>This combination of medicine and philosophy is
						clearly marked in the Hippocratic collection. There
						are some treatises which seek to explain medical
						phenomena by <hi rend="ital">a priori</hi> assumptions, after the manner
						of the philosophers with their method of <foreign lang="greek">U(POQE/S1EIS2</foreign>
						or postulates ; there are others which strongly
						oppose this method. The Roman Celsus in his
						preface<note>Hippocrates . . . ab studio sapientiae disciplinam hanc
							separavit, vir et arte et facundia insignis.</note> asserts that Hippocrates separated medicine
						from philosophy, and it is a fact that the best works
						of the Hippocratic school are as free from philosophic
						assumptions as they are from religious dogma. But
						before attempting to estimate the work of Hippocrates
						it is necessary to consider, not only the doctrine of
						the philosophers, but also the possibly pre-Hippocratic
						books in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus.</hi> These are the <hi rend="ital">Prenotions of Cos</hi>
						and the <hi rend="ital">First Prorrhetic,</hi><note>Grimm, Ermerins and Adams are convinced of the early
							date of these. Littr&eacute; seems to have changed his mind. Contrast
							I. 351 with VIII. xxxix. The writer in Pauly-Wissowa
							is also uncertain. I hope to treat the question fully when I
							come to <hi rend="ital">Prognostic</hi> in Vol. II.</note> and perhaps the treatise--in
						Latin and Arabic, the Greek original having mostly
						perished--on the number seven (<foreign lang="greek">PERI\ E(BDOMA/DWN</foreign>).</p>
					<pb id="p.xiii"/>
					<p>The <hi rend="ital">Prenotions of Cos</hi> and the <hi rend="ital">First Prorrhetic</hi> (the
						latter being the earlier, although both are supposed
						to be earlier than Hippocrates) show that in the
						medical school of Cos great attention was paid to the
						natural history of diseases, especially to the probability
						of a fatal or not fatal issue. The <hi rend="ital">Treatise on
							Seven</hi>, with its marked Pythagorean characteristics,
						proves, if indeed it is as early as Roscher would have
						us believe, that even before Hippocrates disease was
						considered due to a disturbance in the balance of the
						humours, and health to a " coction " of them, while
						the supposed preponderance of seven doubtless exercised
						some influence on the later doctrine of critical
						days. The work may be taken to be typical of the
						Italian-Sicilian school of medicine, in which <hi rend="ital">a priori</hi>
						assumptions of the " philosophic " type were freely
						admitted. Besides these two schools there was also
						a famous one at Cnidos,<note>There are several Cnidian treatises in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus.</hi> See
							p. xxiii. The Cnidian point of view admits of defence, and
							their desire to classify was a really scientific instinct. I
							hope to treat of the Cnidians fully when I come to translate
							<hi rend="ital">Regimen in Acute Diseases.</hi></note> the doctrines of which are
						criticised in the Hippocratic treatise <hi rend="ital">Regimen in Acute
							Diseases.</hi> The defects of this school seem to have
						been :--</p>
					<p>(1) the use of too few remedies ;</p>
					<p>(2) faulty or imperfect prognosis ;</p>
					<p>(3) over-elaboration in classifying diseases.<note>The Coan school, on the other hand, sought for a unity
						in diseases. Its followers tried to combine, the Cnidians to
						distinguish and to note differences. See Littr&eacute; II. 202-204.</note></p>
					<p>We may now attempt to summarize the components</p>
					<pb id="p.xiv"/>
					<p>of Greek medicine towards the end of the
						fifth century <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi></p>
					<p>(1) There was a religious element, which, however,
						had been generally discarded.</p>
					<p>(2) There was a philosophic element, still very
						strong, which made free use of unverified postulates
						in discussing the causes and treatment--especially
						the former--of diseases.</p>
					<p>(3) There was a rational element, which relied
						upon accurate observation and accumulated experience.
						This rationalism concluded that disease
						and health depended on environment and on the
						supposed constituents of the human frame.</p>
					<p>Now if we take the Hippocratic collection we find
						that in no treatise is there any superstition,<note>A possible exception is <hi rend="ital">Decorum</hi>, which I hope to discuss
							in Vol. II.</note> in many
						there is much " philosophy " with some sophistic
						rhetoric, and among the others some are merely
						technical handbooks, while others show signs of a
						great mind, dignified and reserved with all the
						severity of the Periclean period, which, without
						being distinctively original, transformed the best
						tendencies in Greek medicine into something which
						has ever since been the admiration of doctors and
						scientific men. It is with the last only that I am
						concerned at present.</p>
					<p>I shall make no attempt to fix with definite precision
						which treatises are to be included in this
						category, and I shall confine myself for the moment
						to three--<hi rend="ital">Prognostic, Regimen in Acute Diseases,</hi> and
						<hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi> and <hi rend="ital">III.</hi> These show certain characteristics,
						which, although there is no internal clue to</p>
					<pb id="p.xv"/>
					<p>either date or authorship, impress upon the reader a
						conviction that they were written by the same man,
						and at a time before the great period of Greece had
						passed away. They remind one, in a subtle yet very
						real way, of Thucydides.<note>The resemblance struck Littr&eacute;. See Vol. I., pp. 474, 475.</note></p>
					<p>The style of each work is grave and austere.
						There is no attempt at " window-dressing." Language
						is used to express thought, not to adorn it.
						Not a word is thrown away. The first two treatises
						have a literary finish, yet there is no trace in them
						of sophistic rhetoric. Thought, and the expression
						of thought, are evenly balanced. Both are clear,
						dignified--even majestic.</p>
					<p>The matter is even more striking than the style.
						The spirit is truly scientific, in the modern and
						strictest sense of the word. There is no superstition,
						and, except perhaps in the doctrine of critical days,
						no philosophy.<note>Of course even in the greatest works of the Hippocratic
							<hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> there is, and could not help being, some theory. But
							the writer does not love the theory for its own sake. Rather
							he is constantly forgetting it in his eagerness to record
							observed fact.</note> Instead, there is close, even minute,
						observation of symptoms and their sequences, acute
						remarks on remedies, and recording, without inference,
						of the atmospheric phenomena, which
						preceded or accompanied certain "epidemics."
						Especially noteworthy are the clinical histories,
						admirable for their inclusion of everything that is
						relevant and their exclusion of all that is not.</p>
					<p>The doctrine of these three treatises may be
						summarised as follows :--<note>There is a clear account of Hippocratic doctrine in Littr&eacute;,
							Vol. L, pp. 440-464.</note></p>
					<pb id="p.xvi"/>
					<p>(1) Diseases have a natural course, which the
						physician must know thoroughly,<note>This knowledge is <foreign lang="greek">PRO/GNWS1IS2</foreign>.</note> so as to decide
						whether the issue will be favourable or fatal.</p>
					<p>(2) Diseases are caused by a disturbance<note>It is not clear whether this disturbance is regarded as
						quantitative, qualitative, or both.</note> in the
						composition of the constituents of the body. This
						disturbance is connected with atmospheric and
						climatic conditions.</p>
					<p>(3) Nature tries to bring these irregularities to a
						normal state, apparently by the action of innate heat,
						which " concocts " the " crude " humours of the body.</p>
					<p>(4) There are " critical " days at fixed dates, when
						the battle between nature and disease reaches a crisis.</p>
					<p>(5) Nature may win, in which case the morbid
						matters in the body are either evacuated or carried
						off in an <foreign lang="greek">A)PO/S1TAS1IS2</foreign>,<note>This term will be explained later. Roughly speaking,
							it means the collection and expulsion of morbid elements
							at a fixed point in the body. I translate it " abscession," a
							term which suggests " abscess," perhaps the most common
							form of an " abscession."</note> or the " coction " of the morbid
						elements may not take place, in which case the
						patient dies.</p>
					<p>(6) All the physician can do for the patient is to
						give nature a chance, to remove by regimen all that
						may hinder nature in her beneficent work.</p>
					<p>It may be urged that this doctrine is as hypothetical
						as the thesis that all diseases come from air.
						In a sense it is. All judgments, however simple,
						attempting to explain sense-perceptions, are hypotheses.
						But hypotheses may be scientific or philosophic,
						the latter term being used to denote the</p>
					<pb id="p.xvii"/>
					<p>character of early Greek philosophy. A scientific
						hypothesis is a generalization framed to explain the
						facts of experience ; it is not a foundation, but is in
						itself a superstructure ; it is constantly being tested
						by appeals to sense-experience, and is kept, modified
						or abandoned, according to the support, or want of
						support, that phenomena give to it. A "philosophic"
						hypothesis is a generalization framed with a
						view to unification rather than to accounting for all
						the facts ; it is a foundation for an unsubstantial
						superstructure ; no efforts are made to test it by
						appeals to experience, but its main support is a
						credulous faith.</p>
					<p>Now the doctrine of the <hi rend="ital">Epidemic</hi> group is certainly
						not of the philosophic kind. Some of it was undoubtedly
						derived from early philosophic medicine,
						but in this group of treatises observed phenomena
						are constantly appealed to ; nor must it be forgotten
						that in the then state of knowledge much that would
						now be styled inference was then considered fact,
						<hi rend="ital">e. g.</hi> the "coction" of phlegm in a common cold.
						Throughout, theory is in the background, observation
						in the foreground. It is indeed most remarkable
						that Hippocratic theory is hard to disentangle from
						the three works on which my argument turns. It
						is a nebulous framework, implied in the technical
						phraseology--<foreign lang="greek">PE/YIS2</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">KRI/S1IS2</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">KRA=S1IS2</foreign>--and often illustrated
						by appeal to <hi rend="ital">data</hi>, but never obtrusively
						insisted upon.</p>
					<p>In 1836 a French doctor, M. S. Houdart,<note><hi rend="ital">Etudes historiques et critiques sur la vis et la doctrine
						d'Hippocrate, et sur l'&eacute;tat de la m&eacute;decine avant lui.</hi> Paris and
						London.</note> violently
						attacked this medical doctrine on the ground that it</p>
					<pb id="p.xviii"/>
					<p>neglected the physician's prime duty,<note>" Attendre qu'il plaise &eacute; la nature de nous d&eacute;livrer de
						nos maux, c'est laisser l'&eacute;conomie en proie &eacute; la douleur, c'est
						donner le temps aux alt&eacute;rations de d&eacute;vorer nos visc&eacute;res, c'est,
						en un mot, nous conduire s&eacute;rement &eacute; la mort."--<hi rend="ital">Op. cit.</hi>
						p. 253. M. Houdart was but following the example of
						Asclepiades, the fashionable physician at Rome in the first
						century <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi>, who called the Hippocratic treatment a
						"meditation upon death."</note> which is to
						effect a cure. Diagnosis, he urges, is neglected in
						the cult of prognosis ; no attempt is made to localize
						the seat of disease ; the observations in the <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi>
						are directed towards superficial symptoms without
						any attempt to trace them to their real cause. The
						writer is an interested but callous spectator who
						looks on unmoved while his patient dies.<note>" Lisez les &eacute;pid&eacute;mies. Si votre coeur r&eacute;siste &eacute; cette
							lecture, vous l'avez de bronze. Qui peut voir en effet de
							sang-froid cette foule d'infortun&eacute;s conduits &eacute; pas lents sur
							les bords de la tombe, o&eacute; ils finissent la plupart par tomber,
							apr&eacute;s avoir souffert durant trois ou quatre mois entiers les
							douleurs les plus vari&eacute;es et les plus aigu&eacute;s ?"--<hi rend="ital">Op. cit.</hi>
							p. 246.</note></p>
					<p>In this rather rabid criticism there is a morsel of
						truth. The centre of interest in these treatises is
						certainly the disease rather than the patient. The
						writer is a cold observer of morbid phenomena, who
						has for a moment detached himself from pity for
						suffering. But this restraint is in reality a virtue ;
						concentration on the subject under discussion is
						perhaps the first duty of a scientist. Moreover, we
						must not suppose that the fatally-stricken patients
						of the <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> received no treatment or nursing.
						Here and there the treatment is mentioned or hinted
						at,<note>E.g. <hi rend="ital">Epid.</hi> III. Case <hi rend="sc">VIII</hi>. (second series) : <foreign lang="greek">QERMA/S1MATA</foreign>
							and <foreign lang="greek">O\GDO/H A)GKW=NA E)/TAMON</foreign>.</note> but the writer assumes that the usual methods</p>
					<pb id="p.xix"/>
					<p>were followed, and does not mention them because
						they are irrelevant.</p>
					<p>The charge of callousness may be dismissed. More
						serious is the attack on the fundamental principle of
						Hippocratic medicine, that " nature " alone can effect
						a cure, and that the only thing the physician can do
						is to allow nature a chance to work. Modern medical
						science has accepted this principle as an ultimate
						truth, but did the writer of the three treatises under
						discussion do his best to apply it ? Did he really
						try to serve nature, and, by so doing, to conquer
						her ? Houdart says that practically all the author
						of the <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> did was " to examine stools, urine,
						sweats, etc., to look therein for signs of coction, to
						announce crises and to pronounce sentences of
						death,"<note><hi rend="ital">Op. cit.</hi> p. 247.</note> in other words that he looked on and did
						nothing. I have just pointed out that the silence of
						the <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> on the subject of treatment must not
						be taken to mean that no treatment was given, but
						it remains to be considered whether all was done
						that could have been done. What remedies were
						used by the author of <hi rend="ital">Regimen in Acute Diseases ?</hi>
						They were :--</p>
					<p>(1) Purgatives and, probably, emetics.</p>
					<p>(2) Fomentations and baths.</p>
					<p>(3) (<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) Barley-water and barley-gruel, in the
						preparation and administering of which
						great care was to be taken.</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) Wine.</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">c</hi>) Hydromel, a mixture of honey and water ;
						and oxymel, a mixture of honey and
						vinegar.</p>
					<pb id="p.xx"/>
					<p>(4) Venesection.</p>
					<p>(5) Care was taken not to distress the patient.<note>It should be noticed that in all the Hippocratic collection
						no attention is paid to the pulse. The doctor judged whether
						a patient was feverish, and estimated the degree of fever, by
						the touch. I have not translated <foreign lang="greek">PURETO\S2 O)CU/S2</foreign> by " high
						temperature," but by " acute fever," because I wish to
						introduce as few anachronisms as possible.</note></p>
					<p>If we take into account the scientific knowledge
						of the time, it is difficult to see what more the
						physician could have done for the patient. Even
						nowadays a sufferer from measles or influenza can
						have no better advice than to keep warm and comfortable
						in bed, to take a purge, and to adopt a diet
						of slops. Within the last few years, indeed, chemistry
						has discovered febrifuges and anaesthetics, the microscope
						has put within our reach prophylactic vaccines,
						and the art of nursing has improved out of all recognition,
						but nearly all these things were as unknown
						to M. Houdart as they were in the fifth century <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi></p>
					<p>This criticism of Hippocratic medicine has been
						considered, not because it is in itself worthy of prolonged
						attention, but because it shows that underlying
						the three treatises I have mentioned there is a fundamental
						principle, a unity, a positive characteristic
						implying either a united school of thought or else a
						great personality. All antiquity agreed that they
						were written by the greatest physician of ancient
						times--Hippocrates. Within the last hundred years,
						however, doubts have been expressed whether Hippocrates
						wrote anything. Early in the nineteenth
						century a doctor of Lille published a thesis intitled
						<hi rend="ital">Dubitationes de Hippocratis vita, patria, genealogia,
							forsan mythologicis, et de quibusdam eius libris multo</hi></p>
					<pb id="p.xxi"/>
					<p><hi rend="ital">antiquioribus quam vulgo creditur.</hi> Wellmann and
						Wilamowitz hold similar views nowadays. As the
						Hippocratic writings are all anonymous, such a hypothesis
						is not difficult to maintain. But it is a matter
						of merely antiquarian interest whether or not the
						shadowy " Hippocrates " of ancient tradition is really
						the writer of the <hi rend="ital">Epidemics.</hi> The salient and important
						truth is that in the latter half of the fifth
						century works were written, probably by the same
						author, embodying a consistent doctrine of medical
						theory and practice, free from both superstition and
						philosophy, and setting forth rational empiricism of
						a strictly scientific character. If in future I call the
						spirit from which this doctrine emanated " Hippocrates "
						it is for the sake of convenience, and not
						because I identify the author with the shadowy
						physician of tradition.</p>
					<p>Similar in style and in spirit to the three treatises
						discussed above are <hi rend="ital">Aphorisms</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Airs Waters Places</hi>,
						along with two surgical works, <hi rend="ital">Fractures</hi><note>With this should be joined the work <hi rend="ital">Articulations</hi>, which
							is very closely allied to <hi rend="ital">Fractures</hi>, and is supposed by Galen
							to have been originally combined with it as a single work.
							<hi rend="ital">Instruments of Reduction</hi> appears to be a compendium of
							<hi rend="ital">Articulations.</hi></note> and <hi rend="ital">Wounds
								in the Head.</hi> The severely practical character of the
						last is particularly noteworthy, and makes the
						reader wonder to what heights Greek surgery would
						have risen had antiseptics been known. <hi rend="ital">Aphorisms</hi>
						is a compilation, but a great part shows a close
						relationship to the Hippocratic group. The least
						scientific of all the seven treatises is <hi rend="ital">Airs Waters
							Places</hi>, which, in spite of its sagacity and rejection
						of the supernatural, shows a tendency to facile and
						unwarranted generalization.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>2.  The Hippocratic Collection</head>
					<p>We are now in a position to attempt a brief
						analysis of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus Hippocraticum.</hi> For the
						moment the external evidence of Galen and other
						ancient commentators, for or against the authenticity
						of the various treatises, will be passed over. This
						evidence is of great importance, but may tend to
						obscure the issue, which is the mutual affinities of
						the treatises as shown by their style and content.</p>
					<p>In the first place the heterogeneous character of
						the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> should be observed. It contains :--</p>
					<p>(1) Text-books for physicians ;</p>
					<p>(2) Text-books for laymen ;</p>
					<p>(3) Pieces of research or collection of material for
						research.</p>
					<p>(4) Lectures or essays for medical students and
						novices.</p>
					<p>(5) Essays by philosophers who were perhaps not
						practising physicians, but laymen interested in
						medicine and anxious to apply to it the methods of
						philosophy.</p>
					<p>(6) Note-books or scrap-books.</p>
					<p>Even single works often exhibit the most varied
						characteristics. It is as though loose sheets had
						been brought together without any attempt at coordination
						or redaction. <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi>, for instance,
						jumps with startling abruptness from a " constitution "
						of the diseases prevalent at one period in
						Thasos to the function of the physician in an illness,
						passing on to a few disjointed remarks on pains in the
						head and neck. Then follows another " constitution,"
						after which comes an elaborate classification of the</p>
					<pb id="p.xxiii"/>
					<p>ordinary fevers, with their periods, paroxysms and
						crises. At the end come fourteen clinical histories.</p>
					<p>I have already mentioned a pre-Hippocratic group
						and a Hippocratic group, and it has been noticed
						that the main task of Greek medicine was to free
						science from superstition and from philosophic hypotheses.
						The <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> contains two polemical works,
						<hi rend="ital">On Epilepsy</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi>, which attack respectively
						the " divine " origin of disease and the
						intrusion into medicine of the hypothetical speculation
						of philosophers.</p>
					<p>There is another group of works which, while
						they do not display to any marked degree the
						Hippocratic characteristics, are nevertheless practical
						handbooks of medicine, physiology or anatomy. The
						list is a long one, and includes works by different
						authors and of different schools :--</p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">The Surgery.</hi></p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">The Heart.</hi></p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Places in Man.</hi></p>

					<p><hi rend="ital">Superfoetation.</hi></p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Regimen in Health.</hi><note>Really a continuation of <hi rend="ital">Nature of Man.</hi></note></p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Regimen II.</hi> and <hi rend="ital">III.</hi> with <hi rend="ital">Dreams.</hi></p>
					<p>Another most important group of works consists
						of those in which the philosophic element predominates
						over the scientific, the writers being anxious,
						not to advance the practice of medicine, but to bring
						medicine under the control of philosophic dogma,
						to achieve in fact the end attacked by the writer of
						<hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine.</hi> These works are <hi rend="ital">Nutriment, Regimen
							I.</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Airs.</hi> The first two are Heraclitean ; the
						last is probably derived from Diogenes of Apollonia.</p>
					<pb id="p.xxv"/>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Regimen I.</hi>, however, while strongly Heraclitean, is
						eclectic. Animals are said to be composed of two
						elements, fire and water, fire being a composite of
						the hot and the dry, water of the cold and the
						moist. Certain sentences are strikingly reminiscent
						of Anaxagoras, so much so that it is impossible to
						regard the resemblances as accidental. Take for
						instance the following :--</p>
					<p>(1) <foreign lang="greek">A)PO/LLUTAI ME\N OU)N OU)DE\N A(PA/NTWN XORMA/TWN</foreign>,
						<foreign lang="greek">OU)DE\ GI/NETAI O(/TI MH\ KAI\ PRO/S1QEN H)N</foreign>. <foreign lang="greek">CUMMIS1GO/MENA DE\

						<hi rend="ital">fr.</hi> 22 (Schaubach).</p>
					<p>To assign exact dates to these works is impossible,
						but they are probably much later than Heraclitus
						himself. The interesting fact remains that Heraclitus
						had followers who kept his doctrine alive,
						second-rate thinkers, perhaps, and unknown in the
						history of science, but hearty supporters of a creed,
						and ready to extend it to embrace all new know
						ledge as it was discovered. Particularly interesting
						is the work <hi rend="ital">Nutriment.</hi> This not only adopts the
						theory of Heraclitus, but also mimics his sententious
						and mysterious manner of expression. A few examples
						may not be out of place.</p>

					<p>Similar to these philosophic treatises are the
						essays, <foreign lang="greek">E)PIDEI/CEIS2</foreign> or displays, which propound theses
						which are not the <foreign lang="greek">U(POQE/S1EIS2</foreign> of philosophers. These
						are <hi rend="ital">The Art</hi>, the object of which is to show that
						there <hi rend="ital">is</hi> an art of medicine, and <hi rend="ital">Nature of Man</hi>,
						which combats the monist philosophers, and sets
						forth the doctrine of the four humours as the cause
						of health, by their perfect <hi rend="ital">crasis</hi>, and of disease,
						through a disturbance of that <hi rend="ital">crasis.</hi> To this group
						we may perhaps add the treatise <hi rend="ital">Decorum</hi>, which
						deals (among other things) with bed-side manners,
						and <hi rend="ital">Precepts</hi>, a work similar in style and subject.</p>
					<p>The last two works are interesting for their introductory
						remarks. <hi rend="ital">Decorum</hi> practically identifies
						medicine and philosophy, which term is used to
						denote the philosophic spirit, with its moral as well
						as its intellectual attributes, and recognises the
						working of an agency not human ; it is in fact
						typical of the ethical science, practical if occasionally
						commonplace, which came into vogue towards
						the end of the fourth century <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi> The introduction
						to <hi rend="ital">Precepts</hi> is Epicurean. The first chapter, in
						fact, is a summary of Epicurean epistemology, and
						is full of the technical terms of that school. A
						single quotation will suffice :--</p>
					<pb id="p.xxvii"/>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">O( GA\R LOGIS1MO\S2 MNH/MH TI/S2 E)S1TI CUNQETIKH\ TW=N MET'

							U(POKEIME/NWN</foreign>.--<hi rend="ital">Precepts</hi> I.</p>
					<p>This definition of <foreign lang="greek">LOGIS1MO/S2</foreign> is practically the same
						as that of the Epicurean <foreign lang="greek">PRO/LHYIS2</foreign> given in Diogenes
						Laertius X. 33.</p>
					<p>A few of the contents of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus Hippocraticum</hi>
						remain unclassified. Of these, by far the most
						Hippocratic are <hi rend="ital">Epidemics II., IV. VII.</hi> It is indeed
						remarkable that in antiquity they were not generally
						assigned to the " great " Hippocrates. The clinical
						histories are invaluable, although they are not so
						severely pertinent as those of <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi> and <hi rend="ital">III.</hi>,
						betraying sometimes an eye for picturesque but
						irrelevant detail.</p>
					<p>The treatise curiously misnamed <hi rend="ital">Fleshes</hi> contains,
						amid a variety of interesting anatomical and physiological
						detail, traces of Pythagoreanism in the virtue
						attached to the number seven, and of Heracliteanism
						in the view put forward that warmth is the spirit
						that pervades the universe.</p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Humours</hi> deals with the relations of humours to
						the seasons and so on.</p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">The Oath</hi> and <hi rend="ital">The Law</hi> are small but interesting
						documents throwing light on medical education and
						etiquette.</p>
					<p>Finally, the <hi rend="ital">Epistles</hi><note>It is interesting to note that the Platonic collection and
						the New Testament, like the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi>, end with a series of
						letters.</note> and <hi rend="ital">Decree</hi>, although merely
						imaginary essays, show what manner of man Hippocrates
						was supposed to have been by the Greeks
						of a later age.</p>
					<pb id="p.xxviii"/>
					<p>The Hippocratic collection is a medley, with no
						inner bond of union except that all the works are
						written in the Ionic dialect and are connected more
						or less closely with medicine or one of its allied
						sciences. There are the widest possible divergences
						of style, and the sharpest possible contradictions in
						doctrine. The questions present themselves, why
						were they united, and when did the union occur?</p>
					<p>Littr&eacute;'s problem, "When was the Hippocratic
						collection published?"<note>Vol. I., chap. xi.</note> cannot be answered, for
						it is more than doubtful whether, as a whole, the
						collection was ever published at all. The publication
						of a modern work must in no way be compared
						with the circulation of a book in ancient times.
						Printing and the law of copyright have created a
						revolution. As soon as an ancient author let go out
						of his possession a single copy of his book, it was,
						to all intents and purposes, "published." Copies
						might be multiplied without permission, and a
						popular and useful work was no doubt often circulated
						in this way. Now at least one hundred,
						perhaps three hundred, years separate the writing of
						the earliest work in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> from the writing
						of the latest. Diocles knew the <hi rend="ital">Aphorisms</hi>, Ctesias
						probably knew <hi rend="ital">Articulations</hi>, and Menon certainly
						knew two or three treatises. Aristotle himself
						quotes from <hi rend="ital">Nature of Man</hi>, though he ascribes it
						to Polybus. It is surely impossible to suppose with
						Littr&eacute; that there was anything approaching a publication
						of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> by the Alexandrian librarians.
						Even if they had published for the first time only
						a large portion of the collection, such a momentous
						event would scarcely have passed unnoticed by the</p>
					<pb id="p.xxix"/>
					<p>long series of commentators culminating in Galen.
						The librarians of Alexandria could not have done
						more than establish a canon, and if our present
						collection represents their work in this direction
						it was done very badly, as the most superficial critic
						would not fail to notice that a great part of its
						contents is neither by Hippocrates himself nor by
						his school.</p>
					<p>The Hippocratic collection is a library, or rather,
						the remains of a library. What hypothesis is more
						probable than that it represents the library of the
						Hippocratic school at Cos? The ancient biographies
						of Hippocrates relate a fable that he destroyed the
						library of the Temple of Health at Cnidos (or,
						according to another form of the fable, at Cos) in
						order to enjoy a monopoly of the knowledge it
						contained. The story shows, at least, that such
						libraries existed, and indeed a school of medicine,
						like that which had its home at Cos, could not
						well have done without one. And what would this
						library contain? The works of the greatest of the
						Asclepiads, whether published or not ; valuable
						works, of various dates and of different schools,
						bearing on medicine and kindred subjects ; medical
						records and notes by distinguished professors of
						the school, for the most part unpublished ; various
						books, of no great interest or value, presented to
						the library or acquired by chance.</p>
					<p>The Hippocratic collection actually corresponds
						to this description. This is nearly all the historian
						is justified in saying. Beyond is mere conjecture.
						We can only guess when this library ceased to be
						the property of the Hippocratic school, and how it
						was transferred to one or other of the great libraries</p>
					<pb id="p.xxx"/>
					<p>which were collected in Alexandrine times, to be
						re-copied and perhaps increased by volumes which
						did not belong to the original collection.</p>
					<p>It may be urged that if the Hippocratic <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi>
						were originally a library, it is improbable that all the
						treatises composing it would be written in Ionic. But
						it is by no means certain when Ionic ceased to be the
						normal medium for medical science ; for all we
						know the dialect may have been in vogue until long
						after the <foreign lang="greek">KOINH/</foreign> established itself throughout the
						Greek world. Moreover, we do not know what
						levelling forces were at work among copyists and
						librarians, inducing them to assimilate the dialects
						of medical works to a recognized model. We do know,
						however, that as centuries passed more and more
						Ionisms, most of them spurious, were thrust upon
						the Hippocratic texts. The process we can trace in
						the later history of the text may well have been
						going on, in a different form, in the fourth and third
						centuries <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi></p>
					<p>It is because I regard the Hippocratic collection
						as merely a library that I do not consider it worth
						while to attempt an elaborate classification, like those
						of Littr&eacute;, Greenhill, Ermerins, and Adams. A library
						is properly catalogued according to subject matter,
						date, and authorship ; it is of little use to view each
						separate volume in its relationship to a particular
						writer. The Hippocrates of tradition and the Hippocrates
						of the commentators may well be left
						buried in obscurity and uncertainty. What we do
						know, what must be our foundation stone, is that
						certain treatises in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> are impressed with
						the marks of an outstanding genius, who inherited
						much but bequeathed much more. He stands for</p>
					<pb id="p.xxxi"/>
					<p>science and against superstition and hypothetical
						philosophy. The other contents of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> are
						older or later than this nucleus, either in harmony
						with its doctrines or opposed to them. More than
						this we cannot hope to know for certain.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="chapter"><head>3.  Means of Dating Hippocratic Works</head>
					<p>The means of fixing the dates of the treatises
						composing the Hippocratic collection are twofold--external
						and internal.</p>
					<p>The external evidence consists of the statements
						of Galen and other ancient authors.</p>
					<p>The internal tests are :--</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) The philosophical tenets stated or implied ;</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) The medical doctrines ;</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">c</hi>) The style of the treatise ;</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">d</hi>) The language and grammar.</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) When a philosophic doctrine is adopted, or
						referred to as influential, it is presumptive evidence
						that the treatise was written before that doctrine
						grew out of date. We cannot, however, always be
						sure when a doctrine did grow out of date. It is a
						mistaken idea to suppose that the rise of a fresh
						school meant the death of its predecessors. It is
						certain, for instance, that Heraclitus had followers,
						after the rise of other schools, who developed his
						doctrines without altering their essential character.</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) Medical doctrines also are by no means a
						certain test. If we could be sure that a knowledge</p>
					<pb id="p.xxxii"/>
					<p>of the pulse was unknown to the writers of the chief
						Hippocratic treatises, we should be more confident
						in dating, <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi>, the work called <hi rend="ital">Nutriment</hi>, which
						recognizes the existence of a pulse. It is a fact
						that no use is made of this knowledge in any
						treatise of the collection, but we must not infer
						from this that the Hippocratic writers were ignorant
						of pulses. We can only infer that they were
						ignorant of their medical importance.</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">c</hi>) The style of a treatise is sometimes a sure
						test and sometimes not. Sophistic rhetoric is of
						such a marked character in its most pronounced
						form that a treatise showing it is not likely to be
						much earlier than 427 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi>, nor much later than
						400 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi>, when sophistic extravagances began to be
						modified under the influence of the Attic orators.
						But a work moderately sophistic in general style
						and sentence-structure may be much later.</p>
					<p>There is also a subtle quality about writings later
						than 300 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi>, an unnatural verbosity and tortuousness
						of expression, a suspicion of the "baboo," that is as
						unmistakable as it is impalpable. A few of the
						Hippocratic treatises display this characteristic.</p>
					<p>(<hi rend="ital">d</hi>) In some respects grammar and diction are the
						surest tests of all. If the negative <foreign lang="greek">MH/</foreign> is markedly
						ousting <foreign lang="greek">OU)</foreign> it is a sure sign of post-Alexandrine
						date. A preference for compound words with
						abstract meaning, in cases where a simple expression
						would easily have sufficed, is a mark of later
						Greek prose. If any reader wishes for concrete
						evidence to support my rather vague generalisations,
						he has only to read <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi>, then <hi rend="ital">The Art</hi> or
						<hi rend="ital">Regimen I.</hi>, and finally <hi rend="ital">Precepts</hi> or <hi rend="ital">Decorum</hi>, and try
						to note the differences.</p>

					<p>It is obvious that if we could find passages in the
						Hippocratic collection which clearly maintain the
						doctrine propounded in this part of the <hi rend="ital">Phaedrus</hi> we
						should be able to say with confidence that the</p>
					<pb id="p.xxxv"/>
					<p>Hippocrates of history and tradition was the author
						of such and such a treatise.</p>
					<p>Galen maintains that Plato refers to the treatise
						<hi rend="ital">Nature of Man.</hi> I believe that few readers of the
						latter will notice any striking resemblances between
						this work<note>To my mind the closest resemblances are in Chapters
							VII and VIII, which deal with the relations between the
							"four humours" and the four seasons.</note> and the doctrine outlined by Plato.
						More plausible is the view of Littr&eacute;, that Plato refers
						to Chapter XX of <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi>, which contains
						the following passage :--</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">E)PEI\ TOU=TO/ GE MOI DOKEI= A)NAGKAI=ON EI)=NAI PANTI\ I)HTRW=| PERI\

					<p>Here the resemblance is closer--close enough to
						show that the author of <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi>, if he be not
						the Hippocrates of history, at least held views similar
						to his. And here the question must be left. Few
						would maintain with Littr&eacute; that the resemblance
						between the two passages is so striking that they
						must be connected ; few again would deny that
						Plato was thinking of <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine.</hi> Ignorance
						and uncertainty seem to be the final result of most
						of the interesting problems presented by the Hippocratic
						collection.</p>

					<p>About the time of Nero a glossary of unusual
						Hippocratic terms was written by Erotian, which</p>
					<pb id="p.xxxvi"/>
					<p>still survives. Erotian was not the first to compose
						such a work, nor was he the last, the most famous of
						his successors being Galen. An examination of this
						glossary, combined with testimony derived from
						Galen, throws some light on the history of the
						Hippocratic collection. It will be well to quote a
						passage from Erotian's introduction, which contains
						a fairly complete list of commentators.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head><hi rend="ital">Galen</hi></head>
					<p>Galen is the most important of the ancient commentators
						on Hippocrates, and of his work a great
						part has survived.</p>
					<pb id="p.xli"/>
					<p>His writings are of value for two reasons :--</p>
					<p>(1) They often give us a text superior to that of
						the MSS. of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus.</hi> Sometimes this text is
						actually given in Galen's quotations ; sometimes it
						is implied in Galen's commentary.<note>On the value of Galen for a reconstruction of the text
							see especially I. Ilberg in the <hi rend="ital">I'roleyomena</hi> to K&eacute;hlewein's
							edition Vol. I., pp. xxxiv-xlix and lviii-lxii.</note></p>
					<p>(2) They sometimes throw light upon the interpretation
						of obscure passages.</p>
					<p>Galen's ideal of a commentator is beyond criticism.
						He prefers ancient readings, even when they are
						the more difficult, and corrects only when these give
						no possible sense. In commenting he is of opinion
						that he should first determine the sense of the text
						and then see whether it corresponds with the
						truth.<note>See Littr&eacute; I. 120, 121.</note></p>
					<p>Unfortunately he is not so successful when he
						attempts to put his ideal into practice. He is intolerably
						verbose, and what is worse, he is eager so
						to interpret Hippocrates as to gain support therefrom
						for his own theories. A good example of this
						fault is his misinterpretation of <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> III. <hi rend="sc">XIV.</hi>
						Littr&eacute; gives as another fault his neglect of observation
						and observed fact.<note>I. 121.</note></p>

						the following :--</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>6. L<hi rend="sc">IFE OF</hi> H<hi rend="sc">IPPOCRATES</hi>.</head>
					<p>We possess three ancient biographies of Hippocrates :
						one by Suidas, one by Tzetzes, and one by
						Soranus, a late writer of uncertain date.</p>
					<pb id="p.xliii"/>
					<p>From these we gather that Hippocrates was born
						in Cos in 460 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi>;<note>Aulus Gellius <hi rend="ital">N.A.</hi> XVII. 21 says that he was older
							than Socrates. This statement, if true, would put his birth
							prior to 470 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi></note> that he belonged to the guild of
						physicians called Asclepiadae ; that his father was
						Heraclides, and his teachers were Herodicus and
						his own father ; that he travelled all over Greece,
						and was a great friend of Democritus of Abdera ;
						that his help was sought by Perdiccas king of Macedonia
						and by Artaxerxes king of Persia ; that he
						stayed the plague at Athens and in other places ;
						that his life was a long one but of uncertain length,
						the traditions making him live 85, 90, 104 or 109
						years.</p>
					<p>In these accounts there is a certain amount of
						fable, but in the broad outline there is nothing
						improbable except the staying of the Athenian
						plague, which is directly contrary to the testimony
						of Thucydides, who expressly states that medical
						help was generally unsuccessful.</p>
					<p>The <hi rend="ital">Epislles</hi> in the Hippocratic collection, and the
						so-called <hi rend="ital">Decree of the Athenians</hi>, merely give, with
						fuller picturesqueness of detail, the same sort of
						information as is contained in the biographies.</p>
					<p>Plato refers to Hippocrates in two dialogues--the
						<hi rend="ital">Protagoras</hi><note>311 B,C.</note> and the <hi rend="ital">Phaedrus.</hi><note>270 C-E.</note> The former
						passage tells us that Hippocrates was a Coan, an
						Asclepiad, and a professional trainer of medical
						students ; the latter states as a fundamental principle
						of Hippocratic physiology the dogma that an understanding
						of the body is impossible without an
						understanding of nature as a whole, in modern</p>
					<pb id="p.xliv"/>
					<p>language, physiology is inseparable from physics and
						chemistry.</p>
					<p>From Aristotle<note><hi rend="ital">Politics</hi>, VII. 4 (1326 a).</note> we learn that Hippocrates was
						already known as "the Great Hippocrates."</p>
					<p>Such is the ancient account of Hippocrates, a
						name without writings, as Wilamowitz says. There
						is no quotation from any treatise in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> before
						Aristotle,<note>Who quotes from <hi rend="ital">Nature of Man.</hi></note> and he assigns as the author not Hippocrates
						but Polybus.<note>See Littr&eacute; VI. 58 and Aristotle <hi rend="ital">Hist. Animal.</hi> III. 3
							(512 b), and compare Galen XV. 11.</note> The <hi rend="ital">Phaedrus</hi> passage, indeed,
						has been recognized by Littr&eacute; as a reference to
						<hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi>, but Galen is positive that it refers
						to <hi rend="ital">Nature of Man.</hi></p>
					<p>In fact the connexion between the great physician
						and the collection of writings which bears his name
						cannot with any confidence be carried further back
						than Ctesias the Cnidian,<note>Ctesias appears to have known the treatise <hi rend="ital">Articulations</hi>,
							Littre&eacute; I. 70.</note> Diocles of Carystus<note>Diocles criticises <hi rend="ital">Aphorisms</hi> II. 33. See Dietz <hi rend="ital">Scholia in
								Hippocratem et Galenum</hi> II. 326, and Littr&eacute; I. 321-323.</note> and
						Menon,<note>Menon refers to <hi rend="ital">Airs</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">PERI\ FUS1W=N</foreign>), <hi rend="ital">Nature of Man, Places
							in Man</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">Glands</hi>, Hippocrates being expressly connected
							with the first two.</note> the writer of the recently discovered <hi rend="ital">Iatrica.</hi>
						Ctesias and Diocles belong to the earlier half of the
						fourth century, and Menon was a pupil of Aristotle.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="chapter"><head>7. T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> A<hi rend="sc">SCLEPIADAE</hi>.</head>
					<p>Hippocrates was, according to Plato, an Asclepiad.
						This raises the very difficult question, who the
						Asclepiadae were. Its difficulty is typical of several</p>
					<pb id="p.xlv"/>
					<p>Hippocratic problems. Certainty, even approximate
						certainty, is impossible owing to the scantiness of
						the evidence.</p>
					<p>The old view, discarded now by the most competent
						authorities, is that the Asclepiadae were the
						priests of the temples of Asclepius, combining the
						functions of priest and physician. This view implied
						that Hippocratic medicine had its origin in templepractice.
						For a thorough refutation of it see
						Dr. E. T. Withington's excursus in my <hi rend="ital">Malaria and
							Greek History</hi><note>pp. 137-156.</note> and his own book <hi rend="ital">Medical History
								from the Earliest Times.</hi><note>pp. 45, 46 and 378.</note></p>
					<p>Another view is that the Asclepiadae were a guild,
						supposed to have been founded by Asclepius, the
						members of which were bound by rules and swore
						the Hippocratic "Oath." Such is the view of
						Dr. Withington himself. It is one which is free from
						all intrinsic objections, but it is supported by the
						scantiest of positive evidence.</p>
					<p>It should be noticed that the term "Asclepiadae"
						means literally "the family of Asclepius," and it is
						at least possible that the Asclepiads were a clan of
						hereditary physicians who claimed to be descended
						from Asclepius. It would be very easy for such a
						family to develop into something like a guild by the
						admission, or rather adoption, of favoured outsiders.
						In this way the term might readily acquire the
						general meaning of medical practitioner, which it
						apparently has in <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> Theognis 432 :--</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">EI) D' *)AS1KLHPIA/DAIS2 TOU=TO/ G' E)/DWKE QEO/S2</foreign>,

						<foreign lang="greek">POLLOU\S2 A)\N MIS1QOU\S2 KAI\ MEGA/LOUS2 E)/FERON</foreign>.</p>
					<pb id="p.xlvi"/>
					<p>I do not think that it has been noticed what an
						interesting parallel is afforded by the term "Homeridae."
						A family of poets tracing their descent from
						Homer finally could give their name to any public
						reciter of the Homeric poems.<note>See <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> Pindar, <hi rend="ital">Nemeans</hi> II. 1.</note></p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>8. T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> D<hi rend="sc">OCTRINE OF</hi> H<hi rend="sc">UMOURS</hi>.</head>
					<p>The doctrine of the humours probably had its
						origin<note>It is supposed by some that the humoral pathology
							originated in Egypt. See Sir Clifford Allbutt, <hi rend="ital">Greek Medicine
								in Rome</hi>, p. 133.</note> in superficial deductions from obvious facts of
						physiology, but it was strongly coloured by philosophic
						speculation, in particular by the doctrine of
						opposites. Indeed it is impossible to keep distinct
						the various influences which acted and reacted upon
						one another in the spheres of philosophy and
						medicine; only the main tendencies can be clearly
						distinguished.</p>
					<p>Even the most superficial observer must notice
						(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) that the animal body requires air, fluid, and solid
						food; (<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) that too great heat and cold are fatal to
						life, and that very many diseases are attended by
						fever; (<hi rend="ital">c</hi>) that fluid is a necessary factor in digestion;<note>See <hi rend="ital">Nutriment</hi> LV.: <foreign lang="greek">U(GRAS1I/H TROFH=S O)/XHMA</foreign>. See also
							<hi rend="ital">Disenses</hi> IV., Littr&eacute; VII. 568: <foreign lang="greek">TO\ S1W=MA</foreign> . . . <foreign lang="greek">A)PO\ TW=N BRWTW=N
								KAI\ TW=N POTW=N TH=S I)KMA/DOS E)PAURI/S1KETAI</foreign>.</note>
						(<hi rend="ital">d</hi>) that blood is in a peculiar way connected with
						life and health.</p>
					<p>These simple observations were reinforced by the
						speculations of philosophers, particularly when philosophy
						took a biological or physiological turn, and</p>
					<pb id="p.xlvii"/>
					<p>became interested in the organs of man and their
						functions.<note>Empedocles, Philistion and Pausanias were the chief
							pioneers in this union of philosophy with medicine which the
							writer of <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi> so much deplores. See Burnet,
							<hi rend="ital">Early Greek Philosophy</hi>, pp. 234, 235 (also Galen X. 5, <foreign lang="greek">OI( E)K
								TH=S *)ITALI/AS I)ATROI\ *FILIS1TI/WN TE KAI\ *)EMPEDOKLH=S KAI\ *PAUS1ANI/AS KAI\
								OI( TOU/TWN E(TAI=ROI</foreign>.)</note></p>
					<p>The second of the Greek philosophers, Anaximander,<note>He was also interested in biology. See Burnet, pp. 72,
						73.</note>
						taught that creation was made up of
						"opposites," though it is not clear how many he
						conceived these opposites to be. Many later
						thinkers, working on lines similar to those of
						Anaximander, made them four in number--the hot,
						the cold, the moist and the dry. These were the
						essential qualities of the four elements, fire, air,
						water, earth.</p>
					<p>There was, however, no uniformity among thinkers
						as to the number of the opposites, and Alcmaeon, a
						younger contemporary of Pythagoras and a native of
						Croton, postulated an indefinite number.<note>Aristotle <hi rend="ital">Meta.</hi> A 986 a 31 : <foreign lang="greek">FHS1I\ GA\R E)/NAI DU/O TA\ POLLA\

					<p>But the opposites are not <foreign lang="greek">XUMOI/</foreign>: they are only

							about the humours themselves. It is merely a series of notes

						one or other "lording it over the others" (<foreign lang="greek">MONARXI/A</foreign>)
						in a state of disease.</p>
					<p>The two commonest complaints in ancient Greece,

						these humours four : phlegm, blood (suggested by
						hemorrhage in fevers), yellow bile and black bile
						(suggested by the vomits, etc., in remittent malaria).</p>

					<p>Some thinkers, belonging to the school of Empedocles,

					<p>The doctrines I have described admitted many
						variations, and in Menon's <hi rend="ital">Iatrica</hi>, which is chiefly
						an account of the origins of disease as given by
						various physicians, the most diverse views are set
						forth. Petron of Aegina, while holding that the
						body is composed of the four opposites, stated that
						disease was due to faulty diet, and that bile was
						the result and not the cause of disease.<note><hi rend="ital">Iatrica</hi>, XX.</note> Hippon
						thought that a suitable quantity of moisture was the
						cause of health ;<note><hi rend="ital">Ibid.</hi>, XI.</note> Philolaus that disease was due to
						bile, blood and phlegm ;<note><hi rend="ital">Ibid.</hi>, XVIII.</note> Thrasymachus of Sardis
						that blood, differentiated by excess of cold or heat
						into phlegm, bile, or <foreign lang="greek">TO\ S1ES1HPO/S</foreign> (matter or pus), was</p>
					<pb id="p.l"/>
					<p>the cause ;<note><hi rend="ital">Iatrica</hi>, XI. (end).</note> Menecrates that the body is composed
						of blood, bile, breath and phlegm, and that health is
						a harmony of these.<note><hi rend="ital">Ibid.</hi>, XIX.</note></p>
					<p>The Hippocratic collection shows similar diversity
						of opinion. <hi rend="ital">Diseases</hi> IV. 51, gives as the
						four humours bile, blood, phlegm and <foreign lang="greek">U(/DRWY</foreign> (not
						water, but a watery humour).<note>Littr&eacute; VII. 584.</note> <hi rend="ital">Affections I.</hi> ascribes
						all diseases to bile and phlegm.<note><hi rend="ital">Ibid.</hi>, VI. 208.</note> <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi>
						recognizes an indefinite number of humours.</p>
					<p>The great Hippocratic group imply the doctrine
						of humours in its phraseology and outlook on
						symptoms, but it is in the background, and nowhere
						are the humours described. It is clear, however,
						that bile and phlegm are the most prominent, and
						bilious and phlegmatic temperaments are often
						mentioned in <hi rend="ital">Airs Waters Places</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi>
						and <hi rend="ital">III.</hi> There are signs of subdivision in <foreign lang="greek">PIKRO/XOLOI</foreign><note><hi rend="ital">Regimen in Acute Diseases</hi>, XXXIII. : <foreign lang="greek">OI( PIK?O/XOLOI TA\
							A)/NW</foreign> : <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> III. <hi rend="sc">XIV</hi>. (end).</note>
						and <foreign lang="greek">LEUKOFLEGMATI/AI</foreign>.<note><hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> III. <hi rend="sc">XIV</hi>.</note></p>
					<p>Amid all these differences, which by their very
						variety indicate that they belonged to theory without
						seriously affecting practice, there is one common
						principle--that health is a harmonious mingling of
						the constituents of the body. What these constituents
						are is not agreed, nor is it clear what exactly
						is meant by "mingling."</p>
					<p>The word <foreign lang="greek">A)/KRHTOS</foreign>, which I have translated "unmixed"
						or "uncompounded," is said by Galen to
						mean "consisting of one humour only." It is more</p>
					<pb id="p.li"/>
					<p>likely that the word means properly "showing signs
						that <hi rend="ital">crasis</hi> has not taken place."</p>
					<div3 type="section"><head><hi rend="ital">Coction</hi></head>
						<p>The course of our inquiry has brought us to the
							doctrine of "coction" (<foreign lang="greek">PE/YIS</foreign>). Familiar as a
							modern is with the difference between chemical
							blending and mechanical mixture, it is difficult for
							him to appreciate fairly theories put forward when
							this difference was unknown, and the human mind
							was struggling with phenomena it had not the
							power to analyse, and trying to express what was
							really beyond its reach. We must try to see things
							as the Greek physician saw them.</p>
						<p>We have in Chapters XVIII and XIX of <hi rend="ital">Ancient
							Medicine</hi> the most complete account of coction as
							the ancient physician conceived of it. It is really
							the process which leads to <foreign lang="greek">KRA=S1IS</foreign> as its result. It
							is neither purely mechanical nor yet what we should
							call chemical; it is the action which so combines
							the opposing humours that there results a perfect
							fusion of them all. No one is left in excess so as to
							cause trouble or pain to the human individual. The
							writer takes three types of illnesses--the common
							cold, ophthalmia and pneumonia--and shows that
							as they grow better the discharges become less acrid
							and thicker as the result of <foreign lang="greek">PE/YIS</foreign>.</p>
						<p>In one respect the writer of <hi rend="ital">Ancient Medicine</hi> is
							not a trustworthy guide to the common conception
							of <foreign lang="greek">PE/YIS</foreign>. He attached but little importance to heat,
							and it can scarcely be doubted that the action of
							heat upon the digestibility of foods, and the heat
							which accompanies the process of digestion itself,</p>
						<pb id="p.lii"/>
						<p>must have coloured the notion of <foreign lang="greek">PE/YIS</foreign> as generally
							held. It is true that we read little about innate
							heat in the Hippocratic collection, but that is an
							accident, and it certainly was thought to have a
							powerful influence upon the bodily functions.<note>See <hi rend="ital">Aphorisms</hi>, I. 14: <foreign lang="greek">TA\ AU)CANO/UENA PLEI=S1TON E)/XEI TO\
								E)/MFUTON QERMO/N: PLEI/S1THS OU)=N DEI=TAI TROFH=S: EI) DE\ MH/</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">TO\ S1W=MA
									A)NALI/S1KETAI K</foreign>.<foreign lang="greek">T</foreign>.<foreign lang="greek">L</foreign>.</note></p>
						<p>A disease was supposed to result when the equilibrium
							of the humours, from some "exciting cause"
							or other (<foreign lang="greek">PRO/FAS1IS</foreign>), was disturbed, and then nature,
							that is the constitution of the individual (<foreign lang="greek">FU/S1IS</foreign>),
							made every effort she could through coction to
							restore the necessary <foreign lang="greek">KRA=S1IS</foreign>.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section"><head><hi rend="ital">Crisis</hi></head>
						<p>The battle between nature and the disease was
							decided on the day that coction actually took place
							or failed to take place. The result was recovery,
							partial or complete, aggravation of the disease, or
							death. The crisis (<foreign lang="greek">KRI/S1IS</foreign>) is "the determination of
							the disease as it were by a judicial verdict."<note>See Dr. E. T. Withington, <hi rend="ital">Classical Review</hi>, May-June
								1920, p. 65. There is a good definition of <foreign lang="greek">KRI/S1IS</foreign> in <hi rend="ital">Affections</hi>
								VIII. (Littr&eacute; VI. 216) : <foreign lang="greek">KRI/NES1QAI DE/ E)S1TIN E)N TAI=S NOU/S1OIS</foreign>,
								<foreign lang="greek">O(/TAN AU)/CWNTAI AI( NOU=S1OI H)\ MATAI/NWNTAI H)\ METAPI/PTWS1IN E)S E(/TERON
									NO/S1HMA H)\ TELENTW=S1IN</foreign>.</note></p>
						<p>After a crisis there might, or might not, be a
							relapse (<foreign lang="greek">U(POS1TROFH/</foreign>), which would be followed in due
							course by another crisis.</p>
						<p>The crisis, if favourable, was accompanied by the
							expulsion of the residue remaining after coction
							and <foreign lang="greek">KRA=S1IS</foreign> of the humours had occurred. This expulsion</p>
						<pb id="p.liii"/>
						<p>might take place through any of the ordinary
							means of evacuation--mouth, bowels, urine, pores--and
							the evacuated matters were said to be concocted
							(<foreign lang="greek">PE/PONA</foreign>), that is to say, they presented signs that
							coction had taken place.<note>The chief signs of coction were greater consistency,
								darker colour, and "ripeness" or "mellowness."</note></p>
						<p>But nature was not always able to use the
							ordinary means of evacuation. In this case there
							would be an abscession (<foreign lang="greek">A)PO/S1TAS1IS</foreign>). When the
							morbid residue failed to be normally evacuated, it
							was gathered together to one part of the body and
							eliminated, sometimes as an eruption or inflammation,
							sometimes as a gangrene or tumour, sometimes
							as a swelling at the joints.</p>
						<p>An abscession did not necessarily mean recovery ;
							it might merely be a change from one disease to
							another. The Hippocratic writers are not clear
							about the point, but apparently the abscession might
							fail to accomplish its purpose, and so the disease
							continued in an altered form.<note>The most important passages are:--
								<p>(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">OU)DE\ GA\R AI( GIGNO/MENAI TOU/TOIS A\POS1TA/S1IES E)/KRINON W(/S1PER
									E)PI\ TOI=S A)/LLOIS</foreign> (<hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> III. <hi rend="sc">XII</hi>.).</p>

									(<hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> I. <hi rend="sc">VIII</hi>.).</p></note> In other words there
							was abscession without real crisis.</p>
						<p>To trace the course of a disease through its various
							stages, and to be able to see what is portended by
							symptoms in different diseases and at different stages
							of those diseases, was an art upon which Hippocrates
							laid great stress. He called it <foreign lang="greek">PRO/GNWS1IS</foreign>, and it
							included at least half of the physician's work.</p>
						<pb id="p.liv"/>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section"><head><hi rend="ital">Critical Days</hi></head>
						<p>Crises took place on what were called critical days.
							It is a commonplace that a disease tends to reach a
							crisis on a fixed day from the commencement,
							although the day is not absolutely fixed, nor is it
							the same for all diseases. The writer of <hi rend="ital">Prognostic</hi>
							and <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi> lays it down as a general law that
							acute diseases have crises on one or more fixed days
							in a series.</p>
						<p>In <hi rend="ital">Prognostic</hi> Chapter XX the series for fevers is
							given thus:--4th day, 7th, 11th, 14th, 17th, 20th,
							34th, 40th, 60th.</p>
						<p>In <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> I. <hi rend="sc">XXVI</hi>. two series are given:--</p>
						<p>(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) diseases which have exacerbations on even
							days have crises on these even days: 4th, 6th, 8th,
							10th, 14th, 20th, 24th, 30th, 40th, 60th, 80th,
							120th.</p>
						<p>(<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) diseases which have exacerbations on odd days
							have crises on these odd days: 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th,
							11th, 17th, 21st, 27th, 31st.</p>
						<p>A crisis on any other than a normal day was
							supposed to indicate a probably fatal relapse.</p>
						<p>Galen thought that Hippocrates was the first to
							discuss the critical days, and there is no evidence
							against this view, though it seems more likely that
							it gradually grew up in the Coan school.<note>On the other hand, critical days are not discussed at all
								in <hi rend="ital">Coan Prenotions</hi>, the supposed repository of pre-Hippocratic
								Coan medicine.</note></p>
						<p>What was the origin of this doctrine? Possibly
							it may in part be a survival of Pythagorean magic,
							numbers being supposed to have mystical powers,
							which affected medicine through the Sicilian-Italian</p>
						<pb id="p.lv"/>
						<p>school. But a man so free from superstition as the
							author of <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi> was unlikely to be influenced
							by mysticism, particularly by a mysticism which left
							his contemporaries apparently untouched. More
							probably there is an effort to express a medical
							truth. In malarious countries, all diseases, and not
							malaria only, tend to grow more severe periodically ;
							latent malaria, in fact, colours all other complaints.
							May it not be that severe exacerbations and normal
							crises were sometimes confused by Hippocrates, or
							perhaps a series of malarial exacerbations attracted
							the crisis to one of the days composing it? The
							sentence in <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> I. <hi rend="sc">XXVI</hi>. is very definitely to
							the effect that when exacerbations are on even days,
							crises are on even days ; when exacerbations are
							on odd days, crises are on odd days. Evidently
							the critical days are not entirely independent of
							the periodicity of malaria.</p></div3></div2>

					<p>Diseases were classified by ancient physicians
						according to their symptoms ; they are now classified
						according to the micro-organisms which cause them.
						Accordingly it often happens that no exact equivalent
						in Greek corresponds to an English medical term
						and <hi rend="ital">vice versa.</hi> The name of a Greek disease
						denotes merely a syndrome of symptoms.</p>
					<p>Perhaps the most remarkable point arising in a
						discussion of Greek diseases is the apparent absence
						of most infectious fevers. Plagues, vaguely referred
						to by the term <foreign lang="greek">LOIMO/S</foreign>,<note>For the common Greek conception of <foreign lang="greek">LOIMO/S</foreign> see pseudo-Aristotle
							<hi rend="ital">Problems</hi> I. 7.</note> occurred at intervals, but the</p>
					<pb id="p.lvi"/>
					<p>medical writings in the Hippocratic collection are
						occupied almost entirely with endemic disease and
						do not describe plagues, not even the great plague
						at Athens. There is no mention of smallpox or
						measles ; no certain reference occurs to diphtheria,
						scarlet fever, bubonic plague or syphilis. It is
						extremely doubtful whether typhoid was present in
						Greece, for although it is similar to severe cases of
						<foreign lang="greek">KAU=S1OS</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">FRENI=TIS</foreign>, the latter were certainly in most
						cases pernicious malaria, which is often so like
						typhoid that only the microscope can distinguish
						them. It is expressly stated by pseudo-Aristotle<note><hi rend="ital">Problems</hi>, VII. 8.</note>
						that fevers were not infectious, and it is difficult to
						reconcile this statement with the prevalence of
						typhoid. The question must be left open, as the
						evidence is not clear enough to warrant a confident
						decision.<note>See St&eacute;phanos, <hi rend="ital">La Gr&eacute;ce</hi>, p 502.</note></p>
					<p>Colds, "with and without fever,"<note>See <hi rend="ital">Epidemics IV.</hi>, Littr&eacute; V., p. 149.</note> were common
						enough in ancient times, but whether influenza
						prevailed cannot be stated for certain. Its all too
						frequent result, pneumonia, was indeed well known,
						but it is puzzling that in the description of epidemic
						cough at Perinthus,<note><hi rend="ital">Epidemics VI.</hi>, Littr&eacute;, pp. 331-337.</note> the nearest approach to an
						influenza wave in the Hippocratic collection, it is
						expressly stated that relapses into pneumonia were
						rare.<note><hi rend="ital">Loc. cit.</hi>, p. 333.</note></p>
					<p>Consumption (<foreign lang="greek">FQI/S1IS</foreign>) is one of the diseases most
						frequently mentioned in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi>, and it is remarkable
						that in the very passage where we are told</p>
					<pb id="p.lvii"/>
					<p>that fevers are not infectious it is also stated that
						consumption is so. To consumption are added
						"ophthalmias," which term will therefore include
						all contagious inflammations of the eyes.<note>Pseudo-Aristotle <hi rend="ital">Problems</hi> VII. 8 : <foreign lang="greek">DIA\ TI/ A)PO\ FQI/S1EWS KAI\

					<p>The greatest plague of the Greek and of the
						ancient world generally was malaria, both mild and
						malignant, both intermittent and remittent.</p>
					<p>The intermittents (<foreign lang="greek">DIALEI/PONTES PNRETOI/</foreign>) are :--</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">A)MFHMERINO\S PURETO/S</foreign> (quotidians)</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">TRITAI=OS PURETO/S</foreign> (tertians)</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">TETARTAI=OS PURETO/S</foreign> (quartans)<note>See <hi rend="ital">e.g. Epidemics</hi> I.
						<hi rend="sc">XXIV</hi>., where quintans, septans
						and nonans also are mentioned. In the fourth century the
						existence of these fevers was denied.</note></p>
					<p>The remittents (often <foreign lang="greek">S1UNEXEI=S PURETOI/</foreign>) included :--</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">KAU=S1OS</foreign>, so called because of the intense heat felt
						by the patient, a remittent tertian often mentioned
						in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus.</hi></p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">FRENI=TIS</foreign>, characterized by pain in the hypochondria
						and by delirium. It generally had a
						tertian periodicity.</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">LH/QARGOS</foreign>, characterized by irresistible coma. It
						bore a strong likeness to what is now known as the
						comatose form of pernicious malaria.</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">H(MITRITAI=OS</foreign>, semitertian, was pernicious remittent
						malaria with tertian periodicity.<note>I have discussed these diseases more fully in my <hi rend="ital">Malaria
							and Greek History</hi>, pp. 63-68.</note></p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">TU=FOS</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">TI=FOS</foreign>, of which five different kinds are

					<pb id="p.lviii"/>
					<p>(Littr&eacute; VII. 260 foll.), was in at least two cases a
						species of remittent malaria.</p>
					<p>In connexion with the question of malaria it should
						be noticed that malarial cachexia, the symptoms of
						which are anaemia, weakness, dark complexion and
						enlarged spleen, is often described in the Hippocratic
						collection. Especially vivid is the description in
						<hi rend="ital">Airs Waters Places.</hi> This is further evidence of
						the malarious condition of the ancient Greek world.</p>
					<div3 type="section"><head><foreign lang="greek">MELAGXOLI/A</foreign></head>
						<p>This word is closely connected both with the
							doctrine of the humours and with the prevalence
							of malaria. It is fully discussed in <hi rend="ital">Malaria and
								Greek History</hi>, pp. 98-101. Generally it means our
							"melancholia," but sometimes merely "biliousness."
							In popular speech <foreign lang="greek">MELAGXOLI/A</foreign> and its cognates sometimes
							approximate in meaning to "nervous breakdown."
							Probably the name was given to any
							condition resembling the prostration, physical and

					<div3 type="section"><head><hi rend="ital">Delirium</hi></head>
						<p>The Hippocratic collection is rich in words

							associations and its own shade of meaning, but
							these are now to a great extent lost. Only the
							broad outlines of the differences between them can
							be discerned by the modern reader. The words fall
							into two main classes :--</p>
						<p>(1) Those in which the mental derangement of
							delirium is the dominant idea ; <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">PARAFE/ROMAI</foreign>,
							<foreign lang="greek">PARAFRONW=</foreign> (the word common in <hi rend="ital">Prognostic</hi>), <foreign lang="greek">PARANOW=</foreign>,
							<foreign lang="greek">PARAKROU/W</foreign> (the most common word in <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi>
							and <hi rend="ital">III.</hi>), <foreign lang="greek">PARAKOPH/</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">E)KMAI/NOMAI</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">MANI/A</foreign>.</p>
						<p>(2) Those in which stress is laid upon delirious

						<pb id="p.lx"/>
						<p>It is more difficult to say exactly which words in
							each class signify the greater degree of delirium.
							Of class (1) <foreign lang="greek">E)KMAI/NOMAI</foreign> is obviously the most vigorous
							word, meaning "wild raving," <foreign lang="greek">MANI/A</foreign> comes next to

							the chilly feeling experienced in fevers, especially in
							malarial fevers. These are (<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">R(I=GOS</foreign> and its derivatives,
							and (<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">FRI/XH</foreign> and its derivatives. The former
							lays stress upon the chilly feeling, the latter upon
							the shivering accompanying it. But in this case also
							it is possible to discriminate too finely; see <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> in
							<hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> III. Case <hi rend="sc">II</hi>. (second series), <foreign lang="greek">FRIKW/DHS</foreign> is
							followed by <foreign lang="greek">META\ TO\ GENO/MENON R(I=GOS</foreign>, referring apparently
							to the same occasion.</p>
						<p>The reader should note the extreme care with
							which symptoms are described in the Hippocratic
							group of treatises. It has been pointed out, for
							instance, that in <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> I. Case <hi rend="sc">I</hi>., and <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi>
							III. Case <hi rend="sc">XV</hi>. (second series), there are possibly</p>
						<pb id="p.lxi"/>
						<p>instances of Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Noticed by
							the writer of these works, this important symptom
							was overlooked until the eighteenth century.</p>

				<div2 type="chapter"><head>10. <foreign lang="greek">POLU/S</foreign> <hi rend="sc">AND</hi> <foreign lang="greek">O)LI/GOS</foreign> <hi rend="sc">IN THE PLURAL</hi>.</head>
					<p>It is at least curious that one of the translator's
						greatest difficulties is to decide what are the
						meanings of <foreign lang="greek">POLU/S</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">O)LI/GOS</foreign> (also of <foreign lang="greek">S1MIKRA/</foreign>) when
						used in the plural. The reader is at first sight
						inclined to think that <foreign lang="greek">R(EU/MATA POLLA/</foreign> (<hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> III.
						<hi rend="sc">IV</hi>.) means "many fluxes," and so possibly it may.
						But just above we have <foreign lang="greek">R(EU=MA POLU/</foreign>, "a copious flux,"
						and so the plural may well mean "copious fluxes."
						The ambiguity becomes more serious when the
						words are applied to the excreta. Is frequency or
						quantity the more dominant idea? It seems impossible
						to say for certain, but the evidence tends
						towards the latter view. From <hi rend="ital">Prognostic</hi> Chapter XI
						it seems that quantity is the more important thing,
						and in the same passage <foreign lang="greek">PUKNO/N</foreign> is the word used
						to denote frequency. The usage in <hi rend="ital">Epidemics I.</hi> and
						<hi rend="ital">III.</hi> bears out this view. "Frequently shivering" is
						<foreign lang="greek">FRIKW/DEES PUKNA/</foreign> (<hi rend="ital">Epid.</hi> III. <hi rend="sc">XIII</hi>.). In the same chapter
						occurs the sentence, <foreign lang="greek">AI( DE\ BH=XES E)NH=S1AN ME\N DIA\ TE/LEOS
							POLLAI/</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">KAI\ POLLA\ A)NA/GOUS1AI PE/PONA</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">POLLAI/</foreign>
						means "many" and <foreign lang="greek">POLLA/</foreign> "copious." In <hi rend="ital">Epid.</hi> III.
						Case <hi rend="sc">II</hi>. (second series) <foreign lang="greek">BH=XES S1UNEXE/ES U(GRAI\ POLLAI/</foreign>
						means "continued coughing with watery and copious
						sputa." In Case <hi rend="sc">IX</hi>. of the same series "frequent,
						slight epistaxis" is <foreign lang="greek">H(|MORRA/GEI</foreign> . . . . <foreign lang="greek">PUKNA\ KAT) O)LI/GON</foreign>.
						After long consideration of this difficult question I
						conclude that <foreign lang="greek">POLU/S</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">O)LI/GOS</foreign> in the plural, when</p>
					<pb id="p.lxii"/>
					<p>used of excreta, etc., should be translated "copious"
						or "abundant" unless the context makes the other
						meaning absolutely necessary.</p>
					<p>The case is somewhat similar with the word <foreign lang="greek">S1MIKRA/</foreign>.
						Used adverbially this word means "slightly," "a
						little," more often than it does "in small quantities."
						<foreign lang="greek">S1MIKRA\ KATENO/EI</foreign> is almost certainly "lucid intervals,"
						and <foreign lang="greek">S1MIKRA\ E)KOIMH/QH</foreign> is "snatches of sleep," but I do
						not feel sure that <foreign lang="greek">S1MIKRA\ PARE/KROUS1E</foreign> means more
						than "slight delirium," nor <foreign lang="greek">S1MIKRA\ E)PU/RECE</foreign> (<hi rend="ital">Epid.</hi>
						III. <hi rend="sc">XIII</hi>.) more than "slightly feverish."</p>

					<p>The later MSS. of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> exhibit a mass of
						pseudo-ionic forms which are not to be found, or are
						only rarely found, in the earlier MSS. The uncontracted
						forms, too, are more common in the later
						authorities. If we follow closely the earlier MSS.
						we have a text which is very like Attic, with a mild
						sprinkling of Ionic forms. These facts seem to show
						that, when Ionic became the medium of scientific
						prose, it lost touch gradually with the spoken speech
						and assimilated itself to the predominant Attic,
						and later on possibly to the <foreign lang="greek">KOINH/</foreign>. It retained
						just enough Ionic to keep up the tradition and to
						conform to convention. The later scribes, under the
						mistaken impression that the texts before them had
						been atticized, restored what they considered to be
						the ancient forms, often with disastrous results.
						Many of their ionisms are sheer monstrosities.</p>
					<p>In 1894 A. W. Smyth discussed the dialect of the
						<hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> in his work <hi rend="ital">The Sounds and Inflections of the</hi></p>
					<pb id="p.lxiii"/>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Greek Dialects : Ionic.</hi><note>See 94-103, pp. 100-110.</note> He pointed out, however,
						that the labours of Littr&eacute;<note>See Vol. I., 479-502.</note> had left much to be
						done in this department of Hippocratic study, and
						that the material for a sound judgment was not
						yet available.</p>
					<p>The collection of this material is not yet complete,
						but a good start was made by K&eacute;hlewein,
						who in Chapter III of the <hi rend="ital">Prolegomena</hi> to the first
						volume of the Teubner Hippocrates (<hi rend="ital">de dialecto

					<p>None of our MSS. are very old, but the oldest

					<p>The early editions are learned but uncritical,
						being stronger on the medical side than in scholarship.
						Special mention should be made of the
						<hi rend="ital">Oeconomia</hi> of Foes, a perfect mine of medical lore,
						and it is supplemented by the excellent notes in
						Foes' edition. Such a work could have appeared
						only in an age when Hippocrates was a real force
						in medical practice.<note>This is in a way a defect. Foes, like Galen, is not
							sufficiently "detached" from Hippocratic teaching to judge
							Hippocrates impartially.</note></p>
					<p>The first scholarly edition was that of Littr&eacute;, and
						only those who have seriously studied the works of
						Hippocrates can appreciate the debt we owe to his
						diligence, or understand why the task occupied
						twenty-two years. Unfortunately Littr&eacute; is diffuse,
						and not always accurate. His opinions, too, changed
						during the long period of preparation, and the
						additional notes in the later volumes must be consulted
						in order to correct the views expressed in the
						earlier.</p>
					<p>As a textual critic he shows much common sense,
						but his notes are awkward to read, and his knowledge
						was practically confined to the Paris MSS.</p>
					<p>He is at his best as a medical commentator, and
						he was the first to explain Hippocratic pathology
						by proving that the endemic diseases of the Hippocratic
						writings must be identified, not with the
						fevers of our climate, but with the remittent forms
						of malaria common in hot climates. It is not too
						much to say that without keeping this fact in view
						we cannot understand a great part of the <hi rend="ital">Corpus.</hi>
						It is curious to note that Hippocrates was a medical
						text-book almost down to the time (about 1840)</p>
					<pb id="p.lxix"/>
					<p>when malaria ceased to be a real danger to northern
						Europe.</p>
					<p>The most useful critical edition of Hippocrates is
						that of Ermerins. He was a scholar with a lucid
						and precise mind, and his critical notes are a pleasure
						to read. The introductions, too, are stimulating,
						instructive and interesting, written in a style full
						of life and charm. As a philologist he was very
						deficient.</p>
					<p>The edition in the Teubner series, edited by
						K&eacute;hlewein, of which two volumes have appeared,
						marks a distinct advance. Fresh manuscripts have
						been collated, and the text has been purged of the
						pseudo-ionisms which have so long disfigured it.</p>
					<p>A word should perhaps be said about Reinhold,
						whose two volumes of text give us more plausible
						conjectures than the work of any other scholar.</p>
					<p>Of the scholars who have worked at parts of the
						<hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> mention should be made of Gomperz and
						Wilamowitz, but especial praise is due to the remarkable
						acuteness of Coray, whose intellect was like
						a sword. He always instructs and inspires, even
						when the reader cannot accept his emendations.</p>
					<p>Adams' well-known translation is the work of a
						man of sense, who loved his author and was not
						without some of the qualifications of a scholar.
						The translation is literal and generally good, but
						is occasionally misleading. The medical annotation
						is far superior to the scholarship displayed in the
						work.</p></div2></div1>

					<p>no need of an empty postulate,<note>Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">XAINH=S2</foreign>, "a
						novel postulate." But the writer's
						objection is not that the postulate is novel, but that it <hi rend="ital">is</hi> a
						postulate. A postulate, he says, is "empty" in a sphere
						where accurate and verifiable knowledge is possible. Only
						in regions where science cannot penetrate are <foreign lang="greek">U(POQE/S1EIS2</foreign>
						legitimate. For this reason I read <foreign lang="greek">KENH=S2</foreign>.</note> as do insoluble
						mysteries, about which any exponent must use a
						postulate, for example, things in the sky or below
						the earth. If a man were to learn and declare the
						state of these, neither to the speaker himself nor to
						his audience would it be clear whether his statements
						were true or not. For there is no test the
						application of which would give certainty.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>PART 2</head>
					<p>II. But medicine has long had all its means to
						hand, and has discovered both a principle and a
						method, through which the discoveries made during
						a long period are many and excellent, while full discovery
						will be made, if the inquirer be competent,
						conduct his researches with knowledge of the discoveries
						already made, and make them his starting-point.
						But anyone who, casting aside and rejecting
						all these means, attempts to conduct research in
						any other way or after another fashion, and asserts
						that he has found out anything, is and has been the
						victim of deception.<note>Or, with the reading suggested, "both deceives
							and is
							deceived."</note> His assertion is impossible ;
						the causes of its impossibility I will endeavour to
						expound by a statement and exposition of what the
						art is.<note>Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">O(/TI E)/S1TIN</foreign>, "that the art really is
							an art,
							really exists."</note> In this way it will be manifest that by any
						other means discoveries are impossible. But it is
						particularly necessary, in my opinion, for one who
						discusses this art to discuss things familiar to ordinary
						folk. For the subject of inquiry and discussion
						is simply and solely the sufferings of these same</p>
					<pb id="p.17"/>
					<p>ordinary folk when they are sick or in pain. Now
						to learn by themselves how their own sufferings
						come about and cease, and the reasons why they get
						worse or better, is not an easy task for ordinary
						folk ; but when these things have been discovered
						and are set forth by another, it is simple. For
						merely an effort of memory is required of each man
						when he listens to a statement of his experiences.
						But if you miss being understood by laymen,
						and fail to put your hearers in this condition, you
						will miss reality. Therefore for this reason also
						medicine has no need of any postulate.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3"><head>PART 3</head>
					<p>III. For the art of medicine would never have been
						discovered to begin with, nor would any medical research
						have been conducted--for there would have
						been no need for medicine--if sick men had profited
						by the same mode of living and regimen as the food,
						drink and mode of living of men in health, and if
						there had been no other things for the sick better
						than these. But the fact is that sheer necessity has
						caused men to seek and to find medicine, because
						sick men did not, and do not, profit by the same
						regimen as do men in health. To trace the matter
						yet further back, I hold that not even the mode of
						living and nourishment enjoyed at the present time
						by men in health would have been discovered, had a
						man been satisfied with the same food and drink as
						satisfy an ox, a horse, and every animal save man,
						for example the products of the earth--fruits, wood
						and grass. For on these they are nourished, grow,
						and live without pain, having no need at all of any
						other kind of living. Yet I am of opinion that to
						begin with man also used this sort of nourishment.
						Our present ways of living have, I think, been</p>
					<pb id="p.19"/>
					<p>discovered and elaborated during a long period of
						time. For many and terrible were the sufferings
						of men from strong and brutish living when they
						partook of crude foods, uncompounded and possessing
						great powers<note>Or "strong qualities."</note>--the same in fact as men
						would
						suffer at the present day, falling into violent pains and
						diseases quickly followed by death. Formerly indeed
						they probably suffered less, because they were used to
						it, but they suffered severely even then. The majority
						naturally perished, having too weak a constitution,
						while the stronger resisted longer, just as at the
						present time some men easily deal with strong foods,
						while others do so only with many severe pains.
						For this reason the ancients too seem to me to
						have sought for nourishment that harmonised with
						their constitution, and to have discovered that which
						we use now. So from wheat, after steeping it,
						winnowing, grinding and sifting, kneading, baking,
						they produced bread, and from barley they produced
						cake. Experimenting with food they boiled or
						baked, after mixing, many other things, combining
						the strong and uncompounded with the weaker
						components so as to adapt all to the constitution and
						power of man, thinking that from foods which, being
						too strong, the human constitution cannot assimilate
						when eaten, will come pain, disease, and death,
						while from such as can be assimilated will come
						nourishment, growth and health. To this discovery
						and research what juster or more appropriate name</p>
					<pb id="p.21"/>
					<p>could be given than medicine, seeing that it has
						been discovered with a view to the health, saving
						and nourishment of man, in the place of that
						mode of living from which came the pain, disease and
						death?</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4"><head>PART 4</head>
					<p>IV. That it is not commonly considered an art is
						not unnatural, for it is inappropriate to call anyone
						an artist in a craft in which none are laymen, but
						all possess knowledge through being compelled to
						use it. Nevertheless the discovery was a great one,
						implying much investigation and art. At any rate
						even at the present day those who study gymnastics
						and athletic exercises are constantly making some
						fresh discovery by investigating on the same method
						what food and what drink are best assimilated and
						make a man grow stronger.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5"><head>PART 5</head>
					<p>V. Let us consider also whether the acknowledged
						art of medicine, that was discovered for the treatment
						of the sick and has both a name and artists,
						has the same object as the other art,<note><hi rend="ital">I.e.</hi> that of dieting in
							health. See Chapter VII.</note> and what its
						origin was. In my opinion, as I said at the beginning,
						nobody would have even sought for medicine,
						if the same ways of life had suited both the sick and
						those in health. At any rate even at the present day
						such as do not use medical science, foreigners and
						some Greeks, live as do those in health, just as they
						please, and would neither forgo nor restrict the satisfaction
						of any of their desires. But those who sought
						for and discovered medicine, having the same intention
						as the men I discussed above, in the first place,
						I think, lessened the bulk of the foods, and, without
						altering their character, greatly diminished their
						quantity. But they found that this treatment was</p>
					<pb id="p.23"/>
					<p>sufficient only occasionally, and although clearly
						beneficial with some patients, it was not so in all
						cases, as some were in such a condition that they
						could not assimilate even small quantities of food.
						As such patients were thought to need weaker nutriment,
						slops were invented by mixing with much
						water small quantities of strong foods, and by taking
						away from their strength by compounding and
						boiling. Those that were not able to assimilate them
						were refused even these slops, and were reduced to
						taking liquids, these moreover being so regulated in
						composition and quantity as to be moderate, and
						nothing was administered that was either more or
						less, or less compounded, than it ought to be.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6"><head>PART 6</head>
					<p>VI. It must be clearly understood that some are
						not benefited in disease by slops, but when they
						take them, their fever and pain grow manifestly
						worse, and it is plain that what is taken proves
						nourishment and increase to the disease, but wears
						away and enfeebles the body. Any men who in this
						condition take dry food, barley-cake or bread, even
						though it be very little, will be hurt ten times
						more, and more obviously, than if they take slops,
						simply and solely because the food is too strong
						for their condition ; and a man to whom slops are
						beneficial, but not solid food, will suffer much more
						harm if he eat more than if he eat little, though
						he will feel pain even if he eat little. Now all the
						causes of the pain can be reduced to one, namely,
						it is the strongest foods that hurt a man most and
						most obviously, whether he be well or ill.</p>
					<pb id="p.25"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7"><head>PART 7</head>
					<p>VII. What difference then can be seen between
						the purpose of him we call physician, who is an
						acknowledged handicraftsman, the discoverer of the
						mode of life and of the nourishment suitable for the
						sick, and his who discovered and prepared originally
						nourishment for all men, which we now use, instead
						of the old savage and brutish mode of living ? My
						own view is that their reasoning was identical and the
						discovery one and the same. The one sought to
						do away with those things which, when taken, the
						constitution of man in health could not assimilate
						because of their brutish and uncompounded character,
						the other those things which the temporary condition
						of an individual prevented him from assimilating.
						How do the two pursuits differ, except in their scope<note>Or
							"appearance." The two pursuits are really one, but
							they appear to a superficial observer to differ.</note>
						and in that the latter is more complex and requires
						the greater application, while the former is the
						starting point and came first in time ?</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="8"><head>PART 8</head>
					<p>VIII. A consideration of the diet of the sick, as
						compared with that of men in health, would show
						that the diet of wild beasts and of animals generally
						is not more harmful, as compared with that of men
						in health.<note>The text here is very uncertain ; I have combined that
							of Littr&eacute; with that of K&eacute;hlewein so as to give a good sense :
							"The diet of men in health is as injurious to the sick as the
							diet of wild beasts is to men in health."</note> Take a man sick of a disease
						which is
						neither severe and desperate nor yet altogether mild,
						but likely to be pronounced under wrong treatment,
						and suppose that he resolved to eat bread, and meat,
						or any other food that is beneficial to men in health,
						not much of it, but far less than he could have taken
						had he been well ; take again a man in health, with
						a constitution neither altogether weak nor altogether</p>
					<pb id="p.27"/>
					<p>strong, and suppose he were to eat one of the foods
						that would be beneficial and strength-giving to an ox
						or a horse, vetches or barley or something similar,
						not much of it, but far less than he could take. If
						the man in health did this he would suffer no less
						pain and danger than that sick man who took bread
						or barley-cake at a time when he ought not. All this
						goes to prove that this art of medicine, if research be
						continued on the same method, can all be discovered.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9"><head>PART 9</head>
					<p>IX. If the matter were simple, as in these instances,
						and both sick and well were hurt by too
						strong foods, benefited and nourished by weaker
						foods, there would be no difficulty. For recourse to
						weaker food must have secured a great degree of
						safety. But as it is, if a man takes insufficient food,
						the mistake is as great as that of excess, and harms
						the man just as much. For abstinence has upon
						the human constitution a most powerful effect, to
						enervate, to weaken and to kill. Depletion produces
						many other evils, different from those of repletion, but
						just as severe. Wherefore the greater complexity of
						these ills requires a more exact method of treatment.
						For it is necessary to aim at some measure. But no
						measure, neither number nor weight, by reference to
						which knowledge can be made exact, can be found
						except bodily feeling. Wherefore it is laborious to
						make knowledge so exact that only small mistakes
						are made here and there. And that physician who
						makes only small mistakes would win my hearty
						praise. Perfectly exact truth is but rarely to be seen.
						For most physicians seem to me to be in the same</p>
					<pb id="p.29"/>
					<p>case as bad pilots ; the mistakes of the latter are
						unnoticed so long as they are steering in a calm, but,
						when a great storm overtakes them with a violent
						gale, all men realise clearly then that it is their
						ignorance and blundering which have lost the ship.
						So also when bad physicians, who comprise the great
						majority, treat men who are suffering from no serious
						complaint, so that the greatest blunders would not
						affect them seriously--such illnesses occur very often,
						being far more common than serious disease--they
						are not shown up in their true colours to laymen if
						their errors are confined to such cases ; but when
						they meet with a severe, violent and dangerous
						illness, then it is that their errors and want of skill
						are manifest to all. The punishment of the impostor,
						whether sailor or doctor, is not postponed, but follows
						speedily.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="10"><head>PART 10</head>
					<p>X. That the discomforts a man feels after unseasonable
						abstinence are no less than those of
						unseasonable repletion, it were well to learn by a
						reference to men in health. For some of them
						benefit by taking one meal only each day, and
						because of this benefit they make a rule of having
						only one meal ; others again, because of the same
						reason, that they are benefited thereby, take lunch
						also. Moreover some have adopted one or other of
						these two practices for the sake of pleasure or for
						some other chance reason. For the great majority
						of men can follow indifferently either the one habit or
						the other, and can take lunch or only one daily meal.
						Others again, if they were to do anything outside what
						is beneficial, would not get off easily, but if they</p>
					<pb id="p.31"/>
					<p>change their respective ways for a single day, nay,
						for a part of a single day, they suffer excessive discomfort.
						Some, who lunch although lunch does not
						suit them, forthwith become heavy and sluggish in
						body and in mind, a prey to yawning, drowsiness and
						thirst ; while, if they go on to eat dinner as well,
						flatulence follows with colic and violent diarrh&oelig;a.
						Many have found such action to result in a serious
						illness, even if the quantity of food they take twice
						a day be no greater than that which they have
						grown accustomed to digest once a day. On the
						other hand, if a man who has grown accustomed,
						and has found it beneficial, to take lunch, should
						miss taking it, he suffers, as soon as the lunch-hour
						is passed, from prostrating weakness, trembling and
						faintness. Hollowness of the eyes follows ; urine
						becomes paler and hotter, and the mouth bitter ; his
						bowels seem to hang ; there come dizziness, depression
						and listlessness. Besides all this, when he
						attempts to dine, he has the following troubles :
						his food is less pleasant, and he cannot digest what
						formerly he used to dine on when he had lunch.
						The mere food, descending into the bowels with
						colic and noise, burns them, and disturbed sleep
						follows, accompanied by wild and troubled dreams.
						Many such sufferers also have found these symptoms
						the beginning of an illness.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="11"><head>PART 11</head>
					<p>XI. It is necessary to inquire into the cause why
						such symptoms come to these men. The one who
						had grown accustomed to one meal suffered, I think,
						because he did not wait sufficient time, until his
						digestive organs had completely digested and assimilated
						the food taken the day before, and until they
						had become empty and quiet, but had taken fresh</p>
					<pb id="p.33"/>
					<p>food while the organs were still in a state of hot
						turmoil and ferment. Such organs digest much more
						slowly than others, and need longer rest and quiet.
						The man accustomed to take lunch, since no
						fresh nourishment was given him as soon as his
						body needed nourishment, when the previous meal
						was digested and there was nothing to sustain him,
						naturally wastes and pines away through want. For
						I put down to want all the symptoms which I have
						said such a man shows. And I assert furthermore
						that all other men besides, who when in good health
						fast for two or three days, will show the same
						symptoms as I have said those exhibit who do not
						take their lunch.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="12"><head>PART 12</head>
					<p>XII. Such constitutions, I contend, that rapidly
						and severely feel the effects of errors, are weaker
						than the others. A weak man is but one step
						removed from a sickly man, but a sickly man is
						weaker still, and is more apt to suffer distress whenever
						he misses the due season. And, while the art
						can admit of such nice exactness, it is difficult always
						to attain perfect accuracy. But many departments of
						medicine have reached such a pitch of exactness,
						and I will speak about them later. I declare, however,
						that we ought not to reject the ancient art as
						non-existent, or on the ground that its method of
						inquiry is faulty, just because it has not attained
						exactness in every detail, but much rather, because
						it has been able by reasoning to rise from deep
						ignorance to approximately perfect accuracy, I think
						we ought to admire the discoveries as the work, not
						of chance, but of inquiry rightly and correctly conducted.</p>
					<pb id="p.35"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="13"><head>PART 13</head>
					<p>XIII. But I want to return to the theory of those
						who prosecute their researches in the art after
						the novel fashion, building on a postulate. For if
						there be such a thing as heat, or cold, or dryness,
						or moistness, which injures a man, it necessarily
						follows that the scientific healer will counteract cold
						with hot, hot with cold, moist with dry and dry
						with moist. Now suppose we have a man whose
						constitution is not strong, but weaker than the
						average. Let this man's food be wheat straight
						from the threshing-floor, unworked and uncooked,
						and raw meat, and let his drink be water. The use
						of this diet will assuredly cause him much severe
						suffering ; he will experience pains and physical
						weakness, his digestion will be ruined and he will
						not be able to live long. Well, what remedy should
						be prepared for a man in this condition ? Heat or
						cold or dryness or moistness ? One of these, plainly ;
						for, according to the theory of the new school, if
						the injury was caused by one of the opposites, the
						other opposite ought to be a specific. Of course the
						most obvious as well as the most reliable medicine
						would be to abandon his old diet, and to give him
						bread instead of wheat, boiled meat instead of raw
						meat, and besides these things, a little wine to
						drink. This change must restore him to his health,
						unless indeed it has been entirely ruined by long
						continuance of the diet. What then shall we say ?
						That he was suffering from cold, and that the taking
						of these hot things benefited him ? Or shall we say
						the opposite ? I think that I have nonplussed my
						opponent. For is it the heat of the wheat, or the
						cold, or the dryness, or the moistness, that the baker
						took away from it ? For a thing which has been</p>
					<pb id="p.37"/>
					<p>exposed to fire and to water, and has been made by
						many other things, each of which has its own individual
						property<note>Or "power."</note> and nature, has lost some of its qualities
						and has been mixed and combined with others.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="14"><head>PART 14</head>
					<p>XIV. Of course I know also that it makes a difference
						to a man's body whether bread be of bolted or
						of unbolted flour, whether it be of winnowed or of
						unwinnowed wheat, whether it be kneaded with
						much water or with little, whether it be thoroughly
						kneaded or unkneaded, whether it be thoroughly
						baked or underbaked, and there are countless other
						differences. Barley-cake varies in just the same
						way. The properties<note>Or "powers."</note> too of each variety are
						powerful, and no one is like to any other. But how
						could he who has not considered these truths, or
						who considers them without learning, know anything
						about human ailments ? For each of these differences
						produces in a human being an effect and a change of
						one sort or another, and upon these differences is
						based all the dieting of a man, whether he be in
						health, recovering from an illness, or suffering from
						one. Accordingly there could surely be nothing
						more useful or more necessary to know than these
						things, and how the first discoverers, pursuing their
						inquiries excellently and with suitable application
						of reason to the nature of man, made their discoveries,
						and thought the art worthy to be ascribed
						to a god, as in fact is the usual belief. For they did
						not consider that the dry or the moist or the hot or
						the cold or anything else of the kind injures a man,
						or that he has need of any such thing, but they
						considered that it is the strength of each thing, that
						which, being too powerful for the human constitution,
						it cannot assimilate, which causes harm, and</p>
					<pb id="p.39"/>
					<p>this they sought to take away. The strongest
						part of the sweet is the sweetest, of the bitter
						the most bitter, of the acid the most acid, and
						each of all the component parts of man has its
						extreme. For these they saw are component
						parts of man, and that they are injurious to
						him ; for there is in man salt and bitter, sweet
						and acid, astringent and insipid,<note>Or "flat," the opposite of
							"sharp."</note> and a vast number
						of other things, possessing properties of all sorts,
						both in number and in strength. These, when
						mixed and compounded with one another are neither
						apparent nor do they hurt a man ; but when one of
						them is separated off, and stands alone, then it is
						apparent and hurts a man. Moreover, of the foods
						that are unsuitable for us and hurt a man when
						taken, each one of them is either bitter, or salt,
						or acid, or something else uncompounded and
						strong, and for this reason we are disordered by
						them, just as we are by the secretions separated
						off in the body. But all things that a man eats
						or drinks are plainly altogether free from such an
						uncompounded and potent humour, <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> bread, cake,
						and suchlike, which men are accustomed constantly
						to use in great quantity, except the highly seasoned
						delicacies which gratify his appetite and greed.
						And from such foods, when plentifully partaken of
						by a man, there arises no disorder at all or isolation
						of the powers<note>Or "properties."</note> resident in the body, but
						strength,
						growth and nourishment in great measure arise from
						them, for no other reason except that they are
						well compounded, and have nothing undiluted and
						strong, but form a single, simple whole.</p>
					<pb id="p.41"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="15"><head>PART 15</head>
					<p>XV. I am at a loss to understand how those who
						maintain the other view, and abandon the old method
						to rest the art on a postulate, treat their patients
						on the lines of their postulate. For they have
						not discovered, I think, an absolute hot or cold,
						dry or moist, that participates in no other form.
						But I think that they have at their disposal the
						same foods and the same drinks as we all use,
						and to one they add the attribute of being hot, to
						another, cold, to another, dry, to another, moist,
						since it would be futile to order a patient to take
						something hot, as he would at once ask, " What hot
						thing ? " So that they must either talk nonsense
						or have recourse to one of these known substances.
						And if one hot thing happens to be astringent, and
						another hot thing insipid, and a third hot thing
						causes flatulence (for there are many various kinds
						of hot things, possessing many opposite powers),
						surely it will make a difference whether he administers
						the hot astringent thing, or the hot insipid
						thing, or that which is cold and astringent at the
						same time (for there is such a thing), or the cold
						insipid thing. For I am sure that each of these
						pairs produces exactly the opposite of that produced
						by the other, not only in a man, but in a leathern
						or wooden vessel, and in many other things less
						sensitive than man. For it is not the heat which
						possesses the great power, but the astringent and
						the insipid, and the other qualities I have mentioned,
						both in man and out of man, whether eaten or
						drunk, whether applied externally as ointment or as
						plaster.</p>
					<pb id="p.43"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="16"><head>PART 16</head>
					<p>XVI. And I believe that of all the powers<note>Or "properties."</note> none
						hold less sway in the body than cold and heat. My
						reasons are these. So long as the hot and cold in the
						body are mixed up together, they cause no pain. For
						the hot is tempered and moderated by the cold, and
						the cold by the hot. But when either is entirely separated
						from the other, then it causes pain. And at
						that season, when cold comes upon a man and causes
						him some pain, for that very reason internal heat
						first is present quickly and spontaneously, without
						needing any help or preparation. The result is the
						same, whether men be diseased or in health.
						For instance, if a man in health will cool his
						body in winter, either by a cold bath or in any
						other way, the more he cools it (provided that his
						body is not entirely frozen) the more he becomes
						hotter than before when he puts his clothes on and
						enters his shelter. Again, if he will make himself
						thoroughly hot by means of either a hot bath of
						a large fire, and afterwards wear the same clothes
						and stay in the same place as he did when chilled, he
						feels far colder and besides more shivery than before.
						Or if a man fan himself because of the stifling heat
						and make coolness for himself, on ceasing to do this
						in this way he will feel ten times the stifling heat felt
						by one who does nothing of the sort.</p>
					<p>Now the following is much stronger evidence still.
						All who go afoot through snow or great cold, and
						become over-chilled in feet, hands or head, suffer at</p>
					<pb id="p.45" />
					<p>night very severely from burning and tingling when
						they come into a warm place and wrap up ; in some
						cases blisters arise like those caused by burning in
						fire. But it is not until they are warmed that they
						experience these symptoms. So ready is cold to pass
						into heat and heat into cold. I could give a multitude
						of other proofs. But in the case of sick folk, is it
						not those who have suffered from shivering in whom
						breaks out the most acute fever? And not only is it
						not powerful, but after a while does it not subside,
						generally without doing harm all the time it remains,
						hot as it is? And passing through all the body it
						ends in most cases in the feet, where the shivering
						and chill were most violent and lasted unusually long.
						Again, when the fever disappears with the breaking
						out of the perspiration, it cools the patient so that
						he is far colder than if he had never been attacked at
						all. What important or serious consequence, therefore,
						could come from that thing on which quickly
						supervenes in this way its exact opposite, spontaneously
						annulling its effect?<note>Or "power."</note> Or what need has it of
						elaborate treatment?</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="17"><head>PART 17</head>
					<p>XVII. An opponent may retort, "But patients
						whose fever comes from ardent fevers,<note><foreign lang="greek">KAU=S1OS2</foreign> was almost certainly a form of remittent malaria.
							See my <hi rend="ital">Malaria and Greek Hist<foreign lang="greek">S1</foreign>ry</hi> (index).</note> pneumonia,
						or other virulent disease, do not quickly get rid of
						their feverishness, and in these cases the heat and
						cold no longer alternate." Now I consider that
						herein lies my strongest evidence that men are not
						feverish merely through heat, and that it could not be
						the sole cause of the harm ; the truth being that one
						and the same thing is both bitter and hot, or acid and</p>
					<pb id="p.47"/>
					<p>hot, or salt and hot, with numerous other combinations,
						and cold again combines with other powers.<note>Or "properties."</note>
						It is these things which cause the harm. Heat, too,
						is present, but merely as a concomitant, having the
						strength of the directing factor which is aggravated
						and increases with the other factor, but having no
						power<note>Or "effect."</note> greater than that which properly belongs
						to it.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="18"><head>PART 18</head>
					<p>XVIII. That this is so is plain if we consider the
						following pieces of evidence. First we have the more
						obvious symptoms, which all of us often experience
						and will continue so to do. In the first place, those
						of us who suffer from cold in the head, with discharge
						from the nostrils, generally find this discharge more
						acrid than that which previously formed there and
						daily passed from the nostrils ; it makes the nose
						swell, and inflames it to an extremely fiery heat, as
						is shown if you put your hand upon it.<note>Or, with the MSS. reading, "And if you keep putting
							your hand to it, and the catarrh last a long time," etc.</note> And if the
						disease be present for an unusually long time, the
						part actually becomes ulcered, although it is without
						flesh and hard. But in some way the heat of the
						nostril ceases, not when the discharge takes place
						and the inflammation is present, but when the
						running becomes thicker and less acrid, being matured
						and more mixed than it was before, then it is that
						the heat finally ceases. But in cases where the evil
						obviously comes from cold alone, unaccompanied by
						anything else, there is always the same change, heat
						following chill and chill heat, and these supervene
						at once, and need no coction. In all other instances,</p>
					<pb id="p.49" />
					<p>where acrid and unmixed humours come into play,
						I am confident that the cause is the same, and that
						restoration results from coction and mixture.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="19"><head>PART 19</head>
					<p>XIX. Again, such discharges as settle in the eyes,
						possessing powerful, acrid humours of all sorts, ulcerate
						the eyelids, and in some cases eat into the parts on to
						which they run, the cheeks and under the eyes ; and
						they rupture and eat through the covering of the
						eyeball. But pains, burning and intense inflammation
						prevail until the discharges are concocted and
						become thicker, so that rheum is formed from them.
						This coction is the result of mixture, compounding
						and digestion. Secondly, the discharges that settle
						in the throat, giving rise to soreness, angina,
						erysipelas and pneumonia, all these at first emit salt,
						watery and acrid humours, whereby the diseases are
						strengthened. But when they become thicker and
						more matured, and throw off all trace of their acridness,
						then the fevers too subside with the other symptoms
						that distress the patient. We must surely consider
						the cause of each complaint to be those things the
						presence of which of necessity produces a complaint
						of a specific kind, which ceases when they change
						into another combination. All conditions, then,
						resulting from heat or cold pure and simple, with no
						other power<note>Or "quality."</note> as a factor, must cease when heat
						changes into cold or cold into heat. This change
						takes place in the manner I have described above.
						Moreover, all other complaints to which man is liable
						arise from powers.<note>Or "qualities."</note> Thus, when there is an out-pouring
						of the bitter principle, which we call yellow</p>
					<pb id="p.51"/>
					<p>bile, great nausea, burning and weakness prevail.
						When the patient gets rid of it, sometimes by purgation,
						either spontaneous or by medicine, if the
						purging be seasonable he manifestly gets rid both
						of the pains and of the heat. But so long as these
						bitter particles are undissolved, undigested and uncompounded,
						by no possible means can the pains and
						fevers be stayed. And those who are attacked by
						pungent and acrid acids suffer greatly from frenzy,
						from gnawings of the bowels and chest, and from
						restlessness.<note>Or "distress."</note> No relief from these symptoms is
						secured until the acidity is purged away, or calmed
						down and mixed with the other humours. But
						coction, alteration, thinning or thickening into the
						form of humours through other forms of all sorts
						(wherefrom crises also and fixing their periods derive
						great importance in cases of illness)--to all
						these things surely heat and cold are not in the least
						liable. For neither could either ferment or thicken.
						&dagger;For what shall we call it? Combinations of humours
						that exhibit a power<note>Or "property."</note> that varies with the various
						factors.<note>There are many reasons for supposing that this sentence
							is either (<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) in its wrong place, or (<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) an interpolation. It
							seems quite irrelevant, and <foreign lang="greek">AU)TW=N</foreign> should grammatically refer
							to <foreign lang="greek">TO\ QERMO\N</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">TO\ YUXRO/N</foreign>, but there is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> a crasis of these,
							but only of <foreign lang="greek">XUMOI/</foreign>. Hot and cold mixed produce only hot or
							cold, not a crasis. The sentence might be more relevantly
							placed at the end of Chapter XVIII, as an explanation of the
							process <foreign lang="greek">A)POKAQI/S1TAS1QAI PEFQE/NTA KAI\ KRHQE/NTA</foreign>. But transposition
							will not remove the other difficulties of the sentence. What
							is <foreign lang="greek">AU)TO/</foreign>? Health or disease? If health, then there is but
							<hi rend="ital">one</hi> crasis producing it, not "many, having various properties."
							If disease, then it cannot be a crasis at all, but
							<foreign lang="greek">A)KRAS1I/A</foreign>. Finally, <foreign lang="greek">A)/LLHN PRO\S2 A)/LLHLA</foreign> is dubious Greek. The
							whole sentence looks like an interpolation, though it is hard
							to say why it was introduced. The scribe of M seems to
							have felt the difficulties, for he wrote <foreign lang="greek">KRH=S1IS2, PLH\N</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">A)/LLHN</foreign>,
							and <foreign lang="greek">E)/XOUS1A</foreign>.</note>&dagger; Since the hot will give up its heat only
						when mixed with the cold, and the cold can be</p>
					<pb id="p.53"/>
					<p>neutralized only by the hot. But all other components
						of man become milder and better the
						greater the number of other components with which
						they are mixed. A man is in the best possible
						condition when there is complete coction and rest,
						with no particular power<note>Or "property."</note> displayed. About this I
						think that I have given a full explanation.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="20"><head>PART 20</head>
					<p>XX. Certain physicians and philosophers assert that
						nobody can know medicine who is ignorant what a
						man is ; he who would treat patients properly must,
						they say, learn this. But the question they raise is one
						for philosophy ; it is the province of those who, like
						Empedocles, have written on natural science,<note>About "nature," how the universe was born and grew
							out of primal elements. We might almost trauslate <foreign lang="greek">FU)S1IS2</foreign> by
							"evolution."</note> what
						man is from the beginning, how he came into being
						at the first, and from what elements he was originally
						constructed. But my view is, first, that all that
						philosophers or physicians have said or written on
						natural science no more pertains to medicine than to
						painting.<note>Or, perhaps, "pertains even less to medicine than to
							literature."</note> I also hold that clear knowledge about
						natural science can be acquired from medicine and
						from no other source, and that one can attain this
						knowledge when medicine itself has been properly
						comprehended, but till then it is quite impossible--I
						mean to possess this information, what man is,
						by what causes he is made, and similar points
						accurately. Since this at least I think a physician
						must know, and be at great pains to know, about
						natural science, if he is going to perform aught of his
						duty, what man is in relation to foods and drinks,</p>
					<pb id="p.55"/>
					<p>and to habits generally, and what will be the effects
						of each on each individual. It is not sufficient to
						learn simply that cheese is a bad food, as it gives a
						pain to one who eats a surfeit of it ; we must know
						what the pain is, the reasons for it, and which constituent
						of man is harmfully affected. For there are
						many other bad foods and bad drinks, which affect a
						man in different ways. I would therefore have the
						point put thus :--"Undiluted wine, drunk in large
						quantity, produces a certain effect upon a man." All
						who know this would realise that this is a power of
						wine, and that wine itself is to blame,<note>See Appendix on p. 64.</note> and we know
						through what parts of a man it chiefly exerts this
						power. Such nicety of truth I wish to be manifest
						in all other instances. To take my former example,
						cheese does not harm all men alike ; some can eat
						their fill of it without the slightest hurt, nay, those
						it agrees with are wonderfully strengthened thereby.
						Others come off badly. So the constitutions of these
						men differ, and the difference lies in the constituent of
						the body which is hostile to cheese, and is roused and
						stirred to action under its influence. Those in whom
						a humour of such a kind is present in greater quantity,
						and with greater control over the body, naturally suffer
						more severely. But if cheese were bad for the human
						constitution without exception, it would have hurt
						all. He who knows the above truths will not fall
						into the following errors.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="21"><head>PART 21</head>
					<p>XXI. In convalescence from illness, and also in
						protracted illnesses, many disturbances occur, some
						spontaneously and some from things casually</p>
					<pb id="p.57"/>
					<p>administered. I am aware that most physicians,
						like laymen, if the patient has done anything
						unusual near the day of the disturbance--taken a
						bath or a walk, or eaten strange food, these things
						being all beneficial--nevertheless assign the cause to
						one of them, and, while ignorant of the real cause,
						stop what may have been of the greatest value. Instead
						of so doing they ought to know what will be
						the result of a bath unseasonably taken or of fatigue.
						For the trouble caused by each of these things is
						also peculiar to each, and so with surfeit or such and
						such food. Whoever therefore fails to know how
						each of these particulars affects a man will be able
						neither to discover their consequences nor to use
						them properly.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="22"><head>PART 22</head>
					<p>XXII. I hold that it is also necessary to know which
						diseased states arise from powers and which from
						structures. What I mean is roughly that a "power"
						is an intensity and strength of the humours, while
						"structures" are the conformations to be found in
						the human body, some of which are hollow, tapering<note>Or "contracting."</note>
						from wide to narrow ; some are expanded, some
						hard and round, some broad and suspended, some
						stretched, some long, some close in texture, some loose
						in texture and fleshy, some spongy and porous. Now
						which structure is best adapted to draw and attract
						to itself fluid from the rest of the body, the hollow
						and expanded, the hard and round, or the hollow
						and tapering? I take it that the best adapted is
						the broad hollow that tapers. One should learn this
						thoroughly from unenclosed objects<note><hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> objects that are not concealed, as are the internal
							organs.</note> that can be</p>
					<pb id="p.59"/>
					<p>seen. For example, if you open the mouth wide
						you will draw in no fluid ; but if you protrude and
						contract it, compressing the lips, and then insert
						a tube, you can easily draw up any liquid you wish.
						Again, cupping instruments, which are broad and
						tapering, are so constructed on purpose to draw and
						attract blood from the flesh. There are many other
						instruments of a similar nature. Of the parts within
						the human frame, the bladder, the head, and the
						womb are of this structure. These obviously attract
						powerfully, and are always full of a fluid from without.
						Hollow and expanded parts are especially
						adapted for receiving fluid that has flowed into them,
						but are not so suited for attraction. Round solids
						will neither attract fluid nor receive it when it has
						flowed into them, for it would slip round and find no
						place on which to rest. Spongy, porous parts, like
						the spleen, lungs and breasts, will drink up readily
						what is in contact with them, and these parts
						especially harden and enlarge on the addition of
						fluid. They will not be evacuated every day, as are
						bowels, where the fluid is inside, while the bowels
						themselves contain it externally ; but when one of
						these parts drinks up the fluid and takes it to itself,
						the porous hollows, even the small ones, are every-where
						filled, and the soft, porous part becomes hard
						and close, and neither digests nor discharges. This
						happens because of the nature of its structure. When
						wind and flatulence are produced in the body, the</p>
					<pb id="p.61"/>
					<p>rumbling noise naturally occurs in the hollow, broad
						parts, such as the bowels and the chest. For when
						the flatulence does not fill a part so as to be at rest,
						but moves and changes its position, it cannot be but
						that thereby noise and perceptible movements take
						place. In soft, fleshy parts occur numbness and
						obstructions, such as happen in apoplexy. And when
						flatulence meets a broad, resisting body, and rushes
						on it, and this happens by nature to be neither strong
						so as to endure its violence without harm, nor soft
						and porous so as to give way and admit it, but tender,
						fleshy, full of blood, and close, like the liver, because
						it is close and broad it resists without yielding, while
						the flatulence being checked increases and becomes
						stronger, dashing violently against the obstacle. But
						owing to its tenderness and the blood it contains,
						the part cannot be free from pain, and this is why
						the sharpest and most frequent pains occur in this
						region, and abscesses and tumours are very common.
						Violent pain, but much less severe, is also felt under
						the diaphragm. For the diaphragm is an extended,
						broad and resisting substance, of a stronger and more
						sinewy texture, and so there is less pain. But here
						too occur pains and tumours.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="23"><head>PART 23</head>
					<p>XXIII. There are many other structural forms,
						both internal and external, which differ widely from
						one another with regard to the experiences of a
						patient and of a healthy subject, such as whether
						the head be large or small, the neck thin or thick,
						long or short, the bowels long or round, the chest and</p>
					<pb id="p.63"/>
					<p>ribs broad or narrow, and there are very many other
						things, the differences between which must all be
						known, so that knowledge of the causes of each thing
						may ensure that the proper precautions are taken.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="24"><head>PART 24</head>
					<p>XXIV. As I have said before, we must examine the
						powers of humours, and what the effect of each is
						upon man, and how they are related to one another.
						Let me give an example. If a humour that is sweet
						assumes another form, not by admixture, but by a
						self-caused change, what will it first become, bitter,
						or salt, or astringent, or acid? I think acid. Therefore
						where sweet humour is the least suitable of all,
						acid humour is the next least suitable to be administered.<note>Because :--
							<p>(1) Health is a <hi rend="ital">crasis</hi> of all the humours, none being in
								excess ;</p>
							<p>(2) Sweet humour passes readily into acid ;</p>
							<p>(3) Therefore, when sweet is the least suitable as a remedy
								(there being an excess of it already), acid (which is likely to
								be reinforced from the sweet) is the next least suitable.</p>
							<p>K&eacute;hlewein's text makes sense only if we transpose <foreign lang="greek">O)CU/S2</foreign> and
								<foreign lang="greek">GLUKU/S2</foreign>. If you want <foreign lang="greek">O)CU\S XUMO/S1</foreign> for <hi rend="ital">crasis</hi> you can get it best
								by adding <foreign lang="greek">O)CU/S2</foreign>, next best by adding <foreign lang="greek">GLUKU/S</foreign>, which naturally
								turns into <foreign lang="greek">O)CU/S2</foreign>.</p></note> If a man can in this way conduct with
						success inquiries outside the human body, he will
						always be able to select the very best treatment.
						And the best is always that which is farthest removed
						from the unsuitable.</p></div2>

					<p>This passage contradicts the general argument, which is
						that in medicine statements about foods must not be made
						<foreign lang="greek">A(PLW=S2</foreign>. Cheese is not bad food ; it is only bad in certain
						conditions, and in certain ways, and at certain times. In
						these circumstances cheese has a <foreign lang="greek">DU/NAMIS</foreign> which does not
						belong to cheese in itself, but is latent until certain conditions
						call it forth. The error, says the writer, is not made in the
						case of wine. Everybody knows that in itself wine is not
						bad ; it is drinking to excess, or at wrong times, which is
						mischievous.</p>
					<p>Now the reading of A (in fact any MS. reading) makes the
						writer say that wine itself <hi rend="ital">is</hi> to blame (<foreign lang="greek">AU)TO\S2 AI)/TIOS2</foreign>)--an
						obvious contradiction of the general argument. My colleague
						the Rev. H. J. Chaytor most ingeniously suggests that <foreign lang="greek">AU)TO/S2</foreign>
						refers not to wine but to the man. He would therefore
						translate "this <foreign lang="greek">DU/NAMIS</foreign> of wine and the man himself are to
						blame." But not only is it more natural for <foreign lang="greek">AU)TO/S2</foreign> to refer to
						wine, but the writer's whole point is that in and by itself <hi rend="ital">no</hi>
						food is <foreign lang="greek">AI)/TIOS2</foreign>. A food is a cause only in certain conditions,
						or, rather, certain conditions call forth certain <foreign lang="greek">DUNA/MEIS2</foreign>.</p>
					<p>I think, therefore, that the right reading is <foreign lang="greek">O(/TI TOIAU/TH
						DU/NAMIS2 OI(/NOU KAI\ OU)K AU)TO\S2 AI(/TIOS2</foreign>. "Such and such a <foreign lang="greek">DU/NAMIS</foreign>
						of wine (<hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> a <foreign lang="greek">DU/NAMIS2</foreign> caused by excess of wine acting upon
						the human <foreign lang="greek">FU/SIIS2</foreign>) is to blame and not mere wine by itself."
						<foreign lang="greek">O(/TI TOIAU/TH</foreign> might easily turn into <foreign lang="greek">O(/TI AU(/TH</foreign>, and the omission
						of <foreign lang="greek">OU)</foreign> by scribes is not uncommon.</p>
					<p>There is an attractive vigour about the reading <foreign lang="greek">I)DO/NTES2</foreign> for
						<foreign lang="greek">OI( EI)DO/TES2</foreign>, and it may be correct. "Anybody can see at a
						glance that in the case of wine it is excess, etc., and not
						merely wine itself which is to blame."</p></div2></div1>

				<pb id="p.71"/>
				<div2 type="section" n="1"><head>PART 1</head><p>W<hi rend="sc">HOEVER</hi> wishes to pursue properly the science of
					medicine must proceed thus. First he ought to
					consider what effects each season of the year can
					produce ; for the seasons are not at all alike, but
					differ widely both in themselves and at their changes.
					The next point is the hot winds and the cold,
					especially those that are universal, but also those
					that are peculiar to each particular region. He
					must also consider the properties of the waters ; for
					as these differ in taste and in weight, so the property
					of each is far different from that of any other.
					Therefore, on arrival at a town with which he is
					unfamiliar, a physician should examine its position
					with respect to the winds and to the risings of
					the sun. For a northern, a southern, an eastern,
					and a western aspect has each its own individual
					property. He must consider with the greatest care
					both these things and how the natives are off for
					water, whether they use marshy, soft waters, or
					such as are hard and come from rocky heights,
					or brackish and harsh. The soil too, whether bare
					and dry or wooded and watered, hollow and hot
					or high and cold. The mode of life also of the
					inhabitants that is pleasing to them, whether they</p>
					<pb id="p.73"/>
					<p>are heavy drinkers, taking lunch,<note>That is, taking more than one full meal every day.</note> and inactive, or
						athletic, industrious, eating much and drinking little.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>PART 2</head><p>II. Using this evidence he must examine the
					several problems that arise. For if a physician
					know these things well, by preference all of them,
					but at any rate most, he will not, on arrival at a
					town with which he is unfamiliar, be ignorant of
					the local diseases, or of the nature of those that
					commonly prevail ; so that he will not be at a loss
					in the treatment of diseases, or make blunders, as is
					likely to be the case if he have not this knowledge
					before he consider his several problems. As time
					and the year passes he will be able to tell what
					epidemic diseases will attack the city either in
					summer or in winter, as well as those peculiar to
					the individual which are likely to occur through
					change in mode of life. For knowing the changes
					of the seasons, and the risings and settings of the
					stars, with the circumstances of each of these
					phenomena, he will know beforehand the nature of
					the year that is coming. Through these considerations
					and by learning the times beforehand, he will
					have full knowledge of each particular case, will
					succeed best in securing health, and will achieve the
					greatest triumphs in the practice of his art. If it
					be thought that all this belongs to meteorology, he
					will find out, on second thoughts, that the contribution
					of astronomy to medicine is not a very small
					one but a very great one indeed. For with the
					seasons men's diseases, like their digestive organs,
					suffer change.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3"><head>PART 3</head><p>III. I will now set forth clearly how each of the
					foregoing questions ought to be investigated, and</p>
					<pb id="p.75"/>
					<p>the tests to be applied. A city that lies exposed
						to the hot winds--these are those between the winter
						rising of the sun and its winter setting--when
						subject to these and sheltered from the north winds,
						the waters here are plentiful and brackish, and must
						be near the surface,<note><foreign lang="greek">METE/WROS2</foreign> "elevated," both here and in Chapter XXIV,
							seems, when applied to springs, to mean the opposite of
							"Deep," <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> rising from a point near the surface of the soil.
							Contrast Chapter VII, where water <foreign lang="greek">E)K BAQUTA/TWN PHGE/WN</foreign> is
							said to be warm in winter and cool in summer.</note> hot in summer and cold in winter.
						The heads of the inhabitants are moist and full of
						phlegm, and their digestive organs are frequently
						deranged from the phlegm that runs down into them
						from the head. Most of them have a rather flabby
						physique, and they are poor eaters and poor drinkers.
						For men with weak heads will be poor drinkers, as
						the after-effects are more distressing to them. The
						endemic diseases are these. In the first place,
						the women are unhealthy and subject to excessive
						fluxes. Then many are barren through disease and
						not by nature, while abortions are frequent. Children
						are liable to convulsions and asthma, and to what
						they think causes the disease of childhood, and to
						be a sacred disease.<note>That is, epilepsy. Coray's reading means, "that
							affection which they think is caused by Heaven, and to be
							sacred."</note> Men suffer from dysentery,
						diarrhoea, ague, chronic fevers in winter, many
						attacks<note>Or "forms."</note> of eczema, and from hemorrhoids. Cases
						of pleurisy, pneumonia, ardent fever, and of diseases
						considered acute, rarely occur. These diseases
						cannot prevail where the bowels are loose. Inflammations
						of the eyes occur with running, but are not</p>
					<pb id="p.77"/>
					<p>serious ; they are of short duration, unless a general
						epidemic take place after a violent change. When
						they are more than fifty years old, they are paralyzed
						by catarrhs supervening from the brain, when the
						sun suddenly strikes their head or they are chilled.
						These are their endemic diseases, but besides, they
						are liable to any epidemic disease that prevails
						through the change of the seasons.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4"><head>PART 4</head><p>IV. But the following is the condition of cities
					with the opposite situation, facing the cold winds
					that blow from between the summer setting and
					the summer rising of the sun, being habitually
					exposed to these winds, but sheltered from the
					hot winds and from the south. First, the waters
					of the region are generally hard and cold. The
					natives must be sinewy and spare, and in most cases
					their digestive organs are costive and hard in their
					lower parts, but more relaxed in the upper. They
					must be bilious rather than phlegmatic. Their
					heads are healthy and hard, but they have in most
					cases a tendency to internal lacerations. Their
					endemic diseases are as follow. Pleurisies are
					common, likewise those diseases which are accounted
					acute. It must be so, since their digestive organs
					are hard, and the slightest cause inevitably produces
					in many patients abscesses, the result of a
					stiff body and hard digestive organs. For their
					dryness, combined with the coldness of the water,
					makes them liable to internal lacerations. Such</p>
					<pb id="p.79"/>
					<p>constitutions necessarily make men eat much and
						drink little ; for one cannot be both a great eater
						and a great drinker. Inflammations of the eyes
						occur at last ; they are hard and violent, and rapidly
						cause rupture of the eyes. Men under thirty
						suffer from violent bleedings at the nose in summer.
						Instances of the disease called "sacred" are rare
						but violent. These men are more likely to be
						long-lived than are others. Their sores become
						neither phlegmatic<hi rend="sup">1</hi> nor malignant, but their characters
						incline to fierceness, not to mildness. For
						men these diseases are endemic, besides there are
						epidemic diseases which may prevail through the
						change of the seasons. As to the women, firstly
						many become barren through the waters being hard,
						indigestible and cold. Their menstrual discharges
						are not healthy, but are scanty and bad. Then
						childbirth is difficult, although abortion is rare.
						After bearing children they cannot rear them, for
						their milk is dried up through the hardness and
						indigestibility of the waters, while cases of phthisis
						are frequent after parturition, for the violence of
						it causes ruptures and strains. Children suffer from
						dropsies in the testicles while they are little, which
						disappear as they grow older. In such a city puberty
						is late.</p>

						Those that lie towards the risings of the sun are
						likely to be healthier than those facing the north
						and those exposed to the hot winds, even though
						they be but a furlong apart. In the first place, the
						heat and the cold are more moderate. Then the
						waters that face the risings of the sun must be clear,
						sweet-smelling, soft and delightful, in such a city.
						For the sun, shining down upon them when it rises,
						purifies them. The persons of the inhabitants are
						of better complexion and more blooming than elsewhere,
						unless some disease prevents this. They
						are clear-voiced, and with better temper and intelligence
						than those who are exposed to the north,
						just as all things growing there are better. A city
						so situated is just like spring, because the heat and
						the cold are tempered ; the diseases, while resembling
						those which we said occur in cities facing the
						hot winds, are both fewer and less severe. The
						women there very readily conceive and have easy
						deliveries.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6"><head>PART 6</head><p>VI. Such are the conditions in these cities. Those
					that lie towards the settings of the sun, and are</p>
					<pb id="p.83"/>
					<p>sheltered from the east winds, while the hot winds
						and the cold north winds blow past them--these
						cities must have a most unhealthy situation. In the
						first place, the waters are not clear, the reason being
						that in the morning mist is generally prevalent,
						which dissolves in the water and destroys its clearness,
						as the sun does not shine upon it before it
						is high on the horizon. In the summer cold breezes
						blow in the morning and there are heavy dews ;
						for the rest of the day the sun as it advances
						towards the west thoroughly scorches the inhabitants,
						so that they are likely to be pale and sickly, subject
						to all the diseases aforesaid, for none are peculiar
						to them.<note><foreign lang="greek">AU)TOI=S2</foreign> may be either a dative of advantage or one of

						voices, because of the atmosphere, since it is usually
						impure and unhealthy in such places. For while
						it is not clarified much by the north winds, which
						are not prevalent there, the winds that do prevail
						insistently are very rainy, such being the nature of
						westerly winds. Such a situation for a city is precisely
						like autumn in respect of the changes of the
						day, seeing that the difference between sunrise and
						afternoon is great.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7"><head>PART 7</head><p>VII. So much for winds, healthy and unhealthy.
					I wish now to treat of waters, those that bring
					disease or very good health, and of the ill or good
					that is likely to arise from water. For the influence</p>
					<pb id="p.85"/>
					<p>of water upon health is very great. Such as are
						marshy, standing and stagnant must in summer be
						hot, thick and stinking, because there is no outflow ;
						and as fresh rain-water is always flowing in and the
						sun heats them, they must be of bad colour, unhealthy
						and bilious. In winter they must be frosty,
						cold and turbid through the snow and frosts, so as
						to be very conducive to phlegm and sore throats.
						Those who drink it have always large, stiff spleens,
						and hard, thin, hot stomachs, while their shoulders,
						collar-bones and faces are emaciated ; the fact is
						that their flesh dissolves to feed the spleen, so that
						they are lean. With such a constitution they eat
						and drink heavily. Their digestive organs, upper
						and lower, are very dry and very hot, so that they
						need more powerful drugs. This malady is endemic
						both in summer and in winter. In addition the
						dropsies that occur are very numerous and very
						fatal. For in the summer there are epidemics of
						dysentery, diarrhoea and long quartan fever, which
						diseases when prolonged cause constitutions such as
						I have described to develop dropsies that result in
						death. These are their maladies in summer. In
						winter young people suffer from pneumonia and
						illnesses attended by delirium, the older, through
						the hardness of their digestive organs, from ardent
						fever. Among the women occur swellings and leucophlegmasia ;
						they conceive hardly and are delivered
						with difficulty. The babies are big and swollen, and</p>
					<pb id="p.87"/>
					<p>then, as they are nursed, they oecome emaciated<note>Or "consumptive."</note>
						and miserable. The discharge after childbirth is
						bad. Children are very subject to hernia and men
						to enlarged veins and to ulcers on the legs, so that
						such constitutions cannot be long-lived but must
						grow prematurely old. Moreover, the women appear
						to be with child, yet, when the time of delivery
						comes, the fullness of the womb disappears, this
						being caused by dropsy in that organ. Such waters
						I hold to be absolutely bad. The next worst will be
						those whose springs are from rocks--for they must
						be hard--or from earth where there are hot waters,
						or iron is to be found, or copper, or silver, or gold,
						or sulphur, or alum, or bitumen, or soda. For all
						these result from the violence of the heat. So from
						such earth good waters cannot come, but hard, heating
						waters, difficult to pass and causing constipation.
						The best are those that flow from high places and
						earthy hills. By themselves they are sweet and clear,
						and the wine they can stand is but little. In winter
						they are warm, in summer cold. They would naturally
						be so, coming from very deep springs. I commend
						especially those whose flow breaks forth towards the
						rising--by preference the summer rising--of the
						sun. For they must be brighter, sweet-smelling
						and light ; while all that are salt, harsh and hard
						are not good to drink, though there are some constitutions
						and some diseases which are benefited by
						drinking such waters, concerning which I will speak</p>
					<pb id="p.89"/>
					<p>presently. Aspect affects spring waters thus. Those
						whose sources face the risings of the sun are the
						very best. Second in excellence come those between
						the summer risings and the summer settings, by
						preference in the direction of the risings. Third
						best are those between the summer and winter
						settings. The worst are those that face the south,
						and those between the winter rising and setting.
						These are very bad indeed when the winds are in the
						south, less bad when they are in the north. Spring
						waters should be used thus. A man in health and
						strength can drink any water that is at hand without
						distinction, but he who because of disease wishes
						to drink the most suitable can best attain health in
						the following way. Those whose digestive organs are
						hard and easily heated will gain benefit from the
						sweetest, lightest and most sparkling waters. But
						those whose bellies are soft, moist, and phlegmatic,
						benefit from the hardest, most harsh and saltish
						waters, for these are the best to dry them up. For
						waters that are best for cooking and most solvent
						naturally loosen the digestive organs the most and
						relax them ; but harsh waters, hard and very bad for
						cooking, contract most these organs and dry them
						up. In fact the public are mistaken about saline
						waters through inexperience, in that they are
						generally considered to be laxative. The truth is
						that they are just the reverse ; they are harsh and
						bad for cooking, so that the digestive organs too
						are stiffened by them rather than loosened.</p>
					<pb id="p.91"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="8"><head>PART 8</head><p>VIII. Such are the facts about spring waters. I
					will now proceed to speak of rain water and snow
					water. Rain waters are the lightest, sweetest, finest
					and clearest. To begin with, the sun raises and draws
					up the finest and lightest part of water, as is proved
					by the formation of salt. The brine, owing to its
					coarseness and weight, is left behind and becomes
					salt ; the finest part, owing to its lightness, is drawn
					up by the sun. Not only from pools does the sun
					raise this part, but also from the sea and from
					whatever has moisture in it--and there is moisture
					in everything. Even from men it raises the finest
					and lightest part of their juices. The plainest
					evidence thereof is that when a man walks or sits
					in the sun wearing a cloak, the parts of his skin
					reached by the sun will not sweat, for it draws up
					each layer of sweat as it appears. But those parts
					sweat which are covered by his cloak or by anything
					else. For the sweat drawn forcibly out by the
					sun is prevented by the covering from disappearing
					through the sun's power. But when the man has
					come into a shady place, his whole body sweats
					alike, as the sun no longer shines upon it. For this
					reason too rain-water grows foul quicker than any
					other, and has a bad smell ; being a mixture gathered
					from very many sources it grows foul very quickly.
					Furthermore, when it has been carried away aloft, and
					has combined with the atmosphere as it circles round,
					the turbid, dark part of it separates out, changes
					and becomes mist and fog, while the clearest and</p>
					<pb id="p.93"/>
					<p>lightest part of it remains, and is sweetened as the
						heat of the sun produces coction, just as all other
						things always become sweeter through coction.
						Now as long as it is scattered and uncondensed, it
						travels about aloft, but as soon as it collects anywhere
						and is compressed into one place owing to
						sudden, contrary winds, then it bursts wherever the
						most compression happens to take place. For this
						is more likely to occur when the clouds, set in
						motion and carried along by a wind that allows them
						no rest, are suddenly encountered by a contrary
						blast and by other clouds.<note>The reading of K&eacute;hlewein means,
							"condensed, set in
							motion and carried along by a wind, are suddenly," etc.</note> In such cases
						the front is
						compressed, the rear comes on and is thus thickened,
						darkened and compressed into one place, so that the
						weight bursts it and causes rain. Such waters are
						naturally the best. But they need to be boiled and
						purified<note>Or, with the reading of Coray, "filtered."</note> from
						foulness if they are not to have a bad
						smell, and give sore throat, coughs and hoarseness to
						those who drink them.</p>
					<p>Waters from snow and ice are all bad. For, once
						frozen, water never recovers its original nature, but
						the clear, light, sweet part is separated out and
						disappears, while the muddiest and heaviest part
						remains. The following experiment will prove it.
						Pour by measure, in winter, water into a vessel and
						set it in the open, where it will freeze best ; then on
						the next day bring it under cover, where the ice will</p>
					<pb id="p.95"/>
					<p>melt best ; if, when it is dissolved, you measure it
						again you will find it much diminished. This shows
						that freezing dries up and causes to disappear the
						lightest and finest part, not the heaviest and coarsest,
						to do which it has no power. In this way, therefore,
						I am of opinion that such waters, derived from snow
						or ice, and waters similar to these, are the worst for
						all purposes.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9"><head>PART 9</head><p>IX. Such are the properties of rain waters, and of
					those from snow and ice. Stone, kidney disease,
					strangury and sciatica are very apt to attack people,
					and ruptures occur, when they drink water of very
					many different kinds, or from large rivers, into which
					other rivers flow, or from a lake fed by many streams
					of various sorts, and whenever they use foreign waters
					coming from a great, not a short, distance. For one
					water cannot be like another ; some are sweet,
					others are impregnated with salt and alum, others
					flow from hot springs. These when mixed up
					together disagree, and the strongest always prevails.
					But the strongest is not always the same ; sometimes
					it is one, sometimes another, according to the winds.
					One has its strength from a north wind, another
					from the south wind, and similarly with the others.
					Such waters then must leave a sediment of mud and
					sand in the vessels, and drinking them causes the
					diseases mentioned before. That there are exceptions
					I will proceed to set forth.</p>
					<p>Those whose bowels are loose and healthy, whose
						bladder is not feverish, and the mouth of whose
						bladder is not over narrow, pass water easily, and no</p>
					<pb id="p.97"/>
					<p>solid matter forms in their bladder. But feverishness
						of the bowels must be accompanied by feverishness
						of the bladder. For when it is abnormally
						heated its mouth is inflamed. In this condition it
						does not expel the urine, but concocts and heats it
						within itself. The finest part is separated off, and
						the clearest passes out as urine, while the thickest
						and muddiest part forms solid matter, which, though
						at first small, grows in course of time. For as it rolls
						about in the urine it coalesces with whatever solid
						matter forms, and so it grows and hardens. When
						the patient makes water, it is forced by the urine to
						fall against the mouth of the bladder, and staying
						the flow of the urine causes violent pain. So that
						boys that suffer from stone rub and pull at their
						privy parts, under the impression that there lies the
						cause of their making water.<note>Coray's emendation would mean, "the
							cause of the
							stoppage," an attractive alteration.</note> That my account is
						correct is shown by the fact that sufferers from stone
						emit urine that is very clear, as the thickest and
						muddiest part of it remains and solidifies. This in
						most cases is the cause of stone. Children get stone
						also from the milk, if it be unhealthy, too hot and
						bilious. For it heats the bowels and the bladder,
						so that the urine is heated and affected as I have
						described. And my opinion is that we should give
						to young children only very diluted wine, which
						heats and parches the veins less. Females suffer
						less from stone. For their urethra is short and
						broad, so that the urine is easily expelled. Nor do
						they rub the privy parts as do males, nor handle the</p>
					<pb id="p.99"/>
					<p>urethra. For it opens directly into the privy parts,
						which is not so with males, nor is their urethra wide.
						And they drink more than boys do.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="10"><head>PART 10</head><p>X. This, or something very like this, is the truth
					concerning these matters. As to the seasons, a
					consideration of the following points will make it
					possible to decide whether the year will prove
					unhealthy or healthy. If the signs prove normal
					when the stars set and rise ; if there be rains in
					autumn, if the winter be moderate, neither too mild
					nor unseasonably cold, and if the rains be seasonable
					in spring and in summer, the year is likely to be
					very healthy. If, on the other hand, the winter
					prove dry and northerly, the spring rainy and
					southerly, the summer cannot fail to be feverladen,
					causing ophthalmia and dysenteries. For
					whenever the great heat comes on suddenly while
					the earth is soaked by reason of the spring rains
					and the south wind, the heat cannot fail to be
					doubled, coming from the hot, sodden earth and
					the burning sun ; men's bowels not being braced
					nor their brain dried--for when spring is such
					the body and its flesh must necessarily be flabby--the
					fevers that attack are of the acutest type in
					all cases, especially among the phlegmatic. Dysenteries
					are also likely to come upon women and
					the most humid constitutions. If at the rising
					of the Dog Star stormy rain occurs and the
					Etesian winds blow, there is hope that the distempers
					will cease and that the autumn will be
					healthy. Otherwise there is danger lest deaths</p>
					<pb id="p.101"/>
					<p>occur among the women and children, and least
						of all among the old men ; and lest those that get
						better lapse into quartans, and from quartans into
						dropsies. But if the winter be southerly, rainy and
						mild, and the spring be northerly, dry and wintry,
						in the first place women with child whose delivery
						is due by spring suffer abortion ; and if they do
						bring forth, their children are weak and sickly,
						so that either they die at once, or live puny, weak
						and sickly. Such is the fate of the women. The
						others have dysenteries and dry ophthalmia, and
						in some cases catarrhs descend from the head to
						the lungs. Phlegmatics are liable to dysenteries,
						and women also, phlegm running down from the
						brain because of the humidity of their constitution.
						The bilious have dry ophthalmia because of the
						warm dryness of their flesh. Old men have catarrhs
						because of their flabbiness and the wasting of their
						veins, so that some die suddenly, while others
						become paralyzed on the right side or the left. For
						whenever, owing to the winter being southerly
						and the body warm, neither brain nor veins are
						hardened, a northerly, dry, cold spring supervening,
						the brain, just at the time when it ought to have been
						relaxed along with spring and purged by cold in the
						head and hoarseness, congeals and hardens, so that
						the heat of summer having suddenly supervened and
						the change supervening, these diseases befall. Such</p>
					<pb id="p.103"/>
					<p>cities as are well situated with regard to sun and
						winds, and use good waters, are less affected by such
						changes ; but if they use marshy or standing waters,
						and are not well situated with regard to winds and
						sun, they are more affected. If the summer prove
						dry, the diseases cease more quickly ; if it be rainy,
						they are protracted. Sores are apt to fester from the
						slightest cause. Lienteries and dropsies supervene
						on the conclusion of the diseases, as the bowels do
						not readily dry up. If the summer and the autumn
						be rainy and southerly, the winter must be unhealthy ;
						phlegmatics and men over forty are likely
						to suffer from ardent fevers, bilious people from
						pleurisy and pneumonia. If the summer prove dry
						and northerly, and the autumn rainy and southerly,
						it is likely that in winter headaches occur and
						mortifications of the brain,<note>See Littr&eacute; V. 581 foll.</note> and in
						addition hoarseness,
						colds in the head, coughs, and in some cases consumption
						as well. But if the weather be northerly
						and dry, with no rain either during the Dog Star or
						at Arcturus, it is very beneficial to those who have
						a phlegmatic or humid constitution, and to women,
						but it is very harmful to the bilious. For these dry
						up overmuch, and are attacked by dry ophthalmia
						and by acute, protracted fevers, in some cases too
						by melancholies. For the most humid and watery
						part of the bile is dried up and is spent, while the</p>
					<pb id="p.105"/>
					<p>thickest and most acrid part is left, and similarly
						with the blood. Consequently these diseases come
						upon them. But all these conditions are helpful to
						the phlegmatic, for they dry up and reach winter
						dried up and not flabby.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="11"><head>PART 11</head><p>XI. By studying and observing after this fashion
					one may foresee most of the consequences of the
					changes. One should be especially on one's guard
					against the most violent changes of the seasons, and
					unless compelled one should neither purge, nor
					apply cautery or knife to the bowels, before at least
					ten days are past. The following are the four most
					violent changes and the most dangerous :--both
					solstices, especially the summer solstice, both the
					equinoxes, so reckoned, especially the autumnal.
					One must also guard against the risings of the stars,
					especially of the Dog Star, then of Arcturus, and also
					of the setting of the Pleiades. For it is especially
					at these times that diseases come to a crisis. Some
					prove fatal, some come to an end, all others change
					to another form and another constitution.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="12"><head>PART 12</head><p>XII. So much for the changes of the seasons.
					Now I intend to compare Asia<note>That is, Asia Minor.</note> and Europe,
					and
					to show how they differ in every respect, and how
					the nations of the one differ entirely in physique
					from those of the other. It would take too long to
					describe them all, so I will set forth my views about
					the most important and the greatest differences. I
					hold that Asia differs very widely from Europe in the</p>
					<pb id="p.107"/>
					<p>nature of all its inhabitants and of all its vegetation.
						For everything in Asia grows to far greater beauty
						and size ; the one region is less wild than the other,
						the character of the inhabitants is milder and more
						gentle. The cause of this is the temperate climate,
						because it lies towards the east midway between
						the risings<note>That is, the winter rising and the summer rising.</note> of
						the sun, and farther away than is
						Europe from the cold. Growth and freedom from
						wildness are most fostered when nothing is forcibly
						predominant, but equality in every respect prevails.
						Asia, however, is not everywhere uniform ; the
						region, however, situated midway between the heat
						and the cold is very fruitful, very wooded and very
						mild ; it has splendid water, whether from rain or
						from springs. While it is not burnt up with the
						heat nor dried up by drought and want of water, it is
						not oppressed with cold, nor yet damp and wet with
						excessive rains and snow. Here the harvests are
						likely to be plentiful, both those from seed and those
						which the earth bestows of her own accord, the
						fruit of which men use, turning wild to cultivated
						and transplanting them to a suitable soil. The
						cattle too reared there are likely to flourish, and
						especially to bring forth the sturdiest young and
						rear them to be very fine creatures.<note>Or, if <foreign lang="greek">PUKN/OTATA</foreign> and
							<foreign lang="greek">K/ALLIDTA</foreign> be adverbs, "they are very
							prolifio and the best of mothers."</note> The men
						will be well nourished, of very fine physique and
						very tall, differing from one another but little either
						in physique or stature. This region, both in character
						and in the mildness of its seasons, might fairly
						be said to bear a close resemblance to spring</p>
					<pb id="p.109"/>
					<p>Courage, endurance, industry and high spirit could
						not arise in such conditions either among the
						natives or among immigrants,<note>The writer is thinking of Asiatic
							natives and the Greek
							colonists on the coast of Asia Minor.</note> but pleasure must
						be supreme . . .<note>There is a gap in the text here dealing with the
							Egyptians
							and Libyans.</note> wherefore in the beasts they are
						of many shapes.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="13"><head>PART 13</head><p>XIII. Such in my opinion is the condition of the
					Egyptians and Libyans. As to the dwellers on the
					right of the summer risings of the sun up to Lake
					Maeotis, which is the boundary between Europe
					and Asia, their condition is as follows. These
					nations are less homogeneous than those I have
					described, because of the changes of the seasons
					and the character of the region. The land is
					affected by them exactly as human beings in
					general are affected. For where the seasons experience
					the most violent and the most frequent
					changes,<note>Or, more idiomatically, "the variations of climate are
						most violent and most frequent." The four changes at the
						end of the four seasons were only the most important of
						many <foreign lang="greek">METABOLAI</foreign>. See Chapter XI, and pp. 68, 69.</note> the land too is
					very wild and very uneven ;
					you will find there many wooded mountains, plains
					and meadows. But where the seasons do not alter
					much, the land is very even. So it is too with the
					inhabitants, if you will examine the matter. Some
					physiques resemble wooded, well-watered mountains,
					others light, dry land, others marshy meadows,
					others a plain of bare, parched earth. For the
					seasons which modify a physical frame differ ; if the</p>
					<pb id="p.111"/>
					<p>differences be great, the more too are the differences
						in the shapes.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="14"><head>PART 14</head><p>XIV. The races that differ but little from one
					another I will omit, and describe the condition only
					of those which differ greatly, whether it be through
					nature or through custom. I will begin with the
					Longheads.<note>Practically nothing more is told us about this race by
						our other authorities, Pliny, Harpocration and Suidas. But
						see Littr&eacute; IV., xi. and xii.</note> There is no other race at all with
					heads like theirs. Originally custom was chiefly responsible
					for the length of the head, but now custom
					is reinforced by nature. Those that have the
					longest heads they consider the noblest, and their
					custom is as follows. As soon as a child is born
					they remodel its head with their hands, while it
					is still soft and the body tender, and force it to
					increase in length by applying bandages and suitable
					appliances, which spoil the roundness of the
					head and increase its length. Custom originally so
					acted that through force such a nature came into
					being ; but as time went on the process became
					natural, so that custom no longer exercised compulsion.
					For the seed comes from all parts of the
					body, healthy seed from healthy parts, diseased seed
					from diseased parts. If, therefore, bald parents have
					for the most part bald children, grey-eyed parents
					grey-eyed children, squinting parents squinting
					children, and so on with other physical peculiarities,
					what prevents a long-headed parent having a long-headed
					child?<note>Modern biologists hold that acquired characteristics are
						not inherited.</note> At the present time long-headedness
					is less common than it was, for owing to intercourse
					with other men the custom is less prevalent.</p>
					<pb id="p.113"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="15"><head>PART 15</head><p>XV. These are my opinions about the Longheads.
					Now let me turn to the dwellers on the Phasis. Their
					land is marshy, hot, wet, and wooded ; copious violent
					rains fall there during every season. The inhabitants
					live in the marshes, and their dwellings are of wood
					and reeds, built in the water. They make little use
					of walking in the city and the harbour, but sail
					up and down in dug-outs made from a single log,
					for canals are numerous. The waters which they
					drink are hot and stagnant, putrefied by the sun
					and swollen by the rains. The Phasis itself is the
					most stagnant and most sluggish of all rivers. The
					fruits that grow in this country are all stunted,
					flabby and imperfect, owing to the excess of water,
					and for this reason they do not ripen. Much fog
					from the waters envelops the land. For these causes,
					therefore, the physique of the Phasians is different
					from that of other folk. They are tall in stature,
					and of a gross habit of body, while neither joint nor
					vein is visible. Their complexion is yellowish, as
					though they suffered from jaundice. Of all men
					they have the deepest voice, because the air they
					breathe is not clear, but moist and turbid. They are
					by nature disinclined for physical fatigue. There
					are but slight changes of the seasons, either in
					respect of heat or of cold. The winds are mostly
					moist, except one breeze peculiar to the country,
					called <hi rend="ital">cenchron</hi>, which sometimes blows strong, violent</p>
					<pb id="p.115"/>
					<p>and hot. The north wind rarely blows, and when
						it does it is weak and gentle.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="16"><head>PART 16</head><p>XVI. So much for the difference, in nature and
					in shape, between the inhabitants of Asia and the
					inhabitants of Europe. With regard to the lack of
					spirit and of courage among the inhabitants, the
					chief reason why Asiatics are less warlike and more
					gentle in character than Europeans is the uniformity
					of the seasons, which show no violent changes either
					towards heat or towards cold, but are equable. For
					there occur no mental shocks nor violent physical
					change, which are more likely to steel the temper
					and impart to it a fierce passion than is a monotonous
					sameness. For it is changes of all things that rouse
					the temper of man and prevent its stagnation. For
					these reasons, I think, Asiatics are feeble. Their
					institutions are a contributory cause, the greater
					part of Asia being governed by kings. Now where
					men are not their own masters and independent,
					but are ruled by despots, they are not keen on
					military efficiency but on not appearing warlike.
					For the risks they run are not similar. Subjects
					are likely to be forced to undergo military service,
					fatigue and death, in order to benefit their masters,
					and to be parted from their wives, their children
					and their friends. All their worthy, brave deeds
					merely serve to aggrandize and raise up their lords,
					while the harvest they themselves reap is danger
					and death. Moreover, the land of men like these</p>
					<pb id="p.117"/>
					<p>must be desert, owing to their enemies and to their
						laziness,<note>Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">H(MEROU=S1QAI TH\N O)RGH\N U(PO/ TE A)POLEMI/WN K.T.L.</foreign>,
							"the temper of men like these must be gentle, because they
							are unwarlike and inactive."</note> so that even if a naturally brave and
						spirited man is born his temper is changed by their
						institutions. Whereof I can give a clear proof.
						All the inhabitants of Asia, whether Greek or
						non-Greek, who are not ruled by despots, but are
						independent, toiling for their own advantage, are
						the most warlike of all men. For it is for their
						own sakes that they run their risks, and in their
						own persons do they receive the prizes of their
						valour as likewise the penalty of their cowardice.
						You will find that Asiatics also differ from one
						another, some being superior, others inferior. The
						reason for this, as I have said above, is the changes
						of the seasons.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="17"><head>PART 17</head><p>XVII. Such is the condition of the inhabitants
					of Asia. And in Europe is a Scythian race, dwelling
					round Lake Maeotis, which differs from the other
					races. Their name is Sauromatae. Their women,
					so long as they are virgins, ride, shoot, throw the
					javelin while mounted, and fight with their enemies.
					They do not lay aside their virginity until they have
					killed three of their enemies, and they do not marry
					before they have performed the traditional sacred
					rites. A woman who takes to herself a husband no
					longer rides, unless she is compelled to do so by
					a general expedition. They have no right breast ;
					for while they are yet babies their mothers make</p>
					<pb id="p.119"/>
					<p>red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this
						very purpose and apply it to the right breast and
						cauterise it, so that its growth is arrested, and all
						its strength and bulk are diverted to the right
						shoulder and right arm.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="18"><head>PART 18</head><p>XVIII. As to the physique of the other Scythians,
					in that they are like one another and not at all like
					others, the same remark applies to them as to the
					Egyptians, only the latter are distressed by the heat,
					the former by the cold.<note>Both people are of peculiar physique, and the cause of
						the peculiarity is in the one case extreme heat, and in the
						other extreme cold.</note> What is called the Scythian
					desert is level grassland, without trees,<note>Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">U(YHLH/</foreign>, "a plateau."</note> and fairly
					well-watered. For there are large rivers which drain
					the water from the plains. There too live the
					Scythians who are called Nomads because they have
					no houses but live in wagons. The smallest have
					four wheels, others six wheels. They are covered
					over with felt and are constructed, like houses,
					sometimes in two compartments and sometimes in
					three, which are proof against rain, snow and wind.
					The wagons are drawn by two or by three yoke of
					hornless oxen. They have no horns because of the
					cold. Now in these wagons live the women, while
					the men ride alone on horseback, followed by the
					sheep they have, their cattle and their horses. They
					remain in the same place just as long as there is
					sufficient fodder for their animals ; when it gives
					out they migrate. They themselves eat boiled</p>
					<pb id="p.121"/>
					<p>meats and drink mares' milk. They have a sweetmeat
						called <hi rend="ital">hippace</hi>, which is a cheese from the milk
						of mares (<hi rend="ital">hippoi</hi>).</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="19"><head>PART 19</head><p>XIX. So much for their mode of living and their
					customs. As to their seasons and their physique,
					the Scythians are very different from all other men,
					and, like the Egyptians, are homogeneous ; they are
					the reverse of prolific, and Scythia breeds the smallest
					and the fewest wild animals. For it lies right close
					to the north and the Rhipaean mountains, from
					which blows the north wind. The sun comes
					nearest to them only at the end of its course,
					when it reaches the summer solstice, and then it
					warms them but slightly and for a short time. The
					winds blowing from hot regions do not reach them,
					save rarely, and with little force ; but from the
					north there are constantly blowing winds that are
					chilled by snow, ice, and many waters,<note>Or, "heavy rains."</note> which, never
					leaving the mountains, render them uninhabitable.
					A thick fog envelops by day the plains upon which
					they live, so that winter is perennial, while summer,
					which is but feeble, lasts only a few days. For the
					plains are high and bare, and are not encircled
					with mountains, though they slope from the north.
					The wild animals too that are found there are not large,
					but such as can find shelter under ground. They
					are stunted owing to the severe climate and the
					bareness of the land, where there is neither warmth<note>Strangely enough, both Littr&eacute; and Adams translate as
						though they took <foreign lang="greek">A)LE/H</foreign> to be the Epic word meaning "means
						of escape."</note>
					nor shelter. And the changes of the seasons are</p>
					<pb id="p.123"/>
					<p>neither great nor violent, the seasons being uniform
						and altering but little. Wherefore the men also are
						like one another in physique, since summer and
						winter they always use similar food and the same
						clothing, breathing a moist, thick atmosphere, drinking
						water from ice and snow, and abstaining from
						fatigue. For neither bodily nor mental endurance
						is possible where the changes are not violent. For
						these causes their physiques are gross, fleshy, showing
						no joints, moist and flabby, and the lower bowels
						are as moist as bowels can be. For the belly cannot
						possibly dry up in a land like this, with such a nature
						and such a climate, but because of their fat and the
						smoothness of their flesh their physiques are similar,
						men's to men's and women's to women's. For as
						the seasons are alike there takes place no corruption
						or deterioration in the coagulation of the seed,<note>As a modern physiologist might put it, "abnormal
							variations in the formation of the embryo."</note>
						except through the blow of some violent cause or of
						some disease.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="20"><head>PART 20</head><p>XX. I will give clear testimony to their moistness.
					The majority of the Scythians, all that are Nomads,
					you will find have their shoulders cauterized, as well
					as their arms, wrists, breast, hips and loins, simply
					because of the moistness and softness of their constitution.
					For owing to their moistness and flabbiness
					they have not the strength either to draw a bow or
					to throw a javelin from the shoulder. But when
					they have been cauterized the excess of moisture</p>
					<pb id="p.125"/>
					<p>dries up from their joints, and their bodies become
						more braced, more nourished and better articulated.
						Their bodies grow relaxed and squat, firstly because,
						unlike the Egyptians, they do not use swaddling
						clothes, of which they have not the habit,<note>This is a literal translation of the text, but see the footnote
							on the opposite page.</note> for the
						sake of their riding, that they may sit a horse well ;
						secondly, through their sedentary lives. For the
						boys, until they can ride, sit the greater part of the
						time in the wagon, and because of the migrations
						and wanderings rarely walk on foot ; while the girls
						are wonderfully flabby and torpid in physique. The
						Scythians are a ruddy race because of the cold, not
						through any fierceness in the sun's heat. It is the
						cold that burns their white skin and turns it ruddy.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="21"><head>PART 21</head><p>XXI. A constitution of this kind prevents fertility.
					The men have no great desire for intercourse because
					of the moistness of their constitution and the softness
					and chill of their abdomen, which are the greatest
					checks on venery. Moreover, the constant jolting
					on their horses unfits them for intercourse. Such
					are the causes of barrenness in the men ; in the
					women they are the fatness and moistness of their
					flesh, which are such that the womb cannot absorb
					the seed. For neither is their monthly purging as
					it should be, but scanty and late, while the mouth
					of the womb is closed by fat and does not admit the
					seed. They are personally fat and lazy, and their</p>
					<pb id="p.127"/>
					<p>abdomen is cold and soft. These are the causes
						which make the Scythian race unfertile. A clear
						proof is afforded by their slave-girls. These, because
						of their activity and leanness of body, no sooner go
						to a man than they are with child.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="22"><head>PART 22</head><p>XXII. Moreover, the great majority among the
					Scythians become impotent, do women's work, live
					like women and converse accordingly. Such men
					they call Anaries. Now the natives put the blame
					on to Heaven, and respect and worship these creatures,
					each fearing for himself. I too think that these
					diseases are divine, and so are all others, no one
					being more divine or more human than any other ;
					all are alike, and all divine. Each of them has a
					nature of its own, and none arises without its natural
					cause. How, in my opinion, this disease arises I will
					explain. The habit of riding causes swellings at the
					joints,<note>For this difficult word see Littr&eacute; V. 320 and VIII. xxxix
						foll.</note> because they are always astride their horses ;
					in severe cases follow lameness and sores on the
					hips. They cure themselves in the following way.
					At the beginning of the disease they cut the vein
					behind each ear. When the blood has ceased to
					flow faintness comes over them and they sleep.
					Afterwards they get up, some cured and some not.
					Now, in my opinion, by this treatment the seed is
					destroyed. For by the side of the ear are veins, to</p>
					<pb id="p.129"/>
					<p>cut which causes impotence, and I believe that these
						are the veins which they cut. After this treatment,
						when the Scythians approach a woman but cannot
						have intercourse, at first they take no notice and
						think no more about it. But when two, three or
						even more attempts are attended with no better
						success, thinking that they have sinned against
						Heaven they attribute thereto the cause, and put
						on women's clothes, holding that they have lost their
						manhood. So they play the woman, and with the
						women do the same work as women do.</p>
					<p>This affliction affects the rich Scythians because of
						their riding, not the lower classes but the upper,
						who possess the most strength ; the poor, who do
						not ride, suffer less. But, if we suppose this disease
						to be more divine than any other, it ought to have
						attacked, not the highest and richest classes only of
						the Scythians, but all classes equally--or rather the
						poor especially, if indeed the gods are pleased to
						receive from men respect and worship, and repay
						these with favours. For naturally the rich, having
						great wealth, make many sacrifices to the gods, and
						offer many votive offerings, and honour them, all of
						which things the poor, owing to their poverty, are
						less able to do ; besides, they blame the gods for not
						giving them wealth, so that the penalties for such sins
						are likely to be paid by the poor rather than by the
						rich. But the truth is, as I said above, these affections
						are neither more nor less divine than any others,
						and all and each are natural. Such a disease arises</p>
					<pb id="p.131"/>
					<p>among the Scythians for such a reason as I have
						stated, and other men too are equally liable to it, for
						wherever men ride very much and very frequently,
						there the majority are attacked by swellings at the
						joints, sciatica and gout, and are sexually very weak.
						These complaints come upon the Scythians, and they
						are the most impotent of men, for the reasons I have
						given, and also because they always wear trousers
						and spend most of their time on their horses, so that
						they do not handle the parts, but owing to cold and
						fatigue forget about sexual passion, losing their
						virility before any impulse is felt.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="23"><head>PART 23</head><p>XXIII. Such is the condition of the Scythians.
					The other people of Europe differ from one another
					both in stature and in shape, because of the changes
					of the seasons, which are violent and frequent,
					while there are severe heat waves, severe winters,
					copious rains and then long droughts, and winds,
					causing many changes of various kinds. Wherefore
					it is natural to realize that generation too varies
					in the coagulation of the seed,<note><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> "in the formation of the foetus."</note> and is not the same
					for the same seed in summer as in winter nor in
					rain as in drought. It is for this reason, I think, that
					the physique of Europeans varies more than that of
					Asiatics, and that their stature differs very widely in
					each city. For there arise more corruptions in the
					coagulation of the seed when the changes of the seasons</p>
					<pb id="p.133"/>
					<p>are frequent than when they are similar or alike.
						The same reasoning applies also to character. In
						such a climate arise wildness, unsociability and spirit.
						For the frequent shocks to the mind impart wildness,
						destroying tameness and gentleness. For this
						reason, I think, Europeans are also more courageous
						than Asiatics. For uniformity engenders slackness,
						while variation fosters endurance in both body and
						soul ; rest and slackness are food for cowardice,
						endurance and exertion for bravery. Wherefore
						Europeans are more warlike, and also because of
						their institutions, not being under kings as are
						Asiatics. For, as I said above, where there are
						kings, there must be the greatest cowards. For
						men's souls are enslaved, and refuse to run risks
						readily and recklessly to increase the power of
						somebody else. But independent people, taking
						risks on their own behalf and not on behalf of
						others, are willing and eager to go into danger, for
						they themselves enjoy the prize of victory. So
						institutions contribute a great deal to the formation
						of courageousness.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="24"><head>PART 24</head><p>XXIV. Such, in outline and in general, is the
					character of Europe and of Asia. In Europe too
					there are tribes differing one from another in stature,
					in shape and in courage. The differences are due to
					the same causes as I mentioned above, which I will
					now describe more clearly. Inhabitants of a region
					which is mountainous, rugged, high, and watered,</p>
					<pb id="p.135"/>
					<p>where the changes of the seasons exhibit sharp
						contrasts, are likely to be of big physique, with a
						nature well adapted for endurance and courage, and
						such possess not a little wildness and ferocity. The
						inhabitants of hollow regions, that are meadowy,
						stifling, with more hot than cool winds, and where
						the water used is hot, will be neither tall nor well-made,
						but inclined to be broad, fleshy, and dark-haired ;
						they themselves are dark rather than fair, less
						subject to phlegm than to bile. Similar bravery and
						endurance are not by nature part of their character,
						but the imposition of law can produce them artificially.
						Should there be rivers in the land, which drain off
						from the ground the stagnant water and the rain
						water, these<note>The people or the rivers ? Probably the former, in which
							case "bright" will mean "of bright (clear) complexion."</note> will be healthy and bright. But if there
						be no rivers, and the water that the people drink be
						marshy, stagnant, and fenny, the physique of the
						people must show protruding bellies and enlarged
						spleens. Such as dwell in a high land that is level,
						windy, and watered, will be tall in physique and
						similar to one another, but rather unmanly and
						tame in character. As to those that dwell on thin,
						dry, and bare soil, and where the changes of the
						seasons exhibit sharp contrasts, it is likely that in
						such country the people will be hard in physique
						and well-braced, fair rather than dark, stubborn and
						independent in character and in temper. For where
						the changes of the seasons are most frequent and most
						sharply contrasted, there you will find the greatest
						diversity in physique, in character, and in constitution.</p>
					<pb id="p.137"/>
					<p>These are the most important factors that create
						differences in men's constitutions ; next come the land
						in which a man is reared, and the water. For in
						general you will find assimilated to the nature of the
						land both the physique and the characteristics of the
						inhabitants. For where the land is rich, soft, and
						well-watered, and the water is very near the surface,
						so as to be hot in summer and cold in winter, and if
						the situation be favourable as regards the seasons,
						there the inhabitants are fleshy, ill-articulated,
						moist, lazy, and generally cowardly in character.
						Slackness and sleepiness can be observed in them,
						and as far as the arts are concerned they are thick-witted,
						and neither subtle nor sharp. But where
						the land is bare, waterless, rough, oppressed by
						winter's storms and burnt by the sun, there you will
						see men who are hard, lean, well-articulated, well-braced,
						and hairy ; such natures will be found
						energetic, vigilant, stubborn and independent in
						character and in temper, wild rather than tame, of
						more than average sharpness and intelligence in
						the arts, and in war of more than average courage.
						The things also that grow in the earth all assimilate
						themselves to the earth. Such are the most sharply
						contrasted natures and physiques. Take these observations
						as a standard when drawing all other
						conclusions, and you will make no mistake.</p></div2></div1>

								there were many rains, gently continuous, with

							<p>The whole weather proved southerly, with droughts,
								but early in the spring, as the previous constitution
								had proved the opposite and northerly, a few patients
								suffered from ardent fevers, and these very mild,
								causing hemorrhage in few cases and no deaths.
								Many had swellings beside one ear, or both ears, in

								causing harm ; in no case was there suppuration
								such as attends swellings of other origin. This was
								the character of them :--flabby, big, spreading, with
								neither inflammation nor pain ; in every case they</p>
							<pb id="p.149"/>
							<p>disappeared without a sign.<note>That is, with no symptoms indicative
								of a crisis.</note> The sufferers were
								youths, young men, and men in their prime, usually
								those who frequented the wrestling school and
								gymnasia. Few women were attacked. Many had
								dry coughs which brought up nothing when they
								coughed, but their voices were hoarse. Soon after,
								though in some cases after some time, painful
								inflammations occurred either in one testicle or in
								both, sometimes accompanied with fever, in other

						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="2"><head>PART 2</head>
							<p>II. Beginning early in the summer, throughout
								the summer and in winter many of those who had
								been ailing a long time took to their beds in a state
								of consumption, while many also who had hitherto
								been doubtful sufferers at this time showed undoubted
								symptoms. Some showed the symptoms now for
								the first time ; these were those whose constitution
								inclined to be consumptive. Many, in fact most of
								these, died ; of those who took to their beds I do not
								know one who survived even for a short time. Death
								came more promptly than is usual in consumption,
								and yet the other complaints, which will be described
								presently, though longer and attended with fever,
								were easily supported and did not prove fatal. For
								consumption was the worst of the diseases that
								occurred, and alone was responsible for the great
								mortality.</p>
							<p>In the majority of cases the symptoms were these.
								Fever with shivering, continuous, acute, not completely
								intermitting, but of the semitertian type ;
								remitting during one day they were exacerbated on
								the next, becoming on the whole more acute. Sweats</p>
							<pb id="p.151"/>
							<p>were continual, but not all over the body. Severe
								chill in the extremities, which with difficulty
								recovered their warmth. Bowels disordered, with
								bilious, scanty, unmixed, thin, smarting stools,
								causing the patient to get up often. Urine either
								thin, colourless,<note>Throughout <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi> <foreign lang="greek">A\)XRWS2</foreign> may
									mean, not merely
									"without colour," but "of bad colour." It certainly has this
									meaning in <hi rend="ital">Airs Waters Places</hi>, VII, l. ii. See p. 85.</note> unconcocted
								and scanty, or thick
								and with a slight deposit, not settling favourably,
								but with a crude and unfavourable deposit. The
								patients frequently coughed up small, concocted
								sputa, brought up little by little with difficulty.
								Those exhibiting the symptoms in their most
								violent form showed no concoction at all, but
								continued spitting crude sputa. In the majority
								of these cases the throat was throughout painful
								from the beginning, being red and inflamed. Fluxes
								slight, thin, pungent. Patients quickly wasted away
								and grew worse, being throughout averse to all food
								and experiencing no thirst. Delirium in many cases
								as death approached. Such were the symptoms of
								the consumption.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="3"><head>PART 3</head>
							<p>III. But when summer came, and during autumn
								occurred many continuous but not violent fevers, which
								attacked persons who were long ailing without
								suffering distress in any other particular manner ; for
								the bowels were in most cases quite easy, and hurt
								to no appreciable extent. Urine in most cases of
								good colour and clear, but thin, and after a time near
								the crisis it grew concocted. Coughing was slight,
								and caused no distress. No lack of appetite ; in fact
								it was quite possible even to give food. In general
								the patients did not sicken, as did the consumptives,</p>
							<pb id="p.153"/>
							<p>with shivering fevers, but with slight sweats, the
								paroxysms being variable and irregular.<note>The words omitted by
									K&eacute;hlewein mean "not intermitting
									altogether, but with exacerbations after the manner
									of tertians."</note> The earliest
								crisis was about the twentieth day ; in most cases
								the crisis was about the fortieth day, though in
								many it was about the eightieth. In some cases
								the illness did not end in this way, but in an
								irregular manner without a crisis. In the majority
								of these cases the fevers relapsed after a brief
								interval, and after the relapse a crisis occurred at
								the end of the same periods as before. The disease
								in many of these instances was so protracted that
								it even lasted during the winter.</p>
							<p>Out of all those described in this constitution
								only the consumptives showed a high mortality-rate ;
								for all the other patients bore up well, and the
								other fevers did not prove fatal.</p>

							<p>IV. In Thasos early in autumn occurred unseasonable
								wintry storms, suddenly with many north
								and south winds bursting out into rains. These conditions
								continued until the setting of the Pleiades and
								during their season. Winter was northerly ; many
								violent and abundant rains ; snows ; generally there
								were fine intervals. With all this, however, the cold
								weather was not exceptionally unseasonable. But
								immediately after the winter solstice, when the west
								wind usually begins to blow, there was a return of
								severe wintry weather, much north wind, snow and</p>
							<pb id="p.155"/>
							<p>copious rains continuously, sky stormy and clouded.
								These conditions lasted on, and did not remit before
								the equinox. Spring cold, northerly, wet, cloudy.
								Summer did not turn out excessively hot, the Etesian
								winds blowing continuously. But soon after, near
								the rising of Arcturus, there was much rain again,
								with northerly winds.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="5"><head>PART 5</head><p>V. The whole year having been wet, cold and
							northerly, in the winter the public health in most
							respects was good, but in early spring many, in fact
							most, suffered illnesses. Now there began at first
							inflammations of the eyes, marked by rheum,
							pain, and unconcocted discharges. Small gummy
							sores, in many cases causing distress when they
							broke out ; the great majority relapsed, and ceased
							late on the approach of autumn. In summer and
							autumn dysenteric diseases, tenesmus and lientery ;
							bilious diarrh&oelig;a, with copious, thin, crude, smarting
							stools ; in some cases it was also watery.
							In many cases there were also painful, bilious defluxions,
							watery, full of thin particles, purulent
							and causing strangury. No kidney trouble, but
							their various symptoms succeeded in various orders.
							Vomitings of phlegm, bile, and undigested food.
							Sweats ; in all cases much moisture over all the
							body. These complaints in many cases were unattended
							with fever, and the sufferers were not confined
							to bed ; but in many others there was fever,
							as I am going to describe. Those who showed all
							the symptoms mentioned above were consumptives
							who suffered pain. When autumn came, and during
							winter, continuous fevers--in some few cases ardent--day
							fevers, night fevers, semitertians, exact
							tertians, quartans, irregular fevers. Each of the
							fevers mentioned found many victims.</p>
							<pb id="p.157"/>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="6"><head>PART 6</head><p>VI. Now the ardent fevers attacked the fewest
							persons, and these were less distressed than any
							of the other sick. There was no bleeding from the
							nose, except very slight discharges in a few cases,
							and no delirium. All the other symptoms were
							slight. The crises of these diseases were quite
							regular, generally in seventeen days, counting the
							days of intermission, and I know of no ardent fever
							proving fatal at this time, nor of any phrenitis.
							The tertians were more numerous than the ardent
							fevers and more painful. But all these had four
							regular periods from the first onset, had complete
							crises in seven, and in no case relapsed. But the
							quartans, while in many instances they began at first
							with quartan periodicity, yet in not a few they became
							quartan by an abscession from other fevers or illnesses.<note>There are
								often mixed infections in malaria. If the
								quartan be one of these, being the longest it outlasts the
								others. So the disease appears to have turned into a
								quartan.</note>
							They were protracted, as quartans usually
							are, or even more protracted than usual. Many
							fell victims to quotidians, night fevers, or irregular
							fevers, and were ill for a long time, either in bed
							or walking about. In most of these cases the fevers
							continued during the season of the Pleiades or even
							until winter. In many patients, especially children,
							there were convulsions and slight feverishness from
							the beginning ; sometimes, too, convulsions supervened
							upon fevers. Mostly these illnesses were
							protracted, but not dangerous, except for those who
							from all other causes were predisposed to die.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="7"><head>PART 7</head><p>VII. But those fevers which were altogether continuous
							and never intermitted at all, but in all cases</p>
							<pb id="p.159"/>
							<p>grew worse after the manner of semitertians, with
								remission during one day followed by exacerbation
								during the next, were the most severe of all the
								fevers which occurred at this time, the longest
								and the most painful. Beginning mildly, and on
								the whole increasing always, with exacerbation,
								and growing worse, they had slight remissions
								followed quickly after an abatement by more violent
								exacerbations, generally becoming worse on the
								critical days. All patients had irregular rigors that
								followed no fixed law, most rarely and least in
								the semitertians,<note>I take the pronoun <foreign lang="greek">AU)=TOS2</foreign> throughout this
									chapter to
									refer to the remittent semitertian, or to sufferers from it.</note> but more
								violent in the other
								fevers. Copious sweats, least copious in the semitertians ;
								they brought no relief, but on the contrary
								caused harm. These patients suffered great
								chill in the extremities, which grew warm again
								with difficulty. Generally there was sleeplessness,
								especially with the semitertians, followed afterwards
								by coma. In all the bowels were disordered
								and in a bad state, but in the semitertians they were
								far the worst. In most of them urine either (<hi rend="ital">a</hi>)
								thin, crude, colourless, after a time becoming slightly
								concocted with signs of crisis, or (<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) thick enough
								but turbid, in no way settling or forming sediment,
								or (<hi rend="ital">c</hi>) with small, bad, crude sediments, these being
								the worst of all. Coughs attended the fevers, but
								I cannot say that either harm or good resulted from
								the coughing on this occasion.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="8"><head>PART 8</head><p>VIII. Now the greatest number of these symptoms
							continued to be protracted, troublesome, very disordered,
							very irregular, and without any critical signs,
							both in the case of those who came very near death</p>
							<pb id="p.161"/>
							<p>and in the case of those who did not. For even if
								some patients enjoyed slight intermissions, there
								followed a quick relapse. A few of them experienced
								a crisis, the earliest being about the eightieth day,
								some of the latter having a relapse, so that most of
								them were still ill in the winter. The greatest
								number had no crisis before the disease terminated.
								These symptoms occurred in those who recovered
								just as much as in those who did not. The illnesses
								showed a marked absence of crisis and a great variety ;
								the most striking and the worst symptom, which
								throughout attended the great majority, was a complete
								loss of appetite, especially in those whose
								general condition exhibited fatal signs, but in these
								fevers they did not suffer much from unseasonable
								thirst. After long intervals, with many pains and
								with pernicious wasting, there supervened abscessions
								either too severe to be endured, or too slight to be
								beneficial, so that there was a speedy return of the
								original symptoms, and an aggravation of the
								mischief.<note>That is, the abscessions did not carry off the morbid
									humours, which spread again throughout the system.</note></p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="9"><head>PART 9</head><p>IX. The symptoms from which these patients
							suffered were dysenteries and tenesmus, lienteries
							also and fluxes. Some had dropsies also, either with
							or without these. Whenever any of these attacked
							violently they were quickly fatal, or, if mild, they did
							no good. Slight eruptions, which did not match the
							extent of the diseases and quickly disappeared again,
							or swellings by the ears that grew smaller<note><foreign lang="greek">MWLUO/MENA</foreign> would
								mean "remained crude."</note> and</p>
							<pb id="p.163"/>
							<p>signified nothing, in some cases appearing at the
								joints, especially the hip-joint, in few instances
								leaving with signs of crisis, when they quickly
								re-established themselves in their original state.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="10"><head>PART 10</head><p>X. From all the diseases some died, but the greatest
							number from these fevers,<note>It is not clear to what <foreign lang="greek">PA/NTWN</foreign> and
								<foreign lang="greek">TOU/TWN</foreign> refer. Probably
								<foreign lang="greek">PA/NTWN</foreign> refers to all the semitertians, and <foreign lang="greek">TOU/TWN</foreign> to the
								special type of them described in Chapter IX.</note> especially children--those
							just weaned, older children of eight or ten years,
							and those approaching puberty. These victims
							never suffered from the latter symptoms without
							the first I have described above, but often the first
							without the latter. The only good sign, the most
							striking that occurred, which saved very many of
							those who were in the greatest danger, was when
							there was a change to strangury, into which abscessions
							took place. The strangury, too, came mostly
							to patients of the ages mentioned, though it did
							happen to many of the others, either without their
							taking to bed or when they were ill. Rapid and
							great was the complete change that occurred in
							their case. For the bowels, even if they were
							perniciously loose, quickly recovered ; their appetite
							for everything returned, and hereafter the fever
							abated. But the strangury, even in these cases, was
							long and painful. Their urine was copious, thick,
							varied, red, mixed with pus, and passed with pain.
							But they all survived, and I know of none of these
							that died.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="11"><head>PART 11</head><p>XI. In all dangerous cases you should be on the
							watch for all favourable coctions of the evacuations
							from all parts, or for fair and critical abscessions.
							Coctions signify nearness of crisis and sure recovery</p>
							<pb id="p.165"/>
							<p>of health, but crude and unconcocted evacuations,
								which change into bad abscessions, denote absence
								of crisis, pain, prolonged illness, death, or a return
								of the same symptoms. But it is by a consideration
								of other signs that one must decide which of these
								results will be most likely. Declare the past,
								diagnose the present, foretell the future ; practise
								these acts. As to diseases, make a habit of two
								things--to help, or at least to do no harm. The
								art has three factors, the disease, the patient, the
								physician. The physician is the servant of the art.
								The patient must co-operate with the physician in
								combating the disease.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="12"><head>PART 12</head><p>XII. Pains about the head and neck, and heaviness
							combined with pain, occur both without and with
							fever. Sufferers from phrenitis have convulsions, and
							eject verdigris-coloured vomit ; some die very quickly.
							But in ardent and the other fevers, those with pain in
							the neck, heaviness of the temples, dimness of sight,
							and painless tension of the hypochondrium, bleed
							from the nose ; those with a general heaviness of the
							head, cardialgia, and nausea, vomit afterwards bile and
							phlegm. Children for the most part in such cases
							suffer chiefly from the convulsions. Women have
							both these symptoms and pains in the womb. Older
							people, and those whose natural heat is failing, have
							paralysis or raving or blindness.</p>

						<div4 type="section" n="13"><head>PART 13</head><p>XIII. In Thasos a little before and at the season
							of Arcturus many violent rains with northerly winds.
							About the equinox until the setting of the Pleiades</p>
							<pb id="p.167"/>
							<p>slight, southerly rains. Winter northerly, droughts,
								cold periods, violent winds, snow. About the
								equinox very severe storms. Spring northerly,
								droughts, slight rains, periods of cold. About the
								summer solstice slight showers, periods of great cold
								until near the Dog Star. After the Dog Star, until
								Arcturus, hot summer. Great heat, not intermittent
								but continuous and severe. No rain fell. The
								Etesian winds blew. About Arcturus southerly
								rains until the equinox.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="14"><head>PART 14</head><p>XIV. In this constitution during winter began
							paralyses which attacked many, a few of whom
							quickly died. In fact, the disease was generally
							epidemic. In other respects the public health
							continued good. Early in spring began ardent
							fevers which continued until the equinox and on to
							summer. Now those who began to be ill at once, in
							spring or the beginning of summer, in most cases
							got well, though a few died ; but when autumn and
							the rains came the cases were dangerous, and
							more died.</p>
							<p>As to the peculiarities of the ardent fevers, the
								most likely patients to survive were those who had a
								proper and copious bleeding from the nose, in fact I
								do not know of a single case in this constitution that
								proved fatal when a proper bleeding occurred, For
								Philiscus and Epaminon and Silenus, who died, had
								only a slight epistaxis on the fourth and fifth days.
								Now the majority of the patients had rigors near the</p>
							<pb id="p.169"/>
							<p>crisis, especially such as had no epistaxis, but these
								had sweats also as well as rigors.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="15"><head>PART 15</head><p>XV. Some had jaundice on the sixth day, but
							these were benefited by either a purging through
							the bladder or a disturbance of the bowels or a
							copious hemorrhage, as was the case with Heraclides,
							who lay sick at the house of Aristocydes.
							This patient, however, who had a crisis on the
							twentieth day, not only bled from the nose, but also
							experienced disturbance of the bowels and a purging
							through the bladder. Far otherwise was it with the
							servant of Phanagoras, who had none of these
							symptoms, and died. But the great majority had
							hemorrhage, especially youths and those in the
							prime of life, and of these the great majority who
							had no hemorrhage died. Older people had jaundice
							or disordered bowels, for example Bion, who lay
							sick at the house of Silenus. Dysenteries also were
							general in summer, and some too of those who had
							fallen ill, and also suffered from hemorrhage, finally
							had dysentery ; for example, the slave of Erato and
							Myllus, after copious hemorrhage, lapsed into dysentery.
							They recovered.</p>
							<p>This humour,<note>That is, blood.</note> then, especially was in great
								abundance,
								since even those who had no hemorrhage
								near the crisis, but swellings by the ears which
								disappeared--and after their disappearance there
								was a heaviness along the left flank up to the extremity
								of the hip--after the crisis had pain and
								passed thin urine, and then began to suffer slight
								hemorrhage about the twenty-fourth day, and</p>
							<pb id="p.171"/>
							<p>abscessions into hemorrhage occurred. In the case
								of Antipho, son of Critobulus, the illness ceased and
								came to a complete crisis about the fortieth day.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="16"><head>PART 16</head><p>XVI. Though many women fell ill, they were
							fewer than the men and less frequently died. But
							the great majority had difficult childbirth, and after
							giving birth they would fall ill, and these especially
							died, as did the daughter of Telebulus on the sixth
							day after delivery. Now menstruation appeared
							during the fevers in most cases, and with many
							maidens it occurred then for the first time. Some
							bled from the nose. Sometimes both epistaxis and
							menstruation appeared together ; for example, the
							maiden daughter of Daitharses had her first menstruation
							during fever and also a violent discharge
							from the nose. I know of no woman who died if
							any of these symptoms showed themselves properly,
							but all to my knowledge had abortions if they
							chanced to fall ill when with child.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="17"><head>PART 17</head><p>XVII. Urine in most cases was of good colour, but
							thin and with slight sediments, and the bowels of most
							were disordered with thin, bilious excretions. Many
							after a crisis of the other symptoms ended with dysentery,
							as did Xenophanes and Critias. I will mention
							cases in which was passed copious, watery, clear and
							thin urine, even after a crisis in other respects favourable,
							and a favourable sediment : Bion, who lay sick
							at the house of Silenus, Cratis, who lodged with
							Xenophanes, the slave of Areto, and the wife of Mnesistratus.
							Afterwards all these suffered from dysentery.</p>
							<p>About the season of Arcturus many had crisis on</p>
							<pb id="p.173"/>
							<p>the eleventh day, and these did not suffer even the
								normal relapses. There were also comatose fevers
								about this time, usually in children, and of all
								patients these showed the lowest mortality.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="18"><head>PART 18</head><p>XVIII. About the equinox up to the setting of
							the Pleiades, and during winter, although the ardent
							fevers continued, yet cases of phrenitis were most
							frequent at this time, and most of them were fatal.
							In summer, too, a few cases had occurred. Now the
							sufferers from ardent fever, when fatal symptoms
							attended, showed signs at the beginning. For right
							from the beginning there was acute fever with slight
							rigors, sleeplessness, thirst, nausea, slight sweats
							about the forehead and collar-bones, but in no case
							general, much delirium, fears, depression, very cold
							extremities, toes and hands, especially the latter.
							The exacerbations on the even days ; but in most
							cases the pains were greatest on the fourth day, with
							sweat for the most part chilly, while the extremities
							could not now be warmed again, remaining livid and
							cold ; and in these cases the thirst ceased. Their
							urine was scanty, black, thin, with constipation of the
							bowels. Nor was there hemorrhage from the nose in
							any case when these symptoms occurred, but only
							slight epistaxis. None of these cases suffered relapse,
							but they died on the sixth day, with sweating.
							The cases of phrenitis had all the above symptoms,
							but the crises generally occurred on the eleventh
							day. Some had their crises on the twentieth day,
							namely those in whom the phrenitis did not begin
							at first, or began about the third or fourth day, but</p>
							<pb id="p.175"/>
							<p>though these fared tolerably at the beginning, yet
								the disease assumed an acute form about the seventh
								day.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="19"><head>PART 19</head><p>XIX. Now the number of illnesses was great. And
							of the patients there died chiefly striplings, young
							people, people in their prime, the smooth, the fair-skinned,
							the straight-haired, the black-haired, the
							black-eyed, those who had lived recklessly and care-lessly,
							the thin-voiced, the rough-voiced, the lispers,
							the passionate. Women too died in very great
							numbers who were of this kind. In this constitution
							there were four symptoms especially which denoted
							recovery :--a proper hemorrhage through the nostrils ;
							copious discharges by the bladder of urine with
							much sediment of a proper character ; disordered
							bowels with bilious evacuations at the right time ;
							the appearance of dysenteric characteristics. The
							crisis in many cases did not come with one only
							of the symptoms described above, but in most cases
							all symptoms were experienced, and the patients
							appeared to be more distressed ; but all with these
							symptoms got well. Women and maidens experienced
							all the above symptoms, but besides, whenever
							any took place properly, and whenever copious menstruation
							supervened, there was a crisis therefrom
							which resulted in recovery ; in fact I know of no
							woman who died when any of these symptoms took
							place properly. For the daughter of Philo, who
							died, though she had violent epistaxis, dined rather
							unseasonably on the seventh day.</p>
							<p>In acute fevers, more especially in ardent fevers,
								when involuntary weeping occurs, epistaxis is to be</p>
							<pb id="p.177"/>
							<p>expected it the patient have no fatal symptoms
								besides ; for when he is in a bad way such weeping
								portends not hemorrhage but death.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="20"><head>PART 20</head><p>XX. The painful swellings by the ears in fevers
							in some cases neither subsided nor suppurated when
							the fever ceased with a crisis. They were cured by
							bilious diarrh&oelig;a, or dysentery, or a sediment of
							thick urine such as closed the illness of Hermippus
							of Clazomen&aelig;. The circumstances of the crises,
							from which too I formed my judgments, were either
							similar or dissimilar ; for example, the two brothers,
							who fell sick together at the same time, and lay ill
							near the bungalow of Epigenes. The elder of these
							had a crisis on the sixth day, the younger on the
							seventh. Both suffered a relapse together at the
							same time with an intermission of five days. After
							the relapse both had a complete crisis together on
							the seventeenth day. But the great majority had
							a crisis on the sixth day, with an intermission of
							six days followed by a crisis on the fifth day after the
							relapse. Those who had a crisis on the seventh day
							had an intermission of seven days, with a crisis on
							the third day after the relapse. Others with a crisis
							on the seventh had an intermission of three days,
							with a crisis on the seventh day after the relapse.
							Some who had a crisis on the sixth day had an
							intermission of six and a relapse of three, an intermission
							of one and a relapse of one, followed by a
							crisis ; for example, Euagon the son of Daitharses.
							Others with a crisis on the sixth had an intermission
							of seven days, and after the relapse a crisis on the
							fourth ; for example, the daughter of Aglai+das. Now
							most of those who fell ill in this constitution went
							through their illness in this manner, and none of</p>
							<pb id="p.179"/>
							<p>those who recovered, so far as I know, failed to
								suffer the relapses which were normal in these cases,
								but all, so far as I know, recovered if their relapses
								took place after this fashion. Further, I know of
								none who suffered a fresh relapse after going through
								the illness in the manner described above.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="21"><head>PART 21</head><p>XXI. In these diseases most died on the sixth
							day, as did Epaminondas, Silenus and Philiscus the
							son of Antagoras. Those who had the swellings by
							the ears had a crisis on the twentieth day, but these
							subsided in all cases without suppuration, being
							diverted to the bladder. There were two cases of
							suppuration, both fatal, Cratistonax, who lived near
							the temple of Heracles, and the serving-maid of
							Scymnus the fuller. When there was a crisis on
							the seventh day, with an intermission of nine days
							followed by a relapse, there was a second crisis on
							the fourth day after the relapse--in the case of
							Pantacles, for example, who lived by the temple of
							Dionysus. When there was a crisis on the seventh
							day, with an intermission of six days followed by a
							relapse, there was a second crisis on the seventh day
							after the relapse--in the case of Phanocritus, for
							example, who lay sick at the house of Gnathon the
							fuller.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="22"><head>PART 22</head><p>XXII. During winter, near the time of the
							winter solstice, and continuing until the equinox,
							the ardent fevers and the phrenitis still caused
							many deaths, but their crises changed. Most cases
							had a crisis on the fifth day from the outset, then
							intermitted four days, relapsed, had a crisis on the
							fifth day after the relapse, that is, after thirteen
							days altogether. Mostly children experienced crises
							thus, but older people did so too. Some had a crisis</p>
							<pb id="p.181"/>
							<p>on the eleventh day, a relapse on the fourteenth,
								and a complete crisis on the twentieth. But if rigor
								came on about the twentieth day the crisis came on
								the fortieth. Most had rigors near the first crisis,
								and those who had rigors at first near the crisis,
								had rigors again in the relapses at the time of the
								crisis. Fewest experienced rigors in the spring,
								more in summer, more still in autumn, but by far
								the most during winter. But the hemorrhages
								tended to cease.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="23"><head>PART 23</head><p>XXIII. The following were the circumstances
							attending the diseases, from which I framed my
							judgments, learning from the common nature of all
							and the particular nature of the individual, from the
							disease, the patient, the regimen prescribed and the
							prescriber--for these make a diagnosis more favourable
							or less ; from the constitution, both as a whole
							and with respect to the parts, of the weather and of
							each region ; from the custom, mode of life, practices
							and ages of each patient ; from talk, manner, silence,
							thoughts, sleep or absence of sleep, the nature and
							time of dreams, pluckings, scratchings, tears ; from
							the exacerbations, stools, urine, sputa, vomit, the
							antecedents and consequents of each member in the
							successions of diseases, and the abscessions to a fatal
							issue or a crisis, sweat, rigor, chill, cough, sneezes,
							hiccoughs, breathing, belchings, flatulence, silent or
							noisy, hemorrhages, and hemorrhoids. From these
							things must we consider what their consequents also
							will be.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="24"><head>PART 24</head><p>XXIV. Some fevers are continuous, some have an
							access during the day and an intermission during
							the night, or an access during the night and an
							intermission during the day ; there are semitertians,</p>
							<pb id="p.183"/>
							<p>tertians, quartans, quintans, septans, nonans. The
								most acute diseases, the most severe, difficult and
								fatal, belong to the continuous fevers. The least
								fatal and least difficult of all, but the longest of all,
								is the quartan. Not only is it such in itself, but it
								also ends other, and serious, diseases. In the fever
								called semitertian, which is more fatal than any
								other, there occur also acute diseases, while it
								especially precedes the illness of consumptives, and
								of those who suffer from other and longer diseases.
								The nocturnal is not very fatal, but it is long. The
								diurnal is longer still, and to some it also brings
								a tendency to consumption. The septan is long but
								not fatal. The nonan is longer still but not fatal.
								The exact tertian has a speedy crisis and is not
								fatal. But the quintan is the worst of all. For if it
								comes on before consumption or during consumption
								the patient dies.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="25"><head>PART 25</head>
							<p>XXV. Each of these fevers has its modes, its
								constitutions and its exacerbations. For example,
								a continuous fever in some cases from the beginning
								is high and at its worst, leading up to the most
								severe stage, but about and at the crisis it moderates.
								In other cases it begins gently and in a suppressed
								manner, but rises and is exacerbated each
								day, bursting out violently near the crisis. In some
								cases it begins mildly, but increases and is exacerbated,
								reaching its height after a time ; then it
								declines again until the crisis or near the crisis.
								These characteristics may show themselves in any
								fever and in any disease. It is necessary also to
								consider the patient's mode of life and to take it</p>
							<pb id="p.185"/>
							<p>into account when prescribing. Many other important
								symptoms there are which are akin to
								these, some of which I have described, while others
								I shall describe later. These must be duly weighed
								when considering and deciding who is suffering from
								one of these diseases in an acute, fatal form, or
								whether the patient may recover ; who has a chronic,
								fatal illness, or one from which he may recover ;
								who is to be prescribed for or not, what the prescription
								is to be, the quantity to be given and the
								time to give it.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="26"><head>PART 26</head>
							<p>XXVI. When the exacerbations are on even days,
								the crises are on even days. But the diseases exacerbated
								on odd days have their crises on odd days.
								The first period of diseases with crises on the even
								days is the fourth day, then the sixth, eighth, tenth,
								fourteenth, twentieth, twenty-fourth, thirtieth,
								fortieth, sixtieth, eightieth, hundred and twentieth.
								Of those with a crisis on the odd days the first period
								is the third, then the fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh,
								seventeenth, twenty-first, twenty-seventh, thirty-first.
								Further, one must know that, if the crises
								be on other days than the above, there will be
								relapses, and there may also be a fatal issue. So
								one must be attentive and know that at these times
								there will be the crises resulting in recovery, or
								death, or a tendency for better or worse. One must
								also consider in what periods the crises occur of
								irregular fevers, of quartans, of quintans, of septans
								and of nonans.</p>

					<p>S<hi rend="sc">OME</hi> MSS., the most important being V, have

						in Book III of the <hi rend="ital">Epidemics.</hi> These characters were
						known to Galen, who wrote, or contemplated writing,
						a treatise about them. There is no doubt, therefore,
						that they are ancient ; Galen indeed in his commentary
						tells us that his predecessors had been much
						exercised over them. Zeuxis, he says, had written
						a history of them in which they were traced back
						to Mnemon, who either added them to a manuscript
						in the Library at Alexandria or else brought to the
						Library a copy with the characters inserted.</p>
					<p>These characters are of no real value for the interpretation
						of the text, but they bear witness to the
						interest taken in the "medical histories" from very
						early times. Somebody or other invented a shorthand
						script in order to summarize these histories, or
						rather the main teaching of them. For some reason
						they were only applied to the histories of the third
						book, and Galen says that the older manuscripts
						of his time had no characters inserted until the
						seventh case (woman with angina).</p>

					<p>Now the first character, as I said, is always the
						letter II with the intersecting line, meaning in all
						cases "probable." At the end we see written either
						<foreign lang="greek">*U</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">*Q</foreign>, meaning "recovery" and "death" respectively.
						Before them is the number of the days
						at the end of which the patient recovered or died.
						The characters in the middle are in all cases (except
						the delta with a mark below it) the letters indicating
						the elements of the word.<note>That is, each middle character except one
							is a letter of
							the alphabet, and that letter is significant, being the initial
							of a word, or of several alternative words.</note> I will now state the
						meaning of each. Remember that the last character
						was said to signify recovery or death, and the last
						but one the number of the days, and I will now give
						a list of the others written between the number and
						the beginning. A signifies "miscarriage," "destruction";
						<foreign lang="greek">*G</foreign> "urine like semen"; the letter with the
						mark underneath,<note>The text is probably mutilated, but the general
							meaning
							is clear.</note> written thus <foreign lang="greek">*D</foreign>, means "evacuations
						by sweats," "diarrhoea" and "perspiration,"<note>Surely this is wrong.
							Littr&eacute;'s suggestion ("stools")
							may possibly be correct.</note>
						and in general any evacuation ; <foreign lang="greek">*E</foreign> "retention,"
						"seat"; <foreign lang="greek">*Z</foreign> "object of search"; <foreign lang="greek">*Q</foreign> "death," as I
						said before ; <foreign lang="greek">*I</foreign> "sweat"; <foreign lang="greek">*K</foreign> "crisis" or "condition
						of the bowels"; <foreign lang="greek">*M</foreign> "madness" or "womb"; <foreign lang="greek">*N</foreign>
						"youth" or "mortification"; <foreign lang="greek">*C</foreign> "yellow bile,"
						"something strange and rare," "irritation," "dryness";
						<foreign lang="greek">*O</foreign> "pains" or "urine," though some say it
						means urine only when it has the <foreign lang="greek">*U</foreign> placed above,
						written as the word <foreign lang="greek">OU(/TWS2</foreign> is generally written ; <foreign lang="greek">*P</foreign>
						means "abundance," "sputum," "wheat,"<note>This again can surely not be
							correct. Littr&eacute;'s emendation
							is unconvincing.</note> "fever,"</p>
					<pb id="p.216"/>
					<p>"affection of the lung"; with a vertical stroke in
						the centre it means as <foreign lang="greek">*I</foreign> said "probable"; <foreign lang="greek">*R</foreign> means
						"flux," "rigor"; <foreign lang="greek">*F</foreign> "phrenitis" or "consumption";
						<foreign lang="greek">*S</foreign> "convulsion" or "morbid condition of oesophagus
						or mouth"; <foreign lang="greek">*T</foreign> "delivery"; <foreign lang="greek">*U</foreign> "recovery of health"
						or "hypochondrium"; <foreign lang="greek">*X</foreign> "bile" or "bilious"; <foreign lang="greek">*Y</foreign>
						"chill"; <foreign lang="greek">*W</foreign> "crudity."</p>
					<p>For more information about the characters see
						Littr&eacute;, III. pp. 28-33, and various notes at the end
						of the cases, and also Ilberg in K&eacute;hlewein's edition,
						p. 245.</p>
					<p>As might have been expected, there is considerable
						doubt as to the right readings of these characters.
						Thus in V the characters at the end of Case <hi rend="sc">I</hi>
						(first series) are :--</p>
					<p><hi rend="center">?? <foreign lang="greek">*Z*S*M*O*N</foreign></hi></p>
					<p>where the first character is obviously another form
						of Galen's ??. Ilberg emends to :--</p>
					<p><hi rend="center">?? <foreign lang="greek">*Z*S*M*O*N</foreign><foreign lang="greek">*U</foreign>></hi></p>
					<p>Galen reads :--</p>
					<p><hi rend="center">?? <foreign lang="greek">*P*O*U*M*U</foreign></hi></p>
					<p><hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">PIQANO/N</foreign>.</p>

					<p><foreign lang="greek">TES1S1ARA/KONTA</foreign>.</p>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">U(GI/EIA</foreign>.</p>
					<p>"It is probable that abundance of urine caused
						recovery in forty days."</p>
					<p>Galen's reading makes it necessary to take the
						words of the text, <foreign lang="greek">META\ DE\ KRI/S1IN</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">TES1S1ARA/KONTA</foreign></p>
					<pb id="p.217"/>
					<p><foreign lang="greek">H(ME/RH|S1IN U(=S1TERON</foreign>, in the unnatural sense of "after

					<p>It appears certain that there were varieties of this

					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="3"><head>PART 3</head><p>III. Early in the spring, at the same time as the
						cold snaps which occurred, were many malignant
						cases<note>Or, "forms."</note> of erysipelas, some from a known exciting cause
						and some not. Many died, and many suffered pain
						in the throat. Voices impaired ; ardent fevers ;
						phrenitis ; aphthae in the mouth ; tumours in the
						private parts ; inflammations of the eyes ; carbuncles ;
						disordered bowels ; loss of appetite ; thirst in some
						cases, though not in all ; urine disordered, copious,
						bad ; long coma alternating with sleeplessness ;
						absence of crisis in many cases, and obscure crises ;
						dropsies ; many consumptives. Such were the
						diseases epidemic. There were patients suffering
						from each of the above types, and fatal cases were
						many. The symptoms in each type were as follow.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="4"><head>PART 4</head><p>IV. Many were attacked by the erysipelas all
						over the body when the exciting cause was a trivial
						accident or a very small wound ; especially when the
						patients were about sixty years old and the wound
						was in the head, however little the neglect might
						have been. Many even while undergoing treatment
						suffered from severe inflammations,<note>With Littr&eacute;'s punctuation the meaning is, "however
							slight the neglect, and even when a patient was actually
							undergoing treatment. There were severe inflammations,"
							etc.</note> and the
						erysipelas would quickly spread widely in all directions.
						Most of the patients experienced abscessions
						ending in suppurations. Flesh, sinews and bones</p>
						<pb id="p.243"/>
						<p>fell away in large quantities. The flux which formed
							was not like pus, but was a different sort of putre-faction
							with a copious and varied flux. If any of these
							symptoms occurred in the head, there was loss of
							hair from all the head and from the chin ; the bones
							were bared and fell away, and there were copious
							fluxes. Fever was sometimes present and sometimes
							absent. These symptoms were terrifying rather
							than dangerous. For whenever they resulted in
							suppuration or some similar coction the cases usually
							recovered. But whenever the inflammation and the
							erysipelas disappeared without producing any such
							abscession, there were many deaths. The course of
							the disease was the same to whatever part of the
							body it spread. Many lost the arm and the entire
							forearm. If the malady settled in the sides there
							was rotting either before or behind. In some cases
							the entire thigh was bared, or the shin and the
							entire foot. But the most dangerous of all such
							cases were when the pubes and genital organs were
							attacked. Such were the sores which sprang from
							an exciting cause. In many cases, however, sores
							occurred in fevers, before a fever, or supervening on
							fevers. In some of these also, when an abscession
							took place through suppuration, or when a seasonable
							disturbance of the bowels occurred or a passing of
							favourable urine, this gave rise to a solution ; but
							when none of these events happened, and the symptoms
							disappeared without a sign, death resulted. It
							was in the spring that by far the greater number of
							cases of erysipelas occurred, but they continued
							throughout the summer and during autumn.</p>
						<pb id="p.245"/>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="5"><head>PART 5</head><p>V. Much trouble was caused to some patients by
						the tumours in the throat, inflammations of the
						tongue and the abscesses about the teeth. Many had
						the symptom of impaired and muffled<note>The word so rendered has
							puzzled the commentators
							from very early times. See the full disoussion of Littr&eacute;
							<hi rend="ital">ad loc.</hi> The ancients interpreted either "cooped up" or
							"altered," "fauss&eacute;e" (Littr&eacute;). See Erotian <hi rend="ital">sub voce</hi> <foreign lang="greek">FWNAI\
								KATEI/LLOUS1AI</foreign>. I think that H. used a strange word metaphorically
							on purpose to describe a strange alteration in the
							voice, which was as it were "imprisoned" or (to borrow a
							motoring expression) "silenced."</note> voice, at first
						at the beginning of the cases of consumption, but
						also in the ardent fevers and in phrenitis.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="6"><head>PART 6</head><p>VI. Now the ardent fevers and phrenitis began
						early in the spring after the cold snaps which
						occurred, and very many fell sick at that time.
						These suffered acute and fatal symptoms. The constitution
						of the ardent fevers that occurred was as
						follows. At the beginning coma, nausea, shivering,
						acute fever, no great thirst, no delirium, slight
						epistaxis. The exacerbations in most cases on even
						days, and about the time of the exacerbations there
						was loss of memory with prostration and speechlessness.
						The feet and hands of these patients were
						always colder than usual, most especially about the
						times of exacerbation. Slowly and in no healthy
						manner they recovered their heat, becoming rational
						again and conversing. Either the coma held them
						continuously without sleep, or they were wakeful
						and in pain. Bowels disordered in the majority of
						these cases, with crude, thin, copious stools. Urine
						copious, thin, with no critical or favourable sign, nor
						did any other critical sign appear in these patients.
						For there occurred neither favourable hemorrhage</p>
						<pb id="p.247"/>
						<p>nor any other of the usual critical abscessions. The
							manner of their dying varied with the individual ; it
							was usually irregular, at the crises, but in some cases
							after long loss of speech and in many with sweating.
							These were the symptoms attending the fatal cases
							of ardent fever, and the cases of phrenitis were
							similar. These suffered from no thirst at all, and
							no case showed the mad delirium that attacked
							others, but they passed away overpowered by a dull
							oppression of stupor.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="7"><head>PART 7</head><p>VII. There were other fevers also, which I shall
						describe in due course. Many had aphthae and
						sores in the mouth. Fluxes about the genitals were
						copious<note>Possibly "frequent," "common." So Littr&eacute;. This is
							one of the most doubtful cases of those difficult words in
							a medical context, <foreign lang="greek">POLU/S</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">O)LI/GOS</foreign> in the plural. See
							General Introduction, p. lxi.</note>; sores, tumours external and internal ;
						the
						swellings which appear in the groin.<note>A curious phrase. I suspect
							that <foreign lang="greek">TA\</foreign> hides a corruption
							of the text.</note> Watery inflammations
						of the eyes, chronic and painful. Growths
						on the eyelids, external and internal, in many cases
						destroying the sight, which are called "figs." There
						were also often growths on other sores, particularly
						in the genitals. Many carbuncles in the summer,
						and other affections called "rot." Large pustules.
						Many had large tetters.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="8"><head>PART 8</head><p>VIII. The bowel troubles in many cases turned
						out many and harmful. In the first place many
						were attacked by painful tenesmus, mostly children--all
						in fact who were approaching puberty--and
						most of these died. Many lienteries. Cases of
						dysentery, but they too<note><hi rend="ital">I. c.</hi> as Galen suggests in his
							commentary, they were like
							the lienteries in not causing much pain. Lientery is not
							particularly painful.</note> were not very painful.
						Stools bilious, greasy, thin and watery. In many</p>
						<pb id="p.249"/>
						<p>cases this condition of the bowels constituted the
							disease itself, fever being sometimes absent and
							sometimes present.<note>Littr&eacute; in a long and obscure note argues that
								only <foreign lang="greek">A)/NEU
									PURETW=N</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">E)N PURETOI=S1I</foreign> can belong to the preceding
								phrase,
								apparently because it is illogical to say that fever was present
								when the disease consisted merely of unhealthy stools. But
								the writer does not wish to exclude fever ; he merely wishes
								to exclude from this class of patient tenesmus, lientery and
								dysentery. The commentary of Galen, <foreign lang="greek">POLLOI=S U=E/ FHS1IN AU)TO\
									TOU=TO GENE/S1QAI TO\ NO/S1HMA</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">TOUTE/S1TI TO\ DIAXWREI=N TA\
										TOIAU=TA: KAI\
										GA\R KAI\ XWRI\S PURETW=N E)NI/OIS TOU=TO GENE/S1QAI *FHS1I</foreign>, does not,
								as
								Littr&eacute; supposes, support his contention. The phrase <foreign lang="greek">KAI\
									XWRI\S PURETW=N E)NI/OIS TOU=TO GENE/S1QAI FHS1I\</foreign> implies <foreign lang="greek">KAI\ E)N
										PURETOI=S

							the contents remained behind.<note>It is hard to separate
								<foreign lang="greek">DIE/CODOI</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">TW=N POLLW=N</foreign>, yet the
								sense seems to require it. The next sentence states that
								these evacuations caused no relief, evidently because they
								did not clear the trouble from the bowel. Now if <foreign lang="greek">DIE/CODOI</foreign> be
								taken with <foreign lang="greek">TW=N POLLW=N</foreign>, the only possible translation is
								" evacuations of the many contents which were retained
								there," implying complete evacuation. Galen's comment
								(K&eacute;hn XVII, Part I, p. 708) bears out the former interpretation
								: <foreign lang="greek">TA\S DE\ DIECO/DOUS</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">TOUTE/S1TI\ TA\S KENW/S1EIS</foreign>,
								<foreign lang="greek">AU)TOI=S S1UMBH=NAI</foreign>,

								<foreign lang="greek">E)PE/XW</foreign>, although I cannot find a parallel for intransitive
								<foreign lang="greek">E)PI/S1XW</foreign> in this sense.</note> The evacuations
							did not take away the pains, and yielded with difficulty
							to the remedies administered. Purgings, in
							fact, did harm in most cases. Of those in this condition
							many died rapidly, though a few held out
							longer. In brief, all patients, whether the disease
							was prolonged or acute, died chiefly from the bowel
							complaints. For the bowels carried all off together.<note>The writer has
								not expressed himself clearly in this
								chapter, which seems to be the roughest of rough notes. The
								last two sentences apparently mean :--
								<p>(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) It was always the bowel complaints which caused most
									deaths. This was natural, since (<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) all attacked by bowel
									complaints died.</p></note></p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="9"><head>PART 9</head><p>IX. Loss of appetite, to a degree that I never

						<pb id="p.251"/>

					<div4 type="section" n="10"><head>PART 10</head><p>X. The urine that was passed was copious, not in
						proportion to, but far exceeding, the drink administered.
						Yet the urine too that was passed showed
						a great malignancy. For it had neither the proper

						signified for most patients wasting, trouble,<note>Probably "disordered

					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="11"><head>PART 11</head><p>XI. Coma attended mostly the phrenitis and ardent
						fevers, without excluding, however, all the other diseases
						of the most severe sort that were accompanied
						by fever. Most patients throughout either were
						sunk in heavy coma or slept only in fitful snatches.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="12"><head>PART 12</head><p>XII. Many other forms also of fever were epidemic
						: -- tertians, quartans, night fevers, fevers
						continuous, protracted, irregular, fevers attended with
						nausea, fevers of no definite character. All these
						cases suffered severely from trouble.<note>See the preceding note.</note>
						For the
						bowels in most cases were disordered, with shivering
						fits. Sweats portended no crisis, and the
						character of the urine was as I have described.
						Most of these cases were protracted, for the abscessions
						too which took place did not prove critical
						as in other cases ; nay rather, in all cases all
						symptoms marked obscurity of crisis,<note>For <foreign lang="greek">DU/S1KRITON</foreign> see
							Foes' <hi rend="ital">Oeconomia, sub voce.</hi> It means
							that it was hard to see when a crisis took place, or that

						especially in the patients last described. A few</p>
						<pb id="p.253"/>
						<p>of these had a crisis about the eightieth day ;
							with most recovery followed no rule. A few of
							them died of dropsy, without taking to their bed ;
							many sufferers from the other diseases too were
							troubled with swellings, most particularly the
							consumptives.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="13"><head>PART 13</head><p>XIII. The severest and most troublesome disease,
						as well as the most fatal, was the consumption.
						Many cases began in the winter, and of these
						several took to their bed, though some went about
						ailing without doing so. Early in the spring most
						of those who had gone to bed died, while none of the
						others lost their cough, though it became easier in
						the summer. During autumn all took to bed and
						many died. Most of these were ill for a long time.
						Now most of these began suddenly to grow worse,
						showing the following symptoms :--frequent shivering ;
						often continuous and acute fever ; unseasonable,
						copious,<note>I am often doubtful as to the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">POLLOI\</foreign> in
							instances like these ; does it refer to quantity or frequency ?
							In these two examples either meaning would give excellent
							sense. See General Introduction, p. lxi.</note> cold sweats throughout ; great
						chill with
						difficult recovery of heat ; bowels variously constipated,
						then quickly relaxing, and violently relaxing
						in all cases near the end ; the humours about the
						lungs spread downwards ; abundance of unfavourable
						urine ; malignant wasting. The coughs throughout
						were frequent, bringing up copious,<note>I am often doubtful as to the
							meaning of <foreign lang="greek">POLLOI\</foreign> in
							instances like these ; does it refer to quantity or frequency ?
							In these two examples either meaning would give excellent
							sense. See General Introduction, p. lxi.</note> concocted and
						liquid sputa, but without much pain ; but even if
						there was pain, in all cases the purging from the
						lungs took place very mildly. The throat did not
						smart very much, nor did salt humours cause any
						distress at all. The fluxes, however, viscid, white,</p>
						<pb id="p.255"/>
						<p>moist, frothy, which came from the head, were
							abundant. But by far the worst symptom that
							attended both these cases and the others was the
							distaste for food, as has been mentioned. They had
							no relish either for drink with nourishment, but they
							remained entirely without thirst. Heaviness in the
							body. Coma. In most of them there was swelling,
							which developed into dropsy. Shivering fits and
							delirium near death.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="14"><head>PART 14</head><p>XIV. The physical characteristics of the consumptives
						were :--skin smooth, whitish, lentil-coloured,
						reddish ; bright eyes ;<note>It seems impossible to decide whether the
							adjective
							<foreign lang="greek">XAROPO/S</foreign> refers here to the brightness of the eyes or to their

					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="15"><head>PART 15</head><p>XV. In all the cases described spring was the
						worst enemy, and caused the most deaths ; summer
						was the most favourable season, in which fewest
						died. In autumn and during the season of the
						Pleiades, on the other hand, there were again
						deaths, usually on the fourth day. And it seems
						to me natural that the coming on of summer should
						have been helpful. For the coming on of winter
						resolves the diseases of summer, and the coming on
						of summer removes those of winter. And yet in</p>
						<pb id="p.257"/>
						<p>itself the summer in question was not healthful ;<note>"Of a good
							constitution."</note>
							in fact it was suddenly hot, southerly, and calm.
							But nevertheless the change from the other constitution
							proved beneficial.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 type="section" n="16"><head>PART 16</head><p>XVI. The power, too, to study correctly what has
						been written I consider to be an important part of
						the art of medicine. The man who has learnt these
						things and uses them will not, I think, make
						great mistakes in the art. And it is necessary to
						learn accurately each constitution of the seasons
						as well as the disease ; what common element
						in the constitution or in the disease is good, and
						what common element in the constitution or in the
						disease is bad ; what malady is protracted and fatal,
						what is protracted and likely to end in recovery ;
						what acute illness is fatal, what acute illness is likely
						to end in recovery. With this knowledge it is easy
						to examine the order of the critical days, and to
						prognosticate therefrom. One who has knowledge
						of these matters can know whom he ought to treat,
						as well as the time and method of treatment.<note>This chapter does not

						my profession, as well as outside my profession in

					composite memory of things apprehended with
					sense-perception. For the sense-perception, coming
					first in experience and conveying to the intellect
					the things subjected to it, is clearly imaged, and
					the intellect, receiving these things many times,
					noting the occasion, the time and the manner, stores
					them up in itself and remembers. Now I approve
					of theorising also if it lays its foundation in incident,
					and deduces its conclusions in accordance with phenomena.
					For if theorising lays its foundation in
					clear fact, it is found to exist in the domain of intellect,
					which itself receives from other sources each
					of its impressions. So we must conceive of our nature
					as being stirred and instructed under compulsion
					by the great variety of things ; and the intellect, as
					I have said, taking over from nature the impressions,
					leads us afterwards into truth. But if it</p>
					<pb id="p.315"/>
					<p>begins, not from a clear impression, but from a
						plausible fiction,<note><hi rend="ital">I. e.,</hi> if the general statement from which
							we deduce
							conclusions be a plausible but untrue hypothesis. Conclusions
							drawn from such hypotheses lead to nowhere.</note> it often induces a grievous
						and
						troublesome condition. All who so act are lost in a
						blind alley. Now no harm would be done if bad
						practitioners received their due wages. But as it is
						their innocent patients suffer, for whom the violence
						of their disorder did not appear sufficient without
						the addition of their physician's inexperience. I
						must now pass on to another subject.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>PART 2</head><p>II. But conclusions which are merely verbal cannot
					bear fruit, only those do which are based on demonstrated
					fact. For affirmation and talk are deceptive
					and treacherous. Wherefore one must hold fast to
					facts in generalisations also,<note>Or, possibly, " even from beginning
						to end."</note> and occupy oneself with
					facts persistently, if one is to acquire that ready and
					infallible habit which we call " the art of medicine."
					For so to do will bestow a very great advantage
					upon sick folk and medical practitioners. Do not
					hesitate to inquire of laymen, if thereby there
					seems likely to result any improvement in treatment.
					For so I think the whole art has been set
					forth, by observing some part of the final end in
					each of many particulars, and then combining all
					into a single whole. So one must pay attention to
					generalities in incidents, with help and quietness
					rather than with professions and the excuses that
					accompany ill-success.</p>
					<pb id="p.317"/>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3"><head>PART 3</head><p>III. Early determination of the patient's treatment--since
					only what has actually been administered
					will benefit ; emphatic assertion is of no
					use--is beneficial but complicated. For it is through
					many turns and changes that all diseases settle into
					some sort of permanence.<note>Because changes and turns are common in the
						early
						stages, to fix the proper treatment early is a complicated
						matter.</note></p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4"><head>PART 4</head><p>IV. This piece of advice also will need our consideration,
					as it contributes somewhat to the whole.
					For should you begin by discussing fees, you will
					suggest to the patient either that you will go away
					and leave him if no agreement be reached, or that
					you will neglect him and not prescribe any immediate
					treatment. So one must not be anxious about fixing
					a fee. For I consider such a worry to be harmful
					to a troubled patient, particularly if the disease be
					acute. For the quickness of the disease, offering no
					opportunity for turning back,<note><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> from missed opportunities
						that have passed away
						while haggling over fees. It is possible that <foreign lang="greek">A)NAS1TROFH/</foreign> has
						here the sense of <foreign lang="greek">A)NAS1TRE/FEIN KARI/DAN</foreign> in Thucydides II. 49,
						" to upset." An acute disease is not the time to upset a
						patient with financial worries.</note> spurs on the good
					physician not to seek his profit but rather to lay
					hold on reputation. Therefore it is better to reproach
					a patient you have saved than to extort money from<note>Or, if Coray's
						emendation be adopted, " to tease."</note>
					those who are at death's door.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5"><head>PART 5</head><p>V. And yet some patients ask for what is out of
					the way and doubtful, through prejudice, deserving
					indeed to be disregarded, but not to be punished.
					Wherefore you must reasonably oppose them, as
					they are embarked upon a stormy sea of change.</p>
					<pb id="p.319"/>
					<p>For, in heaven's name, who that is a brotherly<note>The word so
						translated is fairly common in the <hi rend="ital">Corpus</hi> in
						the sense of " related." Here it evidently means " a loyal
						member of the family of physicians."</note> physician
						practises with such hardness of heart as not at
						the beginning to conduct a preliminary examination
						of every illness<note>With Ermerins' reading, " all the illness."</note> and
						prescribe what will help towards
						a cure, to heal the patient and not to overlook the
						reward, to say nothing of the desire that makes a
						man ready to learn?</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6"><head>PART 6</head><p>VI. I urge you not to be too unkind, but to consider
					carefully your patient's superabundance or
					means. Sometimes give your services for nothing,
					calling to mind a previous benefaction or present
					satisfaction.<note>Or, with <foreign lang="greek">EU)DOKIMI/HN</foreign>, " your present
						reputation."</note> And if there be an opportunity of
					serving one who is a stranger in financial straits,
					give full assistance to all such. For where there is
					love of man, there is also love of the art. For some
					patients, though conscious that their condition is
					perilous, recover their health simply through their
					contentment with the goodness of the physician.
					And it is well to superintend the sick to make them
					well, to care for the healthy to keep them well, but
					also to care for one's own self, so as to observe what
					is seemly.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7"><head>PART 7</head><p>VII. Now those who are buried in deep ignorance

					In fact such men will be shown up as ignorant of</p>
					<pb id="p.321"/>
					<p>medicine, suddenly exalted yet needing good luck.
						For should wealthy men gain some remission of their
						trouble, these quacks win reputation through a
						double good fortune, and if a relapse occurs
						they stand upon their dignity, having neglected
						the irreproachable methods of the art, wherewith
						a good physician, a " brother of the art " as he is
						called, would be at his best. But he who accomplishes
						his cures easily without making a mistake
						would transgress none of these methods through want
						of power ;<note>He is trusted, and so can do as he likes. Therefore want
							of power to influence a patient never compels him to transgress
							the medical code.</note> for he is not distrusted on the ground of
						wickedness. For quacks do not attempt treatment
						when they see an alarming<note>It is quite uncertain whether

									A)LGH/MATOS2

							" alarming."</note> condition, and avoid
						calling in other physicians, because they wickedly
						hate help. And the patients in their pain drift on a
						sea of twofold wretchedness for not having intrusted
						themselves to the end to the fuller treatment that
						is given by the art. For a remission of a disease
						affords a sick man much relief. Wherefore wanting
						a healthy condition they do not wish always to submit
						to the same treatment, therein being in accord
						with a physician's versatility.<note>The reader must suspect that in the
							words <foreign lang="greek">I)HTROU= POIKILI/H</foreign>
							is concealed an allusion to frequent changes of the medical
							attendant. " Changing their doctor every day." The
							version in the text means that the patients frequently
							change their minds as do quacks, or as doctors must be ready
							to change their treatment at a moment's notice.</note> For the patients</p>
					<pb id="p.323"/>
					<p>are in need through heavy expenditure, worshipping
						incompetence and showing no gratitude when they
						meet it ;<note>These patients <foreign lang="greek">A)PORE/OUS1IN</foreign>, and so can scarcely be
							the same
							as the <foreign lang="greek">EU)/POROI</foreign> of the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps
							<foreign lang="greek">OU)K</foreign> should be read before <foreign lang="greek">A)XARIS1TE/ONTES2</foreign>, and the sense
							would
							then be, " they become poor by showing gratitude to quacks,
							when they might be well off by employing qualified men."</note> when they have
						the power to be well off,
						they exhaust themselves about fees, really wishing
						to be well for the sake of managing their investments
						or farms, yet without a thought in these matters to
						receive anything.<note>The greater part of this chapter is hopeless.
							There
							seems to be no connexion between the quack doctors of the
							first part and the wayward patients of the latter part. I
							suspect that an incongruous passage has been inserted here
							by some compiler, just as chapter fourteen was so inserted.
							Perhaps there are gaps in the text, the filling up of which
							would clear away the difficulty. Probably there is one after
							<foreign lang="greek">EI(/NEKEN</foreign>. If the latter part be not an interpolation, the
							general meaning seems to be that when patients grow worse
							under quack treatment, they change their doctor and hire
							another quack. So they both grow worse and lose money.
							They really want to get well to look after their business,
							but do not think of the right way to return to work again,
							<hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> of employing a qualified medical man.</note></p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="8"><head>PART 8</head><p>VIII. So much for such recommendations. For
					remission and aggravation of a disease require respectively
					less or more medical assistance. A
					physician does not violate etiquette even if, being
					in difficulties on occasion over a patient and in the
					dark through inexperience, he should urge the calling
					in of others, in order to learn by consultation the
					truth about the case, and in order that there may
					be fellow-workers to afford abundant help. For
					when a diseased condition is stubborn and the evil
					grows, in the perplexity of the moment most things
					go wrong. So on such occasions one must be bold.<note>Or (reading
						<foreign lang="greek">OU)</foreign>) " on such occasions one must not be
						self-confident."</note>
					For never will I lay it down that the art has been</p>
					<pb id="p.325"/>
					<p>condemned in this matter.<note><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> that because a consultant
						is necessary the fault lies
						with the art of medicine.</note> Physicians who meet
						in consultation must never quarrel, or jeer at one
						another. For I will assert upon oath, a physician's
						reasoning should never be jealous of another. To
						be so will be a sign of weakness. Those who act
						thus lightly are rather those connected with the
						business of the market-place. Yet it is no mistaken
						idea to call in a consultant. For in all abundance
						there is lack.<note>No matter how much help you have you can never have
							enough.</note></p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9"><head>PART 9</head><p>IX. With all these things it will appear strong
					evidence for the reality of the art if a physician,
					while skilfully treating the patient, does not refrain
					from exhortations not to worry in mind in the
					eagerness to reach the hour of recovery. For we
					physicians take the lead in what is necessary for
					health. And if he be under orders the patient will
					not go far astray. For left to themselves patients
					sink through their painful condition, give up the
					struggle and depart this life. But he who has taken
					the sick man in hand, if he display the discoveries
					of the art, preserving nature, not trying to alter it,
					will sweep away the present depression or the distrust
					of the moment. For the healthy condition of
					a human being is a nature that has naturally attained
					a movement, not alien but perfectly adapted, having</p>
					<pb id="p.327"/>
					<p>produced it by means of breath, warmth and coction
						of humours, in every way, by complete regimen and
						by everything combined, unless there be some congenital
						or early deficiency. Should there be such a
						thing in a patient who is wasting, try to assimilate
						to the fundamental nature.<note><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> try to bring the patient
							back to his normal condition.</note> For the wasting, even
						of long standing, is unnatural.</p>

					luxurious headgear and elaborate perfume.
					For excess of strangeness will win you ill-repute, but
					a little will be considered in good taste, just as pain
					in one part is a trifle, while in every part it is serious.

					pertinent to the art, and laboriously far-fetched,<note>See p. 308.</note>
					and which therefore has in itself alone an attractive

					nothing that is immediate, and its remembrance

					outrage, that has no thought for what is
					seemly, while definitions, professions, oaths, great as
					far as the gods invoked are concerned,<note>That is, the oaths
						frantically appeal to all the great gods.</note> come from
					the physician in charge of the disease, bewildered

					spoken in continuous reading and instruction,
					crowding together even before they are troubled by
					a disease.<note>The construction and translation are uncertain. I believe
						that <foreign lang="greek">DRIS1MOI=S2</foreign> and the other datives are a Roman's efforts at

						<foreign lang="greek">LO/GONS2</foreign>. Perhaps it is a Latinism. Cf. "pastor ab Amphryso."</note>
					Wherever I may be in charge of a case,
					with no confidence should I call in such men to
					help as consultants. For in them comprehension of
					seemly learning is far to seek. Seeing then that they
					cannot but be unintelligent, I urge that experience
					is useful, the learning of opinions coming far after.
					For who is desirous and ambitious of learning truly
					subtle diversities of opinion, to the neglect of calm
