				<div2 type="section" n="1">
					<p>I SWEAR by Apollo the physician, and Aesculapius, and Health, and
						All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability
						and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this stipulation- to reckon
						him who taught me this Art equally dear to me as my parents, to share
						my substance with him, and relieve his necessities if required; to
						look upon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and
						to teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee
						or stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode
						of instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons,
						and those of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation
						and oath according to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will
						follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment,
						I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever
						is deleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to
						any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner
						I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity
						and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art. I will
						not cut persons laboring under the stone, but will leave this to be
						done by men who are practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses
						I enter, I will go into them for the benefit of the sick, and will
						abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and,
						further from the seduction of females or males, of freemen and slaves.
						Whatever, in connection with my professional practice or not, in connection
						with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be
						spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should
						be kept secret. While I continue to keep this Oath unviolated, may
						it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected
						by all men, in all times! But should I trespass and violate this Oath,
						may the reverse be my lot! </p>

			<div1 type="text" n="VM"><head>On Ancient Medicine</head>
				<div2 type="section" n="1"><head>PART 1</head>
					<p>Whoever having undertaken to speak or write on Medicine, have first laid down for themselves some hypothesis to their argument, such as hot, or cold, or moist, or dry, or whatever else they choose (thus
						reducing their subject within a narrow compass, and supposing only
						one or two original causes of diseases or of death among mankind),
						are all clearly mistaken in much that they say; and this is the more
						reprehensible as relating to an art which all men avail themselves
						of on the most important occasions, and the good operators and practitioners
						in which they hold in especial honor. For there are practitioners,
						some bad and some far otherwise, which, if there had been no such
						thing as Medicine, and if nothing had been investigated or found out
						in it, would not have been the case, but all would have been equally
						unskilled and ignorant of it, and everything concerning the sick would
						have been directed by chance. But now it is not so; for, as in all
						the other arts, those who practise them differ much from one another
						in dexterity and knowledge, so is it in like manner with Medicine.
						Wherefore I have not thought that it stood in need of an empty hypothesis,
						like those subjects which are occult and dubious, in attempting to
						handle which it is necessary to use some hypothesis; as, for example,
						with regard to things above us and things below the earth; if any
						one should treat of these and undertake to declare how they are constituted,
						the reader or hearer could not find out, whether what is delivered
						be true or false; for there is nothing which can be referred to in
						order to discover the truth.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2"><head>PART 2</head>
					<p>But all these requisites belong of old to Medicine, and an origin
						and way have been found out, by which many and elegant <pb id="p.2"/>discoveries
						have been made, during a length of time, and others will yet be found
						out, if a person possessed of the proper ability, and knowing those
						discoveries which have been made, should proceed from them to prosecute
						his investigations. But whoever, rejecting and despising all these,
						attempts to pursue another course and form of inquiry, and says he
						has discovered anything, is deceived himself and deceives others,
						for the thing is impossible. And for what reason it is impossible,
						I will now endeavor to explain, by stating and showing what the art
						really is. From this it will be manifest that discoveries cannot possibly
						be made in any other way. And most especially, it appears to me, that
						whoever treats of this art should treat of things which are familiar
						to the common people. For of nothing else will such a one have to
						inquire or treat, but of the diseases under which the common people
						have labored, which diseases and the causes of their origin and departure,
						their increase and decline, illiterate persons cannot easily find
						out themselves, but still it is easy for them to understand these
						things when discovered and expounded by others. For it is nothing
						more than that every one is put in mind of what had occurred to himself.
						But whoever does not reach the capacity of the illiterate vulgar and
						fails to make them listen to him, misses his mark. Wherefore, then,
						there is no necessity for any hypothesis. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>PART 3</head>
					<p>For the art of Medicine would not have been invented at first, nor
						would it have been made a subject of investigation (for there would
						have been no need of it), if when men are indisposed, the same food
						and other articles of regimen which they eat and drink when in good
						health were proper for them, and if no others were preferable to these.
						But now necessity itself made medicine to be sought out and discovered
						by men, since the same things when administered to the sick, which
						agreed with them when in good health, neither did nor do agree with
						them. But to go still further back, I hold that the diet and food
						which people in health now use would not have been discovered, provided
						it had suited with man to eat and drink in like manner as the ox,
						the horse, and all other animals, except man, do of the productions
						of the earth, such as fruits, weeds, and grass; for from such things
						these animals <pb id="p.3" />grow, live free of disease, and require no other kind
						of food. And, at first, I am of opinion that man used the same sort
						of food, and that the present articles of diet had been discovered
						and invented only after a long lapse of time, for when they suffered
						much and severely from strong and brutish diet, swallowing things
						which were raw, unmixed, and possessing great strength, they became
						exposed to strong pains and diseases, and to early deaths. It is likely,
						indeed, that from habit they would suffer less from these things then
						than we would now, but still they would suffer severely even then;
						and it is likely that the greater number, and those who had weaker
						constitutions, would all perish; whereas the stronger would hold out
						for a longer time, as even nowadays some, in consequence of using
						strong articles of food, get off with little trouble, but others with
						much pain and suffering. From this necessity it appears to me that
						they would search out the food befitting their nature, and thus discover
						that which we now use: and that from wheat, by macerating it, stripping
						it of its hull, grinding it all down, sifting, toasting, and baking
						it, they formed bread; and from barley they formed cake (maza), performing
						many operations in regard to it; they boiled, they roasted, they mixed,
						they diluted those things which are strong and of intense qualities
						with weaker things, fashioning them to the nature and powers of man,
						and considering that the stronger things Nature would not be able
						to manage if administered, and that from such things pains, diseases,
						and death would arise, but such as Nature could manage, that from
						them food, growth, and health, would arise. To such a discovery and
						investigation what more suitable name could one give than that of
						Medicine? since it was discovered for the health of man, for his nourishment
						and safety, as a substitute for that kind of diet by which pains,
						diseases, and deaths were occasioned. </p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4"><head>PART 4</head>
					<p>And if this is not held to be an art, I do not object. For it is not
						suitable to call any one an artist of that which no one is ignorant
						of, but which all know from usage and necessity. But still the discovery
						is a great one, and requiring much art and investigation. Wherefore
						those who devote themselves to gymnastics and training, are always
						making some new discovery, by <pb id="p.4"/>pursuing the same line of inquiry, where,
						by eating and drinking certain things, they are improved and grow
						stronger than they were. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5"><head>PART 5</head>
					<p>Let us inquire then regarding what is admitted to be Medicine; namely,
						that which was invented for the sake of the sick, which possesses
						a name and practitioners, whether it also seeks to accomplish the
						same objects, and whence it derived its origin. To me, then, it appears,
						as I said at the commencement, that nobody would have sought for medicine
						at all, provided the same kinds of diet had suited with men in sickness
						as in good health. Wherefore, even yet, such races of men as make
						no use of medicine, namely, barbarians, and even certain of the Greeks,
						live in the same way when sick as when in health; that is to say,
						they take what suits their appetite, and neither abstain from, nor
						restrict themselves in anything for which they have a desire. But
						those who have cultivated and invented medicine, having the same object
						in view as those of whom I formerly spoke, in the first place, I suppose,
						diminished the quantity of the articles of food which they used, and
						this alone would be sufficient for certain of the sick, and be manifestly
						beneficial to them, although not to all, for there would be some so
						affected as not to be able to manage even small quantities of their
						usual food, and as such persons would seem to require something weaker,
						they invented soups, by mixing a few strong things with much water,
						and thus abstracting that which was strong in them by dilution and
						boiling. But such as could not manage even soups, laid them aside,
						and had recourse to drinks, and so regulated them as to mixture and
						quantity, that they were administered neither stronger nor weaker
						than what was required. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6"><head>PART 6</head>
					<p>But this ought to be well known, that soups do not agree with certain
						persons in their diseases, but, on the contrary, when administered
						both the fevers and the pains are exacerbated, and it becomes obvious
						that what was given has proved food and increase to the disease, but
						a wasting and weakness to the body. But whatever persons so affected
						partook of solid food, or cake, or bread, even in small quantity,
						would be ten times and more decidedly injured than those who had taken
						soups, for no other <pb id="p.5" />reason than from the strength of the food in reference
						to the affection; and to whomsoever it is proper to take soups and
						not eat solid food, such a one will be much more injured if he eat
						much than if he eat little, but even little food will be injurious
						to him. But all the causes of the sufferance refer themselves to this
						rule, that the strongest things most especially and decidedly hurt
						man, whether in health or in disease. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>PART 7</head>
					<p>What other object, then, had he in view who is called a physician,
						and is admitted to be a practitioner of the art, who found out the
						regimen and diet befitting the sick, than he who originally found
						out and prepared for all mankind that kind of food which we all now
						use, in place of the former savage and brutish mode of living? To
						me it appears that the mode is the same, and the discovery of a similar
						nature. The one sought to abstract those things which the constitution
						of man cannot digest, because of their wildness and intemperature,
						and the other those things which are beyond the powers of the affection
						in which any one may happen to be laid up. Now, how does the one differ
						from the other, except that the latter admits of greater variety,
						and requires more application, whereas the former was the commencement
						of the process? </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>PART 8</head>
					<p>And if one would compare the diet of sick persons with that of persons
						in health, he will find it not more injurious than that of healthy
						persons in comparison with that of wild beasts and of other animals.
						For, suppose a man laboring under one of those diseases which are
						neither serious and unsupportable, nor yet altogether mild, but such
						as that, upon making any mistake in diet, it will become apparent,
						as if he should eat bread and flesh, or any other of those articles
						which prove beneficial to healthy persons, and that, too, not in great
						quantity, but much less than he could have taken when in good health;
						and that another man in good health, having a constitution neither
						very feeble, nor yet strong, eats of those things which are wholesome
						and strengthening to an ox or a horse, such as vetches, barley, and
						the like, and that, too, not in great quantity, but much less than
						he could take; the healthy person who did so would be subjected to
						no less disturbance and danger than the sick person who took bread 
						or <pb id="p.6"/>cake unseasonably. All these things are proofs that Medicine is
						to be prosecuted and discovered by the same method as the other.
					</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9">
					<head>PART 9</head>
					<p>And if it were simply, as is laid down, that such things as are stronger
						prove injurious, but such as are weaker prove beneficial and nourishing,
						both to sick and healthy persons, it were an easy matter, for then
						the safest rule would be to circumscribe the diet to the lowest point.
						But then it is no less mistake, nor one that injuries a man less,
						provided a deficient diet, or one consisting of weaker things than
						what are proper, be administered. For, in the constitution of man,
						abstinence may enervate, weaken, and kill. And there are many other
						ills, different from those of repletion, but no less dreadful, arising
						from deficiency of food; wherefore the practice in those cases is
						more varied, and requires greater accuracy. For one must aim at attaining
						a certain measure, and yet this measure admits neither weight nor
						calculation of any kind, by which it may be accurately determined,
						unless it be the sensation of the body; wherefore it is a task to
						learn this accurately, so as not to commit small blunders either on
						the one side or the other, and in fact I would give great praise to
						the physician whose mistakes are small, for perfect accuracy is seldom
						to be seen, since many physicians seem to me to be in the same plight
						as bad pilots, who, if they commit mistakes while conducting the ship
						in a calm do not expose themselves, but when a storm and violent hurricane
						overtake them, they then, from their ignorance and mistakes, are discovered
						to be what they are, by all men, namely, in losing their ship. And
						thus bad and commonplace physicians, when they treat men who have
						no serious illness, in which case one may commit great mistakes without
						producing any formidable mischief (and such complaints occur much
						more frequently to men than dangerous ones): under these circumstances,
						when they commit mistakes, they do not expose themselves to ordinary
						men; but when they fall in with a great, a strong, and a dangerous
						disease, then their mistakes and want of skill are made apparent to
						all. Their punishment is not far off, but is swift in overtaking both
						the one and the other.<note>He means both the pilot and physician.</note> </p>
				</div2>
				<pb id="p.7"/>
				<div2 type="section" n="10">
					<head>PART 10</head>
					<p>And that no less mischief happens to a man from unseasonable depletion
						than from repletion, may be clearly seen upon reverting to the consideration
						of persons in health. For, to some, with whom it agrees to take only
						one meal in the day, and they have arranged it so accordingly; whilst
						others, for the same reason, also take dinner, and this they do because
						they find it good for them, and not like those persons who, for pleasure
						or from any casual circumstance, adopt the one or the other custom
						and to the bulk of mankind it is of little consequence which of these
						rules they observe, that is to say, whether they make it a practice
						to take one or two meals. But there are certain persons who cannot
						readily change their diet with impunity; and if they make any alteration
						in it for one day, or even for a part of a day, are greatly injured
						thereby. Such persons, provided they take dinner when it is not their
						wont, immediately become heavy and inactive, both in body and mind,
						and are weighed down with yawning, slumbering, and thirst; and if
						they take supper in addition, they are seized with flatulence, tormina,
						and diarrhea, and to many this has been the commencement of a serious
						disease, when they have merely taken twice in a day the same food
						which they have been in the custom of taking once. And thus, also,
						if one who has been accustomed to dine, and this rule agrees with
						him, should not dine at the accustomed hour, he will straightway feel
						great loss of strength, trembling, and want of spirits, the eyes of
						such a person will become more pallid, his urine thick and hot, his
						mouth bitter; his bowels will seem, as it were, to hang loose; he
						will suffer from vertigo, lowness of spirit, and inactivity,- such
						are the effects; and if he should attempt to take at supper the same
						food which he was wont to partake of at dinner, it will appear insipid,
						and he will not be able to take it off; and these things, passing
						downwards with tormina and rumbling, burn up his bowels; he experiences
						insomnolency or troubled and disturbed dreams; and to many of them
						these symptoms are the commencement of some disease. 
					</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="11">
					<head>PART 11</head>
					<p>But let us inquire what are the causes of these things which happened
						to them. To him, then, who was accustomed to take only one meal in
						the day, they happened because he did not <pb id="p.8"/>wait the proper time, until
						his bowels had completely derived benefit from and had digested the
						articles taken at the preceding meal, and until his belly had become
						soft, and got into a state of rest, but he gave it a new supply while
						in a state of heat and fermentation, for such bellies digest much
						more slowly, and require more rest and ease. And as to him who had
						been accustomed to dinner, since, as soon as the body required food,
						and when the former meal was consumed, and he wanted refreshment,
						no new supply was furnished to it, he wastes and is consumed from
						want of food. For all the symptoms which I describe as befalling to
						this man I refer to want of food. And I also say that all men who,
						when in a state of health, remain for two or three days without food,
						experience the same unpleasant symptoms as those which I described
						in the case of him who had omitted to take dinner. </p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="12">    
					<head>PART 12</head>
					<p>Wherefore, I say, that such constitutions as suffer quickly and strongly
						from errors in diet, are weaker than others that do not; and that
						a weak person is in a state very nearly approaching to one in disease;
						but a person in disease is the weaker, and it is, therefore, more
						likely that he should suffer if he encounters anything that is unseasonable.
						It is difficult, seeing that there is no such accuracy in the Art,
						to hit always upon what is most expedient, and yet many cases occur
						in medicine which would require this accuracy, as we shall explain.
						But on that account, I say, we ought not to reject the ancient Art,
						as if it were not, and had not been properly founded, because it did
						not attain accuracy in all things, but rather, since it is capable
						of reaching to the greatest exactitude by reasoning, to receive it
						and admire its discoveries, made from a state of great ignorance,
						and as having been well and properly made, and not from chance.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="13">
					<head>PART 13</head>
					<p>But I wish the discourse to revert to the new method of those who
						prosecute their inquiries in the Art by hypothesis. For if hot, or
						cold, or moist, or dry, be that which proves injurious to man, and
						if the person who would treat him properly must apply cold to the
						hot, hot to the cold, moist to the dry, and dry to the moist- let
						me be presented with a man, not indeed one of a strong constitution,
						but one of the weaker, and let him eat <pb id="p.9"/>wheat, such as it is supplied
						from the thrashing-floor, raw and unprepared, with raw meat, and let
						him drink water. By using such a diet I know that he will suffer much
						and severely, for he will experience pains, his body will become weak,
						and his bowels deranged, and he will not subsist long. What remedy,
						then, is to be provided for one so situated? Hot? or cold? or moist?
						or dry? For it is clear that it must be one or other of these. For,
						according to this principle, if it is one of the which is injuring
						the patient, it is to be removed by its contrary. But the surest and
						most obvious remedy is to change the diet which the person used, and
						instead of wheat to give bread, and instead of raw flesh, boiled,
						and to drink wine in addition to these; for by making these changes
						it is impossible but that he must get better, unless completely disorganized
						by time and diet. What, then, shall we say? whether that, as he suffered
						from cold, these hot things being applied were of use to him, or the
						contrary? I should think this question must prove a puzzler to whomsoever
						it is put. For whether did he who prepared bread out of wheat remove
						the hot, the cold, the moist, or the dry principle in it?- for the
						bread is consigned both to fire and to water, and is wrought with
						many things, each of which has its peculiar property and nature, some
						of which it loses, and with others it is diluted and mixed.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="14">
					<head>PART 14</head>
					<p>And this I know, moreover, that to the human body it makes a great
						difference whether the bread be fine or coarse; of wheat with or without
						the hull, whether mixed with much or little water, strongly wrought
						or scarcely at all, baked or raw- and a multitude of similar differences;
						and so, in like manner, with the cake (maza); the powers of each,
						too, are great, and the one nowise like the other. Whoever pays no
						attention to these things, or, paying attention, does not comprehend
						them, how can he understand the diseases which befall a man? For,
						by every one of these things, a man is affected and changed this way
						or that, and the whole of his life is subjected to them, whether in
						health, convalescence, or disease. Nothing else, then, can be more
						important or more necessary to know than these things. So that the
						first inventors, pursuing their investigations properly, and by a
						suitable train of reasoning, according to the nature of <pb id="p.10"/>man, made
						their discoveries, and thought the Art worthy of being ascribed to
						a god, as is the established belief. For they did not suppose that
						the dry or the moist, the hot or the cold, or any of these are either
						injurious to man, or that man stands in need of them, but whatever
						in each was strong, and more than a match for a man's constitution,
						whatever he could not manage, that they held to be hurtful, and sought
						to remove. Now, of the sweet, the strongest is that which is intensely
						sweet; of the bitter, that which is intensely bitter; of the acid,
						that which is intensely acid; and of all things that which is extreme,
						for these things they saw both existing in man, and proving injurious
						to him. For there is in man the bitter and the salt, the sweet and
						the acid, the sour and the insipid, and a multitude of other things
						having all sorts of powers both as regards quantity and strength.
						These, when all mixed and mingled up with one another, are not apparent,
						neither do they hurt a man; but when any of them is separate, and
						stands by itself, then it becomes perceptible, and hurts a man. And
						thus, of articles of food, those which are unsuitable and hurtful
						to man when administered, every one is either bitter, or intensely
						so, or saltish or acid, or something else intense and strong, and
						therefore we are disordered by them in like manner as we are by the
						secretions in the body. But all those things which a man eats and
						drinks are devoid of any such intense and well-marked quality, such
						as bread, cake, and many other things of a similar nature which man
						is accustomed to use for food, with the exception of condiments and
						confectioneries, which are made to gratify the palate and for luxury.
						And from those things, when received into the body abundantly, there
						is no disorder nor dissolution of the powers belonging to the body;
						but strength, growth, and nourishment result from them, and this for
						no other reason than because they are well mixed, have nothing in
						them of an immoderate character, nor anything strong, but the whole
						forms one simple and not strong substance.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="15">
					<head>PART 15</head>
					<p>I cannot think in what manner they who advance this doctrine, and
						transfer Art from the cause I have described to hypothesis, will cure
						men according to the principle which they have laid down. For, as
						far as I know, neither the hot nor the <pb id="p.11"/>cold, nor the dry, nor the
						moist, has ever been found unmixed with any other quality; but I suppose
						they use the same articles of meat and drink as all we other men do.
						But to this substance they give the attribute of being hot, to that
						cold, to that dry, and to that moist. Since it would be absurd to
						advise the patient to take something hot, for he would straightway
						ask what it is? so that he must either play the fool, or have recourse
						to some one of the well known substances; and if this hot thing happen
						to be sour, and that hot thing insipid, and this hot thing has the
						power of raising a disturbance in the body (and there are many other
						kinds of heat, possessing many opposite powers), he will be obliged
						to administer some one of them, either the hot and the sour, or the
						hot and the insipid, or that which, at the same time, is cold and
						sour (for there is such a substance), or the cold and the insipid.
						For, as I think, the very opposite effects will result from either
						of these, not only in man, but also in a bladder, a vessel of wood,
						and in many other things possessed of far less sensibility than man;
						for it is not the heat which is possessed of great efficacy, but the
						sour and the insipid, and other qualities as described by me, both
						in man and out of man, and that whether eaten or drunk, rubbed in
						externally, and otherwise applied.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="16">
					<head>PART 16</head>
					<p>But I think that of all the qualities heat and cold exercise the least
						operation in the body, for these reasons: as long time as hot and
						cold are mixed up with one another they do not give trouble, for the
						cold is attempered and rendered more moderate by the hot, and the
						hot by the cold; but when the one is wholly separate from the other,
						then it gives pain; and at that season when cold is applied it creates
						some pain to a man, but quickly, for that very reason, heat spontaneously
						arises in him without requiring any aid or preparation. And these
						things operate thus both upon men in health and in disease. For example,
						if a person in health wishes to cool his body during winter, and bathes
						either in cold water or in any other way, the more he does this, unless
						his body be fairly congealed, when he resumes his clothes and comes
						into a place of shelter, his body becomes more heated than before.
						And thus, too, if a person wish to be warmed thoroughly either by
						means of a hot bath or strong fire, and straight-<pb id="p.12"/>way having the same
						clothing on, takes up his abode again in the place he was in when
						he became congealed, he will appear much colder, and more disposed
						to chills than before. And if a person fan himself on account of a
						suffocating heat, and having procured refrigeration for himself in
						this manner, cease doing so, the heat and suffocation will be ten
						times greater in his case than in that of a person who does nothing
						of the kind. And, to give a more striking example, persons travelling
						in the snow, or otherwise in rigorous weather, and contracting great
						cold in their feet, their hands, or their head, what do they not suffer
						from inflammation and tingling when they put on warm clothing and
						get into a hot place? In some instances, blisters arise as if from
						burning with fire, and they do not suffer from any of those unpleasant
						symptoms until they become heated. So readily does either of these
						pass into the other; and I could mention many other examples. And
						with regard to the sick, is it not in those who experience a rigor
						that the most acute fever is apt to break out? And yet not so strongly
						neither, but that it ceases in a short time, and, for the most part,
						without having occasioned much mischief; and while it remains, it
						is hot, and passing over the whole body, ends for the most part in
						the feet, where the chills and cold were most intense and lasted longest;
						and, when sweat supervenes, and the fever passes off, the patient
						is much colder than if he had not taken the fever at all. Why then
						should that which so quickly passes into the opposite extreme, and
						loses its own powers spontaneously, be reckoned a mighty and serious
						affair? And what necessity is there for any great remedy for it?</p>

					<p>One might here say- but persons in ardent fevers, pneumonia, and other
						formidable diseases, do not quickly get rid of the heat, nor experience
						these rapid alterations of heat and cold. And I reckon this very circumstance
						the strongest proof that it is not from heat simply that men get into
						the febrile state, neither is it the sole cause of the mischief, but
						that this species of heat is bitter, and that acid, and the other
						saltish, and many other varieties; and again there is cold combined
						with other qualities. These are what proves injurious; heat, it is
						true, is present also, possessed of strength as being that which conducts,
						is exacerbated and <pb id="p.13"/>increased along with the other, but has no power

					<p>With regard to these symptoms, in the first place those are most obvious
						of which we have all often had experience. Thus, then, in such of
						us as have a coryza and defluxion from the nostrils, this discharge
						is much more acrid than that which formerly was formed in and ran
						from them daily; and it occasions swelling of the nose, and it inflames,
						being of a hot and extremely ardent nature, as you may know, if you
						apply your hand to the place; and, if the disease remains long, the
						part becomes ulcerated although destitute of flesh and hard; and the
						heat in the nose ceases, not when the defluxion takes place and the
						inflammation is present, but when the running becomes thicker and
						less acrid, and more mixed with the former secretion, then it is that
						the heat ceases. But in all those cases in which this decidedly proceeds
						from cold alone, without the concourse of any other quality, there
						is a change from cold to hot, and from hot to cold, and these quickly
						supervene, and require no coction. But all the others being connected,
						as I have said, with acrimony and intemperance of humors, pass off
						in this way by being mixed and concocted.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="19">
					<head>PART 19</head>
					<p>But such defluxions as are determined to the eyes being possessed
						of strong and varied acrimonies, ulcerate the eyelids, and in some
						cases corrode the and parts below the eyes upon which they flow, and
						even occasion rupture and erosion of the tunic which surrounds the
						eyeball. But pain, heat, and extreme burning prevail until the defluxions
						are concocted and become thicker, and concretions form about the eyes,
						and the coction takes place from the fluids being mixed up, diluted,
						and digested together. And in defluxions upon the throat, from which
						are formed hoarseness, cynanche, crysipelas, and pneumonia, all these
						have at first saltish, watery, and acrid discharges, and with these
						the diseases gain strength. But when the discharges become thicker,
						more concocted, and are freed from all acrimony, then, indeed, the
						fevers pass away, and the other symptoms which annoyed the patient;
						for we must account those things the cause of each complaint, which,
						being present in a certain fashion, the complaint exists, but it ceases
						when they <pb id="p.14"/>change to another combination. But those which originate
						from pure heat or cold, and do not participate in any other quality,
						will then cease when they undergo a change from cold to hot, and from
						hot to cold; and they change in the manner I have described before.
						Wherefore, all the other complaints to which man is subject arise
						from powers (qualities?). Thus, when there is an overflow of the bitter
						principle, which we call yellow bile, what anxiety, burning heat,
						and loss of strength prevail! but if relieved from it, either by being
						purged spontaneously, or by means of a medicine seasonably administered,
						the patient is decidedly relieved of the pains and heat; but while
						these things float on the stomach, unconcocted and undigested, no
						contrivance could make the pains and fever cease; and when there are
						acidities of an acrid and aeruginous character, what varieties of
						frenzy, gnawing pains in the bowels and chest, and inquietude, prevail!
						and these do not cease until the acidities be purged away, or are
						calmed down and mixed with other fluids. The coction, change, attenuation,
						and thickening into the form of humors, take place through many and
						various forms; therefore the crises and calculations of time are of
						great importance in such matters; but to all such changes hot and
						cold are but little exposed, for these are neither liable to putrefaction
						nor thickening. What then shall we say of the change? that it is a
						combination (crasis) of these humors having different powers toward
						one another. But the hot does not loose its heat when mixed with any
						other thing except the cold; nor again, the cold, except when mixed
						with the hot. But all other things connected with man become the more
						mild and better in proportion as they are mixed with the more things
						besides. But a man is in the best possible state when they are concocted
						and at rest, exhibiting no one peculiar quality; but I think I have
						said enough in explanation of them.</p>

					<p>Certain sophists and physicians say that it is not possible for any
						one to know medicine who does not know what man is [and how he was
						made and how constructed], and that whoever would cure men properly,
						must learn this in the first place. But this saying rather appertains
						to philosophy, as Empedocles and certain others have described what
						man in his origin is, and how <pb id="p.15"/>he first was made and constructed. But
						I think whatever such has been said or written by sophist or physician
						concerning nature has less connection with the art of medicine than
						with the art of painting. And I think that one cannot know anything
						certain respecting nature from any other quarter than from medicine;
						and that this knowledge is to be attained when one comprehends the
						whole subject of medicine properly, but not until then; and I say
						that this history shows what man is, by what causes he was made, and
						other things accurately. Wherefore it appears to me necessary to every
						physician to be skilled in nature, and strive to know, if he would
						wish to perform his duties, what man is in relation to the articles
						of food and drink, and to his other occupations, and what are the
						effects of each of them to every one. And it is not enough to know
						simply that cheese is a bad article of food, as disagreeing with whoever
						eats of it to satiety, but what sort of disturbance it creates, and
						wherefore, and with what principle in man it disagrees; for there
						are many other articles of food and drink naturally bad which affect
						man in a different manner. Thus, to illustrate my meaning by an example,
						undiluted wine drunk in large quantity renders a man feeble; and everybody
						seeing this knows that such is the power of wine, and the cause thereof;
						and we know, moreover, on what parts of a man's body it principally
						exerts its action; and I wish the same certainty to appear in other
						cases. For cheese (since we used it as an example) does not prove
						equally injurious to all men, for there are some who can take it to
						satiety without being hurt by it in the least, but, on the contrary,
						it is wonderful what strength it imparts to those it agrees with;
						but there are some who do not bear it well, their constitutions are
						different, and they differ in this respect, that what in their body
						is incompatible with cheese, is roused and put in commotion by such
						a thing; and those in whose bodies such a humor happens to prevail
						in greater quantity and intensity, are likely to suffer the more from
						it. But if the thing had been pernicious to of man, it would have
						hurt all. Whoever knows these things will not suffer from it.</p>

						unusual food eaten, all which were better done than otherwise, attribute
						notwithstanding the cause of these disorders, to some of these things,

						And it appears to me that one ought also to know what diseases arise
						in man from the powers, and what from the structures. What do I mean
						by this? By powers, I mean intense and strong juices; and by structures,
						whatever conformations there are in man. For some are hollow, and
						from broad contracted into narrow; some expanded, some hard and round,
						some broad and suspended,<note>Meaning probably the diaphragm, with its membranes.</note> some stretched, some long, some dense, some
						rare and succulent,<note>Meaning the mammae, according to Heurnius.</note> some spongy and of loose texture.<note>Such as the spleen and lungs.</note> Now, then, which
						of these figures is the best calculated to suck to itself and attract
						humidity from another body? Whether what is hollow and expanded, or
						what is solid and round, or what is hollow, and from broad, gradually
						turning narrow? I think such as from hollow and broad are contracted
						into narrow: this may be ascertained otherwise from obvious facts:
						thus, if you gape wide with the mouth you cannot draw in any liquid;
						but by protruding, contracting, and compressing the lips, and still
						more by using a tube, you can readily draw in whatever you wish. And
						thus, too, the instruments which are used for cupping are broad below
						and gradually become narrow, and are so con-<pb id="p.17"/>structed in order to suck
						and draw in from the fleshy parts. The nature and construction of
						the parts within a man are of a like nature; the bladder, the head,
						the uterus in woman; these parts clearly attract, and are always filled
						with a juice which is foreign to them. Those parts which are hollow
						and expanded are most likely to receive any humidity flowing into
						them, but cannot attract it in like manner. Those parts which are
						solid and round could not attract a humidity, nor receive it when
						it flows to them, for it would glide past, and find no place of rest
						on them. But spongy and rare parts, such as the spleen, the lungs,
						and the breasts, drink up especially the juices around them, and become
						hardened and enlarged by the accession of juices. Such things happen
						to these organs especially. For it is not with the spleen as with
						the stomach, in which there is a liquid, which it contains and evacuates
						every day; but when it (the spleen) drinks up and receives a fluid
						into itself, the hollow and lax parts of it are filled, even the small
						interstices; and, instead of being rare and soft, it becomes hard
						and dense, and it can neither digest nor discharge its contents: these
						things it suffers, owing to the nature of its structure. Those things
						which engender flatulence or tormina in the body, naturally do so
						in the hollow and broad parts of the body, such as the stomach and
						chest, where they produce rumbling noises; for when they do not fill
						the parts so as to be stationary, but have changes of place and movements,
						there must necessarily be noise and apparent movements from them.
						But such parts as are fleshy and soft, in these there occur torpor
						and obstructions, such as happen in apoplexy. But when it (the flatus?)
						encounters a broad and resisting structure, and rushes against such
						a part, and this happens when it is by nature not strong so as to
						be able to withstand it without suffering injury; nor soft and rare,
						so as to receive or yield to it, but tender, juicy, full of blood,
						and dense, like the liver, owing to its density and broadness, it
						resists and does not yield. But flatus, when it obtains admission,
						increases and becomes stronger, and rushes toward any resisting object;
						but owing to its tenderness, and the quantity of blood which it (the
						liver) contains, it cannot be without uneasiness; and for these reasons
						the most acute and frequent pains <pb id="p.18"/> occur in the region of it, along
						with suppurations and chronic tumors (phymata). These symptoms also
						occur in the site of the diaphragm, but much less frequently; for
						the diaphragm is a broad, expanded, and resisting substance, of a
						nervous (tendinous?) and strong nature, and therefore less susceptible
						of pain; and yet pains and chronic abscesses do occur about it.</p>

						And, as has been formerly stated, one ought to be acquainted with

						is the most improper of all things that can be administered in cases

					<p>Whoever wishes to investigate medicine properly, should proceed thus:
						in the first place to consider the seasons of the year, and what effects
						each of them produces (for they are not at all alike, but differ much
						from themselves in regard to their changes).<note>The part in parenthesis is rather obscure.  In the old French translation it is rendered thus: "Elles sont tres differentes entre elles par leur nature, et il arrive d'ailleurs une infinite de changemens qui sont tous divers."  On these changes, see Aphor. iii., 2-15.</note> Then the winds, the hot
						and the cold, especially such as are common to all countries, and
						then such as are peculiar to each locality. We must also consider
						the qualities of the waters, for as they differ from one another in
						taste and weight, so also do they differ much in their qualities.
						In the same manner, when one comes into a city to which he is a stranger,
						he ought to consider its situation, how it lies as to the winds and
						the rising of the sun; for its influence is not the same whether it
						lies to the north or the south, to the rising or to the setting sun.
						These things one ought to consider most attentively, and concerning
						the waters which the inhabitants use, whether they be marshy and soft,
						or hard, and running from elevated and rocky situations, and then
						if saltish and unfit for cooking; and the ground, whether it be naked
						and deficient in water, or wooded and well watered, and whether it
						lies in a hollow, confined situation, or is elevated and cold; and
						the mode in which the inhabitants live, and what are their pursuits,
						whether they are fond of drinking and eating to excess, and given
						to indolence, or are fond of exercise and labor, and not given to
						excess in eating and drinking.<pb id="p.20"/>

					<p>
						From these things he must proceed to investigate everything else.
						For if one knows all these things well, or at least the greater part
						of them, he cannot miss knowing, when he comes into a strange city,
						either the diseases peculiar to the place, or the particular nature
						of common diseases, so that he will not be in doubt as to the treatment
						of the diseases, or commit mistakes, as is likely to be the case provided
						one had not previously considered these matters. And in particular,
						as the season and the year advances, he can tell what epidemic diseases
						will attack the city, either in summer or in winter, and what each
						individual will be in danger of experiencing from the change of regimen.
						For knowing the changes of the seasons, the risings and settings of
						the stars, how each of them takes place, he will be able to know beforehand
						what sort of a year is going to ensue. Having made these investigations,
						and knowing beforehand the seasons, such a one must be acquainted
						with each particular, and must succeed in the preservation of health,
						and be by no means unsuccessful in the practice of his art. And if
						it shall be thought that these things belong rather to meteorology,
						it will be admitted, on second thoughts, that astronomy contributes
						not a little, but a very great deal, indeed, to medicine. For with
						the seasons the digestive organs of men undergo a change.</p>

					<p>
						But how of the aforementioned things should be investigated and explained,
						I will now declare in a clear manner. A city that is exposed to hot
						winds (these are between the wintry rising, and the wintry setting
						of the sun), and to which these are peculiar, but which is sheltered
						from the north winds; in such a city the waters will be plenteous
						and saltish, and as they run from an elevated source, they are necessarily
						hot in summer, and cold in winter; the heads of the inhabitants are
						of a humid and pituitous constitution, and their bellies subject to
						frequent disorders, owing to the phlegm running down from the head;
						the forms of their bodies, for the most part, are rather flabby; they
						do not eat nor drink much; drinking wine in particular, and more especially
						if carried to intoxication, is oppressive to them; and the following
						diseases are peculiar to the district: in the first place, the women
						are sickly and subject to excessive menstrua- <pb id="p.21"/>tion; then many are unfruitful
						from disease, and not from nature, and they have frequent miscarriages;
						infants are subject to attacks of convulsions and asthma, which they
						consider to be connected with infancy, and hold to be a sacred disease
						(epilepsy). The men are subject to attacks of dysentery, diarrhea,
						hepialus,<note>The Hepialus is a species of intermittent fever, very common in warm climates.  It would appear to be a variety of the quotidian.  See PAULUS AEGINETA, Vol. I., 252, Syd. Soc. edition.</note> chronic fevers in winter, of epinyctis,<note>Frequent mention of this disease of the skin occurs in the works of the ancient writers on medicine.</note> frequently, and
						of hemorrhoids about the anus. Pleurisies, peripneumonies, ardent
						fevers, and whatever diseases are reckoned acute, do not often occur,
						for such diseases are not apt to prevail where the bowels are loose.
						Ophthalmies occur of a humid character, but not of a serious nature,
						and of short duration, unless they attack epidemically from the change
						of the seasons. And when they pass their fiftieth year, defluxions
						supervening from the brain, render them paralytic when exposed suddenly
						to strokes of the sun, or to cold. These diseases are endemic to them,
						and, moreover, if any epidemic disease connected with the change of
						the seasons, prevail, they are also liable to it. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4">
					<head>PART 4</head>
					<p>
						But the following is the condition of cities which have the opposite
						exposure, namely, to cold winds, between the summer settings and the
						summer risings of the sun, and to which these winds are peculiar,
						and which are sheltered from the south and the hot breezes. In the
						first place the waters are, for the most part, hard cold. The men
						must necessarily be well braced and slender, and they must have the
						discharges downwards of the alimentary canal hard, and of difficult
						evacuation, while those upwards are more fluid, and rather bilious
						than pituitous. Their heads are sound and hard, and they are liable
						to burstings (of vessels?) for the most part. The diseases which prevail
						epidemically with them, are pleurisies, and those which are called
						acute diseases. This must be the case when the bowels are bound; and
						from any causes, many become affected with suppurations in the lungs,
						the cause of which is the tension of the body, and hardness of the
						bowels; for their dryness and the <pb id="p.22"/>coldness of the water dispose them
						to ruptures (of vessels?). Such constitutions must be given to excess
						of eating, but not of drinking; for it is not possible to be gourmands
						and drunkards at the same time. Ophthalmies, too, at length supervene;
						these being of a hard and violent nature, and soon ending in rupture
						of the eyes; persons under thirty years of age are liable to severe
						bleedings at the nose in summer; attacks of epilepsy are rare but
						severe. Such people are likely to be rather long-lived; their ulcers
						are not attended with serious discharges, nor of a malignant character;
						in disposition they are rather ferocious than gentle. The diseases
						I have mentioned are peculiar to the men, and besides they are liable
						to any common complaint which may be prevailing from the changes of
						the seasons. But the women, in the first place, are of a hard constitution,
						from the waters being hard, indigestible, and cold; and their menstrual
						discharges are not regular, but in small quantity, and painful. Then
						they have difficult parturition, but are not very subject to abortions.
						And when they do bring forth children, they are unable to nurse them;
						for the hardness and indigestable nature of the water puts away their
						milk. Phthisis frequently supervenes after childbirth, for the efforts
						of it frequently bring on ruptures and strains. Children while still
						little are subject to dropsies in the testicle, which disappear as
						they grow older; in such a town they are late in attaining manhood.
						It is, as I have now stated, with regard to hot and cold winds and
						cities thus exposed. </p>

						Cities that are exposed to winds between the summer and the winter
						risings of the sun, and those the opposite to them, have the following
						characters:- Those which lie to the rising of the sun are all likely
						to be more healthy than such as are turned to the North, or those
						exposed to the hot winds, even if there should not be a furlong between
						them. In the first place, both the heat and cold are more moderate.
						Then such waters as flow to the rising sun, must necessarily be clear,
						fragrant, soft, and delightful to drink, in such a city. For the sun
						in rising and shining upon them purifies them, by dispelling the vapors
						which generally prevail in the morning. The persons of the inhabitants
						are, for the most part, well colored and blooming, unless some <pb id="p.23"/>disease
						counteract. The inhabitants have clear voices, and in temper and intellect
						are superior to those which are exposed to the north, and all the
						productions of the country in like manner are better. A city so situated
						resembles the spring as to moderation between heat and cold, and the
						diseases are few in number, and of a feeble kind, and bear a resemblance
						to the diseases which prevail in regions exposed to hot winds. The
						women there are very prolific, and have easy deliveries. Thus it is

						But such cities as lie to the west, and which are sheltered from winds
						blowing from the east, and which the hot winds and the cold winds
						of the north scarcely touch, must necessarily be in a very unhealthy
						situation: in the first place the waters are not clear, the cause
						of which is, because the mist prevails commonly in the morning, and
						it is mixed up with the water and destroys its clearness, for the
						sun does not shine upon the water until he be considerably raised
						above the horizon. And in summer, cold breezes from the east blow
						and dews fall; and in the latter part of the day the setting sun particularly
						scorches the inhabitants, and therefore they are pale and enfeebled,
						and are partly subject to all the aforesaid diseases, but no one is
						peculiar to them. Their voices are rough and hoarse owing to the state
						of the air, which in such a situation is generally impure and unwholesome,
						for they have not the northern winds to purify it; and these winds
						they have are of a very humid character, such being the nature of
						the evening breezes. Such a situation of a city bears a great resemblance
						to autumn as regards the changes of the day, inasmuch as the difference
						between morning and evening is great. So it is with regard to the
						winds that are conducive to health, or the contrary. </p>

						And I wish to give an account of the other kinds of waters, namely,
						of such as are wholesome and such as are unwholesome, and what bad
						and what good effects may be derived from water; for water contributes
						much towards health. Such waters then as are marshy, stagnant, and
						belong to lakes, are necessarily hot in summer, thick, and have a
						strong smell, since they have no current; but being constantly supplied
						by rain-water, and the <pb id="p.24"/>sun heating them, they necessarily want their
						proper color, are unwholesome and form bile; in winter, they become
						congealed, cold, and muddy with the snow and ice, so that they are
						most apt to engender phlegm, and bring on hoarseness; those who drink
						them have large and obstructed spleens, their bellies are hard, emaciated,
						and hot; and their shoulders, collar-bones, and faces are emaciated;
						for their flesh is melted down and taken up by the spleen, and hence
						they are slender; such persons then are voracious and thirsty; their
						bellies are very dry both above and below, so that they require the
						strongest medicines.<note>It can scarcely admit of a doubt that our author here alludes to scurvy.</note> This disease is habitual to them both in summer
						and in winter, and in addition they are very subject to dropsies of
						a most fatal character; and in summer dysenteries, diarrheas, and
						protracted quartan fevers frequently seize them, and these diseases
						when prolonged dispose such constitutions to dropsies, and thus prove
						fatal. These are the diseases which attack them in summer; but in
						winter younger persons are liable to pneumonia, and maniacal affections;
						and older persons to ardent fevers, from hardness of the belly. Women
						are subject to oedema and leucophlegmasiae;<note>The leucophlegmasia is treated of in different parts of the Hippocratic treatises, as Aphor. vii., 29; de Morb. ii.  By it he evidently meant a species of dropsy.</note> when pregnant they have

						during nursing they become wasted and sickly, and the lochial discharge
						after parturition does not proceed properly with the women. The children
						are particularly subject to hernia, and adults to varices and ulcers
						on their legs, so that persons with such constitutions cannot be long-lived,
						but before the usual period they fall into a state of premature old
						age. And further, the women appear to be with child, and when the
						time of parturition arrives, the fulness of the belly disappears,
						and this happens from dropsy of the uterus. Such waters then I reckon
						bad for every purpose. The next to them in badness are those which
						have their fountains in rocks, so that they must necessarily be hard,
						or come from a soil which produces thermal waters, such as those having
						iron, <pb id="p.25"/> copper, silver, gold, sulphur, alum, bitumen, or nitre (soda)
						in them; for all these are formed by the force of heat. Good waters
						cannot proceed from such a soil, but those that are hard and of a
						heating nature, difficult to pass by urine, and of difficult evacuation
						by the bowels. The best are those which flow from elevated grounds,
						and hills of earth; these are sweet, clear, and can bear a little
						wine; they are hot in summer and cold in winter, for such necessarily
						must be the waters from deep wells. But those are most to be commended
						which run to the rising of the sun, and especially to the summer sun;
						for such are necessarily more clear, fragrant, and light. But all
						such as are salty, crude, and harsh, are not good for drink. But there
						are certain constitutions and diseases with which such waters agree
						when drunk, as I will explain presently. Their characters are as follows:
						the best are such as have their fountains to the east; the next, those
						between the summer risings and settings of the sun, and especially
						those to the risings; and third, those between the summer and winter
						settings; but the worst are those to the south, and the parts between
						the winter rising and setting, and those to the south are very bad,
						but those to the north are better. They are to be used as follows:
						whoever is in good health and strength need not mind, but may always
						drink whatever is at hand. But whoever wishes to drink the most suitable
						for any disease, may accomplish his purpose by attending to the following
						directions: To persons whose bellies are hard and easily burnt up,
						the sweetest, the lightest, and the most limpid waters will be proper;
						but those persons whose bellies are soft, loose, and pituitous, should
						choose the hardest, those kinds that are most crude, and the saltiest,
						for thus will they be most readily dried up; for such waters as are
						adapted for boiling, and are of a very solvent nature, naturally loosen
						readily and melt down the bowels; but such as are intractable, hard,
						and by no means proper for boiling, these rather bind and dry up the
						bowels. People have deceived themselves with regard to salt waters,
						from inexperience, for they think these waters purgative, whereas
						they are the very reverse; for such waters are crude, and ill adapted <pb id="p.26"/> for boiling, so that the belly is more likely to be bound up than
						loosened by them. And thus it is with regard to the waters of springs.</p>

						I will now tell how it is with respect to rain-water, and water from
						snow. Rain waters, then, are the lightest, the sweetest, the thinnest,
						and the clearest; for originally the sun raises and attracts the thinnest
						and lightest part of the water, as is obvious from the nature of salts;
						for the saltish part is left behind owing to its thickness and weight,
						and forms salts; but the sun attracts the thinnest part, owing to
						its lightness, and he abstracts this not only from the lakes, but
						also from the sea, and from all things which contain humidity, and
						there is humidity in everything; and from man himself the sun draws
						off the thinnest and lightest part of the juices. As a strong proof
						of this, when a man walks in the sun, or sits down having a garment
						on, whatever parts of the body the sun shines upon do not sweat, for
						the sun carries off whatever sweat makes its appearance; but those
						parts which are covered by the garment, or anything else, sweat, for
						the particles of sweat are drawn and forced out by the sun, and are
						preserved by the cover so as not to be dissipated by the sun; but
						when the person comes into the shade the whole body equally perspires,
						because the sun no longer shines upon it. Wherefore, of all kinds
						of water, these spoil the soonest; and rain water has a bad spot smell,
						because its particles are collected and mixed together from most objects,
						so as to spoil the soonest. And in addition to this, when attracted
						and raised up, being carried about and mixed with the air, whatever
						part of it is turbid and darkish is separated and removed from the
						other, and becomes cloud and mist, but the most attenuated and lightest
						part is left, and becomes sweet, being heated and concocted by the
						sun, for all other things when concocted become sweet. While dissipated
						then and not in a state of consistence it is carried aloft. But when
						collected and condensed by contrary winds, it falls down wherever
						it happens to be most condensed. For this is likely to happen when
						the clouds being carried along and moving with a wind which does not
						allow them to rest, suddenly encounters another wind and <pb id="p.27"/>other clouds
						from the opposite direction: there it is first condensed, and what
						is behind is carried up to the spot, and thus it thickens, blackens,
						and is conglomerated, and by its weight it falls down and becomes
						rain. Such, to all appearance, are the best of waters, but they require
						to be boiled and strained; for otherwise they have a bad smell, and
						occasion hoarseness and thickness of the voice to those who drink
						them. Those from snow and ice are all bad, for when once congealed,
						they never again recover their former nature; for whatever is clear,
						light, and sweet in them, is separated and disappears; but the most
						turbid and weightiest part is left behind. You may ascertain this
						in the following manner: If in winter you will pour water by measure
						into a vessel and expose it to the open air until it is all frozen,
						and then on the following day bring it into a warm situation where
						the ice will thaw, if you will measure the water again when dissolved
						you will find it much less in quantity. This is a proof that the lightest
						and thinnest part is dissipated and dried up by the congelation, and
						not the heaviest and thickest, for that is impossible: wherefore I
						hold that waters from snow and ice, and those allied to them, are
						the worst of any for all purposes whatever. Such are the characters
						of rain-water, and those from ice and snow. </p>

						Men<note>This is a most interesting chapter, as containing the most ancient observations which we possess on the important subject of urinary calculi.  The ancients never improved the theory, nor added much to the facts which are here stated by our author.  We have given the summary of their opinions in the Commentary on PAULUS AEGINETA, B. III., 45. I would beg leave to remark that, notwithstanding the number of curious facts which modern chemistry has evolved regarding the composition of urinary calculi, the etiology of the disease is nearly as obscure now as it was in the days of Hippocrates.</note> become affected with the stone, and are seized with diseases of
						the kidneys, strangury, sciatica, and become ruptured, when they drink
						all sorts of waters, and those from great rivers into which other
						rivulets run, or from a lake into which many streams of all sorts
						flow, and such as are brought from a considerable distance. For it
						is impossible that such waters can resemble one another, but one kind
						is sweet, another saltish and aluminous, and some flow from thermal
						springs; and these being all mixed up together disagree, and the strongest
						part always <pb id="p.28"/>prevails; but the same kind is not always the strongest,
						but sometimes one and sometimes another, according to the winds, for
						the north wind imparts strength to this water, and the south to that,
						and so also with regard to the others. There must be deposits of mud
						and sand in the vessels from such waters, and the aforesaid diseases
						must be engendered by them when drunk, but why not to all I will now
						explain. When the bowels are loose and in a healthy state,<note>Coray remarks that Prosper Martian, in his commentary on this passage, confirms the truth of the observation here made, that persons affected with calculus have the bowels consipated.</note> and when
						the bladder is not hot, nor the neck of the bladder very contracted,
						all such persons pass water freely, and no concretion forms in the
						bladder; but those in whom the belly is hot, the bladder must be in
						the same condition; and when preternaturally heated, its neck becomes
						inflamed; and when these things happen, the bladder does not expel
						the urine, but raises its heat excessively. And the thinnest part
						of it is secreted, and the purest part is passed off in the form of
						urine, but the thickest and most turbid part is condensed and concreted,
						at first in small quantity, but afterwards in greater; for being rolled
						about in the urine, whatever is of a thick consistence it assimilates
						to itself, and thus it increases and becomes indurated. And when such
						persons make water, the stone forced down by the urine falls into
						the neck of the bladder and stops the urine, and occasions intense
						pain; so that calculous children rub their privy parts and tear at
						them, as supposing that the obstruction to the urine is situated there.
						As a proof that it is as I say, persons affected with calculus have
						very limpid urine, because the thickest and foulest part remains and
						is concreted. Thus it generally is in cases of calculus. It forms
						also in children from milk, when it is not wholesome, but very hot
						and bilious, for it heats the bowels and bladder, so that the urine
						being also heated undergoes the same change. And I hold that it is
						better to give children only the most diluted wine, for such will
						least burn up and dry the veins. Calculi do not form so readily in
						women, for in them the urethra is short and wide, so that in them
						the urine is easily expelled; neither do they rub the pudendum with
						their hands, nor handle <pb id="p.29"/> the passage like males; for the urethra in
						women opens direct into the pudendum, which is not the case with men,
						neither in them is the urethra so wide, and they drink more than children
						do. Thus, or nearly so, is it with regard to them. </p>

						And respecting the seasons, one may judge whether the year will prove
						sickly or healthy from the following observations:<note>Coray makes the following remarks on the natural characters of the seasons in Greece.  The natural temperature of the winter in Greece was cold and humid; thus a dry and northerly winter was reckoned an unnatural season.  Spring was reckoned unnatural when the heat and rain were excessive.</note>- If the appearances
						connected with the rising and setting stars be as they should be;
						if there be rains in autumn; if the winter be mild, neither very tepid
						nor unseasonably cold, and if in spring the rains be seasonable, and
						so also in summer, the year is likely to prove healthy. But if the
						winter be dry and northerly, and the spring showery and southerly,
						the summer will necessarily be of a febrile character, and give rise
						to ophthalmies and dysenteries. For when suffocating heat sets in
						all of a sudden, while the earth is moistened by the vernal showers,
						and by the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the earth,
						which is thus soaked by rain and heated by a burning sun, while, at
						the same time, men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor the
						brain properly dried; for it is impossible, after such a spring, but
						that the body and its flesh must be loaded with humors, so that very
						acute fevers will attack all, but especially those of a phlegmatic
						constitution. Dysenteries are also likely to occur to women and those
						of a very humid temperament. And if at the rising of the Dogstar rain
						and wintery storms supervene, and if the etesian winds blow, there
						is reason to hope that these diseases will cease, and that the autumn
						will be healthy; but if not, it is likely to be a fatal season to
						children and women, but least of all to old men; and that convalescents
						will pass into quartans, and from quartans into dropsies; but if the
						winter be southerly, showery and mild, but the spring northerly, dry,
						and of a wintry character, in the first place women who happen to
						be with child, and whose accouchement should take place in spring,
						are apt to miscarry; and such as bring forth, have feeble and sickly
						children, so that they either die presently or are <pb id="p.30"/>tender, feeble,
						and sickly, if they live. Such is the case with the women. The others
						are subject to dysenteries and dry ophthalmies, and some have catarrhs
						beginning in the head and descending to the lungs. Men of a phlegmatic
						temperament are likely to have dysenteries; and women, also, from
						the humidity of their nature, the phlegm descending downwards from
						the brain; those who are bilious, too, have dry ophthalmies from the
						heat and dryness of their flesh; the aged, too, have catarrhs from
						their flabbiness and melting of the veins, so that some of them die
						suddenly and some become paralytic on the right side or the left.
						For when, the winter being southerly and the body hot, the blood and
						veins are not properly constringed; a spring that is northerly, dry,
						and cold, having come on, the brain when it should have been expanded
						and purged, by the coryza and hoarseness is then constringed and contracted,
						so that the summer and the heat occurring suddenly, and a change supervening,
						these diseases fall out. And such cities as lie well to the sun and
						winds, and use good waters, feel these changes less, but such as use
						marshy and pooly waters, and lie well both as regards the winds and
						the sun, these all feel it more. And if the summer be dry, those diseases
						soon cease, but if rainy, they are protracted; and there is danger
						of any sore that there is becoming phagedenic from any cause; and
						lienteries and dropsies supervene at the conclusion of diseases; for
						the bowels are not readily dried up. And if the summer be rainy and
						southerly, and next the autumn, the winter must, of necessity, be
						sickly, and ardent fevers are likely to attack those that are phlegmatic,
						and more elderly than forty years, and pleurisies and peripneumonies
						those that are bilious. But if the summer is parched and northerly,
						but the autumn rainy and southerly, headache and sphacelus of the
						brain are likely to occur; and in addition hoarseness, coryza, coughs,
						and in some cases, consumption. But if the season is northerly and
						without water, there being no rain, neither after the Dogstar nor
						Arcturus; this state agrees best with those who are naturally phlegmatic,
						with those who are of a humid temperament, and with women; but it
						is most inimical to the bilious; for they become much parched up,
						and ophthalmies of a dry nature supervene, fevers both acute and chronic, <pb id="p.31"/>
						and in some cases melancholy; for the most humid and watery part of
						the bile being consumed, the thickest and most acrid portion is left,
						and of the blood likewise, when these diseases came upon them. But
						all these are beneficial to the phlegmatic, for they are thereby dried
						up, and reach winter not oppressed with humors, but with them dried
						up. </p>

						Whoever studies and observes these things may be able to foresee most

						I wish to show, respecting Asia and Europe, how, in all respects,
						they differ from one another, and concerning the figure of the inhabitants,
						for they are different, and do not at all resemble one another. To
						treat of all would be a long story, but I will tell you how I think
						it is with regard to the greatest and most marked differences. I say,
						then, that Asia differs very much from Europe as to the nature of
						all things, both with regard to the productions of the earth and the
						inhabitants, for everything is produced much more beautiful and large
						in Asia; the country is milder, and the dispositions of the inhabitants
						also are more gentle and affectionate. The cause of this is the temperature
						of the seasons, because it lies in the middle of the risings of the
						sun towards the east, and removed from the cold (and heat), for nothing
						tends to growth and mildness so much as when the climate has no predominant
						quality, but a general equality of temperature prevails. It is not
						everywhere the same with regard to Asia, but such parts of the country
						as lie intermediate between the heat and the cold, are the best supplied
						with <pb id="p.32"/>fruits and trees, and have the most genial climate, and enjoy
						the purest waters, both celestial and terrestrial. For neither are
						they much burnt up by the heat, nor dried up by the drought and want
						of rain, nor do they suffer from the cold; since they are well watered
						from abundant showers and snow, and the fruits of the season, as might
						be supposed, grow in abundance, both such as are raised from seed
						that has been sown, and such plants as the earth produces of its own
						accord, the fruits of which the inhabitants make use of, training
						them from their wild state and transplanting them to a suitable soil;
						the cattle also which are reared there are vigorous, particularly
						prolific, and bring up young of the fairest description; the inhabitants
						too, are well fed, most beautiful in shape, of large stature, and
						differ little from one another either as to figure or size; and the
						country itself, both as regards its constitution and mildness of the
						seasons, may be said to bear a close resemblance to the spring. Manly
						courage, endurance of suffering, laborious enterprise, and high spirit,
						could not be produced in such a state of things either among the native
						inhabitants or those of a different country, for there pleasure necessarily
						reigns. For this reason, also, the forms of wild beasts there are
						much varied. Thus it is, as I think, with the Egyptians and Libyans.</p>

					<p>
						But concerning those on the right hand of the summer risings of the
						sun as far as the Palus Maeotis (for this is the boundary of Europe
						and Asia), it is with them as follows: the inhabitants there differ
						far more from one another than those I have treated of above, owing
						to the differences of the seasons and the nature of the soil. But
						with regard to the country itself, matters are the same there as among
						all other men; for where the seasons undergo the greatest and most
						rapid changes, there the country is the wildest and most unequal;
						and you will find the greatest variety of mountains, forests, plains,
						and meadows; but where the seasons do not change much there the country
						is the most even; and, if one will consider it, so is it also with
						regard to the inhabitants; for the nature of some is like to a country
						covered with trees and well watered; of some, to a thin soil deficient
						in water; of others, to fenny and marshy places; and of <pb id="p.33"/>some again,
						to a plain of bare and parched land. For the seasons which modify
						their natural frame of body are varied, and the greater the varieties
						of them the greater also will be the differences of their shapes.</p>

						I will pass over the smaller differences among the nations, but will
						now treat of such as are great either from nature, or custom; and,
						first, concerning the Macrocephali. There is no other race of men
						which have heads in the least resembling theirs. At first, usage was
						the principal cause of the length of their head, but now nature cooperates
						with usage. They think those the most noble who have the longest heads.
						It is thus with regard to the usage: immediately after the child is
						born, and while its head is still tender, they fashion it with their
						hands, and constrain it to assume a lengthened shape by applying bandages
						and other suitable contrivances whereby the spherical form of the
						head is destroyed, and it is made to increase in length. Thus, at
						first, usage operated, so that this constitution was the result of
						force: but, in the course of time, it was formed naturally; so that
						usage had nothing to do with it; for the semen comes from all parts
						of the body, sound from the sound parts, and unhealthy from the unhealthy
						parts. If, then, children with bald heads are born to parents with
						bald heads; and children with blue eves to parents who have blue eyes;
						and if the children of parents having distorted eyes squint also for
						the most part; and if the same may be said of other forms of the body,
						what is to prevent it from happening that a child with a long head
						should be produced by a parent having a long head? But now these things
						do not happen as they did formerly, for the custom no longer prevails
						owing to their intercourse with other men. Thus it appears to me to
						be with regard to them.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="15">

					<p>
						As to the inhabitants of Phasis, their country is fenny, warm, humid,
						and wooded; copious and severe rains occur there at all seasons; and
						the life of the inhabitants is spent among the fens; for their dwellings
						are constructed of wood and reeds, and are erected amidst the waters;
						they seldom practice walking either to the city or the market, but
						sail about, up and down, in canoes constructed out of single trees,
						for there are many canals <pb id="p.34"/>there. They drink the hot and stagnant waters,
						both when rendered putrid by the sun, and when swollen with rains.
						The Phasis itself is the most stagnant of all rivers, and runs the
						smoothest; all the fruits which spring there are unwholesome, feeble
						and imperfect growth, owing to the redundance of water, and on this
						account they do not ripen, for much vapor from the waters overspreads
						the country. For these reasons the Phasians have shapes different
						from those of all other men; for they are large in stature, and of
						a very gross habit of body, so that not a joint nor vein is visible;
						in color they are sallow, as if affected with jaundice. Of all men
						they have the roughest voices, from their breathing an atmosphere
						which is not clear, but misty and humid; they are naturally rather
						languid in supporting bodily fatigue. The seasons undergo but little
						change either as to heat or cold; their winds for the most part are
						southerly, with the exception of one peculiar to the country, which
						sometimes blows strong, is violent and hot, and is called by them
						the wind cenchron. The north wind scarcely reaches them, and when
						it does blow it is weak and gentle. Thus it is with regard to the
						different nature and shape of the inhabitants of Asia and Europe.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="16">
					<head>PART 16</head>
					<p>
						And with regard to the pusillanimity and cowardice of the inhabitants,
						the principal reason the Asiatics are more unwarlike and of gentler
						disposition than the Europeans is, the nature of the seasons, which
						do not undergo any great changes either to heat or cold, or the like;
						for there is neither excitement of the understanding nor any strong
						change of the body whereby the temper might be ruffled and they be
						roused to inconsiderate emotion and passion, rather than living as
						they do always in the state. It is changes of all kinds which arouse
						understanding of mankind, and do not allow them to get into a torpid
						condition. For these reasons, it appears to me, the Asiatic race is
						feeble, and further, owing to their laws; for monarchy prevails in
						the greater part of Asia, and where men are not their own masters
						nor independent, but are the slaves of others, it is not a matter
						of consideration with them how they may acquire military discipline,
						but how they may seem not to be warlike, for the dangers are not equally
						shared, since they must serve as soldiers,<pb id="p.35"/> perhaps endure fatigue,
						and die for their masters, far from their children, their wives, and
						other friends; and whatever noble and manly actions they may perform
						lead only to the aggrandizement of their masters, whilst the fruits
						which they reap are dangers and death; and, in addition to all this,
						the lands of such persons must be laid waste by the enemy and want
						of culture. Thus, then, if any one be naturally warlike and courageous,
						his disposition will be changed by the institutions. As a strong proof
						of all this, such Greeks or barbarians in Asia as are not under a
						despotic form of government, but are independent, and enjoy the fruits
						of their own labors, are of all others the most warlike; for these
						encounter dangers on their own account, bear the prizes of their own
						valor, and in like manner endure the punishment of their own cowardice.
						And you will find the Asiatics differing from one another, for some
						are better and others more dastardly; of these differences, as I stated
						before, the changes of the seasons are the cause. Thus it is with
						Asia. </p>

						In Europe there is a Scythian race, called Sauromatae, which inhabits

						javelin from their horses, and fight with their enemies as long as
						they are virgins; and they do not lay aside their virginity until
						they kill three of their enemies, nor have any connection with men
						until they perform the sacrifices according to law. Whoever takes
						to herself a husband, gives up riding on horseback unless the necessity

						well watered; for the rivers which carry off the water from the plains
						are large. There live <pb id="p.36"/>those Scythians which are called Nomades, because
						they have no houses, but live in wagons. The smallest of these wagons
						have four wheels, but some have six; they are covered in with felt,

						a single apartment, and some three; they are proof against rain, snow,
						and winds. The wagons are drawn by yokes of oxen, some of two and
						others of three, and all without horns, for they have no horns, owing
						to the cold. In these wagons the women live, but the men are carried
						about on horses, and the sheep, oxen, and horses accompany them; and
						they remain on any spot as long as there is provender for their cattle,
						and when that fails they migrate to some other place. They eat boiled

						In respect of the seasons and figure of body, the Scythian race, like
						the Egyptian, have a uniformity of resemblance, different from all
						other nations; they are by no means prolific, and the wild beasts
						which are indigenous there are small in size and few in number, for
						the country lies under the Northern Bears, and the Rhiphaean mountains,
						whence the north wind blows; the sun comes very near to them only
						when in the summer solstice, and warms them but for a short period,
						and not strongly; and the winds blowing from the hot regions of the
						earth do not reach them, or but seldom, and with little force; but
						the winds from the north always blow, congealed, as they are, by the
						snow, ice, and much water, for these never leave the mountains, which
						are thereby rendered uninhabitable. A thick fog covers the plains
						during the day, and amidst it they live, so that winter may be said
						to be always present with them; or, if they have summer, it is only
						for a few days, and the heat is not very strong. Their plains are
						high-lying and naked, not crowned with mountains, but extending upwards
						under the Northern Bears. The wild beasts there are not large, but
						such as can be sheltered underground; for the cold of winter and the
						barrenness of the country prevent their growth, and because they have
						no covert nor shelter. The changes of the seasons, too, are not great
						nor violent, for, in <pb id="p.37"/> fact, they change gradually; and therefore their
						figures resemble one another, as they all equally use the same food,
						and the same clothing summer and winter, respiring a humid and dense

						make any laborious exertions, for neither body nor mind is capable

						For these reasons their shapes are gross and fleshy, with ill-marked
						joints, of a humid temperament, and deficient in tone: the internal
						cavities, and especially those of the intestines, are full of humors;
						for the belly cannot possibly be dry in such a country, with such
						a constitution and in such a climate; but owing to their fat, and
						the absence of hairs from their bodies, their shapes resemble one

						I Will give you a strong proof of the humidity (laxity?) of their
						constitutions. You will find the greater part of the Scythians, and
						all the Nomades, with marks of the cautery on their shoulders, arms,
						wrists, breasts, hip-joints, and loins, and that for no other reason
						but the humidity and flabbiness of their constitution, for they can
						neither strain with their bows, nor launch the javelin from their
						shoulder owing to their humidity and atony: but when they are burnt,
						much of the humidity in their joints is dried up, and they become
						better braced, better fed, and their joints get into a more suitable
						condition. They are flabby and squat at first, because, as in Egypt,
						they are not swathed (?); and then they pay no attention to horsemanship,
						so that they may be adepts at it; and because of their sedentary mode
						of life; for the males, when they cannot be carried about on horseback,
						sit the most of their time in the wagon, and rarely practise walking,
						because of their frequent migrations and shiftings of situation; and
						as to the women, it is amazing how flabby and sluggish they are. The
						Scythian race are tawny from the cold, and not from the intense heat
						of the sun, for the whiteness of the skin is parched by the cold,
						and becomes tawny.</p>

						It is impossible that persons of such a constitution could be prolific,
						for, with the man, the sexual desires are not strong, owing to the
						laxity of his constitution, the softness and coldness of his belly,
						from all which causes it is little likely that a man should be given
						to venery; and besides, from being jaded by exercise on horseback,
						the men become weak in their desires. On the part of the men these
						are the causes; but on that of the women, they are embonpoint and
						humidity; for the womb cannot take in the semen, nor is the menstrual
						discharge such as it should be, but scanty and at too long intervals;
						and the mouth of the womb is shut up by fat and does not admit the
						semen; and, moreover, they themselves are indolent and fat, and their
						bellies cold and soft. From these causes the Scythian race is not
						prolific. Their female servants furnish a strong proof of this; for
						they no sooner have connection with a man than they prove with child,
						owing to their active course of life and the slenderness of body.</p>

						And, in addition to these, there are many eunuchs among the Scythians,
						who perform female work, and speak like women. Such persons are called
						effeminates. The inhabitants of the country attribute the cause of
						their impotence to a god, and venerate and worship such persons, every
						one dreading that the like might befall himself; but to me it appears
						that such affections are just as much divine as all others are, and
						that no one disease is either more divine or more human than another,
						but that all are alike divine, for that each has its own nature, and
						that no one arises without a natural cause. But I will explain how
						I think that the affection takes its rise. From continued exercise
						on horseback they are seized with chronic defluxions in their joints
						owing to their legs always hanging down below their horses; they afterwards
						become lame and stiff at the hip-joint, such of them, at least, as
						are severely attacked with it. They treat themselves in this way:
						when the disease is commencing, they open the vein behind either ear,
						and when the blood flows, sleep, from feebleness, seizes them, and
						afterwards they awaken, some in good health and others not. To me
						it appears that the semen is altered by this treatment, for there
						are veins behind the ears which, if cut, induce impotence; now, these
						veins would appear <pb id="p.39"/>to me to be cut.<note>This opinion of our author was no doubt founded on the erroneous notion regarding the distribution of the veins which prevailed in his time, and which we find advocated in the tract "on the Nature of Man," and elsewhere.  (See Aristot., H. N., iii., 3.) Coray strives hard, in his annotations on this passage, to make out that the fact may be as he stated by his ancient countryman, although the hypothesis by which he explained it be false.  It is singular, however, that, after the lapse of more than two thousand years, Phrenology should have come to the assistance of Hippocrates in this case.  I need scarcely remark that Gall and his followers hold that the cerebellum is the seat o the animal appetites, so that, if this be really the fact, a close sympathy between the back of the head and the genital organs may be very legitimately inferred.  At all events, this coincidence between ancient observation and modern hypothesis must be admitted to be very remarkable. </note> Such persons afterwards, when
						they go in to women and cannot have connection with them, at first
						do not think much about it, but remain quiet; but when, after making
						the attempt two, three, or more times, they succeed no better, fancying
						they have committed some offence against the god whom they blame for
						the affection, they put on female attire, reproach themselves for
						effeminacy, play the part of women, and perform the same work as women
						do. This the rich among the Scythians endure, not the basest, but
						the most noble and powerful, owing to their riding on horseback; for
						the poor are less affected, as they do not ride on horses. And yet,
						if this disease had been more divine than the others, it ought not
						to have befallen the most noble and the richest of the Scythians alone,
						but all alike, or rather those who have little, as not being able
						to pay honors to the gods, if, indeed, they delight in being thus
						rewarded by men, and grant favors in return; for it is likely that
						the rich sacrifice more to the gods, and dedicate more votive offerings,
						inasmuch as they have wealth, and worship the gods; whereas the poor,
						from want, do less in this way, and, moreover, upbraid the gods for
						not giving them wealth, so that those who have few possessions were
						more likely to bear the punishments of these offences than the rich.
						But, as I formerly said, these affections are divine just as much
						as others, for each springs from a natural cause, and this disease
						arises among the Scythians from such a cause as I have stated. But
						it attacks other men in like manner, for whenever men ride much and
						very frequently on horseback, then many are affected with rheums in
						the joints, sciatica, and gout, <pb id="p.40"/>and they are inept at venery. But
						these complaints befall the Scythians, and they are the most impotent
						of men for the aforesaid causes, and because they always wear breeches,
						and spend the most of their time on horseback, so as not to touch
						their privy parts with the hands, and from the cold and fatigue they
						forget the sexual desire, and do not make the attempt until after
						they have lost their virility. Thus it is with the race of the Scythians.</p>

						The other races in Europe differ from one another, both as to stature
						and shape, owing to the changes of the seasons, which are very great
						and frequent, and because the heat is strong, the winters severe,
						and there are frequent rains, and again protracted droughts, and winds,
						from which many and diversified changes are induced. These changes
						are likely to have an effect upon generation in the coagulation of
						the semen, as this process cannot be the same in summer as in winter,
						nor in rainy as in dry weather; wherefore, I think, that the figures
						of Europeans differ more than those of Asiatics; and they differ very
						much from one another as to stature in the same city; for vitiations
						of the semen occur in its coagulation more frequently during frequent
						changes of the seasons, than where they are alike and equable. And
						the same may be said of their dispositions, for the wild, and unsociable,
						and the passionate occur in such a constitution; for frequent excitement
						of the mind induces wildness, and extinguishes sociableness and mildness
						of disposition, and therefore I think the inhabitants of Europe more
						courageous than those of Asia; for a climate which is always the same
						induces indolence, but a changeable climate, laborious exertions both
						of body and mind; and from rest and indolence cowardice is engendered,
						and from laborious exertions and pains, courage. On this account the
						inhabitants of Europe are than the Asiatics, and also owing to their
						institutions, because they are not governed by kings like the latter,
						for where men are governed by kings there they must be very cowardly,
						as I have stated before; for their souls are enslaved, and they will
						not willingly, or readily undergo dangers in order to promote the
						power of another; but those that are free undertake dangers on their
						own account, <pb id="p.41"/>and not for the sake of others; they court hazard and
						go out to meet it, for they themselves bear off the rewards of victory,
						and thus their institutions contribute not a little to their courage.
						
						Such is the general character of Europe and Asia.</p>

						And there are in Europe other tribes, differing from one another in
						stature, shape, and courage: the differences are those I formerly
						mentioned, and will now explain more clearly. Such as inhabit a country
						which is mountainous, rugged, elevated, and well watered, and where
						the changes of the seasons are very great, are likely to have great
						variety of shapes among them, and to be naturally of an enterprising
						and warlike disposition; and such persons are apt to have no little
						of the savage and ferocious in their nature; but such as dwell in
						places which are low-lying, abounding in meadows and ill ventilated,
						and who have a larger proportion of hot than of cold winds, and who
						make use of warm waters- these are not likely to be of large stature
						nor well proportioned, but are of a broad make, fleshy, and have black
						hair; and they are rather of a dark than of a light complexion, and
						are less likely to be phlegmatic than bilious; courage and laborious
						enterprise are not naturally in them, but may be engendered in them
						by means of their institutions. And if there be rivers in the country
						which carry off the stagnant and rain water from it, these may be
						wholesome and clear; but if there be no rivers, but the inhabitants
						drink the waters of fountains, and such as are stagnant and marshy,
						they must necessarily have prominent bellies and enlarged spleens.
						But such as inhabit a high country, and one that is level, windy,
						and well-watered, will be large of stature, and like to one another;
						but their minds will be rather unmanly and gentle. Those who live
						on thin, ill-watered, and bare soils, and not well attempered in the
						changes of the seasons, in such a country they are likely to be in
						their persons rather hard and well braced, rather of a blond than
						a dark complexion, and in disposition and passions haughty and self-willed.
						For, where the changes of the seasons are most frequent, and where
						they differ most from one another, there you will find their forms,
						dispositions, and nature the most varied. These are the strongest
						of the natural causes of difference, and next the country in which<pb id="p.42"/>
						one lives, and the waters; for, in general, you will find the forms
						and dispositions of mankind to correspond with the nature of the country;
						for where the land is fertile, soft, and well-watered, and supplied
						with waters from very elevated situations, so as to be hot in summer
						and cold in winter, and where the seasons are fine, there the men
						are fleshy, have ill-formed joints, and are of a humid temperament;
						they are not disposed to endure labor, and, for the most part, are
						base in spirit; indolence and sluggishness are visible in them, and
						to the arts they are dull, and not clever nor acute. When the country
						is bare, not fenced, and rugged, blasted by the winter and scorched
						by the sun, there you may see the men hardy, slender, with well-shaped
						joints, well-braced, and shaggy; sharp industry and vigilance accompany
						such a constitution; in morals and passions they are haughty and opinionative,
						inclining rather to the fierce than to the mild; and you will find
						them acute and ingenious as regards the arts, and excelling in military
						affairs; and likewise all the other productions of the earth corresponding
						to the earth itself. Thus it is with regard to the most opposite natures
						and shapes; drawing conclusions from them, you may judge of the rest
						without any risk of error.</p>

						It appears to me a most excellent thing for the physician to cultivate
						Prognosis; for by foreseeing and foretelling, in the presence of the
						sick, the present, the past, and the future, and explaining the omissions
						which patients have been guilty of,<note>Galen, in his Commentary on this clause of the sentence, acutely remarks that patients are justly disposed to form a high opinion of a physician who points out to them symptoms of their complaint which they themselves had omitted to mention to him.  And Staphanus further remarks that the patient naturally estimates highly the acumen of the physician who detects any errors in regimen which he has been guilty of, such as drinking water, or eating fruit when forbidden; (Ed. Dietz, p. 54;) or when he has some disease about him, such as bubo or inflammation, which he wishes to conceal. (Ibid., p. 63.)</note> he will be the more readily believed
						to be acquainted with the circumstances of the sick; so that men will
						have confidence to intrust themselves to such a physician. And he
						will manage the cure best who has foreseen what is to happen from
						the present state of matters. For it is impossible to make all the
						sick well; this, indeed, would have been better than to be able to
						foretell what is going to happen; but since men die, some even before
						calling the physician, from the violence of the disease, and some
						die immediately after calling him, having lived, perhaps, only one
						day or a little longer, and before the physician could bring his art
						to counteract the disease; it therefore becomes necessary to know
						the nature of such affections, how far they are above the powers of
						the constitution; and, moreover, if there be anything divine in the
						diseases, and to learn a foreknowledge of this also. Thus a man will
						be the more esteemed to be a good physician, for he will be the better
						able to treat those aright who can be saved, having long <pb id="p.44"/>anticipated
						everything; and by seeing and announcing beforehand those who will
						live and those who will die, he will thus escape censure.</p>

						He should observe thus in acute diseases: first, the countenance of
						the patient, if it be like those of persons in health, and more so,
						if like itself, for this is the best of all; whereas the most opposite
						to it is the worst, such as the following; a sharp nose, hollow eyes,
						collapsed temples; the ears cold, contracted, and their lobes turned
						out: the skin about the forehead being rough, distended, and parched;
						the color of the whole face being green, black, livid, or lead-colored.
						If the countenance be such at the commencement of the disease, and
						if this cannot be accounted for from the other symptoms, inquiry must
						be made whether the patient has long wanted sleep; whether his bowels
						have been very loose; and whether he has suffered from want of food;
						and if any of these causes be confessed to, the danger is to be reckoned
						so far less; and it becomes obvious, in the course of a day and a
						night, whether or not the appearance of the countenance proceeded
						from these causes. But if none of these be said to exist, if the symptoms
						do not subside in the aforesaid time, it is to be known for certain
						that death is at hand. And, also, if the disease be in a more advanced
						stage either on the third or fourth day, and the countenance be such,
						the same inquiries as formerly directed are to be made, and the other
						symptoms are to be noted, those in the whole countenance, those on
						the body, and those in the eyes; for if they shun the light, or weep
						involuntarily, or squint, or if the one be less than the other, or
						if the white of them be red, livid, or has black veins in it; if there
						be a gum upon the eyes, if they are restless, protruding, or are become
						very hollow; and if the countenance be squalid and dark, or the color
						of the whole face be changed- all these are to be reckoned bad and
						fatal symptoms. The physician should also observe the appearance of
						the eyes from below the eyelids in sleep; for when a portion of the
						white appears, owing to the eyelids not being closed together, and
						when this is not connected with diarrhea or purgation from medicine,
						or when the patient does not sleep<pb id="p.45"/> thus from habit, it is to be reckoned
						an unfavorable and very deadly symptom; but if the eyelid be contracted,
						livid, or pale, or also the lip, or nose, along with some of the other
						symptoms, one may know for certain that death is close at hand. It
						is a mortal symptom, also, when the lips are relaxed, pendent, cold,
						and blanched.</p>

						It is well when the patient is found by his physician reclining upon
						either his right or his left side, having his hands, neck, and legs
						slightly bent, and the whole body lying in a relaxed state, for thus
						the most of persons in health recline, and these are the best of postures
						which most resemble those of healthy persons. But to lie upon one's
						back, with the hands, neck, and the legs extended, is far less favorable.
						And if the patient incline forward, and sink down to the foot of the
						bed, it is a still more dangerous symptom; but if he be found with
						his feet naked and not sufficiently warm, and the hands, neck, and
						legs tossed about in a disorderly manner and naked, it is bad, for
						it indicates aberration of intellect. It is a deadly symptom, also,
						when the patient sleeps constantly with his mouth open, having his
						legs strongly bent and plaited together, while he lies upon his back;
						and to lie upon one's belly, when not habitual to the patient to sleep
						thus while in good health, indicates delirium, or pain in the abdominal
						regions. And for the patient to wish to sit erect at the acme of a
						disease is a bad symptom in all acute diseases, but particularly so
						in pneumonia. To grind the teeth in fevers, when such has not been
						the custom of the patient from childhood, indicates madness and death,
						both which dangers are to be announced beforehand as likely to happen;
						and if a person in delirium do this it is a very deadly symptom. And
						if the patient had an ulcer previously, or if one has occurred in
						the course of the disease, it is to be observed; for if the man be
						about to die the sore will become livid and dry, or yellow and dry
						before death.</p>

						Respecting the movement of the hands I have these observations to

						Respiration, when frequent, indicates pain or inflanunation in the

						contributing much to the safety of the patient in all acute diseases,

						Those sweats are the best in all acute diseases which occur on the
						critical days, and completely carry off the fever. Those are favorable,
						too, which taking place over the whole body, show that the man is
						bearing the disease better. But those that do not produce this effect
						are not beneficial. The worst are cold sweats, confined to the head,
						face, and neck; these in an acute fever prognosticate death, or in
						a milder one, a prolongation of the disease; and sweats which occur
						over the whole body, with the characters of those confined to the
						neck, are in like manner bad. Sweats attended with a miliary eruption,
						and taking place about the neck, are bad; sweats in the form of drops
						and of vapour are good. One ought to know the entire character of
						sweats, for some are connected with prostration of strength in the
						body, and some with intensity of the inflammation.</p>

						That state of the hypochondrium is best when it is free from pain,
						soft, and of equal size on the right side and the left. But if inflamed,
						or painful, or distended; or when the right and left sides are of
						disproportionate sizes;- all these appearances are to be dreaded.
						And if there be also pulsation in the hypochondrium, it indicates
						perturbation or delirium; and the physician should examine the eyes
						of such persons; for if their pupils be in rapid motion, such persons
						may be expected to go mad. A swelling in the hypochondrium, that is
						hard and painful, is very bad, provided it occupy the whole hypochondrium;
						but if it be on either side, it is less dangerous when on the left.
						Such swellings at the commencement of the disease prognosticate speedy
						death; but if the fever has passed twenty days, and the <pb id="p.47"/>swelling has
						not subsided, it turns to a suppuration.<note>The author evidently alluded to hepatitis ending in abscess.  This would seem to have been a very common termination of inflammation of the liver in Greece, as it is often described in the ancient medical works.  Se PAULUS AEGINETA, B. III., 46, and the authorities quoted there in the Sydenham Society's edition.</note> A discharge of blood from
						the nose occurs to such in the first period, and proves very useful;
						but inquiry should be made if they have headache or indistinct vision;
						for if there be such, the disease will be determined thither. The
						discharge of blood is rather to be expected in those who are younger
						than thirty-five years. Such swellings as are soft, free from pain,
						and yield to the finger, occasion more protracted crises, and are
						less dangerous than the others. But if the fever continue beyond sixty
						days, without any subsidence of the swelling, it indicates that empyema
						is about to take place; and a swelling in any other part of the cavity
						will terminate in like manner. Such, then, as are painful, hard, and
						large, indicate danger of speedy death; but such as are soft, free
						of pain, and yield when pressed with the finger, are more chronic
						than these. Swellings in the belly less frequently form abscesses
						than those in the hypochondrium; and seldomest of all, those below
						the navel are converted into suppuration; but you may rather expect
						a hemorrhage from the upper parts. But the suppuration of all protracted
						swellings about these parts is to be anticipated. The collections
						of matter there are to be thus judged of: such as are determined outwards
						are the best when they are small, when they protrude very much, and
						swell to a point; such as are large and broad, and which do not swell
						out to a sharp point, are the worst. Of such as break internally,
						the best are those which have no external communication, but are covered
						and indolent; and when the whole place is free from discoloration.
						That pus is best which is white, homogeneous, smooth, and not at all

						protracted diarrhoeas supervene, which neither <pb id="p.48"/>remove the pains in

						the rest of his body as well as in his hands and feet, it is more
						dangerous; and if, in addition to the weight, his nails and fingers
						become livid, immediate death may be anticipated; and if the hands
						and feet be black it is less dangerous than if they be livid, but
						the other symptoms must be attended, to; for if he appear to bear

						The excrement is best which is soft and consistent, is passed at the

						it is favorable that they are not accompanied with a noise, nor are
						frequent, nor in great quantity; for <pb id="p.49"/>the man being oppressed by frequently
						getting up, must be deprived of sleep; and if the evacuations be both
						frequent and large, there is danger of his falling into deliquium
						animi. But in proportion to the ingesta he should have evacuations
						twice or thrice in the day, once at night and more copiously in the
						morning, as is customary with a person in health. The faeces should
						become thicker when the disease is tending to a crisis; they ought
						to be yellowish and not very fetid. It is favorable that round worms
						be passed with the discharges when the disease is tending to a crisis.
						The belly, too, through the whole disease, should be soft and moderately
						distended; but excrements that are very watery, or white, or green,
						or very red, or frothy, are all bad. It is also bad when the discharge
						is small, and viscid, and white, and greenish, and smooth; but still
						more deadly appearances are the black, or fatty, or livid, or verdigris-green,
						or fetid. Such as are of varied characters indicate greater duration
						of the complaint, but are no less dangerous; such as those which resemble

						black; these being sometimes passed together, and sometimes singly.
						It is best when wind passes without noise, but it is better that flatulence
						should pass even thus than that it should be retained; and when it
						does pass thus, it indicates either that the man is in pain or in

						the hypochondria, and swellings, if recent, and not accompanied with
						inflammation, are relieved by borborygmi supervening in the hypochondrium,

						if deficient, and if it be sometimes passed clear, and sometimes with
						a white and smooth sediment, the disease will be more protracted,
						and not so void of danger. But if the urine be reddish, and the sediment
						consistent and smooth, the affection, in this case, will be more protracted
						than the former, <pb id="p.50"/>but still not fatal. But farinaceous sediments in
						the urine are bad, and still worse are the leafy; the white and thin
						are very bad, but the furfuraceous are still worse than these. Clouds
						carried about in the urine are good when white, but bad if black.
						When the urine is yellow and thin, it indicates that the disease is
						unconcocted; and if it (the disease) should be protracted, there maybe
						danger lest the patient should not hold out until the urine be concocted.
						But the most deadly of all kinds of urine are the fetid, watery, black,
						and thick; in adult men and women the black is of all kinds of urine
						the worst, but in children, the watery. In those who pass thin and
						crude urine for a length of time, if they have otherwise symptoms
						of convalescence, an abscess may be expected to form in the parts
						below the diaphragm. And fatty substances floating on the surface
						are to be dreaded, for they are indications of melting. And one should
						consider respecting the kinds of urine, which have clouds, whether
						they tend upwards or downwards, and upwards or downwards, and the
						colors which they have and such as fall downwards, with the colors
						as described, are to be reckoned good and commended; but such as are
						carried upwards, with the colors as described, are to be held as bad,
						and are to be distrusted. But you must not allow yourself to be deceived
						if such urine be passed while the bladder is diseased; for then it
						is a symptom of the state, not of the general system, but of a particular
						viscus.</p>

						That vomiting is of most service which consists of phlegm and bile

						vomit all these colors, it is to be reckoned a very fatal symptom.

						The expectoration in all pains about the lungs and sides, should be
						quickly and easily brought up, and a certain degree of yellowness
						should appear strongly mixed up with the sputum. <pb id="p.51"/> But if brought up
						long after the commencement of the pain, and of a yellow or ruddy
						color, or if it occasions much cough, or be not strongly mixed, it
						is worse; for that which is intensely yellow is dangerous, but the
						white, and viscid, and round, do no good. But that which is very green
						and frothy is bad; but if so intense as to appear black, it is still
						more dangerous than these; it is bad,
						if nothing is expectorated, and the lungs discharge nothing, but are
						gorged with matters which boil (as it were) in the air-passages. It
						is bad when coryza and sneezing either precede or follow affections
						of the lungs, but in all other affections, even the most deadly, sneezing
						is a salutary symptom. A yellow spittle mixed up with not much blood
						in cases of pneumonia, is salutary and very beneficial if spit up
						at the commencement of the disease, but if on the seventh day, or
						still later, it is less favorable. And all sputa are bad which do

						When the pains in these regions do not cease, either with the discharge
						of the sputa, nor with alvine evacuations, nor from venesection, purging
						with medicine, nor a suitable regimen, it is to be held that they
						will terminate in suppurations. Of empyemata such as are spit up while
						the sputum is still bilious, are very fatal, whether the bilious portion
						be expectorated separate, or along with the other; but more especially
						if the empyema begin to advance after this sputum on the seventh day
						of the disease. It is to be expected that a person with such an expectoration
						shall die on the fourteenth day, unless something favorable supervene.
						The following are favorable symptoms: to support the disease easily,
						to have free respiration, to be free from pain, to have the sputa
						readily brought up, the whole body to appear equally warm and soft,
						to have no thirst, the urine, and faeces, sleep, and sweats to be
						all favorable, as described before; when all these symptoms concur,
						the patient certainly will not die; but if some of these be present
						and some not, he will not survive longer than the fourteenth day.
						The bad symptoms are the opposite of these, namely, to bear the disease
						with difficulty, respiration large and dense, the pain not ceasing,
						the sputum <pb id="p.52"/>scarcely coughed up, strong thirst, to have the body unequally
						affected by the febrile heat, the belly and sides intensely hot, the
						forehead, hands, and feet cold; the urine, and excrements, the sleep,
						and sweats, all bad, agreeably to the characters described above;
						if such a combination of symptoms accompany the expectoration, the
						man will certainly die before the fourteenth day, and either on the
						ninth or eleventh. Thus then one may conclude regarding this expectoration,
						that it is very deadly, and that the patient will not survive until
						the fourteenth day. It is by balancing the concomitant symptoms whether
						good or bad, that one is to form a prognosis; for thus it will most
						probably prove to be a true one. Most other suppurations burst, some
						on the twentieth, some on the thirtieth, some on the fortieth, and
						some as late as the sixtieth day.<note>The observations of Andral have in some measure confirmed the opinion of Hippoc-rates and other authors, ancient and modern, that there are certain days in the duration of the disease in which there is a greater tendency to amelioration. Of ninety-three cases, he found twenty-three give way on the seventh, thirteen on the eleventh, eleven on the fourteenth, and nine on the twentieth days.  The recoveries in the remaining cases commenced on twelve out of forty-two non-critical days, as many as eleven being ascribed to the tenth day.  Thus the recoveries on critical days averaged as high as four-teen, while those on non-critical scarcely exceeded three." (Dr. C. J. B. Williams on Pneumonia, Cyclop. of Pract.

						One should estimate when the commencement of the suppuration will
						take place, by calculating from the day on which the patient was first
						seized with fever, or if he had a rigor, and if he says, that there
						is a weight in the place where he had pain formerly, for these symptoms
						occur in the commencement of suppurations. One then may expect the
						rupture of the abscesses to take place from these times according
						to the periods formerly stated. But if the empyema be only on either
						side, one should turn him and inquire if he has pain on the other
						side; and if the one side be hotter than the other, and when laid
						upon the sound side, one should inquire if he has the feeling of a

						Empyema may be recognized in all cases by the following symptoms:
						In the first place, the fever does not go off, but is
						<pb id="p.53"/>slight during the day, and increases at night, and copious sweats supervene, there is a desire to cough, and the patients expectorate nothing worth mentioning, the eyes become hollow, the cheeks have red spots on them, the nails of the hands are bent, the fingers are hot especially their extremities,
						there are swellings in the feet, they have no desire of food, and
						small blisters (phlyctaenae) occur over the body. These symptoms attend
						chronic empyemata, and may be much trusted to; and such as are of
						short standing are indicated by the same, provided they be accompanied
						by those signs which occur at the commencement, and if at the same
						time the patient has some difficulty of breathing. Whether they will
						break earlier or later may be determined by these symptoms; if there
						be pain at the commencement, and if the dyspnoea, cough, and ptyalism
						be severe, the rupture may be expected in the course of twenty days
						or still earlier; but if the pain be more mild, and all the other
						symptoms in proportion, you may expect from these the rupture to be
						later; but pain, dyspnoea, and ptyalism, must take place before the
						rupture of the abscess. Those patients recover most readily whom the
						fever leaves the same day that the abscess bursts,- when they recover
						their appetite speedily, and are freed from the thirst,- when the
						alvine discharges are small and consistent, the matter white, smooth,
						uniform in color, and free of phlegm, and if brought up without pain
						or strong coughing. Those die whom the fever does not leave, or when
						appearing to leave them it returns with an exacerbation; when they
						have thirst, but no desire of food, and there are watery discharges
						from the bowels; when the expectoration is green or livid, or pituitous
						and frothy; if all these occur they die, but if certain of these symptoms
						supervene, and others not, some patients die and some recover, after
						a long interval. But from all the symptoms taken together one should
						form a judgment, and so in all other cases.</p>

					<p>When abscesses form about the ears, after peripneumonic affections,
						or depositions of matter take place in the inferior extremities and
						end in fistula, such persons recover. The following observations are
						to be made upon them: if the fever persist, and the pain do not cease,
						if the expectoration be not <pb id="p.54"/>normal, and if the alvine discharges be
						neither bilious, nor free and unmixed; and if the urine be neither
						copious nor have its proper sediment, but if, on the other hand, all
						the other salutary symptoms be present, in such cases abscesses may
						be expected to take place. They form in the inferior parts when there
						is a collection of phlegm about the hypochondria; and in the upper
						when the hypochondria continue soft and free of pain, and when dyspnoea having
						been present for a certain time, ceases without any obvious cause.
						All deposits which take place in the legs after severe and dangerous
						attacks of pneumonia, are salutary, but the best are those which occur
						at the time when the sputa undergo a change; for if the swelling and
						pain take place while the sputa are changing from yellow and becoming
						of a purulent character, and are expectorated freely, under these
						circumstances the man will recover most favorably and the abscess
						becoming free of pain, will soon cease; but if the expectoration is
						not free, and the urine does not appear to have the proper sediment,
						there is danger lest the limb should be maimed, or that the case otherwise
						should give trouble. But if the abscesses disappear and go back, while
						expectoration does not take place, and fever prevails, it is a bad
						symptom; for there is danger that the man may get into a state of
						delirium and die. Of persons having empyema after peripneumonic affections,
						those that are advanced in life run the greatest risk of dying; but
						in the other kinds of empyema younger persons rather die. In cases
						of empyema treated by the cautery or incision, when the matter is
						pure, white, and not fetid, the patient recovers; but if of a bloody
						and dirty character, he dies.</p>

						Pains accompanied with fever which occur about the loins and lower

						since if any unfavorable one supervene, the case is hopeless; but
						if while the disease is determined to the diaphragm, the other symptoms
						are not bad, there is great reason to expect that it will end in empyema.
						When the bladder is hard and painful, it is an extremely bad and mortal
						symptom, more especially in cases attended with continued <pb id="p.55"/>fever; for
						the pains proceeding from the bladder alone are to kill the patient;
						and at such a time the bowels are not moved, or the discharges are
						hard and forced. But urine of a purulent character, and having a white

						place in the characters of the urine, nor the bladder become soft,

						Fevers come to a crisis on the same days as to number on which men
						recover and die. For the mildest class of fevers, and those originating
						with the most favorable symptoms, cease on the fourth day or earlier;
						and the most malignant, and those setting in with the most dangerous
						symptoms, prove fatal on the fourth day or earlier. The first class
						of them as to violence ends thus: the second is protracted to the
						seventh day, the third to the eleventh, the fourth to the fourteenth,
						the fifth to the seventeenth, and the sixth to the twentieth. Thus
						these periods from the most acute disease ascend by fours up to twenty.
						But none of these can be truly calculated by whole days, for neither
						the year nor the months can be numbered by entire days. After these
						in the same manner, according to the same progression, the first period
						is of thirty-four days, the second of forty days, and the third of
						sixty days. In the commencement of these it is very difficult to determine
						those which will come to a crisis after a long interval; for these
						beginnings are very similar, but one should pay attention from the
						first day, and observe further at every additional tetrad, and then
						one cannot miss seeing how the disease will terminate. The constitution
						of quartans is agreeable to the same order. Those which will come
						to a crisis in the shortest space of time, are the easiest to be judged
						of; for the differences of them are greatest from the commencement,
						thus those who are going to recover breathe freely, and do not suffer
						pain, they sleep during the night, and have the other salutary symptoms,
						whereas those that are to die have difficult respiration, are delirious,
						troubled with insomnolency, and have other bad symptoms. Matters being
						thus, one may conjecture, according <pb id="p.56"/> to the time, and each additional
						period of the diseases, as they proceed to a crisis. And in women,

						while the pain is recent, we may expect in like manner a discharge

						much later; for the fevers and delirium less frequently supervene
						upon them, and on that account the ears previously come to a suppuration,
						but at these periods of life, relapses of the disease coming on generally

						Ulceration of the throat with fever, is a serious affection, and if
						any other of the symptoms formerly described as being bad, be present,
						the physician ought to announce that his patient is in danger. Those
						quinsies are most dangerous, and most quickly prove fatal, which make
						no appearance in the fauces, nor in the neck, but occasion very great
						pain and difficulty of breathing; these induce suffocation on the
						first day, or on the second, the third, or the fourth. Such as, in
						like manner, are attended with pain, are swelled up, and have redness
						(erythema) in the throat, are indeed very fatal, but more protracted
						than<pb id="p.57"/> the former, provided the redness be great. Those cases in which
						both the throat and the neck are red, are more protracted, and certain
						persons recover from them, especially if the neck and breast be affected
						with erythema, and the erysipelas be not determined inwardly. If neither
						the erysipelas disappear on the critical day, nor any abscess form
						outwardly, nor any pus be spit up, and if the patient fancy himself
						well, and be free from pain, death, or a relapse of the erythema is
						to be apprehended. It is much less hazardous when the swelling and
						redness are determined outwardly; but if determined to the lungs,
						they superinduce delirium, and frequently some of these cases terminate
						in empyema. It is very dangerous to cut off or scarify enlarged uvulae
						while they and red and large, for inflammations and hemorrhages supervene;
						but one should try to reduce such swellings by some other means at
						this season. When the whole of it is converted into an abscess, which
						is called Uva, or when the extremity of the variety called Columella
						is larger and round, but the upper part thinner, at this time it will
						be safe to operate. But it will be better to open the bowels gently
						before proceeding to the operation, if time will permit, and the patient

						When the fevers cease without any symptoms of resolution occurring,
						and not on the critical days, in such cases a relapse may be anticipated.
						When any of the fevers is protracted, although the man exhibits symptoms
						of recovery, and there is no longer pain from any inflammation, nor
						from any other visible cause, in such a case a deposit, with swelling
						and pain, may be expected in some one of the joints, and not improbably
						in those below. Such deposits occur more readily and in less time
						to persons under thirty years of age; and one should immediately suspect
						the formation of such a deposit, if the fever be protracted beyond
						twenty days; but to aged persons these less seldom happen, and not
						until the fever be much longer protracted. Such a deposit may be expected,
						when the fever is of a continual type, and that it will pass into
						a quartan, if it become intermittent, and its paroxysms come on in
						an irregular manner, and if in this form it approach autumn. As deposits
						form most readily in persons below thirty years of age, so quartans
						most commonly occur to persons beyond that age. It is proper to know
						that deposits occur most readily in winter, that then they are most
						protracted, but are less given to return. Whoever, in a fever that
						is not of a fatal character, says that he has pain in his head, and
						that something dark appears to be before his eyes, and that he has
						pain at the stomach, will be seized with vomiting of bile; but if
						rigor also attack him, and the inferior parts of the hypochondrium
						are cold, vomiting is still nearer at hand; and if he eat or drink
						anything at such a season, it will be quickly vomited. In these cases,
						when the pain commences on the first day, they are particularly oppressed
						on the fourth and the fifth; and they are relieved on the seventh,
						but the greater part of them begin to have pain on the third day,
						and are most especially tossed on the fifth, but are relieved on the
						ninth or eleventh; but in those who begin to have pains on the fifth
						day, and other matters proceed properly with them, the disease comes
						to a crisis on the fourteenth day. But when in such a fever persons
						affected with headache, instead of having a dark appearance before
						their eyes, have dimness of vision, or flashes of light appear before
						their eyes, and instead of pain at the pit of the stomach, they have
						in their hypochondrium a fullness stretching either to the right or
						left side, without either pain or inflammation, a hemorrhage from
						the nose is to be expected in such a case, rather than a vomiting.
						But it is in young persons particularly that the hemorrhage is to
						be expected, for in persons beyond the age of thirty-five, vomitings
						are rather to be anticipated. Convulsions occur to children if acute
						fever be present, and the belly be they cannot sleep, are agitated,
						and moan, and change color, and become green, livid, or ruddy. These
						complaints occur most readily to children which are very young up
						to their seventh year; older children and adults are not equally liable
						to be seized with convulsions in fevers, unless some of the strongest
						and worst symptoms precede, such as those which occur in frenzy. One
						must judge of children as of others, which will die and which recover,
						from the whole of the symptoms, as they have been<pb id="p.59"/> specially described.<note>Our author here and elsewhere impresses it upon his readers that it is from the <hi rend="ital">tout ensemble</hi> of the symptoms that a judgment is to be formed in every case.

According to him, the meaning of our author is that good and bad symptoms tell the same in all places, in the hot regions of Libya, the cold of Scythia, and the temperate of Delos.  It is further to be borne in mind that Odessus in Scythia, and Cyrene in Libya, were the extremities of the Grecian world, whilst Delos may be regarded as its centre.

					<p>Those who composed what are called "The Cnidian Sentences"<note>The Cnidian Sentences in all probability were the results of the observations and theories made in the Temple of Health at Cnidos.  We may reasonably conclude from what we know of them, that, like the Coacae Praenotiones at Cos, the Cnidian Sentences at Cnidos were looked up to in the time of Hippocrates as the great guides to medical practice.  How much, then, it is to be regretted that they have not come down to us like the other! It is clear, however, from Galen's commentary, that the work was extant in his time, and from it, as will be seen, we are enabled to draw a few particulars respecting the theoretical and practical views of the Cnidians.  Le Clerc considers it likely that Euryphon was the author of the Cnidian Sentences (Hist. Phys., i., 3, 30); but it is evident, from the terms in which Hippocrates refers to them, that they were not the work of a single author.  He makes mention, it will be remarked, of more than one person being concerned in remodelling them.</note> have described
						accurately what symptoms the sick experience in every disease, and
						how certain of them terminate; and in so far a man, even who is not
						a physician, might describe them correctly, provided he put the proper
						inquiries to the sick themselves what their complaints are. But those
						symptoms which the physician ought to know beforehand without being
						informed of them by the patient, are, for the most part, omitted,
						some in one case and some in others, and certain symptoms of vital
						importance for a conjectural judgment.<note>By this our author means that the Cnidians neglected Prorrhetics and prognostics.  This must be obvious to every person who had entered properly into the spirit of the Hippocratic system of medicine.</note> But when, in addition to the
						diagnosis, they describe how each complaint should be treated, in
						these cases I entertain a still greater difference of opinion with
						them respecting the rules they have laid down; and not only do I not
						agree with them on this account, but also because the remedies they
						use are few in number; for, with the exception of acute diseases,
						the only medi-<pb id="p.61"/>cines which they give are drastic purgatives, with whey,
						and milk at certain times. If, indeed, these remedies had been good
						and suitable to the complaints in which they are recommended, they
						would have been still more deserving of recommendation, if, while
						few in number, they were sufficient; but this is by no means the case.
						Those, indeed, who have remodeled these "Sentences" have treated of
						the remedies applicable in each complaint more in a medical fashion.
						But neither have the ancients written anything worth regimen, although
						this be a great omission. Some of them, indeed, were not ignorant
						of the many varieties of each complaint, and their manifold divisions,
						but when they wish to tell clearly the numbers (species?) of each
						disease they do not write for their species would be almost innumerable
						if every symptom experienced by the patients were held to constitute
						a disease, and receive a different name.</p>

					<p>For my part, I approve of paying attention to everything relating
						to the art, and that those things which can be done well or properly
						should all be done properly; such as can be quickly done should be
						done quickly; such as can be neatly done should be done neatly; such
						operations as can be performed without pain should be done with the
						least possible pain; and that all other things of the like kind should
						be done better than they could be managed by the attendants. But I
						would more especially commend the physician who, in acute diseases,
						by which the bulk of mankind are cut off, conducts the treatment better
						than others. Acute diseases are those which the ancients named pleurisy,
						pneumonia, phrenitis, lethargy, causus, and the other diseases allied
						to these, including the continual fevers. For, unless when some general
						form of pestilential disease is epidemic, and diseases are sporadic
						and [not] of a similar character, there are more deaths from these
						diseases than from all the others taken together. The vulgar, indeed,
						do not recognize the difference between such physicians and their
						common attendants, and are rather disposed to commend and censure
						extraordinary remedies. This, then, is a great proof that the common
						people are most incompetent, of themselves, to form a judgment how
						such diseases should be treated: since persons who are not physicians
						pass for physicians<pb id="p.62"/> owing most especially to these diseases, for it
						is an easy matter to learn the names of those things which are applicable
						to persons laboring under such complaints. For, if one names the juice
						of ptisan, and such and such a wine, and hydromel, the vulgar fancy
						that he prescribes exactly the same things as the physicians do, both
						the good and the bad, but in these matters there is a great difference

						good or much harm. By undetermined I mean such as these, wherefore
						certain physicians, during their whole lives, are constantly administering
						unstrained ptisans, and fancy they thus accomplish the cure properly,
						whereas others take great pains that the patient should not swallow
						a particle of the barley (thinking it would do much harm), but strain
						the juice through a cloth before giving it; others, again, will neither
						give thick ptisan nor the juice, some until the seventh day of the
						disease, and some until after the crisis. Physicians are not in the
						practice of mooting such questions; nor, perhaps, if mooted, would
						a solution of them be found; although the whole art is thereby exposed
						to much censure from the vulgar, who fancy that there really is no
						such science as medicine, since, in acute diseases, practitioners
						differ so much among themselves, that those things which one administers
						as thinking it the best that can be given, another holds to be bad;
						and, in this respect, they might say that the art of medicine resembles
						augury, since augurs hold that the same bird (omen) if seen on the
						left hand is good, but if on the right bad: and in divination by the
						inspection of entrails you will find similar differences; but certain
						diviners hold the very opposite of these opinions. I say, then, that
						this question is a most excellent one, and allied to very many others,
						some of the most vital importance in the Art, for that it can contribute
						much to the recovery of the sick, and to the preservation of health
						in the case of those who are well; and that it promotes the strength
						of those who use gymnastic exercises, and is useful to whatever one
						may wish to apply it.</p>

						Ptisan, then, appears to me to be justly preferred before all the
						other preparations from grain in these diseases, and I commend those
						who made this choice,<note>Our author now enters upon the consideration of one of his principal objects in the preent work, namely, to describe the modes of preparing ptisan (<hi rend="ital">or</hi>the decoction of barley), and its uses in acute diseases.  He is so full on this subject that the present treatise is quoted by Athenaeus (Deipnos. ii., 16), by the name of the work On the Ptisan.  Galen states that, on the principle that diseases are to be cured by their contraries, as the essence of a febrile disease is combined of heat and dryness, the indication of a cure is to use means of a cooling and moistening nature, and that the ptisan fulfils both these objects.</note> for the mucilage of it is smooth, consistent,
						pleasant, lubricant, moderately diluent, quenches thirst if this be
						required, and has no astringency; gives no trouble nor swells up in
						the bowels, for in the boiling it swells up as much as it naturally
						can. Those, then, who make use of ptisan in such diseases, should
						never for a day allow their vessels to be empty of it, if I may say
						so, but should use it and not intermit, unless it be necessary to
						stop for a time, in order to administer medicine or a clyster. And
						to those who are accustomed to take two meals in the day it is to
						be given twice, and to those accustomed to live upon a single meal
						it is to be given once at first, and then, if the case permit, it
						is to be increased and given twice to them, if they appear to stand
						in need of it. At first it will be proper not to give a large quantity
						nor very thick, but in proportion to the quantity of food which one
						has been accustomed to take, and so as that the veins may not be much
						emptied. And, with regard to the augmentation of the dose, if the
						disease be of a drier nature than one had supposed, one must not give
						more of it, but should give before the draught of ptisan, either hydromel
						or wine, in as great quantity as may be proper; and what is proper
						in each case will be afterward stated by us. But if the mouth and
						the passages from the lungs be in a proper state as to moisture, the
						quantity of the draught is to be increased, as a general rule, for
						an early and abundant state of moisture indicates an early crisis,
						but a late and deficient moisture indicates a slower crisis. And these
						things are as I have stated for the most part; but many other things
						are omitted which are important to the prognosis, as will be explained
						afterwards. And the more <pb id="p.64"/> that the patient is troubled with purging,
						in so much greater quantity is it to be given until the crisis, and
						moreover until two days beyond the crisis, in such cases as it appears
						to take place on the fifth, seventh, or ninth day, so as to have respect
						both for the odd and even day: after this the draught is to be given
						early in the day, and the other food in place is to be given in the
						evening. These things are proper, for the most part, to be given to
						those who, from the first, have used ptisan containing its whole substance;
						for the pains in pleuritic affections immediately cease of their own
						accord whenever the patients begin to expectorate anything worth mentioning,
						and the purgings become much better, and empyema much more seldom
						takes place, than if the patients used a different regimen, and the
						crises are more simple, occur earlier, and the cases are less subject
						to relapses.</p>

						Ptisans are to be made of the very best barley, and are to be well
						boiled, more especially if you do not intend to use them strained.
						For, besides the other virtues of ptisan, its lubricant quality prevents
						the barley that is swallowed from proving injurious, for it does not
						stick nor remain in the region of the breast; for that which is well
						boiled is very lubricant, excellent for quenching thirst, of very
						easy digestion, and very weak, all which qualities are wanted. If,
						then, one do not pay proper attention to the mode of administering
						the ptisan, much harm may be done; for when the food is shut up in
						the bowels, unless one procure some evacuation speedily, before administering
						the draught, the pain, if present, will be exasperated; and, if not
						present, it will be immediately created, and the respiration will
						become more frequent, which does mischief, for it dries the lungs,
						fatigues the hypochondria, the hypogastrium, and diaphragm. And moreover
						if, while the pain of the side persists, and does not yield to warm
						fomentations, and the sputa are not brought up, but are viscid and
						unconcocted, unless one get the pain resolved, either by loosening
						the bowels, or opening a vein, whichever of these may be proper;-
						if to persons so circumstanced ptisan be administered, their speedy
						death will be the result. For these reasons, and for others of a similar
						kind still more, those who use unstrained ptisan die on the seventh
						day, or still earlier, some<pb id="p.65"/> being seized with delirium, and others
						dying suffocated with orthopnoee and riles. Such persons the ancients
						thought <hi rend="ital">struck</hi>, for this reason more especially, that when dead the
						affected side was livid, like that of a person who had been struck.
						The cause of this is that they die before the pain is resolved, being
						seized with difficulty of respiration, and by large and rapid breathing,
						as has been already explained, the spittle becoming thick, acid, and
						unconcocted, cannot be brought up, but, being retained in the bronchi
						of the lungs, produces riles; and, when it has come to this, death,
						for the most part, is inevitable; for the sputa being retained prevent
						the breath from being drawn in, and force it speedily out, and thus
						the two conspire together to aggravate the sputa being retained renders
						the respiration frequent, while the respiration being frequent thickens
						the sputa, and prevents them from being evacuated. These symptoms
						supervene, not only if ptisan be administered unseasonably, but still
						more if any other food or drink worse than ptisan be given.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>PART 6</head>
					<p> 
						For the most part, then, the results are the same, whether the patient
						have used the unstrained ptisan or have used the juice alone; or even
						only drink; and sometimes it is necessary to proceed quite differently.
						In general, one should do thus: if fever commences shortly after taking
						food, and before the bowels have been evacuated, whether with or without
						pain, the physician ought to withhold the draught until he thinks
						that the food has descended to the lower part of the belly; and if
						any pain be present, the patient should use oxymel, hot if it is winter,
						and cold if it is summer; and, if there be much thirst, he should
						take hydromel and water. Then, if any pain be present, or any dangerous
						symptoms make their appearance, it will be proper to give the draught
						neither in large quantity nor thick, but after the seventh day, if
						the patient be strong. But if the earlier-taken food has not descended,
						in the case of a person who has recently swallowed food, and if he
						be strong and in the vigor of life, a clyster should be given, or
						if he be weaker, a suppository is to be administered, unless the bowels
						open properly of themselves. The time for administering the draught
						is to be particularly observed at the commencement and during the
						whole illness; when, then, the feet <pb id="p.66"/> are cold, one should refrain from
						giving the ptisan, and more especially abstain from drink; but when
						the heat has descended to the feet, one may then give it; and one
						should look upon this season as of great consequence in all diseases,
						and not least in acute diseases, especially those of a febrile character,
						and those of a very dangerous nature. One may first use the juice,
						and then the ptisan, attending accurately to the rules formerly laid
						down.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>PART 7</head>
					<p> 
						When pain seizes the side, either at the commencement or at a later
						stage, it will not be improper to try to dissolve the pain by hot
						applications. Of hot applications the most powerful is hot water in
						a bottle, or bladder, or in a brazen vessel, or in an earthen one;
						but one must first apply something soft to the side, to prevent pain.
						A soft large sponge, squeezed out of hot water and applied, forms
						a good application; but it should be covered up above, for thus the
						heat will remain the longer, and at the same time the vapor will be
						prevented from being carried up to the patient's breath, unless when
						this is thought of use, for sometimes it is the case. And further,
						barley or tares may be infused and boiled in diluted vinegar, stronger
						than that it could be drunk, and may then be sewed into bladders and
						applied; and one may bran in like manner. Salts or toasted millet
						in woolen bags are excellent for forming a dry fomentation, for the
						millet is light and soothing. A soft fomentation like this soothes
						pains, even such as shoot to the clavicle. Venesection, however, does
						not alleviate the pain unless when it extends to the clavicle. But
						if the pain be not dissolved by the fomentations, one ought not to
						foment for a length of time, for this dries the lungs and promotes
						suppuration; but if the pain point to the clavicle, or if there be
						a heaviness in the arm, or about the breast, or above the diaphragm,
						one should open the inner vein at the elbow, and not hesitate to abstract
						a large quantity, until it become much redder, or instead of being
						pure red, it turns livid, for both these states occur. But if the
						pain be below the diaphragm, and do not point to the clavicle, we
						must open the belly either with black hellebore or peplium, mixing
						the black hellebore with carrot or seseli, or cumin, or anise, or
						any other of the fragrant herbs; and with the peplium the juice of
						sulphium (asafoetida), for these substances,<pb id="p.67"/> when mixed up together,
						are of a similar nature. The black hellebore acts more pleasantly
						and effectually than the peplium, while, on the other hand, the peplium
						expels wind much more effectually than the black hellebore, and both
						these stop the pain, and many other of the laxatives also stop it,
						but these two are the most efficacious that I am acquainted with.
						And the laxatives given in draughts are beneficial, when not very
						unpalatable owing to bitterness, or any other disagreeable taste,
						or from quantity, color, or any apprehension. When the patient has
						drunk the medicine, one ought to give him to swallow but little less
						of the ptisan than what he had been accustomed to; but it is according
						to rule not to give any draughts while the
						medicine is under operation; but when the purging is stopped then
						he should take a smaller draught than what he had been accustomed
						to, and afterwards go on increasing it progressively, until the pain
						cease, provided nothing else contra-indicate. This is my rule, also,
						if one would use the juice of ptisan (for I hold that it is better,
						on the whole, to begin with taking the decoction at once, rather than
						by first emptying the veins before doing so, or on the third, fourth,
						fifth, sixth, or seventh day, provided the disease has not previously
						come to a crisis in the course of this time), and similar preparations
						to those formerly described are to be made in those cases.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>PART 8</head>
					<p> 
						Such are the opinions which I entertain respecting the administering
						of the ptisan; and, as regards drinks, whichsoever of those about
						to be described may be administered, the same directions are generally
						applicable. And here I know that physicians are in the practice of
						doing the very reverse of what is proper, for they all wish, at the
						commencement of diseases, to starve their patients for two, three,
						or more days, and then to administer the ptisans and drinks; and perhaps
						it appears to them reasonable that, as a great change has taken place
						in the body, it should be counteracted by another great change. Now,
						indeed, to produce a change is no small matter, but the change must
						be effected well and cautiously, and after the change the administration
						of food must be conducted still more so. Those persons, then, would
						be most injured if the change is not properly managed, who used <pb id="p.68"/> unstrained
						ptisans; they also would suffer who made use of the juice alone; and
						so also they would suffer who took merely drink, but these least of
						all.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9">
					<head>PART 9</head>
					<p> 
						One may derive information from the regimen of persons in good health
						what things are proper; for if it appear that there is a great difference
						whether the diet be so and so, in other respects, but more especially
						in the changes, how can it be otherwise in diseases, and more especially
						in the most acute? But it is well ascertained that even a faulty diet
						of food and drink steadily persevered in, is safer in the main as
						regards health than if one suddenly change it to another. Wherefore,
						in the case of persons who take two meals in the day, or of those
						who take a single meal, sudden changes induce suffering and weakness;
						and thus persons who have not been accustomed to dine, if they shall
						take dinner, immediately become weak, have heaviness over their whole
						body, and become feeble and languid, and if, in addition, they take
						supper, they will have acid eructations, and some will have diarrhoea
						whose bowels were previously dry, and not having been accustomed to
						be twice swelled out with food and to digest it twice a day, have
						been loaded beyond their wont. It is beneficial, in such cases, to
						counterbalance this change, for one should sleep after dinner, as
						if passing the night, and guard against cold in winter and heat in
						summer; or, if the person cannot sleep, he may stroll about slowly,
						but without making stops, for a good while, take no supper, or, at
						all events, eat little, and only things that are not unwholesome,
						and still more avoid drink, and especially water. Such a person will
						suffer still more if he take three full meals in the day, and more
						still if he take more meals; and yet there are many persons who readily
						bear to take three full meals in the day, provided they are so accustomed.
						And, moreover, those who have been in the habit of eating twice a
						day, if they omit dinner, become feeble and powerless, averse to all
						work, and have heartburn; their bowels seem, as it were, to hang loose,
						their urine is hot and green, and the excrement is parched; in some
						the mouth is bitter, the eyes are hollow, the temples throb, and the
						extremities are cold, and the most of those who have thus missed their
						dinner cannot eat supper; or, if they do <pb id="p.69"/>sup, they load their stomach,
						and pass a much worse night than if they had previously taken dinner.
						Since, then, an unwonted change of diet for half a day produces such
						effects upon persons in health, it appears not to be a good thing
						either to add or take from. If, then, he who was restricted to a single
						meal, contrary to usage, having his veins thus left empty during a
						whole day, when he supped according to custom felt heavy, it is probable
						that if, because he was uneasy and weak from the want of dinner, he
						took a larger supper than wont, he would be still more oppressed;
						or if, wanting food for a still greater interval, he suddenly took
						a meal after supper, he will feel still greater oppression. He, then,
						who, contrary to usage, has had his veins kept empty by want of food,
						will find it beneficial to counteract the bad effects during that
						day as follows: let him avoid cold, heat, and exertion, for he could
						bear all these ill; let him make his supper considerably less than
						usual, and not of dry food, but rather liquid; and let him take some
						drink, not of a watery character, nor in smaller quantity than is
						proportionate to the food, and on the next day he should take a small
						dinner, so that, by degrees, he may return to his former practice.
						Persons who are bilious in the stomach bear these changes worst, while
						those who are pituitous, upon the whole, bear the want of food best,
						so that they suffer the least from being restricted to one meal in
						the day, contrary to usage. This, then, is a sufficient proof that
						the greatest changes as to those things which regard our constitutions
						and habits are most especially concerned in the production of diseases,
						for it is impossible to produce unseasonably a great emptying of the
						vessels by abstinence, or to administer food while diseases are at
						their acme, or when inflammation prevails; nor, on the whole,
						to make a great change either one way or another with impunity.</p>

						One might mention many things akin to these respecting the stomach
						and bowels, to show how people readily bear such food as they are
						accustomed to, even if it is not naturally good, and drink in like
						manner, and how they bear unpleasantly such food as they are not accustomed
						to, even although not bad, and so in like manner with drink; and as
						to the effects of eating much flesh, contrary to usage, or garlic,
						or asafoetida, or the stem of the <pb id="p.70"/>plant which produces it, or things
						of a similar kind possessed of strong properties, one would be less
						surprised if such things produce pains in the bowels, but rather when
						one learned what trouble, swelling, flatulence, and tormina the cake
						(maza) will raise in the belly when eaten by a person not accustomed
						to it; and how much weight and distention of the bowels bread will
						create to a person accustomed to live upon the maza; and what thirst
						and sudden fullness will be occasioned by eating hot bread, owing
						to its desiccant and indigestible properties; and what different effects
						are produced by fine and coarse bread when eaten contrary to usage,
						or by the cake when usually dry, moist, or viscid; and what different
						effects polenta produces upon those who are accustomed and those who
						are unaccustomed to the use of it; or drinking of wine or drinking
						of water, when either custom is suddenly exchanged for the other;
						or when, contrary to usage, diluted wine or undiluted has been suddenly
						drunk, for the one will create water-brash in the upper part of the
						intestinal canal and flatulence in the lower, while the other will
						give rise to throbbing of the arteries, heaviness of the head, and
						thirst; and white and dark-colored wine, although both strong wines,
						if exchanged contrary to usage, will produce very different effects
						upon the body, so that one need the less wonder that a sweet and strong
						wine, if suddenly exchanged, should have by no means the same effect.</p>

				<div2 type="section" n="11">

					<p> 
						Let us here briefly advert to what may be said on the opposite side;
						namely, that a change of diet has occurred in these cases, without
						any change in their body, either as to strength, so as to require
						an increase of food, or as to weakness, so as to require a diminution.
						But the strength of the patient is to be taken into consideration,
						and the manner of the disease, and of the constitution of the man,
						and the habitual regimen of the patient, not only as regards food
						but also drink. Yet one must much less resort to augmentation, since
						it is often beneficial to have recourse to abstraction, when the patient
						can bear it, until the disease having reached its acme and has become
						concocted. But in what cases this must be done will be afterwards
						described. One might write many other things akin to those which have
						been <pb id="p.71"/> now said, but there is a better proof, for it is not akin to
						the matter on which my discourse has principally turned, but the subject-matter
						itself is a most seasonable proof. For some at the commencement of
						acute diseases have taken food on the same day, some on the next day;
						some have swallowed whatever has come in their way, and some have
						taken <hi rend="ital">cyceon</hi>.<note>The <hi rend="ital">cyceon</hi>was a mixture of various articles of food, but generally contained cheese, honey, and wine.  See Athenaeus (Deipnos, ii.).  It is described by Homer as the potion which Circe administered to the followers of Ulysses.  (Odyss. x., 235).  There is freqent mention of it in the Hippocratic treatises, as at De Diaeta, ii.; de Muliebribus, ii.; and in the works of the other medical authors.</note> Now all these things are worse than if one had observed
						a different regimen; and yet these mistakes, committed at that time,
						do much less injury than if one were to abstain entirely from food
						for the first two or three days, and on the fourth or fifth day were
						to take such food; and it would be still worse, if one were to observe
						total abstinence for all these days, and on the following days were
						to take such a diet, before the disease is concocted;<note>The meaning here is somewhat obscure, but appears to be this:  that if a patient fast for the first two or three days, and take food of a heavy nature on the fourth or fifth, he will be much injured, but that the mistake will be still more fatal if the fast be continued for the first four or five days, and if he then indulge freely in food at the end of these.</note> for in this
						way death would be the consequence to most people, unless the disease
						were of a very mild nature. But the mistakes committed at first were
						not so irremediable as these, but could be much more easily repaired.
						This, therefore, I think a strong proof that such or such a draught
						need not be prescribed on the first days to those who will use the
						same draughts afterwards. At the bottom, therefore, they do not know,
						neither those using unstrained ptisans, that they are hurt by them,
						when they begin to swallow them, if they abstain entirely from food
						for two, three, or more days; nor do those using the juice know that
						they are injured in swallowing them, when they do not commence with
						the draught seasonably. But this they guard against, and know that
						it does much mischief, if, before the disease be concocted, the patient
						swallow unstrained ptisan, when accustomed to use strained. All these
						things are strong proofs that physicians do not conduct the regimen
						of patients properly, but that in those diseases in<pb id="p.72"/> which total abstinence
						from food should not be enforced on patients that will be put on the
						use of ptisans, they do enforce total abstinence; that in those cases
						in which there should be no change made from total abstinence to ptisans,
						they do make the change; and that, for the most part, they change
						from abstinence to ptisans, exactly at the time when it is often beneficial
						to proceed from ptisans almost to total abstinence, if the disease
						happen to be in the state of exacerbation. And sometimes crude matters
						are attracted from the head, and bilious from the region near the
						chest, and the patients are attacked with insomnolency, so that the
						disease is not concocted; they become sorrowful, peevish, and delirious;
						there are flashes of light in their eyes, and noises in their ears;
						their extremities are cold, their urine unconcocted; the sputa thin,
						saltish, tinged with an intense color and smell; sweats about the
						neck, and anxiety; respiration, interrupted in the expulsion of the
						air, frequent and very large; expression of the eyelids dreadful;
						dangerous <hi rend="ital">deliquia</hi>; tossing of the bed-clothes from the breast; the
						hands trembling, and sometimes the lower lip agitated. These symptoms,
						appearing at the commencement, are indicative of strong delirium,
						and patients so affected generally die, or if they escape, it is with
						a deposit, hemorrhage from the nose, or the expectoration of thick
						matter, and not otherwise. Neither do I perceive that physicians are
						skilled in such things as these; how they ought to know such diseases
						as are connected with debility, and which are further weakened by
						abstinence from food, and those aggravated by some other irritation;
						those by pain, and from the acute nature of the disease, and what
						affections and various forms thereof our constitution and habit engender,
						although the knowledge or ignorance of such things brings safety or
						death to the patient. For it is a great mischief if to a patient debilitated
						by pain, and the acute nature of the disease, one administer drink,
						or more ptisan, or food, supposing that the debility proceeds from
						inanition. It is also disgraceful not to recognize a patient whose
						debility is connected with inanition, and to pinch him in his diet;
						this mistake, indeed, is attended with some danger, but much less
						than the other, and yet it is likely to expose one to much greater
						derision, for if another physician, or a private<pb id="p.73"/> person, coming in
						and knowing what has happened, should give to eat or drink those things
						which the other had forbidden, the benefit thus done to the patient
						would be manifest. Such mistakes of practitioners are particularly
						ridiculed by mankind, for the physician or nonprofessional man thus
						coming in, seems as it were to resuscitate the dead. On this subject
						I will describe elsewhere the symptoms by which each of them may be
						recognized.</p>

						And the following observations are similar to those now made respecting
						the bowels. If the whole body rest long, contrary to usage, it does
						not immediately recover its strength; but if, after a protracted repose,
						it proceed to labor, it will clearly expose its weakness. So it is
						with every one part of the body, for the feet will make a similar
						display, and any other of the joints, if, being unaccustomed to labor,
						they be suddenly brought into action, after a time. The teeth and
						the eyes will suffer in like manner, and also every other part whatever.
						A couch, also, that is either softer or harder than one has been accustomed
						to will create uneasiness, and sleeping in the open air, contrary
						to usage, hardens the body. But it is sufficient merely to state examples
						of all these cases. If a person having received a wound in the leg,
						neither very serious nor very trifling, and he being neither in a
						condition very favorable to its healing nor the contrary, at first
						betakes himself to bed, in order to promote the cure, and never raises
						his leg, it will thus be much less disposed to inflammation, and be
						much sooner well, than it would have been if he had strolled about
						during the process of healing; but if upon the fifth or sixth day,
						or even earlier, he should get up and attempt to walk, he will suffer
						much more then than if he had walked about from the commencement of
						the cure, and if he should suddenly make many laborious exertions,
						he will suffer much more than if, when the treatment was conducted
						otherwise, he had made the same exertions on the same days. In fine,
						all these things concur in proving that all great changes, either
						one way or another, are hurtful. Wherefore much mischief takes place
						in the bowels, if from a state of great inanition more food than is
						moderate be administered (and also in the rest of the body,<pb id="p.74"/> if from
						a state of great rest it be hastily brought to greater exertion, it
						will be much more injured), or if from the use of much food it be
						changed to complete abstinence, and therefore the body in such cases
						requires protracted repose, and if, from a state of laborious exertion,
						the body suddenly falls into a state of ease and indolence, in these
						cases also the bowels would require continued repose from abundance
						of food, for otherwise it will induce pain and heaviness in the whole
						body.</p>

						The greater part of my discourse has related to changes, this way

						in acute diseases, in which a change is made to ptisans from a state

						should not be used until the disease be concocted, or some other symptom,

						One must determine by such marks as these, when sweet, strong, and
						dark wine, hydromel, water and oxymel, should be given in acute diseases.
						Wherefore the sweet affects the head less than the strong, attacks
						the brain less, evacuates the bowels more than the other, but induces
						swelling of the spleen and liver; it does not agree with bilious persons,
						for it causes them to thirst; it creates flatulence in the upper part
						of the intestinal canal, but does not disagree with the lower part,
						as far as regards flatulence; and yet flatulence engendered by sweet
						wine is not of a transient nature, but rests for a long time in the
						hypochondria. And therefore it in general is less diuretic than wine
						which is strong and thin; but sweet wine is more expectorant than
						the other. But when it creates thirst, it is less expectorant in such
						cases than the other wine, but if it do not create thirst, it promotes
						expecto-<pb id="p.75"/>ration better than the other. The good and bad effects of a
						white, strong wine, have been already frequently and fully stated
						in the disquisition on sweet wine; it is determined to the bladder
						more than the other, is diuretic and laxative, and should be very
						useful in such complaints; for if in other respects it be less suitable
						than the other, the clearing out of the bladder effected by it is
						beneficial to the patient, if properly administered. There are excellent
						examples of the beneficial and injurious effects of wine, all which
						were left undetermined by my predecessors. In these diseases you may
						use a yellow wine, and a dark austere wine for the following purposes:
						if there be no heaviness of the head, nor delirium, nor stoppage of
						the expectoration, nor retention of the urine, and if the alvine discharges
						be more loose and like scrapings than usual, in such cases a change
						from a white wine to such as I have mentioned, might be very proper.
						It deserves further to be known, that it will prove less injurious
						to all the parts above, and to the bladder, if it be of a more watery
						nature, but that the stronger it is, it will be the more beneficial
						to the bowels.</p>

						Hydromel, when drunk in any stage of acute disease, is less suitable
						to persons of a bilious temperament, and to those who have enlarged
						viscera, than to those of a different character; it increases thirst
						less than sweet wine; it softens the lungs, is moderately expectorant,
						and alleviates a cough; for it has some detergent quality in it, whence
						it lubricates the sputum. Hydromel is also moderately diuretic, unless
						prevented by the state of any of the viscera. And it also occasions
						bilious discharges downwards, sometimes of a proper character, and
						sometimes more intense and frothy than is suitable; but such rather
						occurs in persons who are bilious, and have enlarged viscera. Hydromel
						rather produces expectoration, and softening of the lungs, when given
						diluted with water. But unmixed hydromel, rather than the diluted,
						produces frothy evacuations, such as are unseasonably and intensely
						bilious, and too hot; but such an evacuation occasions other great
						mischiefs, for it neither extinguishes the heat in the hypochondria,
						but rouses it, induces inquietude, and jactitation of the limbs, and
						ulcerates the intestines and anus. The remedies for all these will
						be described afterwards. <pb id="p.76"/>By using hydromel without ptisans, instead
						of any other drink, you will generally succeed in the treatment of
						such diseases, and fail in few cases; but in what instances it is
						to be given, and in what it is not to be given, and wherefore it is
						not to be given,- all this has been explained already, for the most
						part. Hydromel is generally condemned, as if it weakened the powers
						of those who drink it, and on that account it is supposed to accelerate
						death; and this opinion arose from persons who starve themselves to
						death, some of whom use hydromel alone for drink, as fancying that
						it really has this effect. But this is by no means always the case.
						For hydromel, if drunk alone, is much stronger than water, if it do
						not disorder the bowels; but in some respects it is stronger, and
						in some weaker, than wine that is thin, weak, and devoid of <hi rend="ital">bouquet</hi>.
						There is a great difference between unmixed wine and unmixed honey,
						as to their nutritive powers, for if a man will drink double the quantity
						of pure wine, to a certain quantity of honey which is swallowed, he
						will find himself much stronger from the honey, provided it do not
						disagree with his bowels, and that his alvine evacuations from it
						will be much more copious. But if he shall use ptisan for a draught,
						and drink afterward hydromel, he will feel full, flatulent, and uncomfortable
						in the viscera of the hypochondrium; but if the hydromel be taken
						before the draught, it will not have the same injurious effects as
						if taken after it, but will be rather beneficial. And boiled hydromel
						has a much more elegant appearance than the unboiled, being clear,
						thin, white, and transparent, but I am unable to mention any good
						quality which it possesses that the other wants. For it is not sweeter
						than the unboiled, provided the honey be fine, and it is weaker, and
						occasions less copious evacuations of the bowels, neither of which
						effects is required from the hydromel. But one should by all means
						use it boiled, provided the honey be bad, impure, black, and not fragrant,
						for the boiling will remove the most of its bad qualities and appearances.</p>

						You will find the drink, called oxymel, often very useful in these
						complaints, for it promotes expectoration and freedom of breathing.
						the following are the proper occasions for administering it. When
						strongly acid it has no mean operation in<pb id="p.77"/> rendering the expectoration
						more easy, for by bringing up the sputa, which occasion troublesome
						hawking, and rendering them more slippery, and, as it were, clearing
						the windpipe with a feather, it relieves the lungs and proves emollient
						to them; and when it succeeds in producing these effects it must do
						much good. But there are cases in which hydromel, strongly acid, does
						not promote expectoration, but renders it more viscid and thus does
						harm, and it is most apt to produce these bad effects in cases which
						are otherwise of a fatal character, when the patient is unable to
						cough or bring up the sputa. On this account, then, one ought to consider
						beforehand the strength of the patient, and if there be any hope,
						then one may give it, but if given at all in such cases it should
						be quite tepid, and in by no means large doses. But if slightly acrid
						it moistens the mouth and throat, promotes expectoration, and quenches
						thirst; agrees with the viscera seated in the hypochondrium, and obviates
						the bad effects of the honey; for the bilious quality of the honey
						is thereby corrected. It also promotes flatulent discharges from the
						bowels, and is diuretic, but it occasions watery discharges and those
						resembling scrapings, from the lower part of the intestine, which
						is sometimes a bad thing in acute diseases, more especially when the
						flatulence cannot be passed, but rolls backwards; and otherwise it
						diminishes the strength and makes the extremities cold, this is the
						only bad effect worth mentioning which I have known to arise from
						the oxymel. It may suit well to drink a little of this at night before
						the draught of ptisan, and when a considerable interval of time has
						passed after the draught there will be nothing to prevent its being
						taken. But to those who are restricted entirely to drinks without
						draughts of ptisan, it will therefore not be proper at all times to
						give it, more especially from the fretting and irritation of the intestine
						which it occasions, (and these bad effects it will be the more apt
						to produce provided there be no faeces in the intestines and the patient
						is laboring under inanition,) and then it will weaken the powers of
						the hydromel. But if it appears advantageous to use a great deal of
						this drink during the whole course of the disease, one should add
						to it merely as much vinegar as can just be perceived by the taste,
						for thus what is<pb id="p.78"/> prejudicial in it will do the least possible harm,
						and what is beneficial will do the more good. In a word, the acidity
						of vinegar agrees rather with those who are troubled with bitter bile,
						than with those patients whose bile is black; for the bitter principle
						is dissolved in it and turned to phlegm, by being suspended in it;
						whereas black bile is fermented, swells up, and is multiplied thereby:
						for vinegar is a melanogogue. Vinegar is more prejudicial to women
						than to men, for it creates pains in the uterus.</p>

						I have nothing further to add as to the effects of water when used
						as a drink in acute diseases; for it neither soothes the cough in
						pneumonia, nor promotes expectoration, but does less than the others
						in this respect, if used alone through the whole complaint. But if
						taken intermediate between oxymel and hydromel, in small quantity,
						it promotes expectoration from the change which it occasions in the
						qualities of these drinks, for it produces, as it were, a certain
						overflow. Otherwise it does not quench the thirst, for it creates
						bile in a bilious temperament, and is injurious to the hypochondrium;
						and it does the most harm, engenders most bile, and does the least
						good when the bowels are empty; and it increases the swelling of the
						spleen and liver when they are in an inflamed state; it produces a
						gurgling noise in the intestines and swims on the stomach; for it
						passes slowly downwards, as being of a coldish and indigestible nature,
						and neither proves laxative nor diuretic; and in this respect, too,
						it proves prejudicial, that it does not naturally form does in the
						intestines: and, if it be drunk while the feet are cold, its injurious
						effects will be greatly aggravated, in all those parts to which it
						may be determined. When you suspect in these diseases either strong
						heaviness of the head, or mental alienation, you must abstain entirely
						from wine, and in this case use water, or give weak, straw-colored
						wine, entirely devoid of <hi rend="ital">bouquet</hi>, after which a little water is to
						be given in addition; for thus the strength of the will less affect
						the head and the understanding: but in which cases water is mostly
						to be given for drink, when in large quantity, when in moderate, when
						cold, and when hot; all these things have either been discussed already
						or will be treated of at the proper time. In like manner, with respect
						to all the others, such as barley-water, the<pb id="p.79"/> drinks made from green
						shoots, those from raisins, and the skins of grapes and wheat, and
						bastard saffron, and myrtles, pomegranates, and the others, when the
						proper time for using them is come, they will be treated of along
						with the disease in question, in like manner as the other compound

						The bath is useful in many diseases, in some of them when used steadily,
						and in others when not so. Sometimes it must be less used than it
						would be otherwise, from the want of accommodation; for in few families
						are all the conveniences prepared, and persons who can manage them
						as they ought to be. And if the patient be not bathed properly, he
						maybe thereby hurt in no inconsiderable degree, for there is required
						a place to cover him that is free of smoke, abundance of water, materials
						for frequent baths, but not very large, unless this should be required.
						It is better that no friction should be applied, but if so, a hot
						soap (<hi rend="ital">smegma</hi>) must be used in greater abundance than is common, and
						an affusion of a considerable quantity of water is to be made at the
						same time and afterwards repeated. There must also be a short passage
						to the basin, and it should be of easy ingress and egress. But the
						person who takes the bath should be orderly and reserved in his manner,
						should do nothing for himself, but others should pour the water upon
						him and rub him, and plenty of waters, of various temperatures, should
						be in readiness for the <hi rend="ital">douche</hi>, and the affusions quickly made; and
						sponges should be used instead of the comb (<hi rend="ital">strigil</hi>), and the body
						should be anointed when not quite dry. But the head should be rubbed
						by the sponge until it is quite dry; the extremities should be protected
						from cold, as also the head and the rest of the body; and a man should
						not be washed immediately after he has taken a draught of ptisan or
						a drink; neither should he take ptisan as a drink immediately after
						the bath. Much will depend upon whether the patient, when in good
						health, was very fond of the bath, and in the custom of taking it:
						for such persons, especially, feel the want of it, and are benefited
						if they are bathed, and injured if they are not. In general it suits
						better with cases of pneumonia than in ardent fevers; for the bath
						soothes the pain in the side, chest, and back; concocts the sputa,
						promotes expectoration, <pb id="p.80"/>improves the respiration, and allays lassitude;
						for it soothes the joints and outer skin, and is diuretic, removes
						heaviness of the head, and moistens the nose. Such are the benefits
						to be derived from the bath, if all the proper requisites be present;
						but if one or more of these be wanting, the bath, instead of doing
						good, may rather prove injurious; for every one of them may do harm
						if not prepared by the attendants in the proper manner.
						It is by no means a suitable thing in these diseases to persons whose
						bowels are too loose, or when they are unusually confined, and there
						has been no previous evacuation; neither must we bathe those who are
						debilitated, nor such as have nausea or vomiting, or bilious eructations;
						nor such as have hemorrhage from the nose, unless it be less than
						required at that stage of the disease (with those stages you are acquainted),
						but if the discharge be less than proper, one should use the bath,
						whether in order to benefit the whole body or the head alone. If then
						the proper requisites be at hand, and the patient be well disposed
						to the bath, it may be administered once every day, or if the patient
						be fond of the bath there will be no harm, though he should take it
						twice in the day. The use of the bath is much more appropriate to
						those who take unstrained ptisan, than to those who take only the
						juice of it, although even in their case it may be proper; but least
						of all does it suit with those who use only plain drink, although,
						in their case too it may be suitable; but one must form a judgment
						from the rules laid down before, in which of these modes of regimen
						the bath will be beneficial, and in which not. Such as want some of
						the requisites for a proper bath, but have those symptoms which would
						be benefited by it, should be bathed; whereas those who want none
						of the proper requisites, but have certain symptoms which contraindicate
						the bath, are not to be bathed. </p></div2>

						<p>Ardent fever (causus) takes place when the veins, being dried up
							in the summer season, attract acrid and bilious humors to themselves;
							and strong fever seizes the whole body, which experiences aches of
							the bones, and is in a state of lassitude and<pb id="p.81"/> pain. It takes place
							most commonly from a long walk and protracted thirst, when the veins
							being dried up attract acrid and hot defluxions to themselves. The
							tongue becomes rough, dry, and very black; there are gnawing pains
							about the bowels; the alvine discharges are watery and yellow; there
							is intense thirst, insomnolency, and sometimes wandering of the mind.
							To a person in such a state give to drink water and as much boiled
							hydromel of a watery consistence as he will take; and if the mouth
							be bitter, it may be advantageous to administer an emetic and clyster;
							and if these things do not loosen the bowels, purge with the boiled
							milk of asses. Give nothing saltish nor acrid, for they will not be
							borne; and give no draughts of ptisan until the crisis be past. And
							the affection is resolved if there be an epistaxis, or if true critical
							sweats supervene with urine having white, thick, and smooth sediments,
							or if a deposit take place anywhere; but if it be resolved without
							these, there will be a relapse of the complaint, or pain in the hips
							and legs will ensue, with thick sputa, provided the patient be convalescent.
							Another species of ardent fever: belly loose, much thirst, tongue
							rough, dry, and saltish, retention of urine, insomnolency, extremities
							cold. In such a case, unless there be a flow of blood from the nose,
							or an abscess form about the neck, or pain in the limbs, or the patient
							expectorate thick sputa (these occur when the belly is constipated),
							or pain of the hips, or lividity of the genital organs, there is no

							Quinsy takes place when a copious and viscid defluxion from the head,
							in the season of winter or spring, flows into the jugular veins, and
							when from their large size they attract a greater defluxion; and when
							owing to the defluxion being of a cold and viscid nature it becomes
							enfarcted, obstructing the passages of the respiration and of the
							blood, coagulates the surrounding blood, and renders it motionless
							and stationary, it being naturally cold and disposed to obstructions.
							Hence they are seized with convulsive suffocation, the tongue turning
							livid, assuming a rounded shape, and being vent owing to the veins
							which are seated below the tongue (for when an enlarged uvula, which
							is called <hi rend="ital">uva</hi>, is cut, a large vein may be observed on each side).
							These veins, then, becoming filled, and their roots extending into
							the tongue, which is of a loose and spongy texture, it, owing to its
							dryness receiving forcibly the juice from the veins, changes from
							broad and becomes round, its natural color turns to livid, from a
							soft consistence it grows hard, instead of being flexible it becomes
							inflexible, so that the patient would soon be suffocated unless speedily
							relieved. Bleeding, then, in the arm, and opening the sublingual veins,
							and purging with the electuaries, and giving warm gargles, and shaving
							the head, we must apply to it and the neck a cerate, and wrap them
							round with wool, and foment with soft sponges squeezed out of hot
							water; give to drink water and hydromel, not cold; and administer
							the juice of ptisan when, having passed the crisis, the patient is
							out of danger. When, in the season of summer or autumn, there is a
							hot and nitrous defluxion from the head (it is rendered hot and acrid
							by the season), being of such a nature it corrodes and ulcerates,
							and fills with air, and orthopnoea attended with great dryness supervenes;
							the fauces, when examined, do not seem swollen; the tendons on the
							back part of the neck are contracted, and have the appearance as if
							it were tetanus; the voice is lost, the breathing is small, and<pb id="p.84"/> inspiration
							becomes frequent and laborious. In such persons the trachea becomes
							ulcerated, and the lungs engorged, from the patient's not being able
							to draw in the external air. In such cases, unless there be a spontaneous
							determination to the external parts of the neck, the symptoms become
							still more dreadful, and the danger more imminent, partly owing to
							the season, and the hot and acrid humors which cause the disease.</p></div3>

							When fever seizes a person who has lately taken food, and whose bowels
							are loaded with faeces which have been long retained, whether it be
							attended with pain of the side or not, he ought to lie quiet until
							the food descend to the lower region of the bowels, and use oxymel
							for drink; but when the load descends to the loins, a clyster should
							be administered, or he should be purged by medicine; and when purged,
							he should take ptisan for food and hydromel for drink; then he may
							take the cerealia, and boiled fishes, and a watery wine in small quantity,
							at night, but during the day, a watery hydromel. When the flatus is
							offensive, either a suppository or clyster is to be administered;
							but otherwise the oxymel is to be discontinued, until the matters
							descend to the lower part of the bowels, and then they are to be evacuated
							by a clyster. But if the ardent fever (causus) supervene when the
							bowels are empty, should you still judge it proper to administer purgative
							medicine, it ought not be done during the first three days, nor earlier
							than the fourth. When you give the medicine, use the ptisan, observing
							the paroxysms of the fevers, so as not to give it when the fever is
							setting in, but when it is ceasing, or on the decline, and as far
							as possible from the commencement. When the feet are cold, give neither
							drink nor ptisan, nor anything else of the kind, but reckon it an
							important rule to refrain until they become warm, and then you may
							administer them with advantage. For the most part, coldness of the
							feet is a symptom of a paroxysm of the fever coming on; and if at
							such a season you apply those things, you will commit the greatest
							possible mistake, for you will augment the disease in no small degree.
							But when the fever ceases, the feet, on the contrary, become hotter
							than the rest of the body; for when the heat leaves the feet, it is
							kindled up in the breast, and sends its flame up to the head. And
							when<pb id="p.85"/> all the heat rushes upwards, and is exhaled at the head, it is
							not to be wondered at that the feet become cold, being devoid of flesh,
							and tendinous; and besides, they contract cold, owing to their distance
							from the hotter parts of the body, an accumulation of heat having
							taken place in the chest: and again, in like manner, when the fever
							is resolved and dissipated, the heat descends to the feet, and, at
							the same time, the head and chest become cold. Wherefore one should
							attend to this; that when the feet are cold, the bowels are necessarily
							hot, and filled with nauseous matters; the hypochondrium distended:
							there is jactitation of the body, owing to the internal disturbance;
							and aberration of the intellect, and pains; the patient is agitated,
							and wishes to vomit, and if he vomits bad matters he is pained; but
							when the heat descends to the feet, and the urine passes freely, he
							is every way lightened, even although he does not sweat; at this season,
							then, the ptisan ought to be given; it would be death to give it before.</p></div3>
					<div3 type="part" n="8">
						<head>PART 8</head>
						<p>When the bowels are loose during the whole course of fevers, in this
							case we are most especially to warm the feet, and see that they are
							properly treated with cerates, and wrapped in shawls, so that they
							may not become colder than the rest of the body; but when they are
							hot, no fomentation must be made to them, but care is to be taken
							that they do not become cold; and very little drink is to be used,
							either cold water or hydromel. In those cases of fever where the bowels
							are loose, and the mind is disordered, the greater number of patients
							pick the wool from their blankets, scratch their noses, answer briefly
							when questions are put to them, but, when left to themselves, utter
							nothing that is rational. Such attacks appear to me to be connected
							with black bile. When in these cases there is a colliquative diarrhoea,
							I am of opinion that we ought to give the colder and thicker ptisans,
							and that the drinks ought to be binding, of a vinous nature, and rather
							astringent. In cases of fever attended from the first with vertigo,
							throbbing of the head, and thin urine, you may expect the fever to
							be exacerbated at the crisis; neither need it excite wonder, although
							there be delirium. When, at the commencement, the urine is cloudy
							or thick, it is proper to purge gently, provided this be otherwise
							proper; but when the urine at first is<pb id="p.86"/> thin, do not purge such patients,
							but, if thought necessary, give a clyster; such patients should be
							thus treated; they should be kept in a quiet state, have unguents
							applied to them, and be covered up properly with clothes, and they
							should use for drink a watery hydromel, and the juice of ptisan as
							a draught in the evening; clear out the bowels at first with a clyster,
							but give no purgative medicines to them, for, if you move the bowels
							strongly, the urine is not concocted, but the fever remains long,
							without sweats and without a crisis. Do not give draughts when the
							time of the crisis is at hand, if there be agitation, but only when
							the fever abates and is alleviated. It is proper to be guarded at
							the crises of other fevers, and to withhold the draughts at that season.
							Fevers of this description are apt to be protracted, and to have determinations,
							if the inferior extremities be cold, about the ears and neck, or,
							if these parts are not cold, to have other changes; they have epistaxis,
							and disorder of the bowels. But in cases of fever attended with nausea,
							or distention of the hypochondria, when the patients cannot lie reclined
							in the same position, and the extremities are cold, the greatest care
							and precaution are necessary; nothing should be given to them, except
							oxymel diluted with water; no draught should be administered, until
							the fever abate and the urine be concocted; the patient should be
							laid in a dark apartment, and recline upon the softest couch, and
							he should be kept as long as possible in the same position, so as
							not to toss about, for this is particularly beneficial to him. Apply
							to the hypochondrium linseed by inunctions, taking care that he do

						<p>The aspects of the sick are various; wherefore the physician <pb id="p.87"/>should
							pay attention, that he may not miss observing the exciting causes,
							as far as they can be ascertained by reasoning, nor such symptoms
							as should appear on an even or odd day, but he ought to be particularly
							guarded in observing the odd days, as it is in them, more especially,
							that changes take place in patients. He should mark, particularly,
							the first day on which the patient became ill, considering when and
							whence the disease commenced, for this is of primary importance to
							know. When you examine the patient, inquire into all particulars;
							first how the head is, and if there be no headache, nor heaviness
							in it; then examine if the hypochondria and sides be free of pain; for if the hypochondrium
							be painful, swelled, and unequal, with a sense of satiety, or if there
							be pain in the side, and, along with the pain, either cough, tormina,
							or belly-ache, if any of these symptoms be present in the hypochondrium,
							the bowels should be opened with clysters, and the patient should
							drink boiled hydromel in a hot state. The physician should ascertain
							whether the patient be apt to faint when he is raised up, and whether
							his breathing be free; and examine the discharges from the bowels,
							whether they be very black, or of a proper color, like those of persons
							in good health, and ascertain whether the fever has a paroxysm every
							third day, and look well to such persons on those days. And should
							the fourth day prove like the third, the patient is in a dangerous
							state. With regard to the symptoms, black stools prognosticate death;
							but if they resemble the discharges of a healthy person, and if such
							is their appearance every day, it is a favorable symptom; but when
							the bowels do not yield to a suppository, and when, though the respiration
							be natural, the patient when raised to the night table, or even in
							bed, be seized with deliquium, you may expect that the patient, man
							or woman, who experiences these symptoms, is about to fall
							into a state of delirium. Attention also should be paid to the hands,
							for if they tremble, you may expect epistaxis; and observe the nostrils,
							whether the breath be drawn in equally by both; and if expiration
							by the nostrils be large, a convulsion is apt to take place; and should
							a convulsion occur to such a person, death may be anticipated, and
							it is well to announce it beforehand.</p></div3>

							If, in a winter fever, the tongue be rough, and if there be swoonings,
							it is likely to be the remission of the fever. Nevertheless such a
							person is to be kept upon a restricted diet, with water for drink,
							and hydromel, and the strained juices, not trusting to the remission
							of the fevers, as persons having these symptoms are in danger of dying;
							when, therefore, you perceive these symptoms, announce this prognostic,
							if you shall judge proper, after making the suitable observations.
							When, in fevers, any dangerous symptom appears on the fifth day, when
							watery discharges suddenly take place from the bowels, when deliquium
							animi occurs, or the patient is attacked with loss of speech, convulsions,
							or hiccup, under such circumstances he is likely to be affected with
							nausea, and sweats break out under the nose and forehead, or on the
							back part of the neck and head, and patients with such symptoms shortly
							die, from stoppage of the respiration. When, in fevers, abscesses
							form about the legs, and, getting into a chronic state, are not concocted
							while the fever persists, and if one is seized with a sense of suffocation
							in the throat, while the fauces are not swelled, and if it do not
							come to maturation, but is repressed, in such a case there is apt
							to be a flow of blood from the nose; if this, then, be copious, it
							indicates a resolution of the disease, but if not, a prolongation
							of the complaint; and the less the discharge, so much worse the symptoms,
							and the more protracted the disease; but if the other symptoms are
							very favorable, expect in such a case that pains will fall upon the
							feet; if then they attack the feet, and if these continue long in
							a very painful, and inflamed state, and if there be no resolution,
							the pains will extend by degrees to the neck, to the clavicle, shoulder,
							breast, or to some articulation, in which an inflammatory tumor will
							necessarily form. When these are reduced, if the hands are contracted,
							and become trembling, convulsion and delirium seize such a person;
							but blisters break out on the eyebrow, erythema takes place, the one
							eyelid being tumefied overtops the other, a hard inflammation sets
							in, the eye become strongly swelled, and the delirium increases much,
							but makes its attacks rather at night than by day. These symptoms
							more frequently occur on odd than on even<pb id="p.89"/> days, but, whether on the
							one or the other, they are of a fatal character. Should you determine
							to give purgative medicines in such cases, at the commencement, you
							should do so before the fifth day, if there be borborygmi in the bowels,
							or, if not, you should omit the medicines altogether. If there be
							borborygmi, with bilious stools, purge moderately with scammony; but
							with regard to the treatment otherwise, administer as few drinks and
							draughts as until there be some amendment, and the disease is past
							the fourteenth day. When loss of speech seizes a person, on the fourteenth
							day of a fever, there is not usually a speedy resolution, nor any
							removal of the disease, for this symptom indicates a protracted disease;
							and when it appears on that day, it will be still more prolonged.
							When, on the fourth day of a fever, the tongue articulates confusedly,
							and when there are watery and bilious discharges from the bowels,
							such a patient is apt to fall into a state of delirium; the physician
							ought, therefore, to watch him, and attend to whatever symptoms may
							turn up. In the season of summer and autumn an epistaxis, suddenly
							occurring in acute diseases, indicates vehemence of the attack, and
							inflammation in the course of the veins, and on the day following,
							the discharge of thin urine; and if the patient be in the prime of
							life, and if his body be strong from exercise, and brawny, or of a
							melancholic temperament, or if from drinking has trembling hands,
							it may be well to announce beforehand either delirium or convulsion;
							and if these symptoms occur on even days, so much the better; but
							on critical days, they are of a deadly character. If, then, a copious
							discharge of blood procure an issue to the fullness thereof about
							the nose, or what is collected about the anus, there will be an abscess,
							or pains in the hypochondrium, or testicles, or in the limbs; and
							when these are resolved, there will be a discharge of thick sputa,
							and of smooth, thin urine. In fever attended with singultus, give
							asafoetida, oxymel, and carrot, triturated together, in a draught;
							or galbanum in honey, and cumin in a linctus, or the juice of ptisan.
							Such a person cannot escape, unless critical sweats and gentle sleep
							supervene, and thick and acrid urine be passed, or the disease terminate
							in <pb id="p.90"/>an abscess: give pine-fruit and myrrh in a linctus, and further
							give a very little oxymel to drink; but if they are very thirsty,
							some barley-water. </p></div3>

							Peripneumonia, and pleuritic affections, are to be thus observed:
							If the fever be acute, and if there be pains on either side, or in
							both, and if expiration be if cough be present, and the sputa expectorated
							be of a blond or livid color, or likewise thin, frothy, and florid,
							or having any other character different from the common, in such a
							case, the physician should proceed thus: if the pain pass upward to
							the clavicle, or the breast, or the arm, the inner vein in the arm
							should be opened on the side affected, and blood abstracted according
							to the habit, age, and color of the patient, and the season of the
							year, and that largely and boldly, if the pain be acute, so as to
							bring on deliquium animi, and afterwards a clyster is to be given.
							But if the pain be below the chest, and if very intense, purge the
							bowels gently in such an attack of pleurisy, and during the act of
							purging give nothing; but after the purging give oxymel. The medicine
							is to be administered on the fourth day; on the first three days after
							the commencement, a clyster should be given, and if it does not relieve
							the patient, he should then be gently purged, but he is to be watched
							until the fever goes off, and till the seventh day; then if he appear
							to be free from danger, give him some unstrained ptisan, in small
							quantity, and thin at first, mixing it with honey. If the expectoration
							be easy, and the breathing free, if his sides be free of pain, and
							if the fever be gone, he may take the ptisan thicker, and in larger
							quantity, twice a day. But if he do not progress favorably, he must
							get less of the drink, and of the draught, which should be thin, and
							only given once a day, at whatever is judged to be the most favorable
							hour; this you will ascertain from the urine. The draught is not to
							be given to persons after fever, until you see that the urine and
							sputa are concocted (if, indeed, after the administration of the medicine
							he be purged frequently, it may be necessary to give it, but it should
							be given in smaller quantities and thinner than usual, for from inanition
							he will be unable to sleep, or digest properly, or wait the crisis);
							but when the melting down of crude matters has <pb id="p.91"/>taken place, and his
							system has cast off what is offensive, there will then be no objection.
							The sputa are concocted when they resemble pus, and the urine when
							it has reddish sediments like tares. But there is nothing to prevent
							fomentations and cerates being applied for the other pains of the
							sides; and the legs and loins may be rubbed with hot oil, or anointed
							with fat; linseed, too, in the form of a cataplasm, may be applied
							to the hypochondrium and as far up as the breasts. When pneumonia
							is at its height, the case is beyond remedy if he is not purged, and
							it is bad if he has dyspnoea, and urine that is thin and acrid, and
							if sweats come out about the neck and head, for such sweats are bad,
							as proceeding from the suffocation, rales, and the violence of the
							disease which is obtaining the upper hand, unless there be a copious
							evacuation of thick urine, and the sputa be concocted; when either
							of these come on spontaneously, that will carry off the disease. A
							linctus for pneumonia: Galbanum and pine-fruit in Attic honey; and
							southernwood in oxymel; make a decoction of pepper and black hellebore,
							and give it in cases of pleurisy attended with violent pain at the
							commencement. It is also a good thing to boil opoponax in oxymel,
							and, having strained it, to give it to drink; it answers well, also,
							in diseases of the liver, and in severe pains proceeding from the
							diaphragm, and in all cases in which it is beneficial to determine
							to the bowels or urinary organs, when given in wine and honey; when
							given to act upon the bowels, it should be drunk in larger quantity,

							Disorders connected with regimen, for the most part, make their attack
							accordingly as any one has changed his habitual mode of diet. For
							persons who dine contrary to custom experience much swelling of the
							stomach, drowsiness, and fullness; and if they take supper over and
							above, their belly is disordered; such persons will be benefited by
							sleeping after taking the bath, and by walking slowly for a considerable
							time after sleep; if, then, the bowels be moved, he may dine and drink
							a small quantity of wine not much diluted; but if the bowels are not
							opened, he should get his body rubbed with hot oil, and, if thirsty,
							drink of some weak and white wine, or a sweet wine, and take repose;
							if he does not sleep he should repose the longer. In other respects
							he should observe the regimen laid down for those who have taken a
							debauch. With regard to the bad effects of drinks, such as are of
							a watery nature pass more slowly through the body, they regurgitate,
							as it were, and float about the hypochondria, and do not flow readily
							by urine; when filled up with such a drink, he should not attempt
							any violent exertion, requiring either strength or swiftness, but
							should rest as much as possible until the drink has been digested
							along with the food; but such drinks as are stronger or more austere,
							occasion palpitation in the body and throbbing in the head, and in
							this case the person affected will do well to sleep, and take some
							hot draught for which he feels disposed; for abstinence is bad in
							headache and the effects of a surfeit. Those who, contrary to usage,
							restrict themselves to one meal, feel empty and feeble, and pass hot
							urine in consequence of the emptiness of their vessels; they have
							a salt and bitter taste in the mouth; they tremble at any work they
							attempt; their temples throb; and they cannot digest their supper
							so well as if they had <pb id="p.94"/>previously taken their dinner. Such persons
							should take less supper than they are wont, and a pudding of barley-meal
							more moist than usual instead of bread, and of potherbs the dock,
							or mallow, and ptisan, or beets, and along with the food they should
							take wine in moderation, and diluted with water; after supper they
							should take a short walk, until the urine descend and be passed; and
							they may use boiled fish. 
							Articles of food have generally such effects as the following: Garlic
							occasions flatulence and heat about the chest, heaviness of the head,
							and nausea, and any other habitual pain is apt to be exasperated by
							it; it is diuretic, which, in so far, is a good property which it
							possesses; but to eat it when one means to drink to excess, or when
							intoxicated. Cheese produces flatulence and constipation, and heats
							the other articles of food; and it gives rise to crudities and indigestion,
							but it is worst of all to eat it along with drink after a full meal.
							Pulse of all kinds are flatulent, whether raw, boiled, or fried; least
							so when macerated in water, or in a green state; they should not be
							used except along with food prepared from the cerealia. Each of these
							articles, however, has bad effects peculiar to itself. The
							vetch, whether raw or boiled, creates flatulence and pain. The lentil
							is astringent, and disorders the stomach if taken with its hull. The
							lupine has the fewest bad effects of all these things. The stalk and
							the juice of silphium (asafoetida), pass through some people's bowels
							very readily, but in others, not accustomed to them, they engender
							what is called dry cholera; this complaint is more especially produced
							by it if mixed with much cheese, or eaten along with beef. Melancholic
							diseases are most particularly exacerbated by beef, for it is of an
							unmanageable nature, and requires no ordinary powers of stomach to
							digest it; it will agree best with those who use it well boiled and
							pretty long kept. Goat's flesh has all the bad properties of beef;
							it is an indigestible, more flatulent and engenders acid eructations
							and cholera; such as has a fragrant smell, is firm, and sweet to the
							taste, is the best, when well baked and cooled; but those kinds which
							are disagreeable to the taste, have a bad smell, and are hard, such
							are particularly bad, and especially if very fresh; it is best in
							summer and worst <pb id="p.95"/>in autumn. The flesh of young pigs is bad, either
							when it is too raw or when it is over-roasted, for it engenders bile
							and disorders the bowels. Of all kinds of flesh, pork is the best;
							it is best when neither very fat, nor, on the other hand, very lean,
							and the animal had not attained the age of what is reckoned an old
							victim; it should be eaten without the skin, and in a coldish state.</p></div3>

							<p>IN THASUS, about the autumn equinox, and under the Pleiades, the
								rains were abundant, constant, and soft, with southerly winds; the
								winter southerly, the northerly winds faint, droughts; on the whole,
								the winter having the character of spring. The spring was southerly,
								cool, rains small in quantity. Summer, for the most part, cloudy,
								no rain, the Etesian winds, rare and small, blew in an irregular manner.
								The whole constitution of the season being thus inclined to the southerly,
								and with droughts early in the spring, from the preceding opposite
								and northerly state, ardent fevers occurred in a few instances, and
								these very mild, being rarely attended with hemorrhage, and never
								proving fatal. Swellings appeared about the ears, in many on either
								side, and in the greatest number on both sides, being unaccompanied
								by fever so as not to confine the patient to bed; in all cases they
								disappeared without giving trouble, neither did any of them come to
								suppuration, as is common in swellings from other causes. They were
								of a lax, large, diffused character, without inflammation or pain,
								and they went away without any critical sign. They seized children,
								adults, and mostly those who were engaged in the exercises of the
								palestra and gymnasium, but seldom attacked women. Many had dry coughs
								without expectoration, and accompanied with hoarseness of voice. In
								some instances earlier, and in others later, inflammations with pain
								seized sometimes one of <pb id="p.101"/>the testicles, and sometimes both; some of
								these cases were accompanied with fever and some not; the greater
								part of these were attended with much suffering. In other respects
								they were free of disease, so as not to require medical assistance.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="2">
							<head>PART 2</head>
							<p>Early in the beginning of spring, and through the summer, and towards
								winter, many of those who had been long gradually declining, took
								to bed with symptoms of phthisis; in many cases formerly of a doubtful
								character the disease then became confirmed; in these the constitution
								inclined to the phthisical. Many, and, in fact, the most of them,
								died; and of those confined to bed, I do not know if a single individual
								survived for any considerable time; they died more suddenly than is
								common in such cases. But other diseases, of a protracted character,
								and attended with fever, were well supported, and did not prove fatal:
								of these we will give a description afterwards. Consumption was the
								most considerable of the diseases which then prevailed, and the only
								one which proved fatal to many persons. Most of them were affected
								by these diseases in the following manner: fevers accompanied with
								rigors, of the continual type, acute, having no complete intermissions,
								but of the form of the semi-tertians, being milder the one day, and
								the next having an exacerbation, and increasing in violence; constant
								sweats, but not diffused over the whole body; extremities very cold,
								and warmed with difficulty; bowels disordered, with bilious, scanty,
								unmixed, thin, pungent, and frequent dejections. The urine was thin,
								colorless, unconcocted, or thick, with a deficient sediment, not settling
								favorably, but casting down a crude and unseasonable sediment. Sputa
								small, dense, concocted, but brought up rarely and with difficulty;
								and in those who encountered the most violent symptoms there was no
								concoction at all, but they continued throughout spitting crude matters.
								Their fauces, in most of them, were painful from first to last, having
								redness with inflammation; defluxions thin, small and acrid; they
								were soon wasted and became worse, having no appetite for any kind
								of food throughout; no thirst; most persons delirious when near death.
								So much concerning the phthisical affections.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="3">
							<head>PART 3</head>
							<p>In the course of the summer and autumn many fevers of the <pb id="p.102"/>continual
								type, but not violent; they attacked persons who had been long indisposed,
								but who were otherwise not in an uncomfortable state. In most cases
								the bowels were disordered in a very moderate degree, and they did
								not suffer thereby in any manner worth mentioning; the urine was generally
								well colored, clear, thin, and after a time becoming concocted near
								the crisis. They had not much cough, nor it troublesome; they were
								not in appetite, for it was necessary to give them food (on the whole,
								persons laboring under phthisis were not affected in the usual manner).
								They were affected with fevers, rigors, and deficient sweats, with
								varied and irregular paroxysms, in general not intermitting, but having
								exacerbations in the tertian form. The earliest crisis which occurred
								was about the twentieth day, in most about the fortieth, and in many
								about the eightieth. But there were cases in which it did not leave
								them thus at all, but in an irregular manner, and without any crisis;
								in most of these the fevers, after a brief interval, relapsed again;
								and from these relapses they came to a crisis in the same periods;
								but in many they were prolonged so that the disease was not gone at
								the approach of winter. Of all those which are described under this
								constitution, the phthisical diseases alone were of a fatal character;
								for in all the others the patients bore up well, and did not die of
								the other fevers.</p>

							<p>In Thasus, early in autumn, the winter suddenly set in rainy before
								the usual time, with much northerly and southerly winds. These things
								all continued so during the season of the Pleiades, and until their
								setting. The winter was northerly, the rains frequent, in torrents,
								and large, with snow, but with a frequent mixture of fair weather.
								These things were all so, but the setting in of the cold was not much
								out of season. After the winter solstice, and at the time when the
								zephyr usually begins to blow, severe winterly storms out of season,
								with much northerly wind, snow, continued and copious rains; the sky
								tempestuous and clouded; these things were protracted, and did not
								remit until the equinox. The spring was cold, northerly, rainy, and
								clouded;<pb id="p.103"/> the summer was not very sultry, the Etesian winds blew constant,
								but quickly afterwards, about the rising of Arcturus, there were again
								many rains with north winds. The whole season being wet, cold, and
								northerly, people were, for the most part, healthy during winter;
								but early in the spring very many, indeed, the greater part, were
								valetudinary. At first ophthalmies set in, with rheums, pains, unconcocted
								discharges, small concretions, generally breaking with difficulty,
								in most instances they relapsed, and they did not cease until late
								in autumn. During summer and autumn there were dysenteric affections,
								attacks of tenesmus and lientery, bilious diarrhoea, with thin, copious,
								undigested, and acrid dejections, and sometimes with watery stools;
								many had copious defluxions, with pain, of a bilious, watery, slimy,
								purulent nature, attended with strangury, not connected with disease
								of the kidneys, but one complaint succeeding the other; vomitings
								of bile, phlegm, and undigested food, sweats, in all cases a redundance
								of humors. In many instances these complaints were unattended with
								fever, and did not prevent the patients from walking about, but some
								cases were febrile, as will be described. In some all those described
								below occurred with pain. During autumn, and at the commencement of
								winter, there were phthisical complaints, continual fevers; and, in
								a few cases, ardent; some diurnal, others nocturnal, semi-tertians,
								true tertians, quartans, irregular fevers.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="2">
							<head>PART 2</head>
							<p>All the fevers which are described attacked great numbers. The ardent fevers
								attacked the smallest numbers, and the patients suffered the least
								from them, for there were no hemorrhages, except a few and to a small
								amount, nor was there delirium; all the other complaints were slight;
								in these the crises were regular, in most instances, with the intermittents,
								in seventeen days; and I know no instance of a person dying of causus,
								nor becoming phrenitic. The tertians were more numerous than the ardent
								fevers, and attended with more pain; but these all had four periods
								in regular succession from the first attack, and they had a complete
								crisis in seven, without a relapse in any instance. The quartans attacked
								many at first, in the form of regular quartans, but in no few cases
								a transition from other fevers and diseases into quartans took place;
								they were<pb id="p.104"/> protracted, as is wont with them, indeed, more so than usual. Quotidian, nocturnal, and wandering fevers attacked many persons,
								some of whom continued to keep up, and others were confined to bed.
								In most instances these fevers were prolonged under the Pleiades and
								till winter. Many persons, and more especially children, had convulsions
								from the commencement; and they had fever, and the convulsions supervened
								upon the fevers; in most cases they were protracted, but free from
								danger, unless in those who were in a deadly state from other complaints.
								Those fevers which were continual in the main, and with no intermissions,
								but having exacerbations in the tertian form, there being remissions
								the one day and exacerbations the next, were the most violent of all
								those which occurred at that time, and the most protracted, and occurring
								with the greatest pains, beginning mildly, always on the whole increasing,
								and being exacerbated, and always turning worse, having small remissions,
								and after an abatement having more violent paroxysms, and growing
								worse, for the most part, on the critical days. Rigors, in all cases,
								took place in an irregular and uncertain manner, very rare and weak
								in them, but greater in all other fevers; frequent sweats, but most
								seldom in them, bringing no alleviation, but, on the contrary, doing
								mischief. Much cold of the extremities in them, and these were warmed
								with difficulty. Insomnolency, for the most part, especially in these
								fevers, and again a disposition to coma. The bowels, in all diseases,
								were disordered, and in a bad state, but worst of all in these. The
								urine, in most of them, was either thin and crude, yellow, and after
								a time with slight symptoms of concoction in a critical form, or having
								the proper thickness, but muddy, and neither settling nor subsiding;
								or having small and bad, and crude sediments; these being the worst
								of all. Coughs attended these fevers, but I cannot state that any
								harm or good ever resulted from the cough.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="3">
							<head>PART 3</head>
							<p>The most of these were protracted and troublesome, went on in a
								very disorderly and irregular form, and, for the most part, did in
								a crisis, either in the fatal cases or in the others; for if it left
								some of them for a season it soon returned again. In a few instances
								the lever terminated with a crisis;<pb id="p.105"/> in the earliest of these about
								the eightieth day, and some of these relapsed, so that most of them
								were not free from the fever during the winter; but the fever left
								most of them without a crisis, and these things happened alike to
								those who recovered and to those who did not. There being much want
								of crisis and much variety as to these diseases, the greatest and
								worst symptom attended the most of them, namely, a loathing of all
								articles of food, more especially with those who had otherwise fatal
								symptoms; but they were not unseasonably thirsty in such fevers. After
								a length of time, with much suffering and great wasting, abscesses
								were formed in these cases, either unusually large, so that the patients
								could not support them, or unusually small, so that they did no good,
								but soon relapsed and speedily got worse. The diseases which attacked
								them were in the form of dysenteries, tenesmus, lientery, and fluxes;
								but, in some cases, there were dropsies, with or without these complaints.
								Whatever attacked them violently speedily cut them off, or again,
								did them no good. Small rashes, and not corresponding to the violence
								of the disease, and quickly disappearing, or swellings occurred about
								the ears, which were not resolved, and brought on no crisis. In some
								they were determined to the joints, and especially to the hip-joint,
								terminating critically with a few, and quickly again increasing to
								its original habit.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="4">
							<head>PART 4</head>
							<p>Perons died of all these diseases, but mostly of these fevers,
								and notably infants just weaned, and older children, until eight or
								ten years of age, and those before puberty. These things occurred
								to those affected with the complaints described above, and to many
								persons at first without them. The only favorable symptom, and the
								greatest of those which occurred, and what saved most of those who
								were in the greatest dangers, was the conversion of it to a strangury,
								and when, in addition to this, abscesses were formed. The strangury
								attacked, most especially, persons of the ages I have mentioned, but
								it also occurred in many others, both of those who were not confined
								to bed and those who were. There was a speedy and great change in
								all these cases. For the bowels, if they happened previously to have
								watery discharges of a bad character, became regular, they got an
								appetite for food, and the <pb id="p.106"/>fevers were mild afterwards. But, with
								regard to the strangury itself, the symptoms were protracted and painful.
								Their urine was copious, thick, of various characters, red, mixed
								with pus, and was passed with pain. These all recovered, and I did
								not see a single instance of death among them.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="5">
							<head>PART 5</head>
							<p>With regard to the dangers of these cases, one must always attend
								to the seasonable concoction of all the evacuations, and to the favorable
								and critical abscesses. The concoctions indicate a speedy crisis and
								recovery of health; crude and undigested evacuations, and those which
								are converted into bad abscesses, indicate either want of crisis,
								or pains, or prolongation of the disease, or death, or relapses; which
								of these it is to be must be determined from other circumstances.
								<hi rend="ital">The physician must be able to tell the antecedents, know the present,
									and foretell the future- must mediate these things, and have two special
									objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do
									no harm. The art consists in three things- the disease, the patient,
									and the physician. The physician is the servant of the art, and the
									patient must combat the disease along with the physician.</hi><note>
										I need scarcely remark that this passage is of classical celebrity.  Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the first time he read it he thought it unworthy of Hippocrates to lay it down as a rule of practice, that "the physician should do good to his patient, or at least no harm;" but that, after having seen a good deal of the practice of other physicians, and observed how often they were justly exposed to censure for having bled, or applied the bath, or given medicines, or wine unseaonably, he came to recognize the propriety and importance of the rule laid down by Hippocrates.  The practice of certain physicians, Galen remarks, is like playing at the dice, when what turns up may occasion the greatest mischief to their patients.  The last clause of this passage is very forcibly put.  Galen, however, informs us that in some of th MSS. instead of "art" he found "nature"; that is to say, that the physician is "the minister (<hi rend="ital">or</hi> servant) of nature." Either of the readings, he remarks, will agree very well with the meaning of the passage.</note></p></div4>

							<p>Pains about the head and neck, and heaviness of the same along

								in persons attacked with frenzy, and having vomitings of verdigris-green

								those other fevers in which there is pain of the neck, heaviness of
								the temples, mistiness about the eyes, and distention about the hypochondriac
								region, not unattended with pain, hemorrhage from the nose takes place,
								but <pb id="p.107"/>those who have heaviness of the whole head, cardialgia and nausea,
								vomit bilious and pituitous matters; children, in such affections,

							<p>In Thasus, a little before and during the season of Arcturus, there
								were frequent and great rains, with northerly winds. About the equinox,
								and till the setting of the Pleiades, there were a few southerly rains:
								the winter northerly and parched, cold, with great winds and snow.
								Great storms about the equinox, the spring northerly, dryness, rains
								few and cold. About the summer solstice, scanty rains, and great cold
								until near the season of the Dog-star. After the Dog-days, until the

								but continued and severe: no rain; the Etesian winds blew; about the

							<p>In this state of things, during winter, paraplegia set in, and
								attacked many, and some died speedily; and otherwise the disease prevailed
								much in an epidemical form, but persons remained free from all other
								diseases. Early in the spring, ardent fevers commenced and continued
								through the summer until the equinox. Those then that were attacked
								immediately after the commencement of the spring and summer, for the
								most part recovered, and but few of them died. But when the autumn
								and the rains had set in, they were of a fatal character, and the
								greater part then died. When in these attacks of ardent fevers there
								was a proper and copious hemorrhage from the nose, they were generally
								saved by it, and I do not know a single person who had a proper hemorrhage
								who died in this constitution. Philiscus, Epaminon, and Silenus, indeed,
								who had a trifling epistaxis on the fourth and fifth day, died. Most
								of those taken with had a rigor about the time of the crisis, and
								notably those who had no hemorrhage; these had also rigor associated.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="3">
							<head>PART 3</head>
							<p>Some were attacked with jaundice on the sixth day, but these were
								benefited <pb id="p.108"/>either by an urinary purgation, or a disorder of the bowels,
								or a copious hemorrhage, as in the case of Heraclides, who was lodged
								with Aristocydes: this person, though he had the hemorrhage from the
								nose, the purgation by the bladder, and disorder of the bowels, experienced
								a favorable crisis on the twentieth day, not like the servant of Phanagoras,
								who had none of these symptoms, and died. The hemorrhages attacked
								most persons, but especially young persons and those in the prime
								of life, and the greater part of those who had not the hemorrhage
								died: elderly persons had jaundice or disorder of the bowels, such
								as Bion, who was lodged with Silenus. Dysenteries were epidemical
								during the summer, and some of those cases in which the hemorrhage
								occurred, terminated in dysentery, as happened to the slave of Eraton,
								and to Mullus, who had a copious hemorrhage, which settled down into
								dysentery, and they recovered. This humor was redundant in many cases,
								since in those who had not the hemorrhage about the crisis, but the
								risings about the ears disappeared, after their disappearance there
								was a sense of weight in the left flank extending to the extremity
								of the hip, and pain setting in after the crisis, with a discharge
								of thin urine; they began to have small hemorrhages about the twenty-fourth
								day, and the swelling was converted into the hemorrhage. In the case
								of Antiphon, the son of Critobulus' son, the fever ceased and came
								to a crisis about the fortieth day.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="4">
							<head>PART 4</head>
							<p>Many women were attacked, but fewer than of the men, and there were
								fewer deaths among them. But most of them had difficult parturition,
								and after labor they were taken ill, and these most especially died,
								as, for example, the daughter of Telebolus died on the sixth day after
								delivery. Most females had the menstrual discharge during the fever,
								and many girls had it then for the first time: in certain individuals
								both the hemorrhage from the nose and the menses appeared; thus, in
								the case of the virgin daughter of Daetharses, the menses then took
								place for the first time, and she had also a copinous hemorrhage from
								the nose, and I knew no instance of any one dying when one or other
								of these took place properly. But all those in the pregnant state
								that were attacked had abortions, as far as I observed. The urine
								in most cases was of the proper color, but thin, and having scanty
								sediments: in <pb id="p.109"/>most the bowels were disordered with thin and bilious
								dejections; and many, after passing through the other crises, terminated
								in dysenteries, as happened to Xenophanes and Critias. The urine was
								watery, copious, clear, and thin; and even after the crises, when
								the sediment was natural, and all the other critical symptoms were
								favorable, as I recollect having happened to Bion, who was lodged
								in the house of Silenus, and Critias, who lived with Xenophanes, the
								slave of Areton, and the wife of Mnesistratus. But afterwards all
								these were attacked with dysentery. It would be worth while to inquire
								whether the watery urine was the cause of this. About the season of
								Arcturus many had the crisis on the eleventh day, and in them the
								regular relapses did not take place, but they became comatose about
								this time, especially children; but there were fewest deaths of all
								among them.</p></div4>

							<p>About the equinox, and until the season of the Pleiades, and at
								the approach of winter, many ardent fevers set in; but great numbers
								at that season were seized with phrenitis, and many died; a few cases
								also occurred during the summer. These then made their attack at the
								commencement of ardent fevers, which were attended with fatal symptoms;
								for immediately upon their setting in, there were acute fever and
								small rigors, insomnolency, aberration, thirst, nausea, insignificant
								sweats about the forehead and clavicles, but no general perspiration;
								they had much delirious talking, fears, despondency, great coldness
								of the extremities, in the feet, but more especially in their hands:
								the paroxysms were on the even days; and in most cases, on the fourth
								day, the most violent pains set in, with sweats, generally coldish,
								and the extremities could not be warmed, but were livid and rather
								cold, and they had then no thirst; in them the urine was black, scanty,
								thin, and the bowels were constipated; there was an hemorrhage from
								the nose in no case in which these symptoms occurred, but merely a
								trifling epistaxis; and none of them had a relapse, but they died
								on the sixth day with sweats. In the phrenitic cases, all the symptoms
								which have been described did not occur, but in them the disease mostly
								came to a crisis on the eleventh day, and in some on the twentieth.
								In those cases in which the phrenitis did not begin immediately, but
								about the <pb id="p.110"/>third or fourth day, the disease was moderate at the commencement,
								but assumed a violent character about the seventh day. There was a
								great number of diseases, and of those affected, they who died were
								principally infants, young persons, adults having smooth bodies, white
								skins, straight and black hair, dark eyes, those living recklessly
								and luxuriously; persons with shrill, or rough voices, who stammered
								and were passionate, and women more especially died from this form.
								In this constitution, four symptoms in particular proved salutary;
								either a hemorrhage from the nose, or a copious discharge by the bladder
								of urine, having an abundant and proper sediment, or a bilious disorder
								of the bowels at the proper time, or an attack of dysentery. And in
								many cases it happened, that the crisis did not take place by any
								one of the symptoms which have been mentioned, but the patient passed
								through most of them, and appeared to be in an uncomfortable way,
								and yet all who were attacked with these symptoms recovered. All the
								symptoms which I have described occurred also to women and girls;
								and whoever of them had any of these symptoms in a favorable manner,
								or the menses appeared abundantly, were saved thereby, and had a crisis,
								so that I do not know a single female who had any of these favorably
								that died. But the daughter of Philo, who had a copious hemorrhage
								from the nose, and took supper unseasonably on the seventh day, died.
								In those cases of acute, and more especially of ardent fevers, in
								which there is an involuntary discharge of tears, you may expect a
								nasal hemorrhage unless the other symptoms be of a fatal type, for
								in those of a bad description, they do not indicate a hemorrhage,
								but death.</p></div4>

							<p>Swellings about the ears, with pain in fevers, sometimes when
								the fever went off critically, neither subsided nor were converted
								into pus; in these cases a bilious diarrhoea, or dysentery, or thick
								urine having a sediment, carried off the disease, as happened to Hermippus
								of Clazomenae. The circumstances relating to crises, as far as we
								can recognize them, were so far similar and so far dissimilar. Thus
								two brothers became ill at the same hour (they were brothers of Epigenes,
								and lodged near the theatre), of these the elder had a crisis on the
								sixth day, and the younger on the seventh, <pb id="p.111"/>and both had a relapse
								at the same hour; it then left them for five days, and from the return
								of the fever both had a crisis together on the seventeenth day. Most
								had a crisis on the sixth day; it then left them for six days, and
								from the relapse there was a crisis on the fifth day. But those who
								had a crisis on the seventh day, had an intermission for seven days;
								and the crisis took place on the third day after the relapse. Those
								who had a crisis on the sixth day, after an interval of six days were
								seized again on the third, and having left them for one day, the fever
								attacked them again on the next and came to a crisis, as happened
								to Evagon the son of Daetharses. Those in whom the crisis happened
								on the sixth day, had an intermission of seven days, and from the
								relapse there was a crisis on the fourth, as happened to the daughter
								of Aglaidas. The greater part of those who were taken ill under this
								constitution of things, were affected in this manner, and I did not
								know a single case of recovery, in which there was not a relapse agreeably
								to the stated order of relapses; and all those recovered in which
								the relapses took place according to this form: nor did I know a single
								instance of those who then passed through the disease in this manner
								who had another relapse.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="7">
							<head>PART 7</head>
							<p>In these diseases death generally happened on the sixth day, as
								with Epaminondas, Silenus, and Philiscus the son of Antagoras. Those
								who had parotid swellings experienced a crisis on the twentieth day,
								but in all these cases the disease went off without coming to a suppuration,
								and was turned upon the bladder. But in Cratistonax, who lived by
								the temple of Hercules, and in the maid servant of Scymnus the fuller,
								it turned to a suppuration, and they died. Those who had a crisis
								on the seventh day, had an intermission of nine days, and a relapse
								which came to a crisis on the fourth day from the return of the fever,
								as was the case with Pantacles, who resided close by the temple of
								Bacchus. Those who had a crisis on the seventh day, after an interval
								of six days had a relapse, from which they had a crisis on the seventh
								day, as happened to Phanocritus, who was lodged with Gnathon the fuller.
								During the winter, about the winter solstices, and until the equinox,
								the ardent fevers and frenzies prevailed, and many died. The crisis,
								however, changed, and <pb id="p.112"/>happened to the greater number on the fifth
								day from the commencement, left them for four days and relapsed; and
								after the return, there was a crisis on the fifth day, making in all
								fourteen days. The crisis took place thus in the case of most children,
								also in elder persons. Some had a crisis on the eleventh day, a relapse
								on the fourteenth, a complete crisis on the twentieth; but certain
								persons, who had a rigor about the twentieth, had a crisis on the
								fortieth. The greater part had a rigor along with the original crisis,
								and these had also a rigor about the crisis in the relapse. There
								were fewest cases of rigor in the spring, more in summer, still more
								in autumn, but by far the most in winter; then hemorrhages ceased.</p></div4>

							<p>With regard to diseases, the circumstances from which we form a
								judgment of them are,- by attending to the general nature of all,
								and the peculiar nature of each individual,- to the disease, the patient,
								and the applications,- to the person who applies them, as that makes
								a difference for better or for worse,- to the whole constitution of
								the season, and particularly to the state of the heavens, and the
								nature of each country;- to the patient's habits, regimen, and pursuits;-
								to his conversation, manners, taciturnity, thoughts, sleep, or absence
								of sleep, and sometimes his dreams, what and when they occur;- to
								his picking and scratching;- to his tears;- to the alvine discharges,
								urine, sputa, and vomitings; and to the changes of diseases from the
								one into the other;- to the deposits, whether of a deadly or critical
								character;- to the sweat, coldness, rigor, cough, sneezing, hiccup,
								respiration, eructation, flatulence, whether passed silently or with
								a noise;- to hemorrhages and hemorrhoids;- from these, and their consequences,
								we must form our judgment.</p></div4>

							<head>PART 9</head>
							<p>Fevers are,- the continual, some of which hold during the day and
								have a remission at night, and others hold a remission during the
								day; semi-tertians, tertians, quartans, quintans, septans, nonans.
								The most acute, strongest, most dangerous, and fatal diseases, occur
								in the continual fever. The least dangerous of all, and the mildest
								and most protracted,<pb id="p.113"/> is the quartan, for it is not only such from
								itself, but it also carries off other great diseases. In what is called
								the semi-tertian, other acute diseases are apt to occur, and it is
								the most fatal of all others, and moreover phthisical persons, and
								those laboring under other protracted diseases, are apt to be attacked
								by it. The nocturnal fever is not very fatal, but protracted; the
								diurnal is still more protracted, and in some cases passes into phthisis.
								The septan is protracted, but not fatal; the nonan more protracted,
								and not fatal. The true tertian comes quickly to a crisis, and is
								not fatal; but the quintan is the worst of all, for it proves fatal
								when it precedes an attack of phthisis, and when it supervenes on
								persons who are already consumptive. There are peculiar modes, and
								constitutions, and paroxysms, in every one of these fevers; for example,-
								the continual, in some cases at the very commencement, grows, as it
								were, and attains its full strength, and rises to its most dangerous
								pitch, but is diminished about and at the crisis; in others it begins
								gentle and suppressed, but gains ground and is exacerbated every day,
								and bursts forth with all its heat about and at the crisis; while
								in others, again, it commences mildly, increases, and is exacerbated
								until it reaches its acme, and then remits until at and about the
								crisis. These varieties occur in every fever, and in every disease.
								From these observations one must regulate the regimen accordingly.
								There are many other important symptoms allied to these, part of which
								have been already noticed, and part will be described afterwards,
								from a consideration of which one may judge, and decided in each case,
								whether the disease be acute, and whether it will end in death
								or recovery; or whether it will be protracted, and will end in death
								or recovery; and in what cases food is to be given, and in what not;
								and when and to what amount, and what particular kind of food is to
								be administered.</p></div4> 
						<div4 type="section" n="10">
							<head>PART 10</head>
							<p>Those diseases which have their paroxysms on even days have their
								crises on even days; and those which have their paroxysms on uneven
								days have their crises on uneven days. The first period of those which
								have the crisis on even days, is the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 20th,
								30th, 40th, 60th, 80th, 100th; and the first period of those which

								17th, 21th, 27th, 31st. It should be known, that if the crisis take
								place on any other day than on those described, it indicates that
								there will be a relapse, which may prove fatal. But one ought to pay
								attention, and know in these seasons what crises will lead to recovery
								and what to death, or to changes for the better or the worse. Irregular
								fevers, quartans, quintans, septans, and nonans should be studied,
								in order to find out in what periods their crises take place.</p>

						<div4 type="section" n="3">
							<head>Part 3</head>
							<p>Early in spring, along with the prevailing cold, there were many
								cases of erysipelas, some from a manifest cause, and some not. They
								were of a malignant nature, and proved fatal to many; many had sore-throat
								and loss of speech. There were many cases of ardent fever, phrensy,
								aphthous affections of the mouth, tumors on the genital organs; of
								ophthalmia, anthrax, disorder of the bowels, anorexia, with thirst
								and without it; of disordered urine, large in quantity, and bad in
								quality; of persons affected with coma for a long time, and then falling
								into a state of insomnolency. There were many cases of failure of
								crisis, and many of unfavorable crisis; many of dropsy and of phthisis.
								Such were the diseases then epidemic. There were patients affected
								with every one of the species which have been mentioned, and many
								died. The symptoms in each of these cases were as follows:</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="4">
							<head>Part 4</head>
							<p>In many cases erysipelas, from some obvious cause, such as an accident,
								and sometimes from even a very small wound, broke out all over the
								body, especially, in persons about sixty<pb id="p.130"/> years of age, about the head,
								if such an accident was neglected in the slightest degree; and this
								happened in some who were under treatment; great inflammation took
								place, and the erysipelas quickly spread all over. in the most of
								them abscessed ended in suppurations, and there were great fallings
								off (sloughing) of the flesh, tendons, and bones; and the defluxion
								which seated in the part was not like pus, but a sort of putrefaction,
								and the running was large and of various characters. Those cases in
								which any of these things happened about the head were accompanied
								with falling off of the hairs of the head and chin, the bones were
								laid bare and separated, and there were excessive runnings; and these
								symptoms happened in fevers and without fevers. But these things were
								more formidable in appearance than dangerous; for when the concoction
								in these cases turned to a suppuration, most of them recovered; but when the inflammation and erysipelas disappeared,
								and when no abscess was formed, a great number of these died. In like
								manner, the same things happened to whatever part of the body the
								disease wandered, for in many cases both forearm and arm dropped off;
								and in those cases in which it fell upon the sides, the parts there,
								either before or behind, got into a bad state; and in some cases the
								whole femur and bones of the leg and whole foot were laid bare. But
								of all such cases, the most formidable were those which took place
								about the pubes and genital organs.<note>The classical reader will here call to his recollection a striking passage in the celebrated description of the Plague of Athens, as given by Thucydides: "For the mischief, being at first seated in the head, spread over the whole body, and if one survived the most formidable symptoms, an attack on the extremities manifested itself; for it was determined to the genital organs and to the hands and feet, and many escaped with losing them, and some with the loss of their eyes." (ii., 49.)</note> Such was the nature of these cases
								when attended with sores, and proceeding from an external cause; but
								the same things occurred in fevers, before fevers, and after fevers.
								But those cases in which an abscess was formed, and turned
								to a suppuration, or a seasonable diarrhea or discharge of good urine
								took place, were relieved thereby: but those cases in which none of
								these symptoms occurred, but they disappeared without a crisis, proved
								fatal. The greater number of these erysipelatous cases <pb id="p.131"/>took place
								in the spring, but were prolonged through the summer and during autumn.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="5">
							<head>Part 5</head>
							<p>In certain cases there was much disorder, and tumors about the
								fauces, and inflammations of the tongue, and abscesses about the teeth.
								And many were attacked with impairment or loss of speech; at first,
								those in the commencement of phthisis, but also persons in ardent
								fever and in phrenitis.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="6">
							<head>Part 6</head>
							<p>The cases of ardent fever and phrenitis occurred early in spring
								after the cold set in, and great numbers were taken ill at that time,
								and these cases were attended with acute and fatal symptoms. The constitution
								of the ardent fevers which then occurred was as follows: at the commencement
								they were affected with coma, nausea, and rigors; fever acute, not
								much thirst, nor delirium, slight epistaxis, the paroxysms for the
								most part on even days; and, about the time of the paroxysms, forgetfulness,
								loss of strength and of speech, the extremities, that is to say, the
								hands and feet, at all times, but more especially about the time of
								the paroxysms, were colder than natural; they slowly and imperfectly
								became warmed, and again recovered their recollection and speech.
								They were constantly affected either with coma, in which they got no sleep, or with insomnolency, attended with pains;
								most had disorders of the bowels, attended with undigested, thin,
								and copious evacuations; urine copious, thin, having nothing critical
								nor favorable about it; neither was there any other critical appearance
								in persons affected thus; for neither was there any proper hemorrhage,
								nor any other of the accustomed evacuations, to prove a crisis. They
								died, as it happened, in an irregular manner, mostly about the crisis,
								but in some instances after having lost their speech for a long time,
								and having had copious sweats. These were the symptoms which marked
								the fatal cases of ardent fever; similar symptoms occurred in the
								phrenitic cases; but these were particularly free from thirst, and
								none of these had wild delirium as in other cases, but they died oppressed
								by a bad tendency to sleep, and stupor.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="7">
							<head>Part 7</head>
							<p>But there were also other fevers, as will be described. Many had
								their mouths affected with aphthous ulcerations. There were also many
								defluxions about the genital parts, and<pb id="p.132"/> ulcerations, boils (phymata),
								externally and internally, about the groins. Watery ophthalmies of
								a chronic character, with pains; fungous excrescences of the eyelids,
								externally and internally, called fig, which destroyed the sight of
								many persons. There were fungous growths, in many other instances,
								on ulcers, especially on those seated on the genital organs. There
								were many attacks of carbuncle (anthrax) through the summer, and other
								affections, which are called "the putrefaction" (<hi rend="ital">seps</hi>); also large ecthymata, and large tetters (<hi rend="ital">herpetes</hi>) in many instances.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="8">
							<head>Part 8</head>
							<p>And many and serious complaints attacked many persons in the region
								of the belly. In the first place, tenesmus, accompanied with pain,
								attacked many, but more especially children, and all who had not attained
								to puberty; and the most of these died. There were many cases of lientery
								and of dysentery; but these were not attended with much pain. The
								evacuations were bilious, and fatty, and thin, and watery; in many
								instances the disease terminated in this way, with and without fever;
								there were painful tormina and volvuli of a malignant kind; copious
								evacuations of the contents of the guts, and yet much remained behind;
								and the passages did not carry off the pains, but yielded with difficulty
								to the means administered; for in most cases purgings were hurtful
								to those affected in this manner; many died speedily, but in many
								others they held out longer. In a word, all died, both those who had
								acute attacks and those who had chronic, most especially from affections
								of the belly, for it was the belly which carried them all off.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="9">
							<head>Part 9</head>
							<p>All persons had an aversion to food in all the afore-mentioned
								complaints to a degree such as I never met with before, and persons
								in these complaints most especially, and those recovering from them,
								and in all other diseases of a mortal nature. Some were troubled with
								thirst, and some not; and both in febrile complaints and in others
								no one drank unseasonably or disobeyed injunctions.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="10">
							<head>Part 10</head>
							<p>The urine in many cases was not in proportion to the drink administered,
								but greatly in excess; and the badness of the urine voided was great,
								for it had not the proper thickness, nor concoction, nor purged properly;
								for in many cases purgings<pb id="p.133"/> by the bladder indicate favorably, but
								in the greatest number they indicated a melting of the body, disorder
								of the bowels, pains, and a want of crisis.<note>It will readily be understood that a colliquative diabetes would prove a very unfavorable complication of these complaints.</note></p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="11">
							<head>Part 11</head>
							<p>Persons laboring under phrenitis and causus were particularly
								disposed to coma; but also in all other great diseases which occurred
								along with fever. In the main, most cases were attended either by
								heavy coma, or by short and light sleep.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="12">
							<head>Part 12</head>
							<p>And many other forms of fevers were then epidemic, of tertian,
								of quartan, of nocturnal,<note>By nocturnal fevers, according to Galen, was meant quotidians, which had their paroxysms during the night.</note> of continual, of chronic, of erratic, of fevers attended with nausea, and of irregular fevers. All these were attended with much disorder, for the bowels in most cases were disordered, accompanied with rigors, sweats not of a critical character, and with the state of the urine as described. In most instances the disease
								was protracted, for neither did the deposits which took place prove
								critical as in other cases; for in all complaints and in all cases
								there was difficulty of crisis, want of crisis, and protraction of
								the disease, but most especially in these. A few had the crisis about
								the eightieth day, but in most instances it (the disease?) left them
								irregularly. A few of them died of dropsy without being confined to
								bed. And in many other diseases people were troubled with swelling,
								but more especially in phthisical cases.</p></div4>
						<div4 type="section" n="13">
							<head>Part 13</head>
							<p>The greatest and most dangerous disease, and the one that proved
								fatal to the greatest number, was consumption. With many persons it
								commenced during the winter, and of these some were confined to bed,
								and others bore up on foot; the most of those died early in spring
								who were confined to bed; of the others, the cough left not a single
								person, but it became milder through the summer; during the autumn,
								all these were confined to bed, and many of them died, but in the
								greater number of cases the disease was long protracted. Most of these
								were suddenly attacked with these diseases, having frequent rigors,
								often continual and acute fevers; unseasonable, copious,<pb id="p.134"/> and cold
								sweats throughout; great coldness, from which they had great difficulty
								in being restored to heat; the bowels variously constipated, and again
								immediately in a loose state, but towards the termination in all cases
								with violent looseness of the bowels; a determination downwards of
								all matters collected about the lungs; urine excessive, and not good;
								troublesome melting. The coughs throughout were frequent, and copious,
								digested, and liquid, but not brought up with much pain; and even
								when they had some slight pain, in all cases the purging of the matters
								about the lungs went on mildly. The fauces were not very irritable,
								nor were they troubled with any saltish humors; but there were viscid,
								white, liquid, frothy, and copious defluxions from the head. But by
								far the greatest mischief attending these and the other complaints,
								was the aversion to food, as has been described. For neither been
								described. For neither had they any relish for drink along with their

							<p>The form of body peculiarly subject to phthisical complaints was

								the appearance of wings: and women in like manner, with regard to
								the melancholic and subsanguineous, phrenitic and dysenteric affections

							<p>To all those which have been described, the season of spring was
								most inimical, and proved fatal to the greatest numbers: the summer
								was the most favorable to them, and the fewest died then; in autumn,
								and under the Pleiades, again there died great numbers. It appears
								to me, according to the reason of things, that the coming on of summer
								should have done good in these cases; for winter coming on cures the
								diseases of summer, and summer coming on removes the diseases of winter.
								And yet the summer in question was not of itself well constituted,
								for<pb id="p.135"/> it became suddenly hot, southerly, and calm; but, not withstanding,
								it proved beneficial by producing a change on the other constitution.</p></div4>

							<p>I look upon it as being a great part of the art to be able to
								judge properly of that which has been written. For he that knows and
								makes a proper use of these things, would appear to me not likely
								to commit any great mistake in the art. He ought to learn accurately
								the constitution of every one of the seasons, and of the diseases;
								whatever that is common in each constitution and disease is good,
								and whatever is bad; whatever disease will be protracted and end in
								death, and whatever will be protracted and end in recovery; which

								with insomnolency; bowels disordered at the beginning, urine thin.
								On the sixth day, passed oily urine, was delirious. On the seventh,
								all the symptoms were exacerbated; had no sleep, but the urine of
								the same characters, and the understanding disordered; alvine dejections
								bilious and fatty. On the eighth, a slight epistaxis; small vomiting
								of verdigris-green matters; slept a little. On the ninth, in the same
								state. On the tenth, all the symptoms gave way. On the eleventh, he
								sweated, but not over the whole body; he became cold, but immediately
								recovered his heat again. On the fourteenth, acute fever; discharges
								bilious, thin, and copious; substances floating in the urine; he became
								incoherent. On the seventeenth, in a painful state, for he had no
								sleep, and the fever was more intense. On the twentieth, sweated all
								over; apyrexia, dejections bilious; aversion to food, comatose. On
								the twenty-fourth, had a relapse.<pb id="p.136"/> On the thirty-fourth, apyrexia;
								bowels not confined; and he again recovered his heat. Fortieth, apyrexia,
								bowels confined for no long time, aversion to food; had again slight
								symptoms of fever, and throughout in an irregular form; apyrexia at
								times, and at others not; for if the fever intermitted, and was alleviated
								for a little, it immediately relapsed again; he used much and improper
								food; sleep bad; about the time of the relapse he was delirious; passed
								thick urine at that time, but troubled, and of bad characters; bowels

			<div1 type="text" n="VC"><head>On Injuries of the Head</head>
				<div2 type="section" n="1">
					<head>Part 1</head>
					<p>MEN'S heads are by no means all like to one another, nor are the
						sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form. Thus,
						whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence
						is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond
						the rest of it), in him the sutures of the head take the form of the
						Greek letter <hi rend="ital">tau</hi>, T; for the head has the shorter line running transverse
						before the prominence, while the other line runs through the middle
						of the head, all the way to the neck. But whoever has the prominence
						in the back part of the head, in him the sutures are constructed in
						quite the opposite form to the former; for in this case the shorter
						line runs in front of the prominence, while the longer runs through
						the middle all along to the forehead. But whoever has a prominence
						of the head both before and behind, in him the sutures resemble the
						Greek letter <hi rend="ital">eta</hi> E; for the long lines of the letter run transverse
						before each prominence while the short one runs through the middle
						and terminates in the long lines. But whoever has no prominence on
						either part he has the sutures of the head resembling the Greek letter
						chi; for the one line comes transverse to the temple while the other
						passes along the middle of the head. The bone at the middle of the
						head is double, the hardest and most compact part being the upper
						portion, where it is connected with the skin, and the lowest, where
						it is connected with the meninx (dura mater); and from the uppermost
						and lowermost parts the bone gradually becomes softer and less compact,
						till you come to the <hi rend="ital">diploe</hi>. The diploe is the most porous, the softest,
						and most cavernous part. But the whole bone of the head, with the,<pb id="p.146"/>
						exception of a small portion of the uppermost and lowermost portions
						of it, is like a sponge; and the bone has in it many juicy substances,
						like caruncles; and if one will rub them with the fingers, some blood
						will issue from them. There are also in the bone certain very slender
						and hollow vessels full of blood. So it is with regard to hardness,
						softness, and porosity.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2">
					<head>Part 2</head>
					<p>In respect to thickness and thinness; the thinnest and weakest part
						of the whole head is the part about the bregma; and the bone there
						has the smallest and thinnest covering of flesh upon it, and the largest
						proportion of brain is situated in that region of the head. And hence
						it happens that from similar or even smaller wounds and instruments,
						when a person is wounded to the same or a less degree, the bone of
						the head there is more contused, fractured, and depressed; and that
						injuries there are more deadly and more difficult to cure; and it
						is more difficult to save one's life in injuries there than in any
						other part of the head; that from having sustained a similar or even
						a less wound a man will die, and that, too, in a shorter space of
						time than from a wound in any other part of the head. For the brain
						about the bregma feels more quickly and strongly any mischief that
						may occur to the flesh or the bone; for the brain about the bregma
						is in largest quantity, and is covered by the thinnest bone and the
						least flesh. Of the other portions, the weakest is that about the
						temples; for it is the conjunction of the lower jaw with the cranium,
						and there is motion there up and down as at a joint; and the organ
						of hearing is near it; and further, a hollow and important vein runs
						along the temple. But the whole bone of the head behind the vertex
						and the ear is stronger than the whole anterior part, and the bone
						itself has a larger and deeper covering of flesh upon it. And hence
						it follows, that when exposed to the same or even greater injuries
						from instruments of the same or greater size, the bone is less liable
						to be fractured and depressed than elsewhere; and that in a fatal
						accident the patient will live longer when the wound is in the posterior
						part of the head than when elsewhere; and that pus takes longer time
						to form and penetrate through the bone to the brain, owing to the
						thickness of the bone; and moreover, as<pb id="p.147"/> there is less brain in that
						part of the head, more persons who are wounded in the back part of
						the head escape than of those who wounded in the anterior part. And
						in fatal cases, a man will survive longer in winter than in summer,
						whatever be the part of the head in which the wound is situated.</p></div2>

					<p>As to the <hi rend="ital">haedrae</hi> (dints <hi rend="ital">or</hi> marks?) of sharp and light weapons, when
						they take place in the bone without fissure, contusion, or depression
						inwards (and these take place equally in the anterior and posterior
						part of the head), death, when it does occur, does not properly result
						from them. A suture appearing in a wound, when the bone is laid bare,
						on whatever part of the head the wound may have been inflicted, is
						the weakest point of the head to resist a blow or a weapon, when the
						weapon happens to be impinged into the suture itself; but more especially
						when this occurs in the bregma at the weakest part of the head, and
						the sutures happen to be situated near the wound, and the weapon has
						hit the sutures themselves. </p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4">
					<head>Part 4</head>
					<p>The bone in the head is liable to be wounded in the following modes, and there
						are many varieties in each of these modes of fracture: When a wounded
						bone breaks, in the bone comprehending the fissure, contusion necessarily
						takes place where the bone is broken; for an instrument that breaks
						the bone occasions a contusion thereof more or less, both at the fracture
						and in the parts of the bone surrounding the fracture. This is the
						first mode. But there are all possible varieties of fissures; for
						some of them are fine, and so very fine that they cannot be discovered,
						either immediately after the injury, or during the period in which
						it would be of use to the patient if this could be ascertained. And
						some of these fissures are thicker and wider, certain of them being
						very wide. And some of them extend to a greater, and some to a smaller,
						distance. And some are more straight, nay, completely straight; and
						some are more curved, and that in a remarkable degree. And some are
						deep, so as to extend downwards and through the whole bone; and some
						are less so, and do not penetrate through the whole bone.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5">
					<head>Part 5</head>
					<p>But a bone may be contused, and yet remain in its natural condition
						without any fracture in it; this is the second mode.<pb id="p.148"/> And there are
						many varieties of contusion; for they occur to a greater or less degree,
						and to a greater depth, so as sometimes to extend through the whole
						bone; or to a less depth, so as not to extend through the whole bone;
						and to a greater and smaller length and breadth. But it is not possible
						to recognize any of these varieties by the sight, so as to determine
						their form and extent; neither, indeed, is it visible to the eyes
						when any mischief of this kind takes place, and immediately after
						the injury, whether or not the bone has been actually bruised, as
						is likewise the case with certain fractures at a distance from the
						seat of injury.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>Part 6</head>
					<p>And the bone being fractured, is sometimes depressed inwards from
						its natural level along with the fractures, otherwise there would
						be no depression; for the depressed portion being fractured and broken
						off, is pushed inwards, while the rest of the bone remains in its
						natural position; and in this manner a fracture is combined with the
						depression. This is the third mode. There are many varieties of depression,
						for it may comprehend a greater and a small extent of bone, and may
						either be to a greater depth, or less so, and more superficial.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>Part 7</head>
					<p>When a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>, or dint of a weapon, takes place in a bone, there may
						be a fracture combined with it; and provided there be a fracture,
						contusion must necessarily be joined, to a greater or less extent,
						in the seat of the dint and fracture, and in the bone which comprehends
						them. This is the fourth mode. And there may be a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>, or indentation
						of the bone, along with contusion of the surrounding bone, but without
						any fracture either in the hedra or in the contusion inflicted by
						the weapon. But the indentation of a weapon takes place in a bone,
						and is called <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>, when the bone remaining in its natural state,
						the weapon which struck against the bone leaves its impression on
						the part which it struck. In each of these modes there are many varieties,
						with regard to the contusion and fracture, if both these be combined
						with the <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>, or if contusion alone, as it has been already stated
						that there are many varieties of contusion and fracture. And the <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>,
						<hi rend="ital">or</hi> dint, of itself may be longer and shorter, crooked, straight, and circular; and there are many varieties of this mode, according to
						the shape of the weapon; and they may<pb id="p.149"/> be more or less deep, and narrower or broader, and extremely broad. When a part is cleft, the cleft or
						notch which occurs in the bone, to whatever length or breadth, is
						a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>, if the other bones comprehending the cleft remain in their
						natural position, and be not driven inwards; for in this case it would
						be a depression, and no longer a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>. </p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>Part 8</head>
					<p>A bone may be injured in a different part of the head from that on
						which the person has received the wound, and the bone has been laid
						bare. This is the fifth mode. And for this misfortune, when it occurs,
						there is no remedy; for when this mischief takes place, there is no
						means of ascertaining by any examination whether or not it has occurred,
						or on what part of the head.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9">
					<head>Part 9</head>
					<p>Of these modes of fracture, the following require trepanning: the
						contusion, whether the bone be laid bare or not; and the fissure,
						whether apparent or not. And if, when an indentation (<hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>) by a weapon takes place in a bone it be attended with fracture and contusion,
						and even if contusion alone, without fracture, be combined with the
						indentation, it requires trepanning. A bone depressed from position
						rarely requires trepanning; and those which are most pressed and broken
						require trepanning the least; neither does an indentation (<hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>)
						without fracture and contusion require trepanning; nor does a notch,
						provided it is large and wide; for a notch and a hedra are the same.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="10">
					<head>Part 10</head>
					<p>
						In the first place, one must examine the wounded person, in what part
						of the head the wound is situated, whether in the stronger or weaker
						parts; and ascertain respecting the hairs about the wound, whether
						they have been cut off by the instrument, and have gone into the wound;
						and if so, one should declare that the bone runs the risk of being
						denuded of flesh, and of having sustained some injury from the weapon.
						These things one should say from a distant inspection, and before
						laying a hand on the man; but on a close examination one should endeavor
						to ascertain clearly whether the bone be denuded of flesh or not;
						and if the denuded bone be visible to the eyes, this will be enough;
						but otherwise an examination must be made with the sound.
						And if you find the bone denuded of the flesh,<pb id="p.150"/> and not safe from the
						wound, you must first ascertain the state of the bone, and the extent
						of the mischief, and of what assistance it stands in need. One should
						also inquire of the wounded person how and in what way he sustained
						the injury; and if it be not apparent whether the bone has sustained
						an injury or not, it will be still more necessary, provided the bone
						be denuded, to make inquiry how the wound occurred, and in what manner;
						for when contusions and fractures existin the bone, but are not apparent,
						we must ascertain, in the first place from the patient's answers,
						whether or not the bone has sustained any such injuries, and then
						find out the nature of the case by word and deed, with the exception
						of sounding. For sounding does not discover to us whether the bone
						has sustained any of these injuries or not; but sounding discovers
						to us an indentation inflicted by a weapon, and whether a bone be
						depressed from its natural position, and whether the bone be strongly
						fractured; all which may also be ascertained visibly with the eyes.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="11">
					<head>Part 11</head>
					<p>And a bone sustains fractures, either so fine as to escape the sight,
						or such as are apparent, and contusions which are not apparent, and
						depression from its natural position, especially when one person is
						intentionally wounded by another, or when, whether intentionally or
						not, a blow or stroke is received from an elevated place, and if the
						instrument in the hand, whether used in throwing or striking, be of
						a powerful nature, and if a stronger person wound a weaker. Of those
						who are wounded in the parts about the bone, or in the bone itself,
						by a fall, he who falls from a very high place upon a very hard and
						blunt object is in most danger of sustaining a fracture and contusion
						of the bone, and of having it depressed from its natural position;
						whereas he that falls upon more level ground, and upon a softer object,
						is likely to suffer less injury in the bone, or it may not be injured
						at all. Of those instruments which, falling upon the head, wound the
						parts about the bone, or the bone itself, that which falls from a
						very high place, and the least on a level with the person struck,
						and which is at the same time very hard, very blunt, and very heavy,
						and which is the least light, sharp, and soft, such an instrument
						would occasion a fracture and<pb id="p.151"/> contusion of the bone. And there is
						most danger that the bone may sustain these injuries, under such circumstances,
						when the wound is direct and perpendicular to the bone, whether struck
						from the hand or from a throw, or when any object falls upon the person,
						or when he is wounded by falling, or in whatever way the bone sustains
						a direct wound from this instrument. Those weapons which graze the
						bone obliquely are less apt to fracture, contuse, or depress the bone,
						even when the bone is denuded of flesh; for in some of those wounds
						thus inflicted the bone is not laid bare of the flesh. Those instruments
						more especially produce fractures in the bone, whether apparent or
						not, and contusions, and inward depression of the bone, which are
						rounded, globular, smooth on all sides, blunt, heavy, and hard; and
						such weapons bruise, compress, and pound the flesh; and the wounds
						inflicted by such instruments, whether obliquely or circularly, are
						round, and are more disposed to suppurate, and to have a discharge,
						and take longer time to become clean; for the flesh which has been
						bruised and pounded must necessarily suppurate and slough away. But
						weapons of an oblong form, being, for the most part, slender, sharp,
						and light, penetrate the flesh rather than bruise it, and the bone
						in like manner; and such an instrument may occasion a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi> and a cut (for a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi> and a cut are same thing); but weapons of this description
						do not produce contusions, nor fractures, nor depressions inwardly.
						And in addition the appearances in the bone, which you call detect
						by the sight, you should make inquiry as to all these particulars
						(for they are symptoms of a greater or less injury), whether the wounded
						person was stunned, and whether darkness was diffused over his eyes,
						and whether he had vertigo, and fell to the ground.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="12">
					<head>Part 12</head>
					<p>When the bone happens to be denuded of flesh by the weapon, and when
						the wound occurs upon the sutures, it is difficult to distinguish
						the indentation (<hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>) of a weapon which is clearly recognized in
						other parts of the bone, whether it exist or not, and especially if
						the <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi> be seated in the sutures themselves. For the suture being
						rougher than the rest of the bone occasions confusion, and it is not
						clear which is the suture, and which the mark inflicted by the instrument,
						unless the latter<pb id="p.152"/> (<hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>) be large. Fracture also for the most part
						is combined with the indentation when it occurs in the sutures; and
						this fracture is more difficult to discern when the bone is broken,
						on this account, that if there be a fracture, it is situated for the
						most part in the suture. For the bone is liable to be broken and slackened
						there, owing to the natural weakness of the bone there, and to its
						porosity, and from the suture being readily ruptured and slackened:
						but the other bones which surround the suture remain unbroken, because
						they are stronger than the suture. For the fracture which occurs at
						the suture is also a slackening of the suture, and it is not easy
						to detect whether the bone be broken and slackened by the indentation
						of a weapon occurring in the suture, or from a contusion of the bone
						at the sutures; but it is still more difficult to detect a fracture
						connected with contusion. For the sutures, having the appearance of
						fissures, elude the discernment and sight of the physician, as being
						rougher than the rest of the bone, unless the bone be strongly cut
						and slackened (for a cut and a <hi rend="ital">hedra</hi> are the same thing). But it is necessary, if the wound has occurred at the sutures, and the weapon
						has impinged on the bone or the parts about it, to pay attention and
						find out what injury the bone has sustained. For a person wounded
						to the same, or a much smaller, extent, and by weapons of the same
						size and quality, and even much less, will sustain a much greater
						injury, provided he has received the blow at the sutures, than if
						it was elsewhere. And many of these require trepanning, but you must
						not apply the trepan to the sutures themselves, but on the adjoining
						bone.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="13">
					<head>Part 13</head>
					<p>And with regard to the cure of wounds in the head, and the mode of
						detecting injuries in the bone which are not apparent, the following
						is my opinion:- In a wound of the head, you must not apply anything
						liquid, not even wine, but as little as possible, nor a cataplasm,
						nor conduct the treatment with tents, nor apply a bandage to an ulcer
						on the head, unless it be situated on the forehead, in the part which
						is bare of hairs, or about the eyebrow and eye, for wounds occurring
						there require cataplasms and bandages more than upon any other part
						of the head. For the rest of the head surrounds the whole forehead,
						and the <pb id="p.153"/>wounds wherever situated become inflamed and swelled, owing to an influx of blood from surrounding parts. And neither must you
						apply cataplasms and bandages to the forehead at all times; but when
						the inflammation is stopped and the swelling has subsided, you must
						give up the cataplasms and bandages. A wound in any other part of
						the head must not be treated with tents, bandages, or cataplasms,
						unless it also requires incision. You must perform incision on wounds
						situated on the head and forehead, whenever the bone is denuded of
						flesh, and appears to have sustained some injury from the blow, but
						the wound has not sufficient length and breadth for the inspection
						of the bone, so that it may be seen whether it has received any mischief
						from the blow, and of what nature the injury is, and to what extent
						the flesh has been contused, and whether the bone has sustained any
						injury, or whether it be uninjured by the blow, and has suffered no
						mischief; and with regard to the treatment, what the wound, and the
						flesh, and the injury of the bone stand in need of. Ulcers of this
						description stand in need of incision; and, if the bone be denuded
						of the flesh, and if it be hollow, and extend far obliquely, we cut
						up the cavity wherever the medicine cannot penetrate readily, whatever
						medicine it may be; and wounds which are more inclined to be circular
						and hollow, and for the most part others of the like shape, are cut
						up by making double incision in the circle lengthways, according
						to the figure of the man, so as to make the wound of a long form.
						Incisions may be practiced with impunity on other parts of the head,
						with the exception of the temple and the parts above it, where there
						is a vein that runs across the temple, in which region an incision
						is not to be made. For convulsions seize on a person who has been
						thus treated; and if the incision be on the left temple, the convulsions
						seize on the right side; and if the incision be on the right side,
						the convulsions take place on the left side.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="14">
					<head>Part 14</head>
					<p>When, then, you lay open a wound in the head on account of the bones
						having been denuded of the flesh, as wishing to ascertain whether
						or not the bone has received an injury from the blow, you must make
						an incision proportionate to the size of the wound, and as much as
						shall be judged necessary. And <pb id="p.154"/>in making the incision you must separate
						the flesh from the bone where it is united to the membrane (<hi rend="ital">pericranium?</hi>)
						and to the bone, and then fill the whole wound with a tent, which
						will expand the wound very wide next day with as little pain as possible;
						and along with the tents apply a cataplasm, consisting of a mass (<hi rend="ital">maza</hi>)
						of fine flour pounded in vinegar, or boiled so as to render it as
						glutinous as possible. On the next day, when you remove the tent,
						having examined the bone to see what injury it has sustained, if the
						wound in the bone be not right seen by you, nor can you discover what
						mischief the bone itself has sustained, but the instrument seems to
						have penetrated to the bone so as to have injured it, you must scrape
						the bone with a raspatory to a depth and length proportionate to the
						suture of the patient, and again in a transverse direction, for the
						sake of the fractures which are not seen, and of the contusions which
						are not discovered, as not being accompanied with depression of the
						bone from its natural position. For the scraping discovers the mischief,
						if the injuries in the bone be not otherwise manifest. And if you
						perceive an indentation (<hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>) left in the bone by the blow, you
						must scrape the dint itself and the surrounding bones, lest, as often
						happens, there should be a fracture and contusion, or a contusion
						alone, combined with the dint, and escape observation. And when you
						scrape the bone with the raspatory, and it appears that the wound
						in the bone requires the operation, you must not postpone it for three
						days, but do it during this period, more especially if the weather
						be hot, and you have had the management of the treatment from commencement.
						If you suspect that the bone is broken or contused, or has sustained
						both these injuries, having formed your judgement from the severity
						of the wound, and from the information of the patient, as that the
						person who inflicted the wound, provided it was done by another person,
						was remarkably strong, and that the weapon by which he was wounded
						was of a dangerous description, and then that the man had been seized
						with vertigo, dimness of vision, and stupor, and fell to the ground,-
						under these circumstances, if you cannot discover whether the bone
						be broken, contused, or both the one and the other, nor can see<pb id="p.155"/> the
						truth of the matter, you must dissolve the jet-black ointment, and
						fill the wound with it when this dissolved, and apply a linen rag
						smeared with oil, and then a cataplasm of the maza with a bandage;
						and on the next day, having cleaned out the wound, scrape the bone
						with the raspatory. And if the bone is not sound, but fractured and
						contused, the rest of it which is scraped will be white; but the fracture
						and contusion, having imbibed the preparation, will appear black,
						while the rest of the bone is white. And you must again scrape more
						deeply the fracture where it appears black; and, if you thus remove
						the fissure, and cause it to disappear, you may conclude that there
						has been a contusion of the bone to a greater or less extent, which
						has occasioned the fracture that has disappeared under the raspatory;
						but it is less dangerous, and a matter of less consequence, when the
						fissure has been effaced. But if the fracture extend deep, and do
						not seem likely to disappear when scraped, such an accident requires
						trepanning. But having performed this operation, you must apply the
						other treatment to the wound.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="15">
					<head>Part 15</head>
					<p>You must be upon your guard lest the bone sustain any injury from
						the fleshy parts if not properly treated. When the bone has been sawed
						and otherwise denuded, whether it be actually sound, or only appears
						to be so, but has sustained some injury from the blow, there may be
						danger of its suppurating (although it would not otherwise have done
						so), if the flesh which surrounds the bone be ill cured, and become
						inflamed and strangled; for it gets into a febrile state, and becomes
						much inflamed. For the bone acquires heat and inflammation from the
						surrounding flesh, along with irritation and throbbing, and the other
						mischiefs which are in the flesh itself, and from these it gets into
						a state of suppuration. It is a bad thing for the flesh (<hi rend="ital">granulations?</hi>)
						in an ulcer to be moist and mouldy, and to require a long time to
						become clean. But the wound should be made to suppurate as quickly
						as possible; for, thus the parts surrounding the wound would be the
						least disposed to inflammation, and would become the soonest clean;
						for the flesh which has been chopped and bruised by the blow, must
						necessarily suppurate and slough away. But when cleaned the wound
						must <pb id="p.156"/>be dried, for thus the wound will most speedily become whole,
						when flesh devoid of humors grows up, and thus there will be no fungous
						flesh in the sore. The same thing applies to the membrane which surrounds
						the brain: for when, by sawing the bone, and removing it from the
						meninx, you lay the latter bare, you must make it clean and dry as
						quickly as possible, lest being in a moist state for a considerable
						time, it become soaked therewith and swelled; for when these things
						occur, there is danger of its mortifying.</p></div2>

					<p>A piece of bone that must separate from the rest of the bone, in consequence
						of a wound in the head, either from the indentation (<hi rend="ital">hedra</hi>) of a blow
						in the bone, or from the bone being otherwise denuded for a long time,
						separates mostly by becoming exsanguous. For the bone becomes dried
						up and loses its blood by time and a multiplicity of medicines which
						are used; and the separation will take place most quickly, if one
						having cleaned the wound as quickly as possible will next dry it,
						and the piece of bone, whether larger or smaller. For a piece of bone
						which is quickly dried and converted, as it were, into a shell, is
						most readily separated from the rest of the bone which retains its
						blood and vitality; for, the part having become exsanguous and dry,
						more readily drops off from that which retains its blood and is alive.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="17">
					<head>Part 17</head>
					<p>Such pieces of bone as are depressed from their natural position,
						either being broken off or chopped off to a considerable extent, are
						attended with less danger, provided the membrane be safe; and bones
						which are broken by numerous and broader fractures are still less
						dangerous and more easily extracted. And you must not trepan any of
						them, nor run any risks in attempting to extract the pieces of bone,
						until they rise up of their own accord, upon the subsidence of the
						swelling. They rise up when the flesh (<hi rend="ital">granulations</hi>) grows below,
						and it grows from the diploe of the bone, and from the sound portion,
						provided the upper table alone be in a state of necrosis. And the
						flesh will shoot up and grow below the more quickly, and the pieces
						of bone ascend, if one will get the wound to suppurate and make it
						clean as quickly as possible. And when both the tables of the<pb id="p.157"/> bone
						are driven in upon the membrane, I mean the upper and lower, the wound,
						if treated in the same way, will very soon get well, and the depressed
						bones will quickly rise up.</p></div2>

					<p>The bones of children are thinner and softer, for this reason, that

						the bone of a young person more readily and quickly suppurates, and
						that in less time than the bone of an older person; and in accidents,
						which are to prove fatal, the younger person will die sooner than
						the elder. But if the bone is laid bare of flesh, one must attend
						and try to find out, what even is not obvious to the sight, and discover
						whether the bone be broken and contused, or only contused; and if,
						when there is an indentation in the bone, whether contusion, or fracture,
						or both be joined to it; and if the bone has sustained any of these
						injuries, we must give issue to the blood by perforating the bone
						with a small trepan, observing the greatest precautions, for the bone

					<p>When a person has sustained a mortal wound on the head, which cannot
						be cured, nor his life preserved, you may form an opinion of his approaching
						dissolution, and foretell what is to happen from the following symptoms
						which such a person experiences. When a bone is broken, or cleft,
						or contused, or otherwise injured, and when by mistake it has not
						been discovered, and neither the raspatory nor trepan has been applied
						as required, but the case has been neglected as if the bone were sound,
						fever will generally come on if in winter, and in summer the fever
						usually seizes after seven days. And when this happens, the wound
						loses its color, and the inflammation dies in it; and it becomes glutinous,
						and appears like a pickle, being of a tawny and somewhat livid color;
						and the bone then begins to sphacelate, and turns black where it was
						white before, and at last becomes pale and blanched. But when suppuration
						is fairly established in it, small blisters form on the tongue and
						he dies delirious. And, for the most part, <pb id="p.158"/>convulsions seize the other
						side of the body; for, if the wound be situated on the left side,
						the convulsions will seize the right side of the body; or if the wound
						be on the right side of the head, the convulsion attacks the left
						side of the body. And some become apoplectic. And thus they die before
						the end of seven days, if in summer; and before fourteen, if in winter.
						And these symptoms indicate, in the same manner, whether the wound
						be older or more recent. But if you perceive that fever is coming
						on, and that any of these symptoms accompany it, you must not put
						off, but having sawed the bone to the membrane (<hi rend="ital">meninx</hi>), or scraped
						it with a raspatory (and it is then easily sawed or scraped), you
						must apply the other treatment as may seem proper, attention being

						With regard to trepanning, when there is a necessity for it, the following
						particulars should be known. If you have had the management of the
						case from the first, you must not at once saw the bone down to the
						meninx; for it is not proper that the membrane should be laid bare
						and exposed to injuries for a length of time, as in the end it may
						become fungous. And there is another danger if you
						saw the bone down to the meninx and remove it at once, lest in the
						act of sawing you should wound the meninx. But in trepanning, when
						only a very little of the bone remains to be sawed through, and the
						bone can be moved, <pb id="p.159"/>you must desist from sawing, and leave the bone
						to fall out of itself.<note>The operation here described by our author is the more deserving of attention, as it appears to have been peculiar to him.  It is not described by Celsus, Paulus AEgineta, Albucasis, nor any one of the ancient authorities, as far as I can find; neither am I aware of its having been attempted in modern times.  The object of it, however, seems to be very rational, namely, to avoid doing serious injury to the dura mater by tearing the bone forcibly from it at once.</note> For to a bone not sawed through, and where
						a portion is left of the sawing, no mischief can happen; for the portion
						now left is sufficiently thin. In other respects you must conduct
						the treatment as may appear suitable to the wound. And in trepanning
						you must frequently remove the trepan, on account of the heat in the
						bone, and plunge it in cold water. For the trepan being heated by
						running round, and heating and drying the bone, burns it and makes
						a larger piece of bone around the sawing to drop off, than would otherwise
						do. And if you wish to saw at once down to the membrane, and then
						remove the bone, you must also, in like manner, frequently take out
						the trepan and dip it in cold water. But if you have not charge of
						the treatment from the first, but undertake it from another after
						a time, you must saw the bone at once down to the meninx with a serrated
						trepan, and in doing so must frequently take out the trepan and examine
						with a sound (specillum), and otherwise along the tract of the instrument.
						For the bone is much sooner sawn through, provided there be matter
						below it and in it, and it often happens that the bone is more superficial,
						especially if the wound is situated in that part of the head where
						the bone is rather thinner than in other parts. But you must take
						care where you apply the trepan, and see that you do so only where
						it appears to be particularly thick, and having fixed the instrument
						there, that you frequently make examinations and endeavor by moving
						the bone to bring it up. Having removed it, you must apply the other
						suitable remedies to the wound. And if, when you have the management
						of the treatment from the first, you wish to saw through the bone
						at once, and remove it from the membrane, you must, in like manner,
						examine the tract of the instrument frequently with the sound,<pb id="p.160"/> and
						see that it is fixed on the thickest part of the bone, and endeavor
						to remove the bone by moving it about. But if you use a perforator
						(<hi rend="ital">trepan?</hi>), you must not penetrate to the membrane, if you operate
						on a case which you have had the charge of from the first, but must
						leave a thin scale of bone, as described in the process of sawing.</p></div2></div1>

					<p>It's the business of the physician to know, in the first place, things similar and things

In all cases of accident, it was the practice of the ancient surgeons to compare carefully the injured part with its fellow or corresponding part on the opposite side.</note> which are to be seen, touched, and heard; which are to be perceived in the sight, and the touch, and the hearing, and the nose, and the tongue, and the understanding; which are to be known by all the means we know other things.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="2">
					<head>Part 2</head>
					<p>
						The things relating to surgery, are- the patient; the operator; the assistants; the instruments; the light, where and how; how many things, and how; where the body, and the instruments; the time; the manner; the place.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>Part 3</head>
					<p>
						The operator is either sitting or standing, conveniently for himself, for the person operated upon, for the light. There are two kinds of light, the common and the artificial; the common is not at our disposal, the artificial is at our disposal. There are two modes of using each, either to the light, or from the light (to the side?). There is little use of that which is from (<hi rend="ital">or</hi> oblique to the light), and the degree of it is obvious. As to opposite the light, we must turn the part to be operated upon to that which is most brilliant of present and convenient lights, unless those parts which should be concealed, and which it is a shame to look upon; thus the part that is operated upon should be opposite the light, and the operator opposite the part operated<pb id="p.162"/> upon, except in so far as he does not stand in his own light; for in this case the operator will indeed see, but the thing operated upon will not be seen. With regard to himself when sitting, his feet should be raised to a direct line with his knees, and nearly in contact with one another; the knees a little higher than the groins, and at some distance from one another, for the elbows to rest upon them. The robe, in a neat and orderly manner, is to be thrown over the elbows and shoulders equally and proportionally. With regard to the part operated upon; we have to consider how far distant, and how near, above, below, on this side on that side, or in the middle. The measure as to distance and proximity is, that the elbows do not press the knees before, nor the sides behind; that the hands be not raised higher than the breasts, nor lower than so as that when the breast reposes on the knees he may have the hands at right angles with the arm: thus it is as regards the medium; but as concerns this side or that, the operator must not be beyond his seat, but in proportion as he may require turning he must shift the body, or part of the body, that is operated upon. When standing, he must make his inspection, resting firmly and equally on both feet; but he must operate while supporting himself upon either leg, and not the one on the same side with the hand which he makes use of; the knee being raised to the height of the groins as while sitting; and the other measures in like manner. The person operated upon should accommodate the operator with regard to the other parts of his body, either standing, sitting, or lying; so as that he may continue to preserve his figure, avoid sinking down, shrinking from, turning away; and may maintain the figure and position of the part operated upon, during the act of presentation, during the operation, and in the subsequent position.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="4">

						The nails should be neither longer nor shorter than the points of the fingers; and the surgeon should practice with the extremities of the fingers, the index-finger being usually turned to the thumb; when using the entire hand, it should be prone; when both hands, they should be opposed to one another. It greatly promotes a dexterous use of the fingers when the space between them is large, and when the thumb is opposed to the<pb id="p.163"/> index. But it is clearly a disease when the thumb is impaired from birth, or when, from a habit contracted during the time of nursing, it is impeded in its motions by the fingers. One should practice all sorts of work with either of  them, and with both together (for they are both alike), endeavouring to do them well, elegantly, quickly, without trouble, neatly, and promptly.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5">
					<head>Part 5</head>
					<p>The instruments, and when and how they should be prepared, will be treated of afterwards; so that they may not impede the work, and that there may be no difficulty in taking hold of them, with the part of the body which operates. But if another gives them, he must be ready a little beforehand, and do as you direct.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>Part 6</head>
					<p>
						Those about the patient must present the part to be operated upon as may seem proper, and they must hold the rest of the body steady, in silence, and listening to the commands of the operator.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>Part 7</head>
					<p>
						There are two views of bandaging: that which regards it while doing, and that which regards it when done. It should be done quickly, without pain, with ease, and with elegance; quickly, by despatching the work; without pain, by being readily done; with ease, by being prepared for everything; and with elegance, so that it may be agreeable to the sight. By what mode of training these accomplishments are to be acquired has been stated. When done, it should fit well and neatly; it is neatly done when with judgment, and when it is equal and unequal, according as the parts are equal or unequal. The forms of it (the bandage?) are the simple, the slightly winding (called ascia), the sloping (sima), the monoculus, the rhombus, and the semi-rhombus. The form of bandage should be suitable to the form and the affection of the part to which it is applied.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>Part 8</head>
					<p>
						There are two useful purposes to be fulfilled by bandaging: (<hi rend="ital">first</hi>,) strength, which is imparted by the compression and the number of folds. In one case the bandage effects the cure, and in another it contributes to the cure. For these purposes this is the rule- that the force of the constriction be such as to prevent the adjoining parts from separating, without compressing them much, and so that the parts may be adjusted but not <pb id="p.164"/>forced together; and that the constriction be small at the extremities, and least of all in the middle. The knot and the thread that is passed through should not be in a downward but in an upward direction, regard being had to the circumstances under which the case is presented; to position, to the bandaging, and to the compression. The commencement of the ligatures is not to be placed at the wound, but where the knot is situated. The knot should not be placed where it will be exposed to friction, nor where it will be in the way, nor where it will be useless. The knot and the thread should be soft, and not large.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="9">
					<head>Part 9</head>
					<p>
						(<hi rend="ital">Second.</hi>) One ought to be well aware that every bandage has a tendency to fall off towards the part that declines or becomes smaller; as, for example, upwards, in the case of the head, and downwards, in the case of the leg. The turns of the bandage should be made from right to left, and from left to right, except on the head, where it should be in a straight direction. When opposite parts are to be bandaged together, we must use a bandage with two heads; or if we make use of a bandage with one head, we must attach it in like manner at some fixed point: such, for example, as the middle of the head; and so in other cases. Those parts which are much exposed to motion, such as the joints, where there is a flexion, should have few and slight bandages applied to them, as at the ham; but where there is much extension, the bandage should be single and broad, as at the kneepan; and for the maintenance of the bandage in its proper place, some turns should be carried to those parts which are not much moved, and are lank, such as the parts above and below the knee. In the case of the shoulder; a fold should be carried round by the other armpit; in that of the groin, by the flanks of the opposite side; and of the leg, to above the calf of the leg. When the bandage has a tendency to escape above, it should be secured below, and <hi rend="ital">vice versa</hi>; and where there is no means of doing this, as in the case of the head, the turns are to be made mostly on the most level part of the head, and the folds are to be done with as little obliquity as possible, so that the firmest part being last applied may secure the portions which are more movable. When we cannot secure the bandaging by means of <pb id="p.165"/>folds of the cloth, nor by suspending them from the opposite side, we must have recourse to stitching it with ligatures, either passed circularly or in the form of a seam.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="10">
					<head>Part 10 </head>
					<p>
						The bandages should be clean, light, soft, and thin. One should practice rolling with both hands together, and with either separately. One should also choose a suitable one, according to the breadth and thickness of the parts. The heads of the bandages should be hard, smooth, and neatly put on. That sort of bandaging is the worst which quickly falls off; but those are bad bandages which neither compress nor yet come off.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="11">
					<head>Part 11</head>
					<p>
						The following are the object which the upper bandage, the under bandage, or both aim at: The object of the under bandage is either to bring together parts that are separated, or to compress such as are expanded, or to separate what are contracted, or to restore to shape what are distorted, or the contrary. It is necessary to prepare pieces of linen cloth, which are light, thin, soft, clean, having no seams nor protuberances on them, but sound, and able to bear some stretching, or even a little more than required; not dry, but wetted with a juice suitable to the purpose required. We must deal with parts separated (<hi rend="ital">in a sinus?</hi>) in such wise, that the parts which are raised may touch the bottom without producing pressure; we must begin on the sound part, and terminate at the wound; so that whatever humor is in it may be expelled, and that it may be prevented from collecting more. And straight parts are to be bandaged in a straight direction, and oblique obliquely, in such a position as to create no pain; and so that there may be no constriction nor falling off on a change of position, either for the purpose of taking hold of anything, or laying the limb; and that muscles, veins, nerves, and bones may be properly placed and adjusted to one another. It should be raised or laid in a natural position, so as not to occasion pain. In those cases in which an abscess is formed, we must act in a contrary way. When our object is to bring together parts which have become expanded, in other respects we must proceed on the same plain; and we must commence the bringing together from some considerable distance; and after their approach, we must apply compression, at first slight, <pb id="p.166"/>and afterwards stronger, the limit of it being the actual contact of the parts. In order to separate parts which are drawn together, when attended with inflammation, we must proceed on the opposite plan; but when without inflammation, we must use the same preparations, but bandage in the opposite direction. In order to rectify distorted parts, we must proceed otherwise on the same principles; but the parts which are separated must be brought together by an underbandage, by agglutinants, and by suspending it (<hi rend="ital">the limb?</hi>) in its natural position. And when the deformities are the contrary, this is to be done on the contrary plan.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="12">
					<head>Part 12</head>
					<p>
						In fractures we must attend to the length, breadth, thickness, and number of the compresses. The length should be that of the bandaging; the breadth, three or four fingers; thickness, three or fourfold; number so as to encircle the limb, neither more nor less; those applied for the purpose of rectifying a deformity, should be of such a length as to encircle it; the breadth and thickness being determined by the vacuity, which is not to be filled up at once. The upper bandages are two, the first of which is to be carried from the seat of the injury upwards, and the second from the seat of the injury downwards, and from below upwards; the parts about the seat of the injury being most compressed, the extremities least, and the rest in proportion. The upper bandages should take in a considerable portion of the sound parts. We must attend to the number, length, and breadth of the bandages; the number must be such as not to be inferior to what the injury requires, nor occasion compression with the splints, nor prove cumbersome, nor occasion any slipping of them, nor render them inefficient. As to length and breadth, they should be three, four, five, or six cubits in length, and as many fingers broad. The folds of the strings (<hi rend="ital">selvages?</hi>) should be such as not to occasion pressure; they are to be soft and not thick; and all these things are to be proportionate to the length, breadth, and thickness of the part affected. The splints are to be smooth, even, and rounded at the extremities; somewhat less all along than the upper bandaging, and thickest at the part to which fracture inclines. Those parts where there are tuber-<pb id="p.167"/>osities, and which are devoid of flesh, such as the ankles or fingers, we must guard from the splints which are placed over them, either by position, or by their shortness. They are to be secured by the strings in such a manner as not to occasion pressure at first. A soft, consistent, and clean cerate should be rubbed into the folds of the bandage.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="13">
					<head>Part 13</head>
					<p>
						As to the temperature and quantity of the water used, its heat should be just such as the hand can bear, and it ought to be known that a large quantity is best for producing relaxation and attenuation, whereas a moderate quantity is best for incarnating and softening. The limit to the affusion is, to stop when the parts become swelled up, and before the swelling subsides; for the parts swell up at first, and fall afterward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="14">
					<head>Part 14</head>
					<p>
						The object on which to (<hi rend="ital">the limb?</hi>) is laid should be soft, smooth, and sloping upwards toward the protuberant parts of the body, such as the heel or hips, so that there may be no projection, nor bending inwards, nor turning aside. The canal (<hi rend="ital">spout or gutter?</hi>) should rather comprehend the whole limb than the half of it, attention being paid to the injury and to whatever else appears to create inconvenience.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="15">
					<head>Part 15</head>
					<p> 
						The presentation of the injured part to the physician, the extension, the arrangement, and so forth, are to be regulated according to nature. What is nature in these operations is to be determined by the accomplishment of the object which we have in view, and for this purpose we must look to the part in the state of rest, in its middle state, and to habit; in regard to the state of rest and relaxation, as in the arm, that it be in a line with the hand; and with regard to the medium between flexion and extension, that the forearm be at right angles to the arm; and with regard to habit, it should be considered that some limbs bear certain positions preferably, as, for example, the thighs extension; for in such attitudes the parts can best bear to be placed for a considerable time without a change of posture. And in the change from the state of distention, the muscles, veins, nerves, and bones, when properly arranged and secured, will preserve their relations to one another while the limb is raised or placed.<pb id="p.168"/></p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="16">
					<head>Part 16</head>
					<p>
						The extension should be most powerful when the largest and thickest bones, or when both are broken; next when the under-bone, and least of all, when the upper. When immoderate, it is injurious, except in the case of children. The limb should be a little elevated. The model by which we judge if the part be properly set is the sound part of the same name, or the part which is its pair.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="17">
					<head>Part 17</head>
					<p>
						Friction can relax, brace, incarnate, attenuate: hard braces, soft relaxes, much attenuates, and moderate thickens.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="18">
					<head>Part 18</head>
					<p>
						The following should be the state of matters on the first application of the bandage. The person to whom it has been applied should say that he feels the compression particularly at the seat of the injury, but very little at the extremities; the parts should be adjusted but not pressed together, and that rather by the number of the bandages than by the force of the constriction; and the tightness should rather be on the increase during the first day and night; but on the next it should be less, and on the third the bandages should be loose. On the next day a soft swelling should be observed in the extremities; and on the third day, when the bandaging is loosed, the swelling should be found diminished in size, and this should be the case every time the bandages are removed. At the second application of the bandage, it should be ascertained whether the dressing has been properly done, and then greater compression should be made, and with more bandages; and on the third, still greater, and still more. On the seventh day from the first dressing, when the bandages are loosed, the limb should be found slender and the bones mobile. We must then have recourse to the splints, provided the limb be free of swelling, pruritus, and ulceration, and allow them to remain until twenty days after the accident; but if any suspicions arise, the bandages must be loosed in the interval. The splints should be tightened every third day. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="19">
					<head>Part 19</head>
					<p>
						The suspending of a fractured limb in a sling, the disposition of it, and the bandaging, all have for their object to preserve it in position. The principal considerations with regard to the position are the habits and the peculiar nature of each<pb id="p.169"/> of the limbs: the varieties are shown in running, walking, standing, lying, action, repose. </p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="20">
					<head>Part 20</head>
					<p>It should be kept in mind that exercise strengthens, and inactivity wastes.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="21">
					<head>Part 21</head>
					<p>Compression should be produced by the number of bandages, rather than by the force of the constriction.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="22">
					<head>Part 22</head>
					<p>In cases of ecchymosis, contusions, sprains, or swellings not attended with inflammations, blood is to be expelled from the wound, in greatest quantity to the upper part, and in smallest to the inferior; neither the arm nor the leg should be placed in a declining position: the head of the bandage should be placed on the wound, and there the greatest pressure should be made; the least at the extremities, and intermediately in the middle; the last fold of the bandage should be at the upper part of the body. As to binding and compression, these objects are to be attained rather by the number of the bandages than the force of the constriction; and moreover, in these cases the bandages should be thin, light, soft, clean, broad, sound, so that they may effect their purpose, even without splints. And we must use affusions. </p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="23">
					<head>Part 23</head>
					<p>Dislocations, sprains, diastases of bones, violent separation, abruption of the extremities of bones, and distrainings, so as to induce <hi rend="ital">varus</hi> or <hi rend="ital">valgus</hi>, in these cases we must apply the bandages so as not to compress the part whence the displacement took place, and that we may render them tight at the side to which the displacement was, and give the limb an inclination in the opposite direction, and that in an excessive degree. We employ bandages, compresses, suspension of the limb in a sling, attitude, extension, friction, rectification; and along with these the affusion of much water.</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="24">
					<head>Part 24</head>
					<p>
						In treating parts which are atrophied, we must comprehend a considerable part of the sound limb with the bandage, so that by the influx thereby produced, the wasted part may acquire a supply greater than its loss, and may be thus disposed to growth and restoration of its fleshy parts. It is better also to bandage the parts above, as the thigh in the case of the leg, <pb id="p.170"/>and also the thigh and leg of the opposite side, so that they may be placed in similar circumstances, and may both equally be deprived of motion; and that the supply of nourishment may be alike curtailed and open to both. The compression should be the effect rather of the number of the bandages than of their tightness. We relax first the part most requiring it, and have recourse to that kind of friction which will promote the growth of flesh, and to affusion. No splints. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="25">
					<head>Part 25</head>
					<p>
						Those things which are for the purpose of giving support and strength to the part, as to the breast, side, head, and so forth, are used in such cases as the following: for pulsations, that there may be no motion in the part; and in separation at the sutures of the skull, in order to give support; and in order to strengthen the chest and head, in coughs, sneezings, and other movements. In all these cases the same measure of bandaging is to be observed, for where the injury is, there the bandage should compress most, and something soft is to be placed below that suits with the complaint; and we must not apply the bandages tighter than just to stop the pulsations from creating disturbance, and that the separated parts at the sutures may be brought into contact, they must not be such as absolutely to stop the coughs and sneezings, but so as to give support, and, without occasioning uneasiness, prevent the parts from being shaken.</p></div2></div1>

				<pb id="p.171"/>
				<div2 type="section" n="1">
					<head>Part 1</head>
					<p>In treating fractures and dislocations, the physician must make the
						extension as straight as possible, for this is the most natural direction.
						But if it incline to either side, it should rather turn to that of
						pronation, for there is thus less harm than if it be toward supination.
						Those, then, who act in such cases without deliberation, for the most
						part do not fall into any great mistake, for the person who is to
						have his arm bound, presents it in the proper position from necessity,
						but physicians who fancy themselves learned in these matters, are
						they who commit blunders. There is no necessity for much study, then,
						in order to set a broken arm, and in a word, any ordinary physician
						can perform it; but I am under the necessity of giving the longer
						directions on this subject, because I know physicians who have the
						reputation of being skilled in giving the proper positions to the
						arm in binding it up, while in reality they are only showing their
						own ignorance. But many other things in our art are judged of in this
						manner, for people rather admire what is new, although they do not
						know whether it be proper or not, than what they are accustomed to,
						and know already to be proper; and what is strange, they prefer to
						what is obvious. I must now state what the mistakes of medical men
						are, which I wish to unteach, and what instructions I have to give
						as to the management of the arm; for what I have to say regarding
						it, will apply to the other bones in the body.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="2">
					<head>Part 2</head>
					<p>The arm, then, for that is the subject we were treating of, was presented
						in the prone position to be bound, but the physician forced his patient
						to hold it as the archers do when they project the shoulder, and in
						this position he bound it up, thinking within<pb id="p.172"/> himself that he was
						acting according to Nature, and in proof of this he pointed out that
						all the bones in the fore-arm were thus in a straight line, and that
						the integuments both inside and outside, were also in a straight line,
						and that the flesh and nerves (<hi rend="ital">tendons?</hi>) were thus put in their natural
						position, and he appealed to what happens in archery, as a proof of
						this. And so saying, and so doing, he is looked up to as a sage; and
						yet he forgets that in all the other arts and performances, whether
						executed  by strength or dexterity, what is reckoned
						the natural position is not the same, and that in the same piece of
						work it may happen that the natural position of the right arm is not
						the same as that of the left. For there is one attitude in throwing
						the javelin, and another in slinging, another in casting stones, another
						in boxing, and another in a state of repose. And whatever arts one
						examines, it will be found that the natural position of the arms is
						not the same in each, but that in every case the arms are put into
						the attitude which suits best with the instrument that is used, and
						the work to be performed. In practicing archery, no doubt this is
						the best attitude of the left arm, for gingly-moid extremity of the
						humerus being fixed in the cavity of the ulna, in this position, throws
						the bones of the forearm and arm into a line, as if they constituted
						a single bone, and all flexion at the joint is prevented in this position.
						It is no doubt certain that the member is thus put into the most unbending
						and extended position possible, so as not to be overcome or yield
						when the string is drawn by the right arm, and thus will the archer
						be enabled to draw the string farthest, and discharge his arrow with
						the greatest force and rapidity, for arrows thus discharged have the
						greatest swiftness and force, and are carried to the greatest distances.
						But there is nothing in common between the binding up of an arm and
						archery. Moreover, if having thus bound up the arm, the physician
						direct the patient to keep it thus, he will occasion him greater pain
						than he had from the wound itself; and thus also, if the physician
						order him to bend the arm, neither the bones, the nerves, nor the
						flesh will any longer be  in the same condition, but will be arranged
						differently, having overcome the bandaging. What use, then, is there
						of the archer's attitude? <pb id="p.173"/>And these mistakes, the physician, conceited
						in his knowledge, would probably not have committed if he had allowed
						the patient himself to present his arm.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>Part 3</head>
					<p>
						But another physician putting the arm into the state of supination,
						gives orders to extend the arm thus, and bandages it in this position,
						reckoning it the one according to nature, judging thus from the skin,
						and also fancying the bones to be thus in their natural position,
						because the bone which protrudes at the wrist, where the little finger
						is, appears to be in a line with the bone from which people measure
						the bone of the fore-arm. These things he brings forward as proofs
						that the parts are in their natural state, and he is supposed to speak
						correctly. But, indeed, if the arm be kept stretched in a supine position,
						it will become very painful, and this fact any one may ascertain by
						extending his own arm in this attitude. And also a weaker man grasping
						with his hands a stronger man whose arm is turned in a supine position,
						could lead him wherever he chose, and neither, if a man held a sword
						thus in his hand, could he make any proper use of it, so constrained
						is this position. And, moreover, if, when a physician has thus bound
						up the arm, he allow it to remain in the same position, the patient
						will endure greater pain if he walk about, but considerable, even
						if he remain at rest. And thus, too, if he shall bend the arm, the
						muscles and the bones must necessarily assume a different position.
						But, in addition to other mischief, he is ignorant of these facts
						regarding the position, that the bone which protrudes at the wrist,
						close to the little finger, belongs to the fore-arm, whereas the one
						at the joint, from which people measure the fore-arm, is the head
						of the humerus. He fancies that both these belong to the same bone,
						and many others are of this opinion. The latter, in fact, is the same
						part as that which is called the elbow, upon which we sometimes rest,
						and when he holds the arm thus in a supine position, in the first
						place the bone appears distorted, and in the next place the tendons
						which extend from the carpus along the inner side and from the fingers
						become distorted while the arm has a supine position; for these tendons
						proceed to the bone of the humerus, from which the fore-arm is measured.
						Such, and so<pb id="p.174"/> many mistakes and marks of ignorance are committed, regarding the natural construction of the arm. But if one will extend a broken
						arm as I direct, he will turn the bone, situated at the extremity
						of the little finger, into the straight line, and also the one at
						the elbow, and the tendons which stretch from the carpus to the extremity
						of the humerus will be placed in the straight line; and when the arm
						is suspended in a sling, it will be in the same attitude as that in
						which it was bound up, and will give no pain to the patient when he
						walks about, nor when he lies reclined, and will not become fatigued.
						The man should be so seated that the prominent part of the bone may
						be turned to the brightest light which is at hand, so that the operator
						in making the extension, may be at no loss to discover if it be sufficiently
						straight. The prominence of a broken bone could not escape being detected
						by the hand of an experienced person, when applied for this purpose,
						and, moreover, the projecting part is particularly painful to the
						touch.</p></div2>

					<p>
						In cases of fracture in either of the bones of the forearm, it is
						easier to effect a cure if the upper bone be broken, although it be
						the thicker one, both because the sound bone is situated below, and
						forms a support to it, and because the deformity is more easily concealed,
						there being a thick mass of flesh on the upper side, except near to
						the wrist. But the lower bone is without a covering of flesh, is not
						easily concealed, and requires stronger extension. If it is not this
						bone, but the other which is broken, a more feeble extension proves
						sufficient, but if both be broken, a more powerful extension is required.
						In the case of a young person I have known the extension made more
						strong than was necessary, but in general the extension made is less
						than what is required. And when they are extended, the physician should
						apply the palms of the hands, and adjust the fractured parts and then
						having rubbed the parts with cerate, but not in large quantity so
						that the bandages may not come off, it is to be bound up in this state,
						care being taken that the hand be not lower than the elbow, but a
						little higher, so that the blood do not flow toward the extremity,
						but may be determined to the upper part; and then it is to be secured
						with the bandage,<pb id="p.175"/> the head of which is to be placed at the fracture,
						and the bandage should impart firmness to the parts without occasioning
						strong compression. When you have carried the bandage twice or thrice
						round at the seat of the fracture, it is to be carried upward, so
						that the afflux of blood into it may be stopped, and the bandage should
						terminate there, and the first bandages ought not to be long. The
						head of the second bandage is also to be placed upon the seat of the
						fracture, and a single round of it being made there, it is then to
						be carried downward, and is not to be applied so tight as the other,
						and there should be greater distances between the turns, so that the
						bandage may prove sufficient to revert to the spot where the other
						terminated. The bandages may be rolled to the left hand or to the
						right, or to whatever side suits best with the position of the fractured
						arm, or according to the inclination which it may have. Afterward
						we must place along the arm, compresses, smeared with a little cerate,
						for thus they occasion less uneasiness, and are more easily arranged.
						And then we must apply the bandages crossways, sometimes to the right
						hand, and sometimes to the left, for the most part beginning below
						and terminating above, but sometimes commencing above and ending below.
						The parts which are thinly covered with flesh should be wrapped round
						with compresses, and inequalities should be made up, not by a number
						of folds at once, but by degrees. Some slack turns are also to be
						made around the wrist, to this side and to that. These two bandages
						are sufficient at first.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="5">
					<head>Part 5</head>
					<p>
						And these are the signs that the patient has been well treated and
						properly bandaged: if you ask him if the arm feels tight, and he says
						it does, but moderately so, and especially about the fracture; and
						this reply he should make all along, if the bandage be properly applied.
						And these are symptoms of the bandaging being moderately tight; if
						for the first day and night he fancies that the tightness does not
						diminish, but rather increases; and if on the next day there be a
						soft swelling in the hand, for this is a sign of moderate compression,
						but at the end of the second day the compression should feel less,
						and on the third day the bandaging should appear loose. And if any
						of<pb id="p.176"/> these symptoms be wanting, you may conclude that the bandaging
						is slacker than it should be; or if any of these symptoms be in excess,
						you may infer that the compression is more than moderate; and judging
						from these, you will apply the next bandages either slacker or tighter.
						Having removed the bandages on the third day, you must make extension
						and adjust the fracture, and bind it up again; and if the first bandaging
						was moderately applied, the second bandaging should be made somewhat
						tighter. The heads the bandages should be placed on the fractures
						as in the former case; for, so doing, the humors will be driven to
						the extremities, whereas if you bandage any other part beforehand,
						the humors will he forced from it to the seat of the fracture: it
						is of much importance that this should be properly understood. Thus
						the bandaging and compression should always commence at the seat of
						the fracture, and everything else should be conducted on the same
						principle, so that the farther you proceed from the fracture, the
						compression should always be the less. The bandages should never be
						actually loose, but should be smoothly put on. At each dressing the
						number of bandages should be increased; and the patient, if asked,
						should answer, that he feels the bandages somewhat tighter than on
						the former occasion, especially about the fracture, and everything
						else in proportion; and with respect to the swelling, the pain, and
						recovery, everything should proceed as after the former dressing.
						But on the third day the outer bandaging should appear looser. Then
						having removed the bandages, you should bind it up again, somewhat
						tighter than before, and with all the bandages which will be required
						on the occasion, and afterwards one ought to experience the same train
						of symptoms as at the former periods of bandaging.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>Part 6</head>
					<p>When the third day arrives, that is to say, the seventh from the first
						dressing, if properly done, the swelling in the hand should be not
						very great; and the part which has been bandaged should be found more
						slender and less swelled at each time, and on the seventh day the
						swelling should be quite gone, and the broken bones should be more
						readily moved, and admit of being easily adjusted. And if these things
						be so, you should, <pb id="p.177"/>after setting the fracture, apply the bandages
						so as to suit the splints, and a little more tight than formerly,
						unless there be more pain from the swelling in the hand. When you
						have applied the bandages, you must adjust the splints all around
						the limb, and secure them with strings so loose as just
						to keep them in their place, without the application of the splints
						contributing at all to the compression of the arm. After this the
						pain and recovery should proceed as in the preceding periods of the
						bandaging. But if, on the third day, the patient say that the bandaging
						is loose, you must then fasten the splints, especially at the fracture,
						but also elsewhere, wherever the bandaging is rather loose than tight.
						The splint should be thickest where the fracture protrudes, but it
						should not be much more so than elsewhere. Particular attention should
						be paid to the line of the arm corresponding to the thumb, so that
						no splint be laid on it, but upon each side of it, nor in the line
						of the little finger where the bone is prominent at the wrist, but
						on each side of it. And if it be found necessary that splints should
						be applied in these directions at the seat of the fracture, they should
						be made shorter than the others, so as that they may not reach the
						bones which are prominent at the wrist, for otherwise there is danger
						of ulceration, and of the tendons being laid bare. The splints should
						be adjusted anew every third day, in a very gentle manner, always
						keeping in mind that the object of the splints is to maintain the
						lower bandages in their place, and that they are not needed in order
						to contribute to the compression.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>Part 7</head>
					<p>
						If, then, you see that the bones are properly adjusted by the first
						dressings, and that there is no troublesome pruritus in the part,
						nor any reason to suspect ulceration, you may allow the arm to remain
						bandaged in the splints until after the lapse of more than twenty
						days. The bones of the fore-arm generally get consolidated in thirty
						days altogether; but there is nothing precise in this matter, for
						one constitution differs from another, and one period of life from
						another. When you remove the bandages, you must pour hot water on
						the arm and bind it up again, but somewhat slacker, and with fewer
						bandages than formerly: and again on the third day you undo the bandages,
						and<pb id="p.178"/> bind it still more loosely, and with still fewer bandages. And
						if, while the arm is bound up in the splints, you should at any time
						suspect that the bones do not lie properly, or if anything about the
						bandages annoys the patient, you should loose them at the middle of
						the time, or a little earlier, and apply them again. A diet slightly
						restricted will be sufficient in those cases in which there was no
						external wound at first, or when the bone does not protrude; but one
						should live rather sparingly until the tenth day, as being now deprived
						of exercise; and tender articles of food should be used, such as moderately
						loosen the bowels; but one should abstain altogether from flesh and
						wine, and then by degrees resume a more nourishing diet. This diet.
						may be laid down as a just rule in the treatment of fractures, both
						as to how they should be treated, and what will be the results of
						a proper plan of treatment; so that one may know, that if things do
						not turn out thus, there has been some defect or excess in the treatment.
						And in this simple plan of treatment it is necessary to attend also
						to the following directions, which some physicians pay little attention
						to, although, when improperly executed, they are capable of marring
						the whole process of bandaging: for if both the bones be broken, or
						the lower one only, and the patient who has got his arm bandaged keep
						it slung in a shawl, and that the shawl is particularly loose at the
						fracture, so that the arm is not properly suspended at this end or
						that, in this case the bone must necessarily be found distorted upwards;
						whereas, when both bones are thus broken, if the arm recline in the
						shawl at the wrist and elbow, but the rest of it be not kept up, the
						bone in this case will be distorted to the lower side. The greater
						part of the arm and the wrist of the hand should therefore be equally
						suspended in a broad soft shawl. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>Part 8</head>
					<p>
						When the arm is broken, if one stretch the fore-arm and adjust it
						while in this position, the muscle of the arm will be bound while
						extended; but when the dressing is over, and the patient bends his
						arm at the elbow, the muscle of the arm will assume a different shape.
						The following, then, is the most natural plan of setting the arm:
						having got a piece of wood a cubit or somewhat less in length, like
						the handles of spades,<pb id="p.179"/> suspend it by means of a chain fastened to
						its extremities at both ends; and having seated the man on some high
						object, the arm is to be brought over, so that the armpit may rest
						on the piece of wood, and the man can scarcely touch the seat, being
						almost suspended; then having brought another seat, and placed one
						or more leather pillows under the arm, so as to keep it a moderate
						height while it is bent at a right angle, the best plan is to put
						round the arm a broad and soft skin, or broad shawl, and to hang some
						great weight to it, so as to produce moderate extension; or otherwise,
						while the arm is in the position I have described, a strong man is
						to take hold of it at the elbow and pull it downward. But the physician
						standing erect, must perform the proper manipulation, having the one
						foot on some pretty high object, and adjusting the bone with the palms
						of his hands; and it will readily be adjusted, for the extension is
						good if properly applied. Then let him bind the arm, commencing at
						the fracture, and do otherwise as directed above; let him put the
						same questions and avail himself of the same signs to ascertain whether
						the arm be moderately tight or not; and every third day let him bind
						it anew and make it tighter; and on the seventh or ninth day let him
						bind it up with splints, and leave it so until after the lapse of
						more than thirty days. And if he suspect that the bone is not lying
						properly, let him remove the bandages in the interval, and having
						adjusted the arm, let him bind it up again. The bone of the arm is
						generally consolidated in forty days. When these are past, the dressing
						is to be removed, and fewer and slacker bandages applied instead of
						it. The patient is to be kept on a stricter diet, and for a longer
						space of time than in the former case; and we must form our judgment
						of it from the swelling in the hand, looking also to the strength
						of the patient. This also should be known, that the arm is naturally
						inclined outward; to this side, therefore, the distortion usually
						takes place, if not properly treated; but indeed, all the other bones
						are usually distorted during treatment for fracture to that side to
						which they naturally incline. When, therefore, anything of this kind
						is suspected, the arm is to be encircled in a broad shawl, which is
						to be carried round the <pb id="p.180"/>breast, and when the patient goes to rest,
						a compress of many folds, or some such thing, is to be folded and
						placed between the elbow and the side, for thus the bending of the
						bone will be rectified, but care must be taken lest it be inclined
						too much inwards. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="9">

						The human foot is composed of several small bones like the hand. These
						bones therefore are scarcely ever broken, unless the skin at the same
						time be wounded by some sharp and heavy body. The treatment of such
						injuries, therefore, will be delivered under the head of wounds. But
						if any bone be moved from its place, or a joint of the toes be luxated,
						or any of the bones of the part called the tarsus be displaced, it
						must be forced back again to its place as described with regard to
						the hand; and is to be treated with cerate, compresses, and bandages,
						like the fractures, with the exception of the splints; and is to be
						secured tightly in the same way, and the bandages renewed on the third
						day; and the patient thus bandaged should return the same answers
						as in fractures, as to the bandages feeling tight or slack. All these
						bones recover perfectly in twenty days, except those that are connected
						with the bones of the leg, and are in a line with them. It is advantageous
						to lie in bed during the whole of this time; but the patients, thinking
						light of the complaint, have not perseverance to do this, and they
						walk about before they get well; wherefore many of these do not make
						a perfect recovery. And often the pain puts them in mind of the injury;
						and deservedly, for the feet sustain the weight of the whole body.
						When, therefore, they walk about before they are whole, the joints
						which have been luxated are cured incompletely; and, on that account,
						while walking about, they have pains in the leg from time to time. </p></div2> <div2 type="section" n="10">
							<head>Part 10</head>
							<p>
								But those bones which are connected with the bones of the leg are
								larger than the others, and the cure of them when luxuated is more
								protracted. The mode of treatment then is the same; but we must use
								more bandages and more splints, and the bandage is to be carried round
								to this side and to that, and pressure is to be made as in the other
								cases, particularly at the seat of the luxation, and the first circles
								of the bandages are <pb id="p.181"/>to be made there. And at each time the bandages
								are taken off, much hot water is to be used, for in all injuries at
								joints the affusion of hot water in large quantity is to be had recourse
								to. And the same symptoms of compression and relaxation should manifest
								themselves in the same times, as in the cases formerly treated of,
								and the subsequent bandagings should be conducted in like manner.
								These cases get completely well for the most part in forty days, if
								the patients have resolution to keep their bed; but if not, they are
								subjected to the complaints formerly described, or still worse. </p></div2>

						In persons who jumping from any high object pitch upon their heel
						with great force, the bones are separated, and the veins pour forth
						their contents, owing to the contusion of the flesh surrounding the
						bone, and hence a swelling and much pain supervene. For this bone
						(os calcis) is not a small one, protrudes beyond the line of the leg,
						and is connected with important veins and tendons; for the back tendon
						of the leg is inserted into this bone. Such cases are to be treated
						with cerate, and with compresses and bandages; and hot water is to
						be used in large quantity; and they require many bandages, which ought
						to be particularly good and appropriate. And if the patient happen
						to have a tender skin about the heel, nothing is to be done to it;
						but if, as some have it, the skin be thick and hardened, it is to
						be pared down smoothly and thinned, but without wounding it. It is
						not everybody who can apply the bandage properly in such cases; for
						if one shall bind the parts, as in other accidents about the ankle,
						sometimes bringing a fold round the foot and sometimes round the tendon,
						these turns leave out the heel, which is the seat of the contusion,
						and thus there is danger that the os calcis may sphacelate; and if
						this should take place, the impediment may endure for life and also
						in all the other cases of sphacelus, not proceeding from such a cause
						as this; as when, from being carelessly allowed to lie in a certain
						position during confinement to bed, the heel becomes black, or when
						a serious wound has occurred in the leg and it is long of healing,
						and is connected with the heel, or when the same thing happens in
						the thigh, or when in any disease a protracted decubitus takes place<pb id="p.182"/>
						on the back, in all such cases the sores are inveterate, troublesome,
						and frequently break out again, unless particular attention be paid
						to the cure, along with much rest, as in all the cases attended with
						sphacelus. And cases of sphacelus connected with this cause, in addition
						to other inconveniences, are attended with great danger to the whole
						body. For they are apt to be attended with very acute fevers, of the
						continual type, accompanied with tremblings, hiccup, aberration of
						intellect, and which prove fatal within a few days: and there may
						be lividities of bloody veins<note>By bloody viens is meant veins of a largge size, as Galen explains.  Contusions of such necessarily produce extravasation and hemorrage, and the other bad consequences described by our author.</note>, with nausea, and gangrene from pressure;
						these diseases may occur, besides the sphacelus.<note>That gangrene should have often supervened in such a case, as described by our author, need not appear surprising.  It shows that Hippocrates had a wonderful talent for original observation when he was able to detect and describe such a case; and it ought to teach our profession a lesson of humility, in comparing our present state of knowledge with that of our forefathers, when we thus find that the "old man of Cos," twenty-two centuries ago, understood the nature of this accident better than many of us did not many years since.</note> Those which have
						been described are the most violent contusion; but in general the
						contusions are mild, and no great care is required with regard to
						the treatment, and yet it must be conducted properly. But when the
						contusion appears to be severe, we must do as described above, making
						many turns of the bandage around the heel, sometimes carrying it to
						the extremity of the foot, sometimes to the middle, and sometimes
						around the leg; and, in addition, all the surrounding parts are to
						be bandaged in this direction and that, as formerly described; and
						the compression should not be made strong, but we should make use
						of many bandages, and it is better also to administer hellebore the
						same day or on the morrow; and the bandages should be removed on the
						third day and reapplied. And these are the symptoms by which we discover
						whether the case will get worse or not: when the extravasated blood,
						the lividities, and the surrounding parts become red and hard, there
						is danger of an exacerbation. But if there be no fever, we must give
						emetics, as has been said, and administer<pb id="p.183"/> the other remedies which
						are applicable when the fever is not of a continual type; but if continual
						fever be present, we must not give strong medicines, but enjoin abstinence
						from solid food and soups, and give water for drink, and not allow
						wine but <hi rend="ital">oxyglyky</hi> (a composition from vinegar and honey?). But if
						the case be not going to get worse, the ecchymosed and livid parts,
						and those surrounding them become greenish and not hard; for this
						is a satisfactory proof in all cases of ecchymosis, that they are
						not to get worse; but when lividity is complicated with hardness,
						there is danger that the part may become blackened. And we must so
						manage the foot as that it may be generally raised a little higher
						than the rest of the body. Such a patient will get well in sixty days
						if he keep quiet.</p></div2>

						The leg consists of two bones, of which the one is much more slender
						than the other at one part, but not much more slender at another.
						These are connected together at the foot, and form a common epiphysis,
						but they are not united together along the line of the leg; and at
						the thigh they are united together and form an epiphysis, and this
						epiphysis has a diaphysis; but the other bone in a line with the little
						toe is a little longer. Such is the nature of the bones of the leg.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="13">
					<head>Part 13</head>
					<p>
						Sometimes the bones connected with the foot are displaced, sometimes
						both bones with their epiphysis; sometimes the whole epiphysis is
						slightly moved, and sometimes the other bone. These cases are less
						troublesome than the same accidents at the wrist, if the patients
						will have resolution to give them rest. The mode of treatment is the
						same as that of the other, for the reduction is to be made, as of
						the other, by means of extension, but greater force is required, as
						the parts of the body concerned are stronger in this case. But, for
						the most part, two men will be sufficient, by making extension in
						opposite directions, but, not withstanding, if they are not sufficiently
						strong, it is easy to make more powerful extension in the following
						way: having fixed in the ground either the nave of a wheel, or any
						such object, something soft is to be bound round the foot, and then
						some broad thongs of ox-skin being brought round it, the heads of
						the thongs are to be fastened to a pestle or any other piece of wood,
						the end of <pb id="p.184"/>which is to be inserted into the nave, and it, the pestle,
						is to be pulled away, while other persons make counter-extension by
						grasping the shoulders and the ham. It is also sometimes necessary
						to secure the upper extremity otherwise; this if you desire to effect,
						fasten deeply in the ground a round, smooth piece of wood, and place
						the upper extremity of the piece of wood at the perineum, so that
						it may prevent the body from yielding to the pulling at the foot,
						and, moreover, to prevent the leg while stretched, from inclining
						downward; some person seated at his side should push back the hip,
						so that the body may not turn round with the pulling, and for this
						purpose, if you think fit, pieces of wood may be fastened about the
						armpits on each side, and they are to be stretched by the hands, and
						thus secured, while another person takes hold of the limb at the knee,
						and aids in thus making counter-extension. Or thus, if you prefer
						it: having bound other thongs of leather about the limb, either at
						the knee, or around the thigh, and having fastened another nave of
						a wheel in the ground above the head, and adjusted the thongs piece
						of wood adapted to the nave, extension may thus be made in the opposite
						direction to the feet. Or if you choose, it may be done thus: instead
						of the naves, lay a moderate-sized beam under the couch, and then
						having fastened pieces of wood in this beam, both before and behind
						the head, make counter-extension by means of thongs, or place windlasses
						at this extremity and that, and make extension by means of them. There
						are many other methods of making extension. But the best thing is,
						for any physician who practices in a large city, to have prepared
						a proper wooden machine, with all the mechanical powers applicable
						in cases of fractures and dislocation, either for making extension,
						or acting as a lever. For this purpose it will be sufficient to possess
						a board in length, breadth, and thickness, resembling the quadrangular
						threshing-boards made of oak.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="14">
					<head>Part 14</head>
					<p>
						When you have made proper extension, it is easy reduce the joint,
						for the displaced bone is thus raised into a line with the other.
						And the bones are to be adjusted with the palms of the hands, pressing
						upon the projecting bone with the one, and making counter-pressure
						below the ankle with the other. When<pb id="p.185"/> you have replaced the bones,
						you must apply the bandages while the parts are upon the stretch,
						if you possibly can; but if prevented by the thongs, you must loose
						them, and make counter-extension until you get the bandages applied.
						The bandage is to be applied in the manner formerly described, the
						heads of the bandages being placed on the projecting part, and the
						first turns made in like manner, and so also with regard to the number
						of compresses and the compression; and turns of the bandages are to
						be brought frequently round on this and on that side of the ankle.
						But this joint must be bound more tight at the first dressing than
						in the case of the hand. But when you have applied the bandage, you
						must place the bandaged part somewhat higher than the rest of the
						body, and in such a position that the foot may hang as little as possible.
						The attenuation of the body is to be made proportionate to the magnitude
						of the luxation, for one luxation is to be a small, and another to
						a great extent. But in general we must reduce more, and for a longer
						time, in injuries about the legs, than in those about the hands; for
						the former parts are larger and thicker than the latter, and it is
						necessary that the body should be kept in a state of rest, and in
						a recumbent position. There is nothing to prevent or require the limb
						to be bandaged anew on the third day. And all the treatment otherwise
						is to be conducted in like manner, as in the preceding cases. And
						if the patient have resolution to lie quiet, forty days will be sufficient
						for this purpose, if only the bones be properly reduced, but if he
						will not lie quiet, he will not be able to use the limb with ease,
						and he will find it necessary to wear a bandage for a long time. When
						the bones are not properly replaced, but there has been some defect
						in this respect, the hip, the thigh, and the leg become wasted, and
						if the dislocation be inward, the external part of the thigh is wasted,
						and <hi rend="ital">vice versa</hi>. But for the most part the dislocation is inward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="15">

						And when both bones of the leg are broken without a wound of the skin,
						stronger extension is required. We may make extension by some of the
						methods formerly described, provided the bones ride over one another
						to a considerable degree. But extension by men is also sufficient,
						and for the most part two <pb id="p.186"/>strong men will suffice, by making extension
						and counterextension. Extension must naturally be made straight in
						a line with the leg and thigh, whether on account of a fracture of
						the bones of the leg or of the thigh. And in both cases they are to
						be bandaged while in a state of extension, for the same position does
						not suit with the leg and the arm. For when the fractured bones of
						the arm or fore-arm are bandaged, the fore-arm is suspended in a sling,
						and if you bind them up while extended, the figures of the fleshy
						parts will be changed in bending the arm at the elbow, for the elbow
						cannot be kept long extended, since persons are not in the custom
						of keeping the joint long in this form, but in a bent position, and
						persons who have been wounded in the arm, and are still able to walk
						about, require to have the arm bent at the elbow-joint. But the leg,
						both in walking and standing, is habitually extended, either completely
						or nearly so, and is usually in a depending position from its construction,
						and in order that it may bear the weight of the rest of the body.
						Wherefore it readily bears to be extended when necessary, and even
						when in bed the limb is often in this position. And when wounded,
						necessity subdues the understanding, since the patients become incapable
						of raising themselves up, so that they neither think of bending the
						limb nor of getting up erect, but remain lying in the same position.
						For these reasons, neither the same position nor the same mode of
						bandaging applies to the arm and to the leg. If, then, extension by
						means of men be sufficient, we should not have recourse to any useless
						contrivances, for it is absurd to
						employ mechanical means when not required; but if extension by men
						be not sufficient, you may use any of the mechanical powers which
						is suitable. When sufficiently extended, it will be easy to adjust
						the bones and bring them into their natural position, by straightening
						and arranging them with the palms of the hand. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="16">
					<head>Part 16</head>
					<p>
						When the parts are adjusted, you should apply the bandages while the
						limb is in a stretched position, making the first turns to the right
						or to the left, as may be most suitable; and the end of the bandage
						should be placed over the fracture, and the first turns made at that
						place; and then the bandage should be <pb id="p.187"/>carried up the leg, as described
						with regard to the other fractures. But the bandages should be broader
						and longer, and more numerous, in the case of the leg than in that
						of the arm. And when it is bandaged it should be laid upon some smooth
						and soft object, so that it may not be distorted to the one side or
						the other, and that there may be no protrusion of the bones either
						forward or backward; for this purpose nothing is more convenient than
						a cushion, or something similar, either of linen or wool, and not
						hard; it is to be made hollow along its middle, and placed below the
						limb. With regard to the canals (<hi rend="ital">gutters?</hi>) usually placed below fractured
						legs, I am at a loss whether to advise that they should be used or
						not. For they certainly are beneficial, but not to the extent which
						those who use them suppose. For the canals do not preserve the leg
						at rest as they suppose; nor, when the rest of the body is turned
						to the one side or the other, does the canal prevent the leg from
						following, unless the patient himself pay attention; neither does
						the canal prevent the limb from being moved without the body to the
						one side or the other. And a board is an uncomfortable thing to have
						the limb laid upon, unless something soft be placed above it. But
						it is a very useful thing in making any subsequent arrangements of
						the bed and in going to stool. A limb then may be well or ill arranged
						with or without the canal. But the common people have more confidence,
						and the surgeon is more likely to escape blame, when the canal is
						placed under the limb, although it is not <hi rend="ital">secundum artem</hi>. For the
						limb should by all means lie straight upon some level and soft object,
						since the bandaging must necessarily be overcome by any distortion
						in the placing of the leg, whenever or to whatever extent it may be
						inclined. The patient, when bandaged, should return the same answers
						as formerly stated, for the bandaging should be the same, and the
						same swellings should arise in the extremities, and the slackening
						of the bandages in like manner, and the new bandaging on the third
						day; and the bandaged part should be found reduced in swelling; and
						the new bandagings should be more tightly put on, and more pieces
						of cloth should be used; and the bandages should be carried loosely
						about the foot, unless the wound be near the <pb id="p.188"/>knee. Extension should
						be made and the bones adjusted at every new bandaging; for, if properly
						treated, and if the swelling progress in a suitable manner, the bandaged
						limb will have become more slender and attenuated, and the bones will
						be more mobile, and yield more readily to extension. On the seventh,
						the ninth, or the eleventh day, the splints should be applied as described
						in treating of the other fractures. Attention should be paid to the
						position of the splints about the ankles and along the tendon of the
						foot which runs up the leg. The bones of the leg get consolidated
						in forty days, if properly treated. But if you suspect that anything
						is wanting to the proper arrangement of the limb, or dread any ulceration,
						you should loose the bandages in the interval, and having put everything
						right, apply them again.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="17">
					<head>Part 17</head>
					<p>
						But if the other bone (<hi rend="ital">fibula?</hi>) of the leg be broken, less powerful
						extension is required, and yet it must not be neglected, nor be performed
						slovenly, more especially at the first bandaging. For in all cases
						of fracture this object should be attained then as quickly as possible.
						For when the bandage is applied tight while the bones are not properly
						arranged, the properly arranged, the part becomes more painful. The
						treatment otherwise is the same. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="18">
					<head>Part 18</head>
					<p>
						Of the bones of the leg, the inner one, called the tibia, is the more
						troublesome to manage, and requires the greater extension; and if
						the broken bones are not properly arranged, it is impossible to conceal
						the distortion, for the bone is exposed and wholly uncovered with
						flesh; and it is much longer before patients can walk on the leg when
						this bone is broken. But if the outer bone be broken, it causes much
						less trouble, and the deformity, when the bones are not properly set,
						is much more easily concealed, the bone being well covered with flesh;
						and the patients speedily get on foot, for it is the inner bone of
						the leg which supports the most of the weight of the body. For along
						with the thigh, as being in a line with weight thrown upon the thigh,
						the inner bone has more work to sustain; inasmuch as it is the head
						of the thigh-bone which sustains the upper part of the body, and it
						is on the inner and not on the outer side of<pb id="p.189"/> the thigh, being in a
						line with the tibia; and the other half of the body approximates more
						to this line than to the external one; and at the same time the inner
						bone is larger than the outer, as in the fore-arm the bone in the
						line of the little finger is the slenderer and longer. But in the
						joint of the inferior extremity, the disposition of the longer bone
						is not alike, for the elbow and the ham are bent differently. For
						these reasons when the external bone is broken, the patients can soon
						walk about; but in fractures of the inner, it is a long time before
						they can walk.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="18">
					<head>Part 18</head>
					<p>
						When the thigh-bone is broken, particular pains should be taken with
						regard to the extension that it may not be insufficient, for when
						excessive, no great harm results from it. For, if one should bandage
						a limb while the extremities of the bone are separated to a distance
						from one another by the force of the extension, the bandaging will
						not keep them separate, and so the bones will come together again
						as soon as the persons stretching it let go their hold; for the fleshy
						parts (<hi rend="ital">muscles?</hi>) being thick and strong, are more powerful than the
						bandaging, instead of being less so. In the case then which we are
						now treating of, nothing should be omitted in order that the parts
						may be properly distended and put in a straight line; for it is a
						great disgrace and an injury to exhibit a shortened thigh. For the
						arm, when shortened, might be concealed, and the mistake would not
						be great; but a shortened thigh-bone would exhibit the man maimed.
						For when the sound limb is placed beside it, being longer than the
						other, it exposes the mistake, and therefore it would be to the advantage
						of a person who would be improperly treated that both his legs should
						be broken, rather than either of them; for in this case the one would
						be of the same length as the other. When, then, proper extension has
						been made, you must adjust the parts with the palms of the hands,
						and bandage the limb in the manner formerly described, placing the
						hands of the bandages as was directed, and making the turns upward.
						And the patient should return the same answers to the same questions
						as formerly, should be pained and recover in like manner, and should
						have the bandaging<pb id="p.190"/> renewed in the same way; and the application of
						the splints should be the same. The thigh-bone is consolidated in
						forty days.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="20">
					<head>Part 20</head>
					<p>
						But this also should be known, that the thigh-bone is curved rather
						to the outside than to the inside, and rather forward than backward;
						when not properly treated, then, the distortions are in these directions;
						and the bone is least covered with flesh at the same parts, so that
						the distortion cannot be concealed. If, therefore, you suspect anything
						of this kind, you should have recourse to the mechanical contrivances
						recommended in distortion of the arm. And a few turns of the bandage
						should be brought round by the hip and the loins, so that the groin
						and the articulation near the perineum may be included in the bandage;
						and moreover, it is expedient that the extremities of the splints
						should not do mischief by being placed on parts not covered with the
						bandages. The splints, in fact, should be carefully kept off the naked
						parts at both ends; and the arrangement of them should be so managed,
						as that they may not be placed on the natural protuberances of the
						bone at the knee-joint, nor on the tendon which is situated there.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="21">
					<head>Part 21</head>
					<p>
						The swellings which arise in the ham, at the foot, or in any other
						part from the pressure, should be well wrapped in unscoured and carded
						wool, washed with wine and oil, and anointed with cerate, before bandaging;
						and if the splints give pain they should be slackened. You may sooner
						reduce the swellings, by laying aside the splints, and applying plenty
						of bandages to them, beginning from below and rolling upward; for
						thus the swellings will be most speedily reduced, and the humors be
						propelled to the parts above the former bandages. But this form of
						bandaging must not be used unless there be danger of vesications or
						blackening in the swelling, and nothing of the kind occurs unless
						the fracture be bound too tight, or unless the limb be allowed to
						hang, or it be rubbed with the hand, or some other thing of an irritant
						nature be applied to the skin. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="22">
					<head>Part 22</head>
					<p>
						More injury than good results from placing below the thigh a canal
						which does not pass farther down than the ham,<pb id="p.191"/> for it neither prevents
						the body nor the leg from being moved without the thigh. And it creates
						uneasiness by being brought down to the ham, and has a tendency to
						produce what of all things should be avoided, namely, flexion at the
						knee, for this completely disturbs the bandages; and when the thigh
						and leg are bandaged, if one bend the limb at the knee, the muscles
						necessarily assume another shape, and the broken bones are also necessarily
						moved. Every endeavor then should be made to keep the ham extended.
						But it appears to me, that a canal which embraces the limb from the
						nates to the foot is of use. And moreover, a shawl should be put loosely
						round at the ham, along with the canal, as children are swathed in
						bed; and then, if the thigh-bone gets displaced either upward or to
						the side, it can be more easily kept in position by this means along
						with the canal. The canal then should be made so as to extend all
						along the limb or not used at all. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="23">
					<head>Part 23</head>
					<p>
						The extremity of the heel should be particularly attended to, so that
						it may be properly laid, both in fractures of the leg and of the thigh.
						For if the foot be placed in a dependent position, while the rest
						of the body is supported, the limb must present a curved appearance
						at the forepart of the leg; and if the heel be placed higher than
						is proper, and if the rest of the leg be rather too low, the bone
						at the forepart of the leg must present a hollow, more especially
						if the heel of the patient be naturally large. But all the bones get
						consolidated more slowly, if not laid properly, and if not kept steady
						in the same position, and in this case the callus is more feeble. </p></div2>

						These things relate to cases in which there is fracture of the bones
						without protrusion of the same or wound of any other kind. In those
						cases in which the bones are simply broken across, and are not comminuted,
						but protrude, if reduced the same day or next, and secured in their
						place, and if there be no reason to anticipate that any splintered
						bones will come away; and in those in which the broken bones do not
						protrude, nor is the mode of fracture such that there is reason to
						expect the splinters will come out, some physicians heal the sores
						in a way which neither does much good nor harm, by means of a cleansing<pb id="p.192"/>
						application, applying pitch ointment, or some of the dressings for
						fresh wounds, or anything else which they are accustomed to do, and
						binding above them compresses wetted with wine, or greasy wool, or
						something else of the like nature. And when the wounds become clean
						and are new healed, they endeavor to bind up the limb with plenty
						of bandages, and keep it straight with treatment does some good, and
						never much harm. The bones, however, can never be equally well restored
						to their place, but the part is a little more swelled than it should
						be; and the limb will be somewhat shortened, provided both bones either
						of the leg or fore-arm have been fractured.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="25">
					<head>Part 25</head>
					<p> 
						There are others who treat such cases at first with bandages, applying
						them on both sides of the seat of the injury, but omit them there,
						and leave the wound uncovered, and afterward they apply to the wound
						some cleansing medicine, and complete the dressing with compresses
						dipped in wine and greasy wool. This plan of treatment is bad, and
						it is clear that those who adopt this mode of practice are guilty
						of great mistakes in other cases of fracture as well as these. For
						it is a most important consideration to know in what manner the head
						of the bandage should be placed and at what part the greatest pressure
						should be, and what benefits would result from applying the end of
						the bandage and the pressure at the proper place, and what mischiefs
						would result from applying the head of the bandage and the pressure
						otherwise than at the proper place. Wherefore it has been stated in
						the preceding part of the work what are the results of either; and
						the practice of medicine bears witness to the truth of it, for in
						a person thus bandaged, a swelling must necessarily arise on the wound.
						For, if even a sound piece of skin were bandaged on either side, and
						a part were left in the middle, the part thus left unbandaged would
						become most swelled, and would assume a bad color; how then could
						it be that a wound would not suffer in like manner? The wound then
						must necessarily become discolored and its lips everted, the discharge
						will be ichorous and without pus, and the bones, which should not
						have got into a state of necrosis, exfoliate; and the wound gets into
						a throbbing and inflamed condition. And they<pb id="p.193"/> are obliged to apply
						a cataplasm on account of the swelling, but this is an unsuitable
						application to parts which are bandaged on both sides, for a useless
						load is added to the throbbing which formerly existed in it. At last
						they loose the bandages when matters get very serious, and conduct
						the rest of the treatment without bandaging; and notwithstanding,
						if they meet with another case of the same description, they treat
						it in the same manner, for they do not think that the application
						of the bandages on both sides, and the exposure of the wound are the
						cause of what happened, but some other untoward circumstance. Wherefore
						I would not have written so much on this subject, if I had not well
						known that this mode of bandaging is unsuitable, and yet that many
						conduct the treatment in this way, whose mistake it is of vital importance
						to correct, while what is here said is a proof, that what was formerly
						written as to the circumstances under which bandages should be tightly
						applied to fractures or otherwise has been correctly written. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="26">
					<head>Part 26</head>
					<p>
						As a general rule it may be said, that in those cases in which a separation
						of bone is not expected, the same treatment should be applied as when
						the fractures are not complicated with an external wound; for the
						extension, adjustment of the bones, and the bandaging, are to be conducted
						in the same manner. To the wound itself a cerate mixed with pitch
						is to be applied, a thin folded compress is to be bound upon it, and
						the parts around are to be anointed with white cerate. The cloths
						for bandages and the other things should be torn broader than in cases
						in which there is no wound, and the first turn of the bandage should
						be a good deal broader than the wound. For a narrower bandage than
						the wound binds the wound like a girdle, which is not proper, or the
						first turn should comprehend the whole wound, and the bandaging should
						extend beyond it on both sides. The bandage then should be put on
						in the direction of the wound, and should be not quite so tight as
						when there is no wound, but the bandage should be otherwise applied
						in the manner described above. The bandages should be of a soft consistence,
						and more especially so in such cases than in those not complicated
						with a wound. The number of bandages should not<pb id="p.194"/> be smaller, but rather
						greater than those formerly described. When applied, the patient should
						have the feeling of the parts being properly secured, but not too
						tight, and in particular he should be able to say that they are firm
						about the wound. And the intervals of time during which the parts
						seem to be properly adjusted, and those in which they get loose, should
						be the same as those formerly described. The bandages should be renewed
						on the third day, and the after treatment conducted in the same manner
						as formerly described, except that in the latter case the compression
						should be somewhat less than in the former. And if matters go on properly,
						the parts about the wound should be found at every dressing always
						more and more free of swelling, and the swelling should have subsided
						on the whole part comprehended by the bandages. And the suppurations
						will take place more speedily than in the case of wounds treated otherwise;
						and the pieces of flesh in the wound which have become black and dead,
						will sooner separate and fall off under this plan of treatment than
						any other, and the sore will come more quickly to cicatrization when
						thus treated than otherwise. The reason of all this is, that the parts
						in which the wound is situated, and the surrounding parts, are kept
						free of swelling. In all other respects the treatment is to be conducted
						as in cases of fracture without a wound of the integuments. Splints
						should not be applied. On this account the bandages should be more
						numerous than in the former case, both because they must be put on
						less tight, and because the splints are later of being applied. But
						if you do apply the splints, they should not be applied along the
						wound, and they are to be put on in a loose manner, especial care
						being taken that there may be no great compression from the splints.
						This direction has been formerly given. And the diet should be more
						restricted, and for a longer period, in those cases in which there
						is a wound at the commencement, and when the bones protrude through
						the skin; and, in a word, the greater the wound, the more severe and
						protracted should the regimen be. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="27">
					<head>Part 27</head>
					<p>
						The treatment of the sores is the same in those cases of fracture
						in which there was no wound of the skin at first, but<pb id="p.195"/> one has formed
						in the course of treatment, owing to the pressure of the splints occasioned
						by the bandages, or from any other cause. In such cases it is ascertained
						that there is an ulcer, by the pain and the throbbing; and the swelling
						in the extremities becomes harder than usual, and if you apply your
						finger the redness disappears, but speedily returns. If you suspect
						anything of the kind you must loose the dressing, if there be any
						itching below the under-bandages, or in any other part that is bandaged,
						and used a pitched cerate instead of the other. If there be nothing
						of that, but if the ulcer be found in an irritable state, being very
						black and foul, and the fleshy parts about to suppurate, and the tendons
						to slough away, in these cases no part is to be exposed to the air,
						nor is anything to be apprehended from these suppurations, but the
						treatment is to be conducted in the same manner as in those cases
						in which there was an external wound at first. You must begin to apply
						the bandages loosely at the swelling in the extremities, and then
						gradually proceed upward with the bandaging, so that it may be tight
						at no place, but particularly firm at the sore, and less so elsewhere.
						The first bandages should be clean and not narrow, and the number
						of bandages should be as great as in those cases in which the splints
						were used, or somewhat fewer. To the sore itself a compress, anointed
						with white cerate, will be sufficient, for if a piece of flesh or
						nerve (<hi rend="ital">tendon?</hi>) become black, it will fall off; for such sores are
						not to be treated with acrid, but with emollient applications, like
						burns. The bandages are to be renewed every third day, and no splints
						are to be applied, but rest is to be more rigidly maintained than
						in the former cases, along with a restricted diet. It should be known,
						that if any piece of flesh or tendon be to come away, the mischief
						will spread much less, and the parts will much more speedily drop
						off, and the swelling in the surrounding parts will much more completely
						subside, under this treatment, than if any of the cleansing applications
						be put upon the sore. And if any part that is to come away shall fall
						off, the part will incarnate sooner when thus treated than otherwise,
						and will more speedily cicatrize. Such are the good effects of knowing
						how a bandage can be well and moderately applied.<pb id="p.196"/> But a proper position,
						the other parts of the regimen, and suitable bandages cooperate. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="28">
					<head>Part 28</head>
					<p>
						If you are deceived with regard to a recent wound, supposing there
						will be no exfoliation of the bones, while they are on the eve of
						coming out of the sore, you must not hesitate to adopt this mode of
						treatment; for no great mischief will result, provided you have the
						necessary dexterity to apply the bandages well and without doing any
						harm. And this is a symptom of an exfoliation of bone being about
						to take place under this mode of treatment; pus runs copiously from
						the sore, and appears striving to make its escape. The bandage must
						be renewed more frequently on account of the discharge, since otherwise
						fevers come on; if the sore and surrounding parts be compressed by
						the bandages they become wasted. Cases complicated with the exfoliation
						of very small bones, do not require any change of treatment, only
						the bandages should be put on more loosely, so that the discharge
						of pus may not be intercepted, but left free, and the dressings are
						to be frequently renewed until the bone exfoliate, and the splints
						should not be applied until then.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="29">
					<head>Part 29</head>
					<p>
						Those cases in which the exfoliation of a larger piece of bone is
						expected, whether you discover this at the commencement, or perceive
						subsequently that it is to happen, no longer require the same mode
						of treatment, only that the extension and arrangement of the parts
						are to be performed in a manner that has been described; but having
						formed double compresses, not less than half a fathom in breadth (being
						guided in this by the nature of the wound), and considerably shorter
						than what would be required to go twice round the part that is wounded,
						but considerably longer than to go once round, and in number what
						will be sufficient, these are to be dipped in a black austere wine;
						and beginning at the middle, as is done in applying the double-headed
						bandage, you are to wrap the part around and proceed crossing the
						heads in the form of the bandage called "ascia." These things are
						to be done at the wound, and on both sides of it; and there must be
						no compression, but they are to be laid on so as to give support to
						the wound. And on the wound itself is to be applied the pitched cerate,
						or one of the applications<pb id="p.197"/> to recent wounds, or any other medicine
						which will suit with the embrocation. And if it be the summer season,
						the compresses are to be frequently damped with wine; but if the winter
						season, plenty of greasy wool, moistened with wine and oil, should
						be applied. And a goat's skin should be spread below, so as to carry
						off the fluids which run from the wound; these must be guarded against,
						and it should be kept in mind, that parts which remain long in the
						same position are subject to excoriations which are difficult to cure. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="30">
					<head>Part 30</head>
					<p>
						In such cases as do not admit of bandaging according to any of the
						methods which have been described, or which will be described, great
						pains should be taken that the fractured part of the body be laid
						in a right position, and attention should be paid that it may incline
						upward rather than downward. But if one would wish to do the thing
						well and dexterously, it is proper to have recourse to some mechanical
						contrivance, in order that the fractured part of the body may undergo
						proper and not violent extension; and this means is particularly applicable
						in fractures of the leg. There are certain physicians who, in all
						fractures of the leg, whether bandages be applied or not, fasten the
						sole of the foot to the couch, or to some other piece of wood which
						they have fixed in the ground near the couch. These persons thus do
						all sorts of mischief but no good; for it contributes nothing to the
						extension that the foot is thus bound, as the rest of the body will
						no less sink down to the foot, and thus the limb will no longer be
						stretched, neither will it do any good toward keeping the limb in
						a proper position, but will do harm, for when the rest of the body
						is turned to this side or that, the bandaging will not prevent the
						foot and the bones belonging to it from following the rest of the
						body. For if it had not been bound it would have been less distorted,
						as it would have been the less prevented from following the motion
						of the rest of the body. But one should sew two balls of Egyptian
						leather, such as are worn by persons confined for a length of time
						in large shackles, and the balls should have coats on each
						side, deeper toward the wound, but shorter toward the joints; and
						the balls should be well stuffed and soft, and fit well, the one above
						the <pb id="p.198"/>ankles, and the other below the knee. Sideways it should have
						below two appendages, either of a single or double thong, and short,
						like loops, the one set being placed on either side of the ankle,
						and the other on the knee. And the other upper ball should have others
						of the same kind in the same line. Then taking four rods, made of
						the cornel tree, of equal length, and of the thickness of a finger,
						and of such length that when bent they will admit of being adjusted
						to the appendages, care should be taken that the extremities of the
						rods bear not upon the skin, but on the extremities of the balls.
						There should be three sets of rods, or more, one set a little longer
						than another, and another a little shorter and smaller, so that they
						may produce greater or less distention, if required. Either of these
						sets of rods should be placed on this side and that of the ankles.
						If these things be properly contrived, they should occasion a proper
						and equable extension in a straight line, without giving any pain
						to the wound; for the pressure, if there is any, should be thrown
						at the foot and the thigh. And the rods are commodiously arranged
						on either side of the ankles, so as not to interfere with the position
						of the limb; and the wound is easily examined and easily arranged.
						And, if thought proper, there is nothing to prevent the two upper
						rods from being fastened to one another; and if any light covering
						be thrown over the limb, it will thus be kept off from the wound.
						If, then, the balls be well made, handsome, soft, and newly stitched,
						and if the extension by the rods be properly managed, as has been
						already described, this is an excellent contrivance; but if any of
						them do not fit properly, it does more harm than good. And all other
						mechanical contrivances should either be properly done, or not be
						had recourse to at all, for it is a disgraceful and awkward thing
						to use mechanical means in an unmechanical way. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="31">
					<head>Part 31</head>
					<p>
						Moreover, the greater part of physicians treat fractures, both with
						and without an external wound, during the first days, by means of
						unwashed wool, and there does not appear to be anything improper in
						this. It is very excusable for those who are called upon to treat
						newly-received accidents of this kind, and who have no cloth for bandages
						at hand, to do them up <pb id="p.199"/>with wool; for, except cloth for bandages,
						one could not have anything better than wool in such cases; but a
						good deal should be used for this purpose, and it should be well carded
						and not rough, for in small quantity and of a bad quality it has little
						power. But those who approve of binding up the limb with wool for
						a day or two, and on the third and fourth apply bandages, and make
						the greatest compression and extension at that period, such persons
						show themselves to be ignorant of the most important principles of
						medicine; for, in a word, at no time is it so little proper to disturb
						all kinds of wounds as on the third and fourth day; and all sort of
						probing should be avoided on these days in whatever other injuries
						are attended with irritation. For, generally, the third and fourth
						day in most cases of wounds, are those which give rise to exacerbations,
						whether the tendency be to inflammation, to a foul condition of the
						sore, or to fevers. And if any piece of information be particularly
						valuable this is; to which of the most important cases in medicine
						does it not apply? and that not only in wounds but in many other diseases,
						unless one should call all other diseases wounds. And this doctrine
						is not devoid of a certain degree of plausibility, for they are allied
						to one another in many respects. But those who maintain that wool
						should be used until after the first seven days, and then that the
						parts should be extended and adjusted, and secured with bandages,
						would appear not to be equally devoid of proper judgment, for the
						proper judgment, for the most dangerous season for inflammation is
						then past, and the bones being loose can be easily set after the lapse
						of these days. But still this mode of treatment is far inferior to
						that with bandages from the commencement; for, the latter method exhibits
						the patient on the seventh day free from inflammation, and ready for
						complete bandaging with splints; while the former method is far behind
						in this respect, and is attended with many other bad effects which
						it would be tedious to describe. </p></div2>

					<p>In those cases of fracture in which the bones protrude and cannot
						be restored to their place, the following mode of reduction may be
						practiced:- Some small pieces of iron are to be prepared like the
						levers which the cutters of stone make use of, one being<pb id="p.200"/> rather broader
						and another narrower; and there should be three of them at least,
						and still more, so that you may use those that suit best; and then,
						along with extension, we must use these as levers, applying the under
						surface of the piece of iron to the under fragment of the bone, and
						the upper surface to the upper bone; and, in a word, we must operate
						powerfully with the lever as we would do upon a stone or a piece of
						wood. The pieces of iron should be as strong as possible, so that
						they may not bend. This is a powerful assistance, provided the pieces
						of iron be suitable, and one use them properly as levers. Of all the
						mechanical instruments used by men, the most powerful are these three,
						the axis in peritrochio, the lever, and the wedge. Without these,
						one or all, men could not perform any of their works which require
						great force. Wherefore, reduction with the lever is not to be despised,
						for the bones will be reduced in this way, or not at all. But if the
						upper fragment which rides over the other does not furnish a suitable
						point of support a suitable point of support for the lever, but the
						protruding part is sharp, you must scoop out of the bone what will
						furnish a proper place for the lever to rest on. The lever, along
						with extension, may be had recourse to on the day of the accident,
						or next day, but by no means on the third, the fourth,
						and the fifth. For if the limb is disturbed on these days, and yet
						the fractured bones not reduced, inflammation will be excited, and
						this no less if they are reduced; for convulsions are more apt to
						occur if reduction take place, than if the attempt should fail. These
						facts should be well known, for if convulsions should come on when
						reduction is effected, there is little hope of recovery;
						but it is of use to displace the bones again if this can be done with
						out trouble. For it is not at the time when the parts are in a particularly
						relaxed condition that convulsions and tetanus are apt to supervene,
						but when they are more than usually tense. In the case we are now
						treating of, we should not disturb the limb on the aforesaid days,
						but strive to keep the wound as free from inflammation as possible,
						and especially encourage suppuration in it. But when seven days have
						elapsed, or rather more, if there be no fever, and if the wound be
						not inflamed, then there will be less to prevent an attempt at reduction,<pb id="p.201"/>
						if you hope to succeed; but otherwise you need not take and give trouble
						in vain.</p></div2>

						When you have reduced the bones to their place, the modes of treatment,
						whether you expect the bones to exfoliate or not, have been already
						described. All those cases in which an exfoliation of bone is expected,
						should be treated by the method of bandaging with cloths, beginning
						for the most part at the middle of the bandage, as is done with the
						double-headed bandage; but particular attention should be paid to
						the shape of the wound, so that its lips may gape or be distorted
						as little as possible under the bandage. Sometimes the turns of the
						bandage have to be made to the right, and sometimes to the left, and
						sometimes a double-headed bandage is to be used.</p></div2>

						It should be known that bones, which it has been found impossible
						to reduce, as well as those which are wholly denuded of flesh, will
						become detached. In some cases the upper part of the bone is laid
						bare, and in others the flesh dies all around; and, from a sore of
						long standing, certain of the bones become carious, and some not,
						some more, and some less; and in some the small, and in others the
						large bones. From what has been said it will be seen, that it is impossible
						to tell in one word when the bones will separate. Some come away more
						quickly, owing to their smallness, and some from being merely fixed
						at the point; and some, from pieces not separating, but merely exfoliating,
						become dried up and putrid; and besides, different modes of treatment
						have different effects. For the most part, the bones separate most
						quickly in those cases in which suppuration takes place most quickly,
						and when new flesh is most quickly formed, and is particularly sound,
						for the flesh which grows up below in the wound generally elevates
						the pieces of bone. It will be well if the whole circle of the bone
						separate in forty days; for in some cases it is protracted to sixty
						days, and in some to more; for the more porous pieces of bone separate
						more quickly, but the more solid come away more slowly; but the other
						smaller splinters in much less time, and others otherwise. A portion
						of bone which protrudes should be sawn off for the following reasons:
						if it cannot be reduced, and if it appears<pb id="p.202"/> that only a small
						piece is required in order that it may get back into its place; and
						if it be such that it can be taken out, and if it occasions inconvenience
						and irritates any part of the flesh, and prevents the limb from being
						properly laid, and if, moreover, it be denuded of flesh, such a piece
						of bone should be taken off. With regard to the others, it is not
						of much consequence whether they be sawed off or not. For it should
						be known for certain, that such bones as are completely deprived of
						flesh, and have become dried, all separate completely. Those which
						are about to exfoliate should not be sawn off. Those that will separate
						completely must be judged of from the symptoms that have been laid
						down.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="34">
					<head>Part 34</head>
					<p>
						Such cases are to be treated with compresses and vinous applications,
						as formerly laid down regarding bones which will separate. We must
						avoid wetting it at the beginning with anything cold; for there is
						danger of febrile rigors, and also of convulsions; for convulsions
						are induced by cold things, and also sometimes by wounds. It is proper
						to know that the members are necessarily shortened in those cases
						in which the bones have been broken, and have healed the one across
						the other, and in those cases in which the whole circle of the bone
						has become detached.</p></div2>

						Those cases in which the bone of the thigh, or of the arm, protrudes,
						do not easily recover. For the bones are large, and contain much marrow;
						and many important nerves, muscles, and veins are wounded at the same
						time. And if you reduce them, convulsions usually supervene; and,
						if not reduced, acute bilious fevers come on, with singultus and mortification.
						The chances of recovery are not fewer in those cases in which the
						parts have not been reduced, nor any attempts made at reduction. Still
						more recover in those cases in which the lower, than those in which
						the upper part of the bone protrudes; and some will recover when reduction
						has been made, but very rarely indeed. For modes of treatment and
						peculiarity of constitution make a great difference as to the capability
						of enduring such an injury. And it makes a great difference if the
						bones of the arm and of the thigh protrude to the inside; for there
						are many and important vessels situated there, some of which, if wounded,
						will prove fatal; there are such also on the outside, but of less
						im-<pb id="p.203"/>portance. In wounds of this sort, then, one ought not to be ignorant
						of the dangers, and should prognosticate them in due time. But if
						you are compelled to have recourse to reduction, and hope to succeed,
						and if the bones do not cross one another much, and if the muscles
						are not contracted (for they usually are contracted), the lever in
						such cases may be advantageously employed.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="36">

					<p>
						Having effected the reduction, you must give an emollient draught
						of hellebore the same day, provided it has been reduced on the day
						of the accident, but otherwise it should not be attempted. The wound
						should be treated with the same things as are used in fractures of
						the bones of the head, and nothing cold should be applied; the patient
						should be restricted from food altogether, and if naturally of a bilious
						constitution, he should have for a diet a little fragrant <hi rend="ital">oxyglyky</hi>
						sprinkled on water; but if he is not bilious, he should have water
						for drink; and if fever of the continual type come on, he is to be
						confined to this regimen for fourteen days at least, but if he be
						free of fever, for only seven days, and then you must bring him back
						by degrees to a common diet. To those cases in which the bones have
						not been reduced, a similar course of medicine should be administered,
						along with the same treatment of the sores and regimen; and in like
						manner the suspended part of the body should not be stretched, but
						should rather be contracted, so as to relax the parts about the wound.
						The separation of the bones is protracted, as also was formerly stated.
						But one should try to escape from such cases, provided one can do
						so honourably, for the hopes of recovery are small, and the dangers
						many; and if the physician do not reduce the fractured bones he will
						be looked upon as unskillful, while by reducing them he will
						bring the patient nearer to death than to recovery.</p></div2>

						Luxations and subluxations at the knee are much milder accidents than
						subluxations and luxations at the elbow. For the knee-joint, in proportion
						to its size, is more compact than that of the arm, and has a more
						even conformation, and is <pb id="p.204"/>rounded, while the joint of the arm is large,
						and has many cavities. And in addition, the bones of the leg are nearly
						of the same length, for the external one overtops the other to so
						small an extent as hardly to deserve being mentioned, and therefore
						affords no great resistance, although the external nerve (<hi rend="ital">ligament?</hi>)
						at the ham arises from it; but the bones of the fore-arm are unequal,
						and the shorter is considerably thicker than the other, and the more
						slender (<hi rend="ital">ulna?</hi>) protrudes, and passes up above the joint, and to it
						(the <hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) are attached the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) which go downward
						to the junction of the bones; and the slender bone (<hi rend="ital">ulna?</hi>) has more
						to do with the insertion of the ligaments in the arm than the thick
						bone (<hi rend="ital">radius?</hi>). The configuration then of the articulations, and of
						the bones of the elbow, is such as I have described. Owing to their
						configuration, the bones at the knee are indeed frequently dislocated,
						but they are easily reduced, for no great inflammation follows, nor
						any constriction of the joint. They are displaced for the most part
						to the inside, sometimes to the outside, and occasionally into the
						ham. The reduction in all these cases is not difficult, but in the
						dislocations inward and outward, the patient should be placed on a
						low seat, and the thigh should be elevated, but not much. Moderate
						extension for the most part sufficeth, extension being made at the
						leg, and counter-extension at the thigh.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="38">
					<head>Part 38</head>
					<p>
						Dislocations at the elbow are more troublesome than those at the knee,
						and, owing to the inflammation which comes on, and the configuration
						of the joint, are more difficult to reduce if the bones are not immediately
						replaced. For the bones at the elbow are less subject to dislocation
						than those of the knee, but are more difficult to reduce and keep
						in their position, and are more apt to become inflamed and ankylosed. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="39">
					<head>Part 39</head>
					<p>
						For the most part the displacements of these bones are small, sometimes
						toward the ribs, and sometimes to the outside; and the whole articulation
						is not displaced, but that part of the humerus remains in place which
						is articulated with the cavity of the bone of the forearm that has
						a protuberance (<hi rend="ital">ulna?</hi>). Such dislocations, to whatever side, are easily
						reduced, and the extension is to be made in the line of the arm, one
						person making <pb id="p.205"/>extension at the wrist, and another grasping the armpit,
						while a third, applying the palm of his hand to the part of the joint
						which is displaced, pushes it inward, and at the same time makes
						counterpressure on the opposite side near the joint with the other
						hand.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="40">
					<head>Part 40</head>
					<p>
						The end of the humerus at the elbow gets displaced (<hi rend="ital">subluxated?</hi>)
						by leaving the cavity of the ulna. Such luxations readily yield to
						reduction, if applied before the parts get inflamed. The displacement
						for the most part is to the inside, but sometimes to the outside,
						and they are readily recognized by the shape of the limb. And often
						such luxations are reduced without any powerful extension. In dislocations
						inward, the joint is to be pushed into its place, while the fore-arm
						is brought round to a state of pronation. Such are most of the dislocations
						at the elbow.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="41">
					<head>Part 41</head>
					<p>
						But if the articular extremity of the humerus be carried to either
						side above the bone of the fore-arm, which is prominent, into the
						hollow of the arm (?), this rarely happens; but if it does happen,
						extension in the straight line is not so proper under such circumstances;
						for in such a mode of extension, the process of the ulna (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>)
						prevents the bone of the arm (<hi rend="ital">humerus?</hi>) from passing over it. In dislocations
						of this kind, extension should be made in the manner described when
						treating of the bandaging of fractured bones of the arm, extension
						being made upward at the armpit, while the parts at the elbow are
						pushed downward, for in this manner can the humerus be most readily
						raised above its cavity; and when so raised, the reduction is easy
						with the palms of the hand, the one being applied so as to make pressure
						on the protuberant part of the arm, and the other making counter-pressure,
						so as to push the bone of the fore-arm into the joint. This method
						answers with both cases. And perhaps this is the most suitable mode
						of reduction in such a case of dislocation. The parts may be reduced
						by extension in a straight line, but less readily than thus.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="42">
					<head>Part 42</head>
					<p>
						If the arm be dislocated forward- this rarely happens, indeed, but
						what would a sudden shock not displace? for many other things are
						removed from their proper place, notwith-<pb id="p.206"/>standing a great obstacle,-
						in such a violent displacement the part (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) which passes
						above the prominent part of the bones is large, and the stretching
						of the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) is intense; and yet the parts have been
						so dislocated in certain cases. The following is the symptom of such
						a displacement: the arm cannot be bent in the least degree at the
						elbow, and upon feeling the joint the nature of the accident becomes
						obvious. If, then, it is not speedily reduced, strong and violent
						inflammation, attended with fever, will come on, but if one happen
						to be on the spot at the time it is easily reduced. A piece of hard
						linen cloth (or a piece of hard linen, not very large, rolled up in
						a ball, will be sufficient) is to be placed across the bend of the
						elbow, and the arm is then to be suddenly bent at the elbow, and the
						hand brought up to the shoulder. This mode of reduction is sufficient
						in such displacements; and extension in the straight line can rectify
						this manner of dislocation, but we must use at the same time the palms
						of the hands, applying the one to the projecting part of the humerus
						at the bend of the arm for the purpose of pushing it back, and applying
						the other below to the sharp extremity of the elbow, to make counter-pressure,
						and incline the parts into the straight line. And one may use with
						advantage in this form of dislocation the method of extension formerly
						described, for the application of the bandages in the case of fracture
						of the arm; but when extension is made, the parts are to be adjusted,
						as has been also described above.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="43">
					<head>Part 43</head>
					<p>
						But if the arm be dislocated backward (but this very rarely happens,
						and it is the most painful of all, and the most subject to bilious
						fevers of the continual type, which prove fatal in the course of a
						few days), in such a case the patient cannot extend the arm. If you
						are quickly present, by forcible extension the parts may return to
						their place of their own accord; but if fever have previously come
						on, you must no longer attempt reduction, for the pain will be rendered
						more intense by any such violent attempt. In a word, no joint whatever
						should be reduced during the prevalence of fever, and least of all
						the elbow-joint.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="44">
					<head>Part 44</head>
					<p>
						There are also other troublesome injuries connected with<pb id="p.207"/> the elbow-joint;
						for example, the thicker bone (<hi rend="ital">radius?</hi>) is sometime partially displaced
						from the other, and the patient can neither perform extension nor
						flexion properly. This accident becomes obvious upon examination with
						the hand at the bend of the arm near the division of the vein that
						runs up the muscle. In such a case it is not easy to reduce the parts
						to their natural state, nor is it easy, in the separation of any two
						bones united by symphysis, to restore them to their natural state,
						for there will necessarily be a swelling at the seat of the diastasis.
						The method of bandaging a joint has been already described in treating
						of the application of bandages to the ankle. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="45">
					<head>Part 45</head>
					<p>
						In certain cases the process of the ulna (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) behind the humerus
						is broken; sometimes its cartilaginous part, which gives origin to
						the posterior tendon of the arm, and sometimes its fore part, at the
						base of the anterior coronoid process; and when this displacement
						takes place, it is apt to be attended with malignant fever. The joint,
						however, remains in place, for its whole base protrudes at that point.
						But when the displacement takes place where its head overtops the
						arm, the joint becomes looser if the bone be fairly broken across.
						To speak in general terms, all cases of fractured bones are less dangerous
						than those in which the bones are not broken, but the veins and important
						nerves (<hi rend="ital">tendons?</hi>) situated in these places are contused; for the risk
						of death is more immediate in the latter class of cases than in the
						former, if continual fever come on. But fractures of this nature seldom
						occur.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="46">
					<head>Part 46</head>
					<p>
						It sometimes happens that the head of the humerus is fractured at
						its epiphysis; and this, although it may appear to be a much more

						injuries at the joint.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="47">
					<head>Part 47</head>
					<p>
						The treatment especially befitting each particular dislocation has
						been described; and it has been laid down as a rule, that immediate
						reduction is of the utmost advantage, owing to the rapid manner in
						which inflammation of the tendons supervenes. For even when the luxated
						parts are immediately reduced, the tendons usually become stiffened,
						and for a considerable time prevent extension and flexion from being
						performed <pb id="p.208"/>to the ordinary extent. All these cases are to be treated in a similar way,
						whether the extremity of the articulating bone be snapped off, whether
						the bones be separated, or whether they be dislocated; for they are
						all to be treated with plenty of bandages, compresses, and cerate,
						like other fractures. The position of the joint in all these cases
						should be the same, as when a fractured arm or fore-arm has been bound
						up. For this is the most common position in all dislocations, displacements,
						and fractures; and it is the most convenient for the subsequent movements,
						whether of extension or flexion, as being the intermediate stage between
						both. And this is the position in which the patient can most conveniently
						carry or suspend his arm in a sling. And besides, if the joint is
						to be stiffened by callus, it were better that this should not take
						place when the arm is extended, for this position will be a great
						impediment and little advantage; if the arm be wholly bent, it will
						be more useful; but it will be much more convenient to have the joint
						in the intermediate position when it becomes ankylosed. So much with
						regard to position.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="48">
					<head>Part 48</head>
					<p>
						In bandaging, the head of the first bandage should be placed at the
						seat of the injury, whether it be a case of fracture, of dislocation,
						or of diastasis (<hi rend="ital">separation?</hi>), and the first turns should be made
						there, and the bandages should be applied most firmly at that place,
						and less so on either side. The bandaging should comprehend both the
						arm and the fore-arm, and on both should be to a much greater extent
						than most physicians apply it, so that the swelling may be expelled
						from the seat of the injury to either side. And point of the fore-arm
						should be comprehended in the bandaging, whether the injury be in
						that place or not, in order that the swelling may not collect there.
						In applying bandages, we must avoid as much as possible accumulating
						many turns of the bandage at the bend of the arm. For the principal
						compression should be at the seat of the injury, and the same rules
						are to be observed, and at the same periods, with regard to compression
						and relaxation, as formerly described respecting the treatment of
						broken bones; and the bandages should be renewed every third day;
						and they should appear<pb id="p.209"/> loose on the third day, as in the other case.
						And splints should be applied at the proper time (for there is nothing
						unsuitable in them, whether the bones be fractured or not, provided
						there is no fever); they should be particularly loose, whether applied
						to the arm or the forearm, but they must not be thick. It is necessary
						that they should be of unequal size, and that the one should ride
						over the other, whenever from the flexion it is judged proper. And
						the application of the compresses should be regulated in the same
						manner as has been stated with regard to the splints; and they should
						be put on in a somewhat more bulky form at the seat of the injury.
						The periods are to be estimated from the inflammation, and from what
						has been written on them above.</p></div2></div1>

						I am acquainted with one form in which the shoulder-joint is dislocated,
						namely, that into the armpit; I have never seen it take place upward
						nor outward; and yet I do not positively affirm whether it might be
						dislocated in these directions or not, although I have something which
						I might say on this subject. But neither have I ever seen what I considered
						to be a dislocation forward. Physicians, indeed, fancy that dislocation
						is very apt to occur forward, and they are more particularly deceived
						in those persons who have the fleshy parts about the joint and arm
						much emaciated; for, in all such cases, the head of the arm appears
						to protrude forward. And I in one case of this kind having said that
						there was no dislocation, exposed myself to censure from certain physicians
						and common people on that account, for they fancied that I alone was
						ignorant of what everybody else was acquainted with, and I could not
						convince them but with difficulty, that the matter was so. But if
						one will strip the point of the shoulder of the fleshy parts, and
						where the muscle (<hi rend="ital">deltoid?</hi>) extends, and also lay bare the tendon
						that goes from the armpit and clavicle to the breast (<hi rend="ital">pectoral muscle?</hi>),
						the head of the humerus will appear to protrude strongly forward,
						although not dislocated, for the head of the humerus naturally inclines
						forward, but the rest of the bone is turned outward. The humerus is
						connected obliquely with the cavity of the scapula, when the arm is
						stretched along the sides; but when the whole arm is stretched forward,
						then the head of the humerus is in a line with the cavity of the humerus,
						and no longer appears to protrude forward. And with regard to the
						variety we are now treating of, I have never seen a case of dislocation
						forward; <pb id="p.211"/>and yet I do not speak decidedly respecting it, whether such
						a dislocation may take place or not. When, then, a dislocation into
						the armpit takes place, seeing it is of frequent occurrence, many
						persons know how to reduce it, for it is an easy thing to teach all
						the methods by which physicians effect the reductions, and the best
						manner of applying them. The strongest of those methods should be
						used when the difficulty of reduction is particularly great. The strongest
						is the method to be last described.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="2">
					<head>Part 2</head>
					<p>
						Those who are subject to frequent dislocations at the shoulder-joint,
						are for the most part competent to effect the reduction themselves;
						for, having introduced the knuckles of the other hand into the armpit,
						they force the joint upward, and bring the elbow toward the breast.
						The physician might reduce it in the same manner, if having introduced
						his fingers into the armpit on the inside of the dislocated joint,
						he would force it from the ribs, pushing his own head against the
						acromion, in order to make counter-pressure, and with his knees applied
						to the patient's elbow pushing the arm to the sides. It will be of
						advantage if the operator has strong hands, or the physician may do
						as directed with his head and hands, while another person brings the
						elbow toward the breast. Reduction of the shoulder may also be effected
						by carrying the fore-arm backward to the spine, and then with the
						one hand grasping it at the elbow, to bend the arm upward, and with
						the other to support it behind at the articulation. This mode of reduction,
						and the one formerly described, are not natural, and yet by rotating
						the bone of the joint, they force it to return.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>Part 3</head>
					<p>
						Those who attempt to perform reduction with the heel, operate in a
						manner which is an approach to the natural. The patient must lie on
						the ground upon his back, while the person who is to effect the reduction
						is seated on the ground upon the side of the dislocation; then the
						operator, seizing with his hand the affected arm, is to pull it, while
						with his heel in the armpit he pushes in the contrary direction, the
						right heel being placed in the right armpit, and the left heel in
						the left armpit. But a round ball of a suitable size must be placed
						in the hollow of the armpit; the most convenient are very small and
						hard balls, formed from <pb id="p.212"/>several pieces of leather sewed together.
						For without something of the kind the heel cannot reach to the head
						of the humerus, since, when the arm is stretched, the armpit becomes
						hollow, the tendons on both sides of the armpit making counter-contraction
						so as to oppose the reduction. But another person should be seated
						on the other side of the patient to hold the sound shoulder, so that
						the body may not be dragged along when the arm of the affected side
						is pulled; and then, when the ball is placed in the armpit, a supple
						piece of thong sufficiently broad is to be placed round it, and some
						person taking hold of its two ends is to seat himself above the patient's
						head to made counter-extension, while at the same time he pushes with
						his foot against the bone at the top of the shoulder. The ball should
						be placed as much on the inside as possible, upon the ribs, and not
						upon the head of the humerus.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="4">
					<head>Part 4</head>
					<p>
						There is another method of reduction performed by the shoulder of
						a person standing. The person operating in this way, who should be
						taller than the patient, is to take hold of his arm and place the
						sharp point of his own shoulder in the patient's armpit, and push
						it in so that it may lodge there, and having for his object that the
						patient may be suspended at his back by the armpit, he must raise
						himself higher on this shoulder than the other; and he must bring
						the arm of the suspended patient as quickly as possible to his own
						breast. In this position he should shake the patient when he raises
						him up, in order that the rest of the body may be a counterpoise to
						the arm which is thus held. But if the patient be very light, a light
						child should be suspended behind along with him. These methods of
						reduction are all of easy application in the palestra, as they can
						all be performed without instruments, but they may also be used elsewhere.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="5">
					<head>Part 5</head>
					<p>
						Those who accomplish the reduction by forcibly bending it round a
						pestle, operate in a manner which is nearly natural. But the pestle
						should be wrapped in a soft shawl (for thus it will be less slippery),
						and it should be forced between the ribs and the head of the humerus.
						And if the pestle be short, the patient should be seated upon something,
						that his arm can with difficulty pass above the pestle. But for the
						most part the pestle<pb id="p.213"/> should be longer, so that the patient when standing
						may be almost suspended upon the piece of wood. And then the arm and
						forearm should be stretched along the pestle, whilst some person secures
						the opposite side of the body by throwing his arms round the neck,
						near the clavicle.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>Part 6</head>
					<p>
						But the method with a ladder is another of the same kind, and still
						better, since by it the body can be more safely counterpoised on this
						side; and that, while in the method which the piece of wood resembling
						a pestle, there is danger of the body tumbling to either side. But
						some round thing should be tied upon the step of the ladder which
						may be fitted to the armpit, whereby the head of the bone may be forced
						into its natural place.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>Part 7</head>
					<p>
						The following, however, is the strongest of all the methods of reduction.
						We must get a piece of wood, five, or at least four inches broad,
						two inches in thickness, or still thinner, and two cubits in length,
						or a little less; and its extremity at one end should be rounded,
						and made very narrow and very slender there, and it should have a
						slightly projecting edge (<hi rend="ital">ambe</hi>) on its round extremity, not on the
						part that is to be applied to the side, but to the head of the humerus,
						so that it may be adjusted in the armpit at the sides under the head
						of the humerus; and a piece of soft shawl or cloth should be glued
						to the end of the piece of wood, so as to give the less pain upon
						pressure. Then having pushed the head of this piece of wood as far
						inward as possible between the ribs and the head of the humerus, the
						whole arm is to be stretched along this piece of wood, and is to be
						bound round at the arm, the fore-arm, and the wrist, so that it may
						be particularly well secured; but great pains should be taken that
						the extremity of this piece of wood should be introduced as far as
						possible into the armpit, and that it is carried past the head of
						the humerus. Then a cross-beam is to be securely fastened between
						two pillars, and afterward the arm with the piece of wood attached
						to it is to be brought over this cross-beam, so that the arm may be
						on the one side of it and the body on the other, and the cross-beam
						in the armpit; and then the arm with the piece of wood is to be forced
						down on the one side of the cross-beam, and the rest of the body on
						the other. The cross-beam is to be bound so high that the <pb id="p.214"/>rest of
						the body may be raised upon tip-toes. This is by far the most powerful
						method of effecting reduction of the shoulder; for one thus operates
						with the lever upon the most correct principles, provided only the
						piece of wood be placed as much as possible within the head of the
						humerus, and thus also the counter-balancing weights will be most
						properly adjusted, and safely applied to the bone of the arm. Wherefore
						recent cases in this way may be reduced more quickly than could be
						believed, before even extension would appear to be applied; and this
						is the only mode of reduction capable of replacing old dislocations,
						and this it will effect, unless flesh has already filled up the (glenoid)
						cavity, and the head of the humerus has formed a socket for itself
						in the place to which it has been displaced; and even in such an old
						case of dislocation, it appears to me that we could effect reduction
						(for what object would a lever power properly applied not it move?),
						but it would not remain in its place, but would be again displaced
						as formerly. The same thing may be effected by means of the ladder,
						by preparing it in the same manner. If the dislocation be recent,
						a large Thessalian chair may be sufficient to accomplish this purpose;
						the wood, however, should be dressed up as described before; but the
						patient should be seated sideways on the chair, and then the arm,
						with the piece of wood attached to it, is to be brought over the back
						of the chair, and force is to be applied to the arm, with the wood
						on the one side, and the body on the other side. The same means may
						be applied with a double door. One should always use what happens
						to be at hand.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>Part 8</head>
					<p>
						Wherefore it should be known that one constitution differs much from
						another as to the facility with which dislocations in them may be
						reduced, and one articular cavity differs much from another, the one
						being so constructed that the bone readily leaps out and another less
						so; but the greatest difference regards the binding together of the
						parts by the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) which are slack in some and tight
						in others. For the humidity in the joints of men is connected with
						the state of the ligaments, when they are slack and yielding; for
						you may see many people who are so humid (<hi rend="ital">flabby?</hi>) that when they
						choose they can disarticulate their joints without pain, and reduce
						them in like manner. The<pb id="p.215"/> habit of the body also occasions a certain
						difference, for in those who are in a state of embonpoint and fleshy
						the joint is rarely dislocated, but is more difficult to reduce; but
						when they are more attenuated and leaner than usual, then they are
						subject to dislocations which are more easily reduced. And the following
						observation is a proof that matters are so; for in cattle the thighs
						are most apt to be dislocated at the hip-joint, when they are most
						particularly lean, which they are at the end of winter, at which time
						then they are particularly subject to dislocations (if I may be allowed
						to make such an observation while treating of a medical subject);
						and therefore Homer has well remarked, that of all beasts oxen suffer
						the most at that season, and especially those employed at the plow
						as being worked in the winter season. In them, therefore, dislocations
						happen most frequently, as being at that time most particularly reduced
						in flesh. And other cattle can crop the grass when it is short, but
						the ox cannot do so until it becomes long; for, in the others, the
						projection of the lip is slender, and so is the upper lip, but in
						the ox the projection of the lip is thick, and the upper jaw is thick
						and obtuse, and therefore they are incapable of seizing short herbs.
						But the <hi rend="ital">solidungula</hi> as having prominent teeth in both their front
						jaws, can crop the grass and grasp it with their teeth while short,
						and delight more in short grass than in rank; for, in general, short
						grass is better and more substantial than rank, as having not yet
						given out its fructification. Wherefore the poet has the following
						line: 
						
						"As when to horned cattle dear the vernal season comes,"<note>It is certain that there is no such line in the works of Homer as they have come down to us, and it is singular that Galen takes no notice of it, so that it is impossible to explain how our author came to use it.</note>
						
						because rank grass appears to be most sought after by them. But otherwise in the ox, this joint is slacker than in other animals, and, therefore, this
						animal drags his foot in walking more than any other, and especially
						when lank and old. For all these reasons the ox is most particularly
						subject to dislocations; and I have made the more observations respecting
						him, as they confirm <pb id="p.216"/>all that was said before on this subject. With
						regard, then, to the matter on hand, I say that dislocations occur
						more readily, and are more speedily reduced in those who are lean
						than in those who are fleshy; and in those who are humid and lank
						there is less inflammation than in such as are dry and fleshy, and
						they are less compactly knit hereafter, and there is more mucosity
						than usual in cases not attended with inflammation, and hence the
						joints are more liable to luxations; for, in the main, the articulations
						are more subject to mucosities in those who are lean than in those
						who are fleshy; and the flesh of lean persons who have not been reduced
						by a proper course of discipline abounds more with mucosity than that
						of fat persons. But in those cases in which the mucosity is accompanied
						with inflammation, the inflammation binds (<hi rend="ital">braces?</hi>) the joint, and
						hence those who have small collections of mucosities are not very
						subject to dislocations, which they would be if the mucosity had not
						been accompanied with more or less inflammation.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="9">
					<head>Part 9</head>
					<p>
						In cases of dislocation those persons who are not attacked with inflammation
						of the surrounding parts, can use the shoulder immediately without
						pain, and do not think it necessary to take any precautions with themselves;
						it is therefore the business of the physician to warn them beforehand
						that dislocation is more likely to return in such cases than when
						the tendons have been inflamed. This remark applies to all the articulations,
						but particularly to those of the shoulder and knee, for these are
						the joints most subject to luxations. But those who have inflammation
						of the ligaments cannot use the shoulder, for the pain and the tension
						induced by the inflammation prevent them. Such cases are to be treated
						with cerate, compresses, and plenty of bandages; but a ball of soft
						clean wool is to be introduced into the armpit, to fill up the hollow
						of it, that it may be a support to the bandaging, and maintain the
						joint <hi rend="ital">in situ</hi>. The arm, in general, should be inclined upward as much
						as possible, for thus it will be kept at the greatest possible distance
						from the place at which the head of the humerus escaped. And when
						you bandage the shoulder you must fasten the arms to the sides with
						a band, which is to be carried round the body. The shoulder should
						be <pb id="p.217"/>rubbed gently and softly. The physician ought to be acquainted
						with many things, and among others with friction; for from the same
						name the same results are not always obtained; for friction could
						brace a joint when unseasonably relaxed, and relax it when unseasonably
						hard; but we will define what we know respecting friction in another
						place. The shoulder, then, in such a state, should be rubbed with
						soft hands; and, moreover, in a gentle manner, and the joint should
						be moved about, but not roughly, so as to excite pain. Things get
						restored sometimes in a greater space of time, and sometimes in a
						smaller.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="10">
					<head>Part 10</head>
					<p>
						A dislocation may be recognized by the following symptoms:-Since the
						parts of a man's body are proportionate to one another, as the arms
						and the legs, the sound should always be compared with the unsound,
						and the unsound with the sound, not paying regard to the joints of
						other individuals (for one person's joints are more prominent than
						another's), but looking to those of the patient, to ascertain whether
						the sound joint be unlike the unsound. This is a proper rule, and
						yet it may lead to much error; and on this account it is not sufficient
						to know this art in theory, but also by actual practice; for many
						persons from pain, or from any other cause, when their joints are
						not dislocated, cannot put the parts into the same positions as the
						sound body can be put into; one ought therefore to know and be acquainted
						beforehand with such an attitude. But in a dislocated joint the head
						of the humerus appears lying much more in the armpit than it is in
						the sound joint; and also, above, at the top of the shoulder, the
						part appears hollow, and the acromion is prominent, owing to the bone
						of the joint having sunk into the part below; there is a source of
						error in this case also, as will be described afterward, for it deserves
						to be described; and also, the elbow of the dislocated arm is farther
						removed from the ribs than that of the other; but by using force it
						may be approximated, though with considerable pain; and also they
						cannot, with the elbow extended, raise the arm to the ear, as they
						can the sound arm, nor move it about as formerly in this direction
						and that. These, then, are the symptoms of dislocation at the shoulder.
						The methods of reduction and the treatment are as described.<pb id="p.218"/>
					</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="11">
					<head>Part 11</head>
					<p>It deserves to be known how a shoulder which is subject to frequent
						dislocations should be treated. For many persons owing to this accident
						have been obliged to abandon gymnastic exercises, though otherwise
						well qualified for them; and from the same misfortune have become
						inept in warlike practices, and have thus perished. And this subject
						deserves to be noticed, because I have never known any physician treat
						the case properly; some abandon the attempt altogether, and others
						hold opinions and practice the very what is proper. For physicians
						have burned the shoulders subject to dislocation, at the top of the
						shoulder, at the anterior part where the head of the humerus protrudes,
						and a little behind the top of the shoulder; these burnings, if the
						dislocation of the arm were upward, or forward, or backward, would
						have been properly performed; but now, when the dislocation is downward,
						they rather promote than prevent dislocations, for they shut out the
						head of the humerus from the free space above. The cautery should
						be applied thus: taking hold with the hands of the skin at the armpit,
						it is to be drawn into the line, in which the head of the humerus
						is dislocated; and then the skin thus drawn aside is to be burnt to
						the opposite side. The burnings should be performed with irons, which
						are not thick nor much rounded, but of an oblong form (for thus they
						pass the more readily through), and they are to be pushed forward
						with the hand; the cauteries should be red-hot, that they may pass
						through as quickly as possible; for such as are thick pass through
						slowly, and occasion eschars of a greater breadth than convenient,
						and there is danger that the cicatrices may break into one another;
						which, although nothing very bad, is most unseemly, or awkward. When
						you have burnt through, it will be sufficient, in most cases, to make
						eschars only in the lower part; but if there is no danger of the ulcers
						passing into one another, and there is a considerable piece of skin
						between them, a thin spatula is to be pushed through these holes which
						have been burned, while, at the same time, the skin is stretched,
						for otherwise the instrument could not pass through; but when you
						have passed it through you must let go the skin, and then between
						the two eschars you should form another eschar with a <pb id="p.219"/>slender iron,
						and burn through until you come in contact with the spatula. The following
						directions enable you to determine how much of the skin of the armpit
						should be grasped; all men have glands in the armpit greater or smaller,
						and also in many other parts of the body. But I will treat in another
						work of the whole constitution of the glands, and explain what they
						are, what they signify, and what are their offices. The glands, then,
						are not to be taken hold of, nor the parts internal to the glands;
						for this would be attended with great danger, as they are adjacent
						to the most important nerves. But the greater part of the substances
						external to the glands are to be grasped, for there is no danger from
						them. And this, also, it is proper to know, that if you raise the
						arm much, you will not be able to grasp any quantity of skin worth
						mentioning, for it is all taken up with the stretching; and also the
						nerves, which by all means you must avoid wounding, become exposed
						and stretched in this position; but if you only raise the arm a little,
						you can grasp a large quantity of skin, and the nerves which you ought
						to guard against are left within, and at a distance from the operation.
						Should not, then, the utmost pains be taken in the whole practice
						of the art to find out the proper attitude in every case? So much
						regarding the armpit, and these contractions will be sufficient, provided
						the eschars be properly placed. Without the armpit there are only
						two places where one might place the eschars to obviate this affection;
						the one before and between the head of the humerus and the tendon
						at the armpit; and then the skin may be fairly burned through, but
						not to any great depth, for there is a large vein adjacent, and also
						nerves, neither of which must be touched with the heat. But externally,
						one may form another eschar considerably above the tendon at the armpit,
						but a little below the head of the humerus; and the skin must be burned
						fairly through, but it must not be made very deep, for fire is inimical
						to the nerves. Through the whole treatment the sores are to be so
						treated, as to avoid all strong extension of the arm, and this is
						to be done moderately, and only as far as the dressing requires; for
						thus they will be less cooled (for it is of importance to cover up
						all sorts of burns if one would treat them mildly), and then the<pb id="p.220"/> lips
						of them will be less turned aside; there will be less hemorrhage and
						fear of convulsions. But when the sores have become clean, and are
						going on to cicatrization, then by all means the arm is to be bound
						to the side night and day; and even when the ulcers are completely
						healed, the arm must still be bound to the side for a long time; for
						thus more especially will cicatrization take place, and the wide space
						into which the humerus used to escape will become contracted. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="12">
					<head>Part 12</head>
					<p>
						When attempts to reduce a dislocated shoulder have failed, if the
						patient be still growing, the bone of the affected arm will not increase
						like the sound one, for although it does increase in so far it becomes
						shorter than the other; and those persons called <hi rend="ital">weasel-armed</hi>, become
						so from two accidents, either from having met with this dislocation
						<hi rend="ital">in utero</hi>, or from another accident, which will be described afterward.
						But those who while they were children have had deep-seated suppurations
						about the head of the bone, all become weasel-armed; and this, it
						should be well known, will be the issue, whether the abscess be opened
						by an incision or cautery, or whether it break spontaneously. Those
						who are thus affected from birth are quite able to use the arm yet
						neither can they raise the arm to the ear, by extending the elbow,
						but they do this much less efficiently than with the sound arm. But
						in those who have had the shoulder dislocated after they were grown
						up, and when it has not been reduced, the top of the shoulder becomes
						much less fleshy, and the habit of body at that part is attenuated;
						but when they cease to have pain, whatever they attempt to perform
						by raising the elbow from the sides obliquely, they can no longer
						accomplish as formerly; but whatever acts are performed by carrying
						the arm around by the sides, either backward or forward, all those
						they can perform; for they can work with an auger or a saw, or with
						a hatchet, and can dig, by not raising the elbow too much, and do
						all other kinds of work which are done in similar attitudes. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="13">
					<head>Part 13</head>
					<p>
						In those cases where the acromion has been torn off, the bone which
						is thus separated appears prominent. The bone is the bond of connection
						between the clavicle and scapula, for in this respect the constitution
						of man is different from that of<pb id="p.221"/> other animals; physicians are particularly
						liable to be deceived in this accident (for as the separated bone
						protrudes, the top of the shoulder appears low and hollow), so that
						they make preparations as if for dislocation of the shoulder; for
						I have known many physicians, otherwise not inexpert at the art, who
						have done much mischief by attempting to reduce such shoulders, thus
						supposing it a case of dislocation; and they did not desist until
						they gave over mistake of supposing that they had reduced the shoulder.
						The treatment, in these cases, is similar to that which is applicable
						in others of a like kind, namely, cerate, compresses, and suitable
						bandaging with linen cloths. The projecting part must be pushed down,
						and the greater number of compresses are to be placed on it, and most
						compression is to be applied at that part, and the arm being fastened
						to the side is to be kept elevated; for thus the parts which had been
						torn asunder are brought into closest proximity with one another.
						All this should be well known, and if you choose you may prognosticate
						safely that no impediment, small or great, will result from such an
						injury at the shoulder, only there will be a deformity in the place,
						for the bone cannot be properly restored to its natural situation,
						but there must necessarily be more or less tumefaction in the upper
						part. For neither can any other bone be made exactly as it was, which
						having become incorporated with another bone, and having grown to
						it as an apophysis, has been torn from its natural situation. If properly
						bandaged, the acromion becomes free of pain in a few days. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="14">
					<head>Part 14</head>
					<p>
						When a fractured clavicle is fairly broken across it is more easily
						treated, but when broken obliquely it is more difficult to manage.
						Matters are different in these cases from what one would have supposed;
						for a bone fairly broken across can be more easily restored to its
						natural state, and with proper care the upper part may be brought
						down by means of suitable position and proper bandaging, and even
						if not properly set, the projecting part of the bone is not very sharp.
						But in oblique fractures the case is similar to that of bones which
						have been torn away, as formerly described; for they do not admit
						of being<pb id="p.222"/> restored to their place, and the prominence of the bone is
						very sharp. For the most part, then, it should be known, no harm results
						to the shoulder or to the rest of the body from fracture of the clavicle,
						unless it sphacelate, and this rarely happens. A deformity, however,
						may arise from fracture of the clavicle, and in these cases it is
						very great at first, but by and by it becomes less. A fractured clavicle,
						like all other spongy bones, gets speedily united; for all such bones
						form callus in a short time. When, then, a fracture has recently taken
						place, the patients attach much importance to it, as supposing the
						mischief greater than it really is, and the physicians bestow great
						pains in order that it may be properly bandaged; but in a little time
						the patients, having no pain, nor finding any impediment to their
						walking or eating, become negligent; and the physicians finding they
						cannot make the parts look well, take themselves off, and are not
						sorry at the neglect of the patients, and in the meantime the callus
						is quickly formed.<note>See the Plate at the end of the volume.</note> The method of dressing which is most appropriate,
						is similar to that used in ordinary cases, consisting of cerate, compresses,
						and bandages; and it should be most especially known in this operation,
						that most compresses should be placed on the projecting bone, and
						that the greatest pressure should be made there. There are certain
						physicians who make a show of superior skill by binding a heavy piece
						of lead on the part in order to depress the projecting bone; but this
						mode of treatment does not apply to the clavicle, for it is impossible
						to depress the projecting part to any extent worth mentioning. There
						are others who, knowing the fact that the bandages are apt to slip
						off, and that they do not keep the projecting parts in their place,
						apply compresses and bandages like the others, and then having girt
						the patient with a girdle, where it is usually applied with most effect,
						they make a heap of the compresses upon the
						projecting bone when they apply them, and having fastened the head
						of the bandage to the girdle in front, they apply it so as to bring
						the turns of it into the line of the clavicle, carrying them to the
						back, and then bringing them around the girdle they <pb id="p.223"/>carry them to
						the fore part and again backward. There are others who do not apply
						the bandage round the girdle, but carry the rounds of it by the perineum
						and anus, and along the spine, so as to compress the fracture. To
						an inexperienced person these methods will appear not far from natural,
						but when tied, they will be found of no service; for they do not remain
						firm any length of time, even if the patient keep his bed, although
						in this position they answer best; and yet even when lying in bed,
						should he bend his leg, or should his trunk be bent, all the will
						be displaced; and, moreover, the bandaging is inconvenient, in as
						much as the anus is comprehended by it, and many turns of the bandage
						are crowded there in a narrow space. And in the method with the girdle,
						the girdle cannot be so firmly girt around, but that the turns of
						the bandage force the girdle to ascend, and hence of necessity all
						the other bandages must be slackened. He would seem to me to come
						nearest his purpose, although after all he effects but little, who
						would take a few turns round the girdle,
						but would use the bandage principally to secure the former bandaging;
						for in this manner the bandages would be most secure, and would mutually
						assist one another. Every thing now almost has been said which applies
						to fracture of the clavicle. But this also should be known, that in
						fractures of the clavicle, it is the part attached to the breast which
						is uppermost, and that the piece attached to the acromion is the lowermost.
						The cause of this is, that for the most part the breast can neither
						be depressed nor raised, there being but a slight movement of the
						joint at the breast, for the sternum is connected together on both
						sides with the spine. The clavicle admits of most motion at the joint
						of the shoulder, and this arises from its connection with the acromion.
						And, moreover, when broken, the part which is connected with the sternum
						flies upward, and is not easily forced downward; for it is naturally
						light, and there is more room for it above than below. But the shoulder,
						the arm, and the parts connected with them, are easily moved from
						the sides and breast, and, on that account, they admit of being considerably
						elevated and depressed. When, therefore, the clavicle is broken, the
						fragment attached to the shoulder inclines downward, for it inclines
						much more readily <pb id="p.224"/>with the shoulder and arm downward than upward.
						Matters being as I have stated, they act imprudently who think to
						depress the projecting end of the bone. But it is clear that the under
						part ought to be brought to the upper, for the former is the movable
						part, and that which has been displaced from its natural position.
						It is obvious, therefore, that there is no other way of applying force
						to it (for the bandages no more force it to than they force it from);
						but if one will push the arm when at the sides as much as possible
						upward, so that the shoulder may appear as sharp as possible, it is
						clear that in this way it will be adjusted to the fragment of the
						bone connected with the breast from which it was torn. If one then
						will apply a bandage, <hi rend="ital">secundum artem</hi>, for the purpose of promoting
						a speedy cure, and will reckon everything else of no value, except
						the position as described, he will form a correct opinion of the case,
						and will effect a cure in the speediest and most appropriate manner.
						It is of great importance, however, that the patient should lie in
						a recumbent posture. Fourteen days will be sufficient if he keep quiet,
						and twenty at most. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="15">
					<head>Part 15</head>
					<p>
						But if the clavicle be fractured in the opposite manner (which does
						not readily happen), so that the fragment of bone connected with the

						raised up and rides over other, this case does not require much management,

						If the fracture be not thus, but if it incline either forward or backward,
						it may be restored to its natural position, by raising the shoulder
						with the arm as formerly described, and brought back to its natural
						place, when the cure will be speedily accomplished. Most of the varieties
						of displacement may be rectified by raising the arm upward. When the
						upper bone is displaced laterally or downward, it would favor the
						adaptation of the parts if the patient would lie on his back, and
						if some elevated substance were placed between the shoulder-blades,
						so that the breast may be depressed as much as possible upon the two
						sides; and if, while<pb id="p.225"/> another person raised the arm extended along
						the sides, the physician, applying the palm of the one hand to the
						head of the bone, would push it away, and with the other would adjust
						the broken bones, he would thus reduce the parts most readily to their
						natural position. But, as formerly stated, the upper bone (<hi rend="ital">sternal
							fragment?</hi>) is rarely depressed downward. In most cases, after the
						bandages have been applied, that position is beneficial in which the
						elbow is fixed to the same side, and the shoulder is kept elevated;
						but in certain cases, the shoulder is to be raised, as has been directed,
						and the elbow is to be brought forward to the breast, and the hand
						laid on the acromion of the sound side. If the patient has the resolution
						to lie in bed, something should be placed so as to support the shoulder,
						and keep it as much elevated as possible. But if he walk about, the
						arm should be slung in a shawl, which embraces the point of the elbow,
						and is passed round the neck. </p></div2>

						When the elbow-joint is displaced or dislocated to the side or outward,
						while its sharp point (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) remains in the cavity of the humerus,
						extension is to be made in a straight line, and the projecting part
						is to be pushed backward and to the side. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="18">
					<head>Part 18</head>
					<p>
						In complete dislocations toward either side, extension is to be made
						as in bandaging fracture of the arm; for thus the rounded part of
						the elbow will not form an obstacle to it. Dislocation, for the most
						part, takes place toward the sides (<hi rend="ital">inwardly?</hi>). Reduction is to be
						effected by separating (the bones) as much as possible, so that the
						end (of the humerus) may not come in contact with the olecranon, and
						it is to be carried up, and turned round, and not forced in a straight
						line, and, at the same time, the opposite sides are to be pushed together,
						and propelled into their proper place. It will further assist if rotation
						of the fore-arm be made at the elbow, sometimes turning it into a
						supine position, and sometimes into a prone. The position for the
						treatment consists in keeping the hand a little higher than the elbow,
						and the arm at the sides; then it may either be suspended or laid
						at rest, for either position will answer; and nature and the usage
						of common means will accomplish the cure, if the callus does not form
						improperly: it is formed quickly. The treatment<pb id="p.226"/> is to be conducted
						with bandages according to the rule for bandaging articulations, and
						the point of the elbow is to be included in the bandage. </p></div2>

						Dislocations at the elbow give rise to the most serious consequences,
						such as fevers, pain, nausea, vomitings of pure bile, and more especially
						when the humerus is displaced backward from pressure on the nerve,
						which occasions numbness; next to it is the dislocation forward; the
						treatment is the same; reduction in dislocation backward is by extension
						and adaptation; the symptom of this variety-loss of the power of extension;
						of dislocation forward-loss of the power of flexion, and in this case
						reduction is to be accomplished by placing a hard ball (in the bend
						of the elbow), and bending the fore-arm about it, along with sudden
						extension. </p></div2>

						In those cases callus is quickly formed. In congenital dislocations
						the bones below the seat of the injury are shorter than natural, and,
						mostly, those nearest to the place; namely, the bones of the fore-arm,
						next those of the hand; and, third, those of the fingers. The arm
						and shoulder are stronger, owing to the nourishment which they receive,
						and the other arm, from the additional work which it has to perform,
						is still more strong. Wasting of the flesh takes place on the inside
						if the dislocation be on the outside; or otherwise, on the side opposite
						the dislocation. </p></div2>

						When the elbow is dislocated either inward or outward, extension is
						to be made with the fore-arm at a right angle to the arm; the arm,
						suspended by means of a shawl passed through the armpit, and a weight
						attached to the extremity of the elbow; or force may be applied with
						the hands; when the articular extremity has been cleared, the displaced
						parts are to be rectified with the palms of the hand, as in dislocations
						of the hands. It is to be bandaged, suspended in a sling, and placed
						while in this attitude. </p></div2>

						Dislocations backward are to be rectified by the palms of the hands,

						is to be bent around a ball of cloth of proper size, and at the same

						But if the displacement be on the other side, both these operations

						The joint of the hand is dislocated either inward or outward, most
						frequently inward. The symptoms are easily recognized: if inward,
						the patient cannot at all bend his fingers; and if outward, he cannot
						extend them. With regard to the reduction,-by placing the fingers
						above a table, extension and counter-extension are to be made by other
						persons, while with the palm or heel of the hand on the projecting
						bone one pushes forward, and another from behind on the other bone;
						some soft substance is to be applied to it, and the arm is to be turned
						to the prone position if the dislocation was forward, but to the supine,
						if backward. The treatment is to be conducted with bandages. </p></div2>

						The whole hand is dislocated either inward or outward, or to this
						side or that, but more especially inward; and sometimes the epiphysis
						is displaced, and sometimes the other of these bones is separated.
						In these cases strong extension is to be applied, and pressure is
						to be made on the projecting bone, and counter-pressure on the opposite
						side, both at the same time, behind and at the side, with the hands
						upon a table, or with the heel. These accidents give rise to serious
						consequences and deformities; but in the course of time the part gets
						strong, and admits of being used. The cure is with bandages, which
						ought to embrace both the hand and fore-arm; and splints are to be
						applied as far as the fingers; and when they are used they should
						be more frequently unloosed than infractures, and more copious affusions
						of water should be used. </p></div2>

						In congenital dislocations (at the wrist) the hand becomes <pb id="p.228"/>shortened,

						Dislocation at the joint of a finger is easily recognized. Reduction
						is to be effected by making extension in a straight line, and applying

						side of the other. The treatment is with bandages. When not reduced,
						callus is formed outside of the joint. When the dislocation takes
						place at birth, during adolescence the bones below the dislocation

						The jaw-bone, in few cases, is completely dislocated, for the zygomatic
						process formed from the upper jaw-bone (<hi rend="ital">malar?</hi>) and the bone behind
						the ear (<hi rend="ital">temporal?</hi>) shuts up the heads of the under jaw, being above
						the one (<hi rend="ital">condyloid process?</hi>), and below the other (<hi rend="ital">coronoid process?</hi>).
						Of these extremities of the lower jaw, the one, from its length, is
						not much exposed to accidents, while the other, the coronoid, is more
						prominent than the zygoma, and from both these heads nervous tendons
						arise, with which the muscles called temporal and masseter are connected;
						they have got these names from their actions and connections; for
						in eating, speaking, and the other functional uses of the mouth, the
						upper jaw is at rest, as being connected with the head by synarthrosis,
						and not by diarthrosis (<hi rend="ital">enarthrosis?</hi>): but the lower jaw has motion,
						for it is connected with the upper jaw and the head by enarthrosis.
						Wherefore, in convulsions and tetanus, the first symptom manifested
						is rigidity of the lower jaw; and the reason why wounds in the temporal
						region are fatal and induce coma, will be stated in another place.
						These are the reasons why complete dislocation does not readily take
						place, and this is another reason, because there is seldom a necessity
						for swallowing so large pieces of food as would make a man gape more
						than he easily can, and dislocation could not take place in any other
						position than in great gaping, by which the jaw is displaced to either
						side. This circumstance, however, contributes <pb id="p.229"/>to dislocation there;
						of nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) and muscles around joints, or connected with
						joints, such as are frequently moved in using the member are the most
						yielding to extension, in the same manner as well-dressed hides yield
						the most. With regard, then, to the matter on hand, the jaw-bone is
						rarely dislocated, but is frequently slackened (<hi rend="ital">partially displaced?</hi>)
						in gaping, in the same manner as many other derangements of muscles
						and tendons arise. Dislocation is particularly recognized by these
						symptoms: the lower jaw protrudes forward, there is displacement to
						the opposite side, the coronoid process appears more prominent than
						natural on the upper jaw, and the patient cannot shut his lower jaw
						but with difficulty. The mode of reduction which will apply in such
						cases is obvious: one person must secure the patient's head, and another,
						taking hold of the lower jaw with his fingers within and without at
						the chin, while the patient gapes as much as he can, first moves the
						lower jaw about for a time, pushing it to this side and that with
						the hand, and directing the patient himself to relax the jaw, to move
						it about, and yield as much as possible; then all of a sudden the
						operator must open the mouth, while he attends at the same time to
						three positions: for the lower jaw is to be moved from the place to
						which it is dislocated to its natural position; it is to be pushed
						backward, and along with these the jaws are to be brought together
						and kept shut. This is the method of reduction, and it cannot be performed
						in any other way. A short treatment suffices, a waxed compress is
						to be laid on, and bound with a loose bandage. It is safer to operate
						with the patient laid on his back, and his head supported on a leather
						cushion well filled, so that it may yield as little as possible, but
						some person must hold the patient's head.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="31">
					<head>Part 31</head>
					<p>
						When the jaw is dislocated on both sides, the treatment is the same.
						The patients are less able to shut the mouth than in the former variety;
						and the jaw protrudes farther in this case, but is not distorted;
						the absence of distortion may be recognized by comparing the corresponding
						rows of the teeth in the upper and lower jaws. In such cases reduction
						should be performed as quickly as possible; the method of reduction
						has been described<pb id="p.230"/> above. If not reduced, the patient's life will
						be in danger from continual fevers, coma attended with stupor (for
						these muscles, when disordered and stretched preternaturally, induce
						coma); and there is usually diarrhea attended with billous, unmixed,
						and scanty dejections; and the vomitings, if any, consist of pure
						bile, and the patients commonly die on the tenth day. </p></div2>

						In fracture of the lower jaw, when the bone is not fairly broken across,
						and is still partially retained, but displaced, it should be adjusted
						by introducing the fingers at the side of the tongue, and making suitable
						counter-pressure on the outside; and if the teeth at the wound be
						distorted and loosened, when the bone is adjusted, they should be
						connected together, not only two, but more of them, with a gold thread,
						if possible, but otherwise, with a linen thread, until the bone be
						consolidated, and then the part is to be dressed with cerate, a few
						compresses, and a few bandages, which should not be very tight, but
						rather loose. For it should be well known that in fracture of the
						jaw, dressing with bandages, if properly performed, is of little advantage,
						but occasions great mischief if improperly done. Frequent examinations
						should be made about the tongue, and prolonged pressure should be
						applied with the fingers, in order to rectify the displaced bone.
						It would be best if one could do so constantly, but that is impossible. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="33">
					<head>Part 33</head>
					<p>
						But if the bone be fairly broken across (this, however, rarely happens),
						it is to be set in the manner now described. When adjusted, the teeth
						are to be fastened together as formerly described, for this will contribute
						much toward keeping the parts at rest, especially if properly fastened,
						and the ends of the thread secured with knots. But it is not easy
						to describe exactly in writing the whole manipulation of the case;
						but the reader must figure the thing to himself from the description
						given. Then one must take a piece of Carthaginian leather; if the
						patient be a younger person, it will be sufficient to use the outer
						skin, but if an adult the whole thickness of the hide will be required;
						it is to be cut to the breadth of about three inches, or as much as
						will be required, and having smeared the jaw with a little gum (for
						thus it sticks more pleasantly), the end of the skin is to be<pb id="p.231"/> fastened
						with the glue near the fractured part of the jaw, at the distance
						of an inch or a little more, from the wound. This piece is to be applied
						below the jaw; but the thong should have a cut in it, in the direction
						of the chin, so that it may go over the sharp point of the chin. Another
						piece of thong like this, or somewhat broader, is to be glued to the
						upper part of the jaw, at about the same distance from the wound as
						the other thong; this thong should be so cut as to encircle the ear.
						The thongs should be sharp-pointed at the part where they unite, and
						in gluing them, the flesh of the thong should be turned to the patient's
						skin, for in this way it will be more tenacious; then we must stretch
						this thong, but still more so the one at the chin, in order to prevent
						the fragments of the jaw from riding over each other, and the thongs
						are to be fastened at the vertex, and then a bandage is to be bound
						round the forehead, and a proper apparatus is to be put over all,
						to prevent the bandages from being displaced. The patient should lie
						upon the sound side of the jaw, not resting upon the jaw, but upon
						the head. He is to be kept on a spare diet for ten days, and then
						nourished without delay. If there be no inflammation during the first
						days, the jaw is consolidated in twenty days; for callus quickly forms
						in this, as in all the other porous bones, provided there be no sphacelus
						(<hi rend="ital">exfoliation?</hi>). But much remains to be said on the sphacelus of bones
						in another place. This method of distention with glued substances
						is mild, of easy application, and is useful for many dislocations
						in many parts of the body. Those physicians who have not judgment
						combined with their dexterity, expose themselves in fractures of the
						jaws, as in other cases, for they apply a variety of bandages to a
						fractured jaw-bone, sometimes properly, and sometimes improperly.
						For all such bandaging of a fractured jawbone has a tendency rather
						to derange the bones connected with the fracture, than to bring them
						into their natural position. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="34">

					<p>
						But if the lower jaw be disjointed at its symphysis in the chin (there
						is but one symphysis in the lower jaw, but there are several in the
						upper; but I am unwilling to digress from the subject, as these matters
						will have to be touched upon in other kinds of disease)-if, then,
						the symphysis be separated at the chin, it<pb id="p.232"/> is the work which anybody
						can perform, to rectify it; for the part which protrudes is to be
						pushed inward by pressure with the fingers, and the part that inclines
						inward is to forced outward by pushing with the fingers from within.
						It is after having applied extension to separate the fragments that
						this is to be done, for they will thus be more easily restored to
						their natural position, than if one should bring them together by
						using force. This is proper to be known as applying to all such cases.
						When you have set the parts, you must fasten the teeth on both sides
						to one another, as formerly directed. The treatment is to be accomplished
						with cerate, a few compresses, and bandages. This part, in particular,
						requires a short but complex (?) bandaging, for it is nearly cylindrical,
						though not exactly so; but the turn of the bandage is to be made,
						if the right jaw was dislocated, to the right hand (that is said to
						be to the right hand when the right hand conducts the bandaging);
						but if the other jaw be the seat of the dislocation, the bandaging
						is to be made in the other direction. And if matters be properly adjusted,
						and the patient keep quiet, there will be a speedy recovery, and the
						teeth will be uninjured; but if not, the recovery will be more protracted,
						the teeth will be distorted, will give trouble, and become useless. </p></div2>

						Of fractures of the nose there are more than one variety, but those
						who, without judgment, delight in fine bandagings, do much mischief,
						most especially in injuries about the nose. For this is the most complex
						of all the forms of bandaging, having most of the turns of the bandage
						called "ascia," and rhomboidal intervals and uncovered spaces of the
						skin. As has been said, those who practice manipulation without judgment
						are fond of meeting with a case of fractured nose, that they may apply
						the bandage. For a day or two, then, the physician glories in his
						performance, and the patient who has been bandaged is well pleased,
						but speedily the patient complains of the incumbrance of the bandage,
						and the physician is satisfied, because he has had an opportunity
						of showing his skill in applying a complex bandage to the nose. Such
						a bandaging does everything the very reverse of what is proper; for,
						in the first place, those who have their nose flattened by the fracture,
						will clearly have the part rendered <pb id="p.233"/>still more flat, if pressure above
						be applied to it; and further, those cases in which the nose is distorted
						to either side, whether at the cartilage or higher up, will evidently
						derive no benefit from bandaging above it, but will rather be injured;
						for it will not admit of having compresses properly arranged on either
						side of the nose, and indeed, persons applying this bandage do not
						seek to do this.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="36">
					<head>Part 36</head>
					<p>
						This bandaging would appear to me to answer best when the skin surrounding
						the bone is contused on its ridge near the middle, or if the bone
						itself have sustained some injury, but not a great one, in such cases,
						redundant callus forms in the nose, and the part becomes a little
						too prominent; and yet, even in these cases, the bandaging need not
						require much trouble, if, indeed, any bandage be applied at all; for
						it is enough if one lay a waxed compress on the contusion, and then
						apply the double-headed bandage, thus taking one turn with it. The
						best application to such accidents is a small cataplasm of wheaten
						flour, washed, and mixed up into a viscid mass. If the flour be made
						from good wheat, and if it be glutinous, it should be used alone for
						all such cases, but if it be not very glutinous, a little of the manna
						of frankincense, well pulverized, is to be moistened with water, and
						the flour is to be mixed up with it, or a very little gum may be mixed
						in like manner. </p></div2>

						In those cases in which the fractured portions are depressed and flattened,
						if it is depressed in front at the cartilage, something may be introduced
						into the nostrils to rectify the parts. If not, all such deformities
						may be restored by introducing the fingers into the nostrils, if this
						can be managed, but if not, a thick spatula is to be introduced with
						the fingers, not to the fore part of the nose, but to the depressed
						portion, and the physician is to take hold of the nose externally
						on both sides, and at the same time raise it up. And if the fracture
						be much in the fore part one may introduce into the nostrils as already
						stated, either caddis scraped from a linen towel, or something such
						wrapped up in a piece of cloth, or rather stitched in Carthaginian
						leather, and moulded into a shape suitable to the place into which
						it is to be introduced. But if the fracture be at a greater distance,
						it is<pb id="p.234"/> not possible to introduce anything within, for if it was irksome
						to bear anything of the kind in the fore part, how is it not to be
						so when introduced farther in? At first, then, by rectifying the parts
						from within, and sparing no pains upon them from without, they are
						to be brought to their natural position, and set. A fractured nose
						may be readily restored to shape, especially on the day of the accident,
						or even a little later, but the physicians act irresolutely, and touch
						it more delicately at first than they should; for the fingers should
						be applied on both sides along the natural line of the nose, and it
						is to be pushed downward, and thus, with pressure from within, the
						displacement is to be rectified. But for these purposes no physician
						is equal to the index-fingers of the patient himself, if he will pay
						attention and has resolution, for they are the most natural means.
						Either of the fingers is to be placed firmly along the whole nose,
						and thus it is to be gently held, and steadily, if possible until
						it become firm, but if not, he himself is to hold it for as long a
						time as possible, or if he cannot, a child or woman should do it,
						for the hands ought to be soft. Thus may a fracture of the nose, attended
						with depression, and not with displacement to the side, but in a straight
						line, be most properly treated. I have never seen a case of fractured
						nose which could not be rectified when attempted, before callus is
						formed, provided the treatment be properly applied. But although men
						would give a great price to escape being deformed, yet at the same
						time they do not know how to take care, nor have resolution, if they
						do not experience pain, nor fear death, although the formation of
						callus in the nose speedily place, for the most part is consolidated
						in ten days, provided sphacelus do not take place.  </p></div2>

						When the fractured bone is displaced laterally, the treatment is the
						same, but it is obvious that the reduction is to be made, not by applying
						equal force on both sides, but by pushing the displaced portion into
						its natural position, and pressing on it from without, and introducing
						something into the nostrils, and boldly rectifying the fragments which
						incline inward, until the whole be properly adjusted, well knowing
						that if you do not restore the parts at once, it is impossible but
						that the nose must<pb id="p.235"/> be distorted. But when you restore the parts to
						their natural position, either the patient himself, or some other
						person, is to apply one finger or more to the part which protrudes,
						and keep it in position until the fracture be consolidated; but the
						little finger is, from time to time, to be pushed into the nostril,
						to rectify the parts which incline inward. When any inflammation supervenes,
						dough must be used, but attention must still be equally paid to the
						application of the fingers, although the dough be on the part. But
						if the fracture be in the cartilage, with lateral displacement, the
						end of the nose must necessarily be distorted. In such cases some
						of the aforementioned means of reduction, or whatever suits, is to
						be introduced into the nostril; but there are many convenient things
						to be found which have no smell, and are appropriate in other respects;
						thus, on one occasion, I introduced a slice of sheep's lung, as it
						happened to be at hand; for sponges, if introduced, imbibe humidities.
						Then the outer skin of Carthaginian leather is to be taken, and a
						piece of the size of the thumb, or what will answer, is to be cut
						off and glued to the outside of the nostril which is turned aside,
						and then this piece of thong is to be stretched to the proper degree,
						or rather a little more than what will be sufficient to make the nose
						straight and regular. Then (for the thong must be long) it is to be
						brought below the ear and round the head, and the end of the thong
						may either be glued to the forehead, or a still longer one may be
						carried all round the head, and secured. This is a natural mode of
						setting the nose, is of easy application, and is calculated to enable
						the counter-extension on the nose to be made greater or less, as you
						may incline. In a case where the fractured nose is turned to the side,
						the treatment is to be conducted otherwise, as already described;
						and in most of them the thong ought to be glued to the end of the
						nose, in order to make extension in the opposite direction. </p></div2>

						When the fracture is complicated with a wound, one need not be troubled
						on that account, but pitch-cerate or any of the applications for fresh
						wounds is to be applied to the sores; for, in general, they admit
						of easy cure, even when there is reason to apprehend that pieces of
						bone will come out. The parts, at first, <pb id="p.236"/>are to be adjusted fearlessly,
						taking care that nothing is omitted, and, subsequently, they are also
						to be adjusted with the fingers; more softly, indeed, but still it
						must be done; and of all parts of the body the nose is modeled with
						the greatest ease. And there is nothing to prevent us from having
						recourse to the practice of gluing on the thongs, and drawing the
						nose to the opposite side, even if there be a wound or the parts be
						inflamed, for these thongs give no pain. </p></div2>

						With regard to cataplasms, the heaviest, on the whole, are the worst;
						but almost all kinds are bad, form abscesses, occasion an increase
						of humors, and afterward troublesome suppurations; and a fractured
						ear stands in less need of such applications than any other part;
						the most ready, if required, is the paste of meal, but neither should
						it have weight. It should touch as little as possible; for it is a
						good sometimes to apply nothing at all, both to the ear and to many
						other cases. Attention must be paid to the patient's position during
						sleep. And the body must be reduced, more especially if there be danger
						lest the ear suppurate; it will also be better to open the bowels,
						and if the patient can be readily made to vomit, this may be accomplished
						by means of the <hi rend="ital">syrmaism</hi>. If the part come to suppuration, it should
						not be hastily opened; for often when matter appears to be formed
						it is absorbed again, even when no cataplasm is applied. But if forced
						to open it, the part will get soonest well if transfixed with a cautery,
						and yet it should be well understood that the ear gets maimed, and
						is less than the other if burned through. If not burned through, an
						incision, and not a very small one, should be made on the upper side;
						for the pus is found to be surrounded with a thicker covering than
						one would have supposed; and it may be said, in general, that all
						parts of a mucous nature and which form mucus, as being all viscid,
						when touched, slip from below the fingers to either side; and on that
						account the physician, in such cases, finds that he has to pass his<pb id="p.237"/>
						instrument through a thicker substance than he supposed; and in certain
						ganglionic cases, when the skin is flabby and mucous, many physicians
						open them, expecting to find a collection in them; here the physician
						forms a wrong judgment, but by such a procedure no great harm results
						to the patient from having had the part opened. But with regard to
						watery parts, and such as are filled with mucus, and which are situated
						in regions where every one of the parts, if opened, will occasion
						death or some other injury, these will be treated of in another work.
						When, therefore, incision is made in the ear, all sorts of cataplasms
						and pledges should be avoided, and it is to be treated either with
						applications for recent wounds, or anything else which is neither
						heavy nor will occasion pain, for if the cartilage be laid bare and
						abscesses form, the case will be troublesome; this happens from such
						modes of treatment. In all aggravated cases, the most effectual remedy
						is the transfixing of the part with a hot iron. </p></div2>

						The vertebrae of the spine when contracted into a hump behind from
						disease, for the most part cannot be remedied, more especially when
						the gibbosity is above the attachment of the diaphragm to the spine.
						Certain of those below the diaphragm are carried off by varices in
						the legs, more especially by such as occur in the vein at the ham;
						and in those cases where the gibbosities are removed, the varices
						take place also in the groin; and some have been carried off by a
						dysentery when it becomes chronic. And when the gibbosity occurs in
						youth before the body has attained its full growth, in these cases
						the body does not usually grow along the spine, but the legs and the
						arms are fully developed, whilst the parts (about the back) are arrested
						in their development. And in those cases where the gibbosity is above
						the diaphragm, the ribs do not usually expand properly in width, but
						forward, and the chest becomes sharp-pointed and not broad, and they
						become affected with difficulty of breathing and hoarseness; for the
						cavities which inspire and expire the breath do not attain their proper
						capacity. And they are under the necessity of keeping the neck bent
						forward at the great vertebra, in order that their head may not hang
						downward; this, therefore, occasions great contraction of the pharynx
						by its <pb id="p.238"/>inclination inward; for, even in those who are erect in stature,
						dyspnoea is induced by this bone inclining inward, until it be restored
						to its place. From this frame of body, such persons  
						appear to have more prominent necks than persons in good health, and
						they generally have hard and unconcocted tubercles in the lungs, for
						the gibbosity and the distension are produced mostly by such tubercles,
						with which the neighboring nerves communicate. When the gibbosity
						is below the diaphragm, in some of these cases nephritic diseases
						and affections of the bladder supervene, but abscesses of a chronic
						nature, and difficult to cure, occur in the loins and groins, and
						neither of these carries off the gibbosity; and in these cases the
						hips are more emaciated than when the gibbosity is seated higher up;
						but the whole spine is more elongated in them than in those who have
						the gibbosity seated higher up, the hair of the pubes and chin is
						of slower growth and less developed, and they are less capable of
						generation than those who have the gibbosity higher up. When the gibbosity
						seizes persons who have already attained their full growth, it usually
						occasions a crisis of the then existing disease, but in the course
						of time some of them attack, as in the case of younger persons, to
						a greater or less degree; but, not withstanding, for the most part,
						all these diseases are less malignant. And yet many have borne the
						affection well, and have enjoyed good health until old age, more especially
						those persons whose body is inclined to be plump and fat; and a few
						of them have lived to beyond sixty years of age, but the most of them
						are more short-lived. In some cases the curvature of the spine is
						lateral, that is to say, either to the one side or the other; the
						most of such cases are connected with tubercles (<hi rend="ital">abscesses?</hi>) within
						the spine; and in some, the positions in which they have been accustomed
						to lie cooperate with the disease. But these will be treated of among
						the chronic affections of the lungs; for these the most suitable prognostics
						of what will happen in these cases are given. </p></div2>

						When the spine protrudes backward, in consequence of a fall, it seldom
						happens that one succeeds in straightening it. Wherefore succussion
						on a ladder has never straightened anybody, as far as I know, but
						it is principally practiced by those <pb id="p.239"/>physicians who seek to astonish
						the mob-for to such persons these things appear wonderful, for example,
						if they see a man suspended or thrown down, or the like; and they
						always extol such practices, and never give themselves any concern
						whatever may result from the experiment, whether bad or good. But
						the physicians who follow such practices, as far as I have known them,
						are all stupid. The device, however, is an old one, and I give great
						praise to him who first invented this, and any other mechanical contrivance
						which is according to nature. For neither would I despair, but that
						if succussion were properly gone about, the spine, in certain cases,
						might be thereby rectified. But, indeed, for my own part, I have been
						ashamed to treat all such cases in this way, because such modes of
						procedure are generally practiced by charlatans. </p></div2>

						Those cases in which the gibbosity is near the neck, are less likely
						to be benefited by these succussions with the head downward, for the
						weight of the head, and tops of the shoulders, when allowed to hang
						down, is but small; and such cases are more likely to be made straight
						by succussion applied with the feet hanging down, since the inclination
						downward is greater in this way. When the hump is lower down, it is
						more likely in this case that succussion with the head downward should
						do good. If one, then, should think of trying succussion, it may be
						applied in the following manner:-The ladder is to be padded with leather
						lined cushions, laid across, and well secured to one another, to a
						somewhat greater extent, both in length and breadth, than the space
						which the man's body will occupy; he is then to be laid on the ladder
						upon his back, and the feet, at the ankles, are to be fastened, at
						no great distance from one another, to the ladder, with some firm
						but soft band; and he is further to be secured, in like manner, both
						above and below the knee, and also at the nates; and at the groins
						and chest loose shawls are to be put round in such a fashion as not
						to interfere with the effect of the succussion; and his arms are to
						be fastened along his sides to his own body, and not to the ladder.
						When you have arranged these matters thus, you must hoist up the ladder,
						either to a high tower or to the gable-end of a house; but the place
						where you make the <pb id="p.240"/>succussion should be firm, and those who perform
						the extension should be well instructed, so that they may let go their
						hold equally to the same extent, and suddenly, and that the ladder
						may neither tumble to the ground on either side, nor they themselves
						fall forward. But, if the ladder be let go from a tower, or the mast
						of a ship, fastened into the ground with its cordage, it will be better,
						so that the ropes run upon a pulley or axle-tree. But it is disagreeable
						even to enlarge upon these matters; and yet, by the contrivances now
						described, the proper succussion may be made. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="44">
					<head>Part 44</head>
					<p>
						But if the hump be situated very high up, and if succussion be by
						all means to be used, it will be better to do it with the feet downward,
						as has been said, for the force downward will be the greater in this
						case. The patient is to be well fastened to the ladder by cords at
						the breast, at the neck by means of a very loose shawl so as merely
						to keep the part properly on the ladder, and the head is to be fastened
						to the ladder at the forehead, the arms are to be stretched along
						and attached to the patient's body, and not to the ladder, and the
						rest of the body is not to be bound, except so as to keep it in place
						by means of a loose shawl wrapped round it and the ladder; attention,
						moreover, should be paid that these ligatures do not interfere with
						the force of the succussion, and the legs are not to be fastened to
						the ladder, but should be placed near one another, so as to be in
						line with the spine. These matters should be thus arranged, if recourse
						is to be had at all to succussion on a ladder; for it is disgraceful
						in every art, and more especially in medicine, after much trouble,
						much display, and much talk, to do no good after all. </p></div2>

						In the first place, the structure of the spine should be known, for this knowledge
						is requisite in many diseases. Wherefore, on the side turned to the
						belly (<hi rend="ital">the anterior?</hi>) the vertebrae are in a regular line, and are
						united together by a pulpy and nervous band of connection, originating
						from the cartilages, and extending to the spinal marrow. There are
						certain other nervous cords which decussate, are attached (<hi rend="ital">to the
							vertebrae?</hi>), and are extended from both sides of them. But we will
						describe in another work the connections of the veins and arteries,
						their<pb id="p.241"/> numbers, their qualities, their origin, their functional offices
						in particular parts, in what sort of sheaths the spinal marrow is
						inclosed, where they arise, where they terminate, how they communicate,
						and what their uses. On the opposite side (<hi rend="ital">behind?</hi>) the vertebrae
						are connected together by a ginglymoid articulation. Common cords
						(<hi rend="ital">nerves?</hi>) are extended to all parts, both those within and without.
						There is an osseous process from the posterior part of all and each
						of the vertebra, whether greater or smaller; and upon these processes
						there are cartilaginous epiphyses, and from them arise nervous productions
						(<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>), akin to the external nerves (<hi rend="ital">tonoi</hi>). The ribs are united
						to them, having their heads inclined rather to the inside than the
						out, and every one of them is articulated with the vertebrae; and
						the ribs in man are very curved, and, as it were, arched. The space
						between the ribs and the processes of the vertebrae is filled on both
						sides by muscles, which arise from the neck and extend to the loins
						(<hi rend="ital">?</hi>). The spine, longitudinally, is a straight line slightly curved;
						from the os sacrum to the great vertebra which is connected with the
						articulation of the femur, the spine inclines backward, for the bladder,
						the organs of generation, and the loose portion of the rectum, are
						situated there. From this, to the attachment of the diaphragm, the
						spine inclines inward, and this portion alone, from the internal parts,
						gives origin to muscles, which are called <hi rend="ital">psoae</hi>. From this to the
						great vertebra (<hi rend="ital">seventh cervical?</hi>) which is above the tops of the
						shoulders, it is convex behind lengthways; but it is more in appearance
						than it really is, for the spinous processes are highest in the middle,
						and less so above and below. The region of the neck is convex before. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="46">
					<head>Part 46</head>
					<p>
						In cases of displacement backward along the vertebrae, it does not
						often happen, in fact, it is very rare, that one or more vertebrae
						are torn from one another and displaced. For such injuries do not
						readily occur, as the spine could not easily be displaced backward
						but by a severe injury on the fore part through the belly (which would
						prove fatal), or if a person falling from a height should pitch on
						the nates, or shoulders (and even in this case he would die, but not
						immediately); and it also would not readily happen that such a displacement
						could take place <pb id="p.242"/>forward, unless some very heavy weight should fall
						upon it behind; for each of the posterior spinal processes is so constructed,
						that it would sooner be broken than undergo any great inclination
						forward from a force which would have to overcome the ligaments and
						the articulations mutually connecting them. And the spinal marrow
						would suffer, if from the displacement of a vertebra it were to be
						bent even to a small extent; for the displaced vertebra would compress
						the spinal marrow, if it did not break it; and if compressed and strangled,
						it would induce insensibility of many great and important parts, so
						that the physician need not give himself any concern about rectifying
						the displacement of the vertebra, accompanied, as it is, by many other
						ill consequences of a serious nature. It is evident, then, that such
						a case could not be reduced either by succussion or by any other method,
						unless one were to cut open the patient, and then, having introduced
						the hand into one of the great cavities, were to push outward from
						within, which one might do on the dead body, but not at all on the
						living. Wherefore, then, do I write all this? Because certain persons
						fancy that they have cured patients in whom the vertebra had undergone
						complete dislocation forward. Some, indeed, suppose that this is the
						easiest of all these dislocations to be recovered from, and that such
						cases do not stand in need of reduction, but get well spontaneously.
						Many are ignorant, and profit by their ignorance, for they obtain
						credit from those about them. These are deceived in this way, for
						they suppose the spinous processes to be the vertebrae themselves,
						because every one of them appears round to the touch, not knowing
						that these bones are processes from the vertebrae, as formerly stated;
						but the vertebrae are at a considerable distance before them; for
						of all animals, man, in proportion to his bulk, has the belly (<hi rend="ital">internal
							cavity?</hi>) the narrowest from behind to before, especially at the breast.
						When, therefore, any of these processes are severely fractured, whether
						one or more, the part there appears lower than on either side, and
						for that reason they are deceived, supposing that the vertebrae are
						displaced inward. And the attitudes of the patient contribute also to deceive them;
						for if they attempt to put themselves into a bent position, they <pb id="p.243"/>are
						pained, from the skin being stretched at the seat of the injury, and
						at the same time the fragments of the bones wound the skin still more;
						but if they bend forward, they feel easier, for the skin at the wound
						is thus relaxed, and the bones are less disposed to hurt them; and
						if touched, they shrink and bend forward, and the part which is touched
						appears empty and soft. All the circumstances now mentioned contribute
						to deceive the physician. Such patients speedily get well without
						any bad effects, for callus readily forms in all such bones as are
						porous. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="47">
					<head>Part 47</head>
					<p>
						There are many varieties of curvature of the spine even in persons
						who are in good health; for it takes place from natural conformation
						and from habit, and the spine is liable to be bent from old age, and
						from pains. Gibbosities (<hi rend="ital">or</hi> projections backward) from falls generally
						take place when one pitches on the nates, or falls on the shoulders.
						In this case some one of the vertebrae must necessarily appear higher
						than natural, and those on either side to a less degree; but yet no
						one generally has started out of the line of the others, but every
						one has yielded a little, so that a considerable extent of them is
						curved. On this account the spinal marrow easily bears such distortions,
						because they are of a circular shape, and not angular. The apparatus
						for the reduction in this case must be managed in the following manner:
						a strong and broad board, having an oblong furrow in it, is to be
						fastened in the ground, or, in place of the board, we may scoop out
						an oblong furrow in the wall, about a cubit above the floor, or at
						any suitable height, and then something like an oaken bench, of a
						quadrangular shape, is to be laid along (the wall?) at a distance
						from the wall, which will admit of persons to pass round if necessary,
						and the bench is to be covered with robes, or anything else which
						is soft, but does not yield much; and the patient is to be stoved
						with vapor, if necessary, or bathed with much hot water, and then
						he is to be stretched along the board on his face, with his arms laid
						along and bound to his body; the middle, then, of a thong which is
						soft, sufficiently broad and long, and composed of two cross straps
						of leather, is to be twice carried along the middle of the patient's
						breast, as near the armpits as possible, then what is over of the
						thongs at the armpits is <pb id="p.244"/>to be carried round the shoulders, and afterward
						the ends of the thong are to be fastened to a piece of wood resembling
						a pestle; they are to be adapted to the length of the bench laid below
						the patient, and so that the pestle-like piece of wood resting against
						this bench may make extension. Another such band is to be applied
						above the knees and the ankles, and the ends of the thongs fastened
						to a similar piece of wood; and another thong, broad, soft, and strong,
						in the form of a swathe, having breadth and length sufficient, is
						to be bound tightly round the loins, as near the hips as possible;
						and then what remains of this swathelike thong, with the ends of the
						thongs, must be fastened to the piece of wood placed at the patient's
						feet, and extension in this fashion is to be made upward and downward,
						equally and at the same time, in a straight line. For extension thus
						made could do no harm, if properly performed, unless one sought to
						do mischief purposely. But the physicians, or some person who is strong,
						and not uninstructed, should apply the palm of one hand to the hump,
						and then, having laid the other hand upon the former, he should make
						pressure, attending whether this force should be applied directly
						downward, or toward the head, or toward the hips. This method of applying
						force is particularly safe; and it is also safe for a person to sit
						upon the hump while extension is made, and raising himself up, to
						let himself fall again upon the patient. And there is nothing to prevent
						a person from placing a foot on the hump, and supporting his weight
						on it, and making gentle pressure; one of the men who is practiced
						in the palestra would be a proper person for doing this in a suitable
						manner. But the most powerful of the mechanical means is this: if
						the hole in the wall, or in the piece of wood fastened into the ground,
						be made as much below the man's back as may be judged proper, and
						if a board, made of limetree, or any other wood, and not too narrow,
						be put into the hole, then a rag, folded several times or a small
						leather cushion, should be laid on the hump; nothing large, however,
						should be laid on the back, but just as much as may prevent the board
						from giving unnecessary pain by its hardness; but the hump should
						be as much as possible on a line with the hole made in the wall, so
						that the board introduced into it may <pb id="p.245"/>make pressure more especially
						at that spot. When matters are thus adjusted, one
						person, or two if necessary, must press down the end of the board,
						whilst others at the same time make extension and counter-extension
						as along the body, as formerly described. Extension may also be made
						with axles, which may either be fastened in the ground beside the
						bench, or the post of the axles may be attached to the bench itself,
						if you will make them perpendicular and overtopping (<hi rend="ital">the bench?</hi>) a
						little at both ends, or at either end of the bench. These powers are
						easily regulated, so as to be made stronger or weaker, and they are
						of such force, that if one were to have recourse to them for a mischievous
						purpose, and not as a remedy, they would operate strongly in this
						way also; for by making merely extension and counter-extension longitudinally,
						without any additional force, one might make sufficient extension;
						and if, without making extension at all, one were only to press down
						properly with the board, sufficient force might be applied in this
						way. Such powers, then, are excellent which admit of being so regulated,
						that they can be made weaker and stronger as required. And the forces
						are applied in the natural way; for the pressure above forces the
						displaced parts into their place. Natural extension restores parts
						which have come too near one another to their natural position. I,
						then, am acquainted with no powers which are better or more appropriate
						than these; for extension along the spine downward has no proper hold
						at the bone called the os sacrum; and extension upward, along the
						neck and head, has indeed a hold; but extension thus made is unseemly
						to behold, and, besides, if increased, may occasion much mischief
						otherwise. I once made trial of the following plan. Having placed
						the patient on his back, I put below the hump a bladder, not inflated,
						and afterward introduced air into the bladder by means of a brass
						pipe connected with it. But the experiment did not succeed; for, when
						the man was fairly extended, the bladder yielded, and the air could
						not be forced into it; and, besides, the hump of the patient was apt
						to slip off the distended bladder when they were pressed together.
						But when I did not extend the man strongly, the bladder was swelled
						up by the air, and the man became more bent forward <pb id="p.246"/> than proper. I
						have written this expressly; for it is a valuable piece of knowledge
						to learn what things have been tried and have proved ineffectual,
						and wherefore they did not succeed.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="48">
					<head>Part 48</head>
					<p>
						In curvatures forward of the vertebrae from a fall, or from some heavy
						body falling upon them, in general no one of them is displaced far
						beyond the others, but if one or more be so displaced, the case proves
						fatal; but, not withstanding, as formerly stated, the displacement
						is circular, and not angular. In such cases, then, the urine and faeces
						are more apt to be retained than in displacement outward, the feet
						and the whole inferior extremities are colder, and the symptoms are
						more fatal than in the former case; and if they do survive, they are
						more subject to retention of the urine, and to loss of strength, and
						to torpor in their legs. But if the displacement be in the upper part,
						they experience loss of strength and torpor of the whole body. I know
						no mechanical contrivance by which such a displacement could be reduced,
						unless that one might be benefited by succussion on a bladder, or
						any other similar plan of treatment, such as extension, as formerly
						described. I am not aware of any mode of pressure which might be applied
						along with the extension, like that of the board in displacement backward;
						for how could one apply pressure from before through the belly? (<hi rend="ital">internal
							cavity?</hi>) The thing is impossible. But neither coughing nor sneezing
						has any power so as to cooperate with the extension, nor would the
						injection of air into the bowels have any effect. And to apply large
						cupping instruments with the view of drawing back the vertebrae which
						have protruded forward, shows a great error of judgment; for they
						rather propel than attract, and those who apply them are not aware
						even of this fact, for the greater will be the inclination forward
						the greater the instrument applied, the skin being forcibly drawn
						into the cupping-instrument. I could tell of other modes of succussion
						than those formerly described, which one might fancy would be more
						applicable in such an affection; but I have no great confidence in
						them, and therefore I do not describe them. On the main, it should
						be known, respecting the accidents which I have briefly described,
						that displacements forward are of a fatal and injurious nature; but
						that displacements backward, <pb id="p.247"/>for the most part, do not prove fatal,
						nor occasion retention of urine nor torpor of the limbs, for they
						do not stretch the ducts leading toward the intestines, nor occasion
						obstruction of the same; but displacements forward produce both these
						bad effects, and many others in addition. And truly they are more
						apt to lose the power of their legs and arms, to have torpor of the
						body, and retention of urine, who experience no displacement either
						forward or backward, but merely a violent concussion along the spine,
						while those who have displacement backward are least subject to these
						symptoms. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="49">

						And one might observe many other instances in medicine, of considerable
						injuries not proving serious, but producing a crisis in some affection,
						while less considerable injuries prove more serious, give rise to
						chronic diseases, and extend their effects to the whole system. Now
						something similar may happen in fracture of the ribs; for in fracture
						of one or more ribs, in general, if the fractured bones are not driven
						inward, nor are laid bare, fever rarely supervenes, neither does it
						often happen that there is haemoptysis, empyema, and suppurating sores,
						which require treatment with pledgets, nor necrosis of the bones;
						and in these cases the ordinary regimen is sufficient. For, unless
						they be seized with continual fever, a strict diet does more harm
						than good, by inducing inanition, and increasing the pain, fever,
						and cough; for moderate fullness of the intestines has a tendency
						to replace the ribs, while evacuation leads to suspension of the ribs,
						and suspension induces pain. Ordinary bandaging, externally, is sufficient
						in such cases; the bandages should be applied moderately tight, along
						with cerate and compresses, or a pad of wool may be applied. The rib
						is consolidated in twenty days, for callus soon forms in such bones. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="50">
					<head>Part 50</head>
					<p>
						But when there is contusion of the flesh about the ribs, either from
						a blow, or a fall, or a bruise, or any like cause, there is often
						copious vomiting of blood, for there are canals stretched along the
						vacuity of each rib (<hi rend="ital">intercostal space?</hi>), and nerves proceeding from
						the most important parts of the body have their origin there. Many
						of these, therefore, are troubled with coughs, tubercles, empyema,
						external suppurations, and sphacelus of the <pb id="p.248"/>ribs. And even when no
						such symptoms supervene from contusion of the skin about the ribs,
						still in such cases there is, generally, more combined pain than in
						fractures of the ribs, and relapses of pain in the seat of the injury
						are more apt to occur. Wherefore some physicians pay much less attention
						to such injuries, than where the rib is fractured, whereas, if they
						were wise, they would treat such cases with far greater care than
						the other; for it is proper that the diet should be restricted, that
						the patients should remain at rest as much as possible, and abstain
						from venery, from fat articles of food, from such as excite cough,
						and from everything strong; they should be bled in the arm, speak
						as little as possible, should have the contused part bound round with
						folded compresses, plenty of bandages, broader than the contusion,
						and which should be smeared with cerate; in applying the bandages,
						broad and soft shawls should be used, and they should be put on moderately
						firm, so that the patient will say that they are neither too tight
						nor loose, and the bandaging should commence at the seat of the injury,
						and be made more particularly tight there, and the bandaging should
						be conducted as is done with a double-headed roller, so that the skin
						about the ribs may not be ruffled, but may lie smooth, and the bandaging
						should be renewed every day, or every alternate day. It is better
						also to open the bowels with some gentle medicine, so as just to produce
						an evacuation of the food, and the diet is to be restricted for ten
						days, and then the body is to be recruited and filled up; while you
						are upon the reducing system, the bandaging should be tighter, but
						when you are making him up again, it must be looser; and, if he spit
						blood from the commencement, the treatment and bandaging should be
						continued for forty days; but if there be no haemoptysis, treatment
						for twenty days will generally be sufficient; but the length of time
						must be regulated by the magnitude of the injury. When such contusions
						are neglected, if no greater mischief result there from, at all events
						the bruised part has its flesh more pulpy than it had formerly. When,
						therefore, any such thing is left behind, and is not properly dissipated
						by the treatment, it will be worse if the mucosity be lodged near
						the bone, for the flesh no longer adheres to the bone <pb id="p.249"/>as formerly,
						the bone becomes diseased, and chronic sloughings of the bone in many
						cases arise from such causes. But if the mischief be not upon the
						bone, but it is the flesh itself which is pulpy, relapses and pains
						will return from time to time, if there happen to be any disorder
						in the body; wherefore proper bandaging, and for a considerable time,
						must be had recourse to, until the extravasated blood forming in the
						bruise be dried up and absorbed, and the part be made up with sound
						flesh, and the flesh adhere to the bone. The best cure is the cautery
						in those cases which, from neglect, have become chronic, and the place
						turns painful, and the flesh is pulpy. And when the flesh itself is
						pulpy, the burning should be carried as far as the bone, but the bone
						itself should not be heated; but if it be in the intercostal space,
						you need not make the burning so superficial, only you must take care
						not to burn quite through. But if the contusion appear to be at the
						bone, if it be still recent, and the bone has not yet become necrosed,
						if it be very small, it is to be burned as has been described; but
						if the rising along the bone be oblong, several eschars are to be
						burned over it. Necrosis of the rib will be described along with the
						treatment of suppurating sores.</p></div2>

						There are four modes of dislocation at the hip-joint: of which modes,
						dislocation inward takes place most frequently, outward, the most
						frequently of all the other modes; and it sometimes takes place backward
						and forward, but seldom. When, therefore, dislocation takes place
						inward, the leg appears longer than natural, when compared with the
						other leg, for two reasons truly; for the bone which articulates with
						the hip-joint is carried from above down to the ischium where it rises
						up to the pubes, upon it, then, the head of the femur rests, and the
						neck of the femur is lodged in the cotyloid foramen (<hi rend="ital">foramen thyroideum?</hi>).
						The buttock appears hollow externally, from the head of the thighbone
						having shifted inward, and the extremity of the femur at the knee
						is turned outward, and the leg and foot in like manner. The foot then
						being turned outward, physicians, from ignorance, bring the sound
						leg to it and not it to the sound leg; on this account, the injured
						limb appears to be much longer than the sound one, and in many other
						cases similar circumstances <pb id="p.250"/>lead to error in judgment. Neither does
						the limb at the groin admit of flexion as in the sound limb, and the
						head of the bone is felt at the perineum too prominent. These, then,
						are the symptoms attending dislocation of the thigh inward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="52">
					<head>Part 52</head>
					<p>
						When, then, a dislocation has not been reduced, but has been misunderstood
						or neglected, the leg, in walking, is rolled about as is the case
						with oxen, and the weight of the body is mostly supported on the sound
						leg, and the limb at the flank, and the joint where the dislocation
						has occurred is necessarily hollow and bent, while on the sound side
						the buttock is necessarily rounded. For if one should walk with the
						foot of the sound leg turned outward, the weight of the body would
						be thrown upon the injured limb, but the injured limb could not carry
						it, for how could it? One, then, is forced in walking to turn the
						leg inward, and not outward, for thus the sound leg best supports
						its own half of the body, and also that of the injured side. But being
						hollow at the flank and the hip-joint, they appear small in stature,
						and are forced to rest on a staff at the side of the sound leg. For
						they require the support of a staff there, since the nates inclines
						to this side, and the weight of the body is carried to it. They are
						forced also to stoop, for they are obliged to rest the hand on the
						side of the thigh against the affected limb; for the limb which is
						injured cannot support the body in changing the legs, unless it be
						held when it is applied to the ground. They who have got an unreduced
						dislocation inward are forced to put themselves into these attitudes,
						and this from no premeditation on their part how they should assume
						the easiest position, but the impediment itself teaches them to choose
						that which is most conformable to their present circumstances. For
						persons who have a sore on the foot, or leg, and cannot rest upon
						the limb, all, even children, walk in this way; for they turn the
						injured limb outward in walking, and they derive two advantages therefrom,
						to supply two wants; the weight of the body is not equally thrown
						upon the limb turned outward, as upon the one turned inward, for neither
						is the weight in a line with it, but is much more thrown upon the
						one under the body; for the weight is in a straight line with it,
						both in walking and in the shifting of the legs. In this <pb id="p.251"/>position
						one can most quickly turn the sound limb under the body, by walking
						with the unsound limb outward, and the sound inward. In the case we
						are now treating of, it is well that the body finds out the attitudes
						which are the easiest for itself. Those persons, then, who have not
						attained their growth at the time when they met with a dislocation
						which is not reduced, become maimed in the thigh, the leg, and the
						foot, for neither do the bones grow properly, but become shortened,
						and especially the bone of the thigh; and the whole limb is emaciated,
						loses its muscularity, and becomes enervated and thinner, both from
						the impediment at the joint, and because the patient cannot use the
						limb, as it does not lie in its natural position, for a certain amount
						of exercise will relieve excessive enervation, and it will remedy
						in so far the deficiency of growth in length. Those persons, then,
						are most maimed who have experienced the dislocation <hi rend="ital">in utero</hi>, next
						those who have met with it in infancy, and least of all, those who
						are full grown. The mode of walking adopted by adults has been already
						described; but those who are children when this accident befalls them,
						generally lose the erect position of the body, and crawl about miserably
						on the sound leg, supporting themselves with the hand of the sound
						side resting on the ground. Some, also, who had attained manhood before
						they met with this accident, have also lost the faculty of walking
						erect. Those who were children when they met with the accident, and
						have been properly instructed, stand erect upon the sound leg, but
						carry about a staff, which they apply under the armpit of the sound
						side, and some use a staff in both arms; the unsound limb they bear
						up, and the smaller the unsound limb, the greater facility have they
						in walking, and their sound leg is no less strong than when both are
						sound. The fleshy parts of the limb are enervated in all such cases,
						but those who have dislocation inward are more subject to this loss
						of strength than, for the most part, those who have it outward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="53">

						Some tell a story how the Amazonian women dislocate the joints of
						their male children while mere infants, some at the knee, and others
						at the hip-joint, that they may be maimed, and that the male sex may
						not conspire against the female, and that <pb id="p.252"/>they use them as artisans
						to perform any sedentary work, such as that of a shoemaker or brazier.
						Whether these things be true or not I do not know, but this I know,
						that matters would be such as is represented, provided their children,
						while infants, were to have their joints dislocated. The consequences
						of dislocation inward at the hip-joint are much greater than of dislocation
						outward at the hip-joint, but at the knee, although there be some
						difference, it is less; but the mode of either impediment is peculiar,
						their legs are more bandied when the dislocation is outward, but those
						who have dislocation inward stand erect on their feet with less freedom.
						In like manner, when the dislocation is at the anklejoint, if outward
						they become <hi rend="ital">vari</hi> (<hi rend="ital">their toes are turned inward?</hi>), but they can stand;
						but if the dislocation be inward they become <hi rend="ital">valgi</hi> (<hi rend="ital">their toes are
							turned outward?</hi>), but they have less freedom of standing. The proportional
						growth of their bones is as follows: in those cases in which the bone
						of the leg is dislocated, the bones of the feet grow very little,
						as being very near the injury, but the bones of the leg increase in
						size, and with very little defect, but the fleshy parts (<hi rend="ital">muscles?</hi>)
						are wasted. But when the ankle-joint is in its natural state, but
						the knee is dislocated, in  these cases the bones of the leg do not grow in like manner, but become shortened, as being nearest the seat of the injury, and the bones of the feet also are atrophied, but not in the same proportion; because, as was said a little while ago, the ankle-joint is safe, and if they could use it, as in the case of club-foot, the bones of the foot would be still less atrophied. When the dislocation takes place at the hip-joint, the bone of the thigh, in this case, does not generally grow in like manner, as being the one nearest the seat of the injury, but becomes shorter than the sound one; but the growth of the bones of the leg is not
						arrested in like manner; nor of those of the feet, for this reason, that there is no displacement between the bones of the thigh and leg, nor between those of the leg and foot; in those cases, however, the fleshy parts of the whole limb are atrophied; but if they could make use of the limb, the growth of the bones would be still more developed, as formerly stated, only the thigh, although its flesh would be much less wasted, would <pb id="p.253"/>still be by no means so fleshy as the sound limb. The following observations are a proof of this: those persons who are weasel-armed (<hi rend="ital">galiancones</hi>) from birth, owing to dislocation of the humerus, or when the accident has happened to them before they have attained their full growth, such persons have the bone of the arm shortened, but those of the fore-arm and hand are little inferior in size to the sound, for the reasons which have been stated, because the humerus is the bone nearest to the joint affected, and, on that account, it is shorter than natural; but the fore-arm is not equally affected by the accident, because the joint at which the bones of the arm and forearm are articulated remains in its natural condition, and the hand is still further distant than the fore-arm from the seat of the injury. Such are the reasons why certain of the bones in this case increase in growth, and certain do not. The laborious office of the hand contributes much to the development of the flesh in the fore-arm and hand, for whatever work is done by the hand, these weasel-armed persons strive to do no less effectually with the other hand than with the sound; for the arms do not support the weight of the body like the legs, and the work performed by them is light. From exercise, then, the fleshy parts on the hand and fore-arm are not atrophied in weasel-armed persons, and by these means the arm, too, gains flesh. But in dislocation inward at the hip-joint, whether from birth or from childhood, the fleshy parts, on that account, are much more atrophied than those of the hand, because the patients cannot exercise the leg. Another proof will be given in the observations which will be presently stated, that these things are such as I things are such as I have represented. </p></div2>

						When the head of the femur is dislocated outward, the limb in these cases, when compared with the other, appears shortened, and this is natural, for the head of the femur no longer rests on a bone as in dislocation inward, but along the side of a bone which naturally inclines to the side, and it is lodged in flesh of a pulpy and yielding nature, and on that account it appears more shortened. Inwardly, the thigh about the perineum appears more hollow and flabby, but externally the buttock is more rounded, from the head of the thigh having slipped outward, but <pb id="p.254"/>the nates appear to be raised up, owing to the flesh there having yielded to the head of the thigh-bone; but the extremity of the thigh-bone, at the knee, appears to be turned inward, and the leg and foot in like manner, neither does it admit of flexion like the sound limb. These, then, are the symptoms of dislocation outward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="55">
					<head>Part 55</head>
					<p>
						When such a dislocation is not reduced in adults, the whole limb appears to be shortened, and in walking they cannot reach the ground with the heel, but they walk with the ball of the foot on the ground, and the points of their toes incline a little inward. But the injured limb, in this case, can support the body much better than in dislocation inward, both because the head of the femur and the neck of its articular extremity, being naturally oblique, have formed a bed under a considerable portion of the hip, and because the extremity of the foot is not forcibly turned outward, but is nearly in a line with the body, and is even inclined more inwardly. When, then, the articular extremity of the femur has worn out a socket for itself in the flesh where it was lodged, and the flesh is lubricated, it ceases to be painful in the course of time, and when it becomes free from pain, they can walk without a staff, if so inclined, and they can support the body on the injured limb. From usage then, in such cases, the fleshy parts are less enervated than in those which have been mentioned a little before, still, however, they lose their strength more or less; but in general there is more enervation when the dislocation is inward than when it is outward. Some of them, then, cannot wear their shoes, owing to the unbending state of their leg, and some of them can. But when this dislocation takes place <hi rend="ital">in utero</hi>, and when the dislocation having occurred at any time before manhood, from violence, has not been replaced, or when from disease the articular extremity has started from its socket, and is displaced (for many such cases occur, and from some of them, if the femur become necrosed, obstinate suppurations requiring the use of tents are formed, and in certain of them the bone is laid bare), whether the bone become necrosed or not, the bone of the thigh is much shortened, and does not usually grow like the sound one, the bones, too, of the leg, become shorter than those <pb id="p.255"/>of the other, but in a small degree, for the same reasons that were formerly stated; such persons can walk, some of them in the same fashion as adults having an unreduced dislocation, and some of them walk with the whole foot on the ground, but limp in walking, being obliged to do so by the shortness of the limb. Such is the result, even though they be carefully and properly trained in the attitudes before they have strength for walking, and in like manner also, after they have acquired the necessary strength; but those persons require the most care who were very young when they met with the accident, for, if neglected while children, the limb becomes entirely useless and atrophied. The fleshy parts of the entire limb are more wasted than those of the sound limb, but this is much less apt to happen in their case than in dislocation inward, owing to usage and exercise, as they are speedily able to make use of the limb, as was stated a little before with regard to the weasel-armed (<hi rend="ital">galiancones</hi>).</p></div2>

						There are persons who, from birth or from disease, have dislocations outward of both the thighs; in them, then, the bones are affected in like manner, but the fleshy parts in their case lose their strength less; the legs, too, are plump and fleshy, except that there is some little deficiency at the inside, and they are plump because they have the equal use of both their legs, for in walking they totter equally to this side that. Their nates appear very prominent, from the displacement of the bones of the joint. But if in their case the bones do not sphacelate (<hi rend="ital">become carious?</hi>) and if they do not become bent above the hip-joint, if nothing of this kind happen to them, they become otherwise sufficiently healthy, but the growth of all the rest of the body, with the exception of the head, is arrested. </p></div2>

						In dislocations of the head of the femur backward, which rarely occur, the patient cannot extend the leg, either at the dislocated joint, or at the ham, to any extent, and of all the dislocations, this is the variety in which the patients have the least power of making extension at the groin and the ham. But, moreover, this also should be known (for it is a valuable piece of knowledge, and of much importance, and yet most yet most people are ignorant of it), that persons in health cannot extend the joint <pb id="p.256"/>at the ham, if they do not extend the joint at the groin at the same time, unless they raise the foot very high, for in this way they could do it; neither also could they bend the joint at the ham, but with much greater difficulty, if they do not bend the joint at the groin at the same time. There are many other things in the body which have similar connections, both with regard to the contractions of nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>), and the positions of muscles, and many of them more worthy of being known than is generally supposed, and with regard to the nature of the intestine and that of the whole internal cavity, and with regard to the displacements and contractions of the uterus; but all these things will be treated of elsewhere, in a work akin to the present one. But with regard to the matter on hand, they cannot make extension, as has been already stated; and the limb appears shortened, for two reasons-first, because it cannot be extended, and also because the bone has slipped into the flesh of the nates; for the head and neck of the femur, in this dislocation, are carried downward from their natural situation, to the outside of the nates. But yet they can bend the limb, unless prevented by pain, and the leg and foot appear pretty straight, and not much inclined toward either side, but at the groin the flesh, when felt, appears looser, from the bone of the joint having slipped to the other side, but at the nates the head of the femur may be felt to be more prominent than natural. Such are the symptoms accompanying dislocation of the thigh backward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="58">
					<head>Part 58</head>
					<p>
						When this dislocation occurs in an adult, and is not reduced, he can walk, indeed, after a time, and when the pain has abated, and when he has been accustomed to rotate the articular bone in the flesh; he finds it necessary, however, to make strong flexion at the groin in walking, for two reasons, both because the limb, for the causes already stated, becomes much shorter, and he is far from touching the ground with his heel, and he can barely reach it with the ball of his foot, and not even thus, unless he bend himself at the groins, and also bend with the other leg at the ham. And in this case, he is under the necessity of supporting the upper part of the thigh with his hand at each step: this also contributes, in a certain degree, to make him bend the body <pb id="p.257"/>at the groins; for, during the shifting of the feet in walking, the body cannot be supported on the unsound be supported on the unsound limb, unless it be pressed to the ground by the hand,-the end of the femur not being placed properly under the body, but having slipped backward to the nates; and if he should try to rest the weight of his body for a little, upon the foot, without any other support, he would fall backward, for there would be a great inclination in this direction, from the hips having protruded backward far beyond the line of the foot, and the spine inclining toward the hips. Such persons can walk, indeed, without a staff, if so accustomed, for because the sole of the foot is in its old line, and is not inclined outward, they do not require anything to balance them. Such, however, as, instead of grasping the thigh, prefer resting their weight upon a staff introduced into the armpit of the affected side, these, if they use a longer staff, will walk, indeed, more erect, but will not be able to reach the ground with the foot, or if they wish to rest upon the foot, they must take a shorter staff, and will require to bend the body at the groins. The wasting of the fleshy parts is analogous to what happens in the cases formerly described, for the wasting is greatest in those cases in which the patients keep the limb up, and do not exercise it, whilst those who practice walking, have the least atrophy. The sound leg, however, is not benefited, but is rather rendered more deformed, if the injured limb be applied to the ground, for it is forced to cooperate with the other, being protruded at the hip, and bent at the ham. But if the patient does not use the injured limb by applying it to the ground, but carries it up, and rests upon a staff, the sound leg thereby gains strength, for it is employed in its natural position, and further, the exercise gives it strength. But it may be said, these things are foreign to medicine; for what is the use of enlarging upon cases which are already past remedy? This is far from being the case, for it belongs to the knowledge of medicine to be acquainted also with these, and they cannot possibly be separated from one another; for to such as are curable, means are to be used to prevent them from becoming incurable, studying how they may best be prevented from getting into an incurable state. And incurable cases should be known, that they <pb id="p.258"/>may not be aggravated by useless applications, and splendid and creditable prognostics are made by knowing where, how, and when every case will terminate, and whether it will be converted into a curable or an incurable disease. When then, from birth, or during one's youth, this dislocation backward occurs, and is not reduced, whether it be connected with violence or disease (for many such dislocations occur in diseases, but the nature of the diseases in which dislocations take place, will be described afterward); if, then, the dislocated limb be not reduced, the bone of the thigh becomes shortened, the whole limb is impaired, is arrested in its growth, and loses its flesh from want of use; the articulation at the ham is also impaired, for the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) become stretched, from cases formerly stated, wherefore those who have this dislocation, cannot make extension at the knee-joint. In a word, all parts of the body which were made for active use, if moderately used and exercised at the labor to which they are habituated, become healthy, increase in bulk, and bear their age well, but when not used, and when left without exercise, they become diseased, their growth is arrested, and they soon become old. Among these parts the joints and nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>), if not used, are not the least liable to be so affected; they are impaired, then, for the reasons we have stated, more in this variety of dislocation than in the others, for the whole limb is wasted, both in its bones and in its fleshy parts. Such persons, then, when they attain their full growth, keep the limb raised and flexed, rest the weight of the body on the other leg, and support themselves with a staff, some with one, and others with two.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="59">

						In dislocations of the head of the thigh-bone forward (they are of rare occurrence), the patients cannot extend the leg completely, but least of all can they bend it at the groin; they are pained, also, if forced to bend the limb at the ham. The length of the leg, if compared at the heel, is the same as that of the other; but the extremity of the foot inclines less to project forward. But the whole limb has its natural direction, and inclines neither to this side nor to that. These cases are particularly attended with severe pain, and they are more apt to be accompanied with retention of urine at first than any of the other <pb id="p.259"/>dislocations; for the head of the thigh-bone is lodged very near to important nerves. And the region of the groin appears swelled out and stretched, while that of the nates is more wrinkled and flabby. The symptoms now stated are those which attend this dislocation of the thigh-bone.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="60">
					<head>Part 60</head>
					<p>
						When persons have attained their full growth before meeting with this dislocation, and when it has not been reduced, upon the subsidence of the pain, and when the bone of the joint has been accustomed to be rotated in the place where it is lodged, these persons can walk almost erect without a staff, and with the injured leg almost quite straight, as it does not admit of easy flexion at the groin and the ham; owing, then, to this want of flexion at the groin, they keep the limb more straight in walking than they do the sound one. And sometimes they drag the foot along the ground, as not being able to bend the upper part of the limb, and they walk with the whole foot on the ground; for in walking they rest no less on the heel than on the fore part of the foot; and if they could take great steps, they would rest entirely on the heel in walking; for persons whose limbs are sound, the greater the steps they take in walking, rest so much the more on the heel, while they are putting down the one foot and raising the opposite. In this form of dislocation, persons rest their weight more on the heel than on the anterior part of the foot, for the fore part of the foot cannot be bent forward equally well when the rest of the limb is extended as when it is in a state of flexion; neither, again, can the foot be arched to the same degree the limb is bent as when it is extended. The natural state of matters is such as has been now described; and in an unreduced dislocation, persons walk in the manner described, for the reasons which have been stated. The limb, moreover, is less fleshy than the other, at the nates, the calf of the leg, and the whole of its posterior part. When this dislocation occurs in infancy, and is not reduced, or when it is congenital, in these cases the bone of the thigh is more atrophied than those of the leg and foot; but the atrophy of the thigh-bone is least of all in this form of dislocation. The fleshy parts, however, are everywhere attenuated, more especially behind, as has been stated above. If properly trained, <pb id="p.260"/>such persons, when they grow up, can use the limb, which is only a little shorter than the other, and yet they support themselves on a staff at the affected side. For, not being able to use properly the ball of the foot without the heel, nor to put it down as some can in the other varieties of dislocation (the cause of which has been just now stated), on this account they require a staff. But those who are neglected, and are not in the practice of putting their foot to the ground, but keep the limb up, have the bones more atrophied than those who use the limb; and, at the articulations, the limb is more maimed in the direct line than in the other forms of dislocation. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="61">
					<head>Part 61</head>
					<p>
						In a word, luxations and subluxations take place in different degrees, being sometimes greater and sometimes less; and those cases in which the bone has slipped or been displaced to a much greater extent, are in general more difficult to rectify than otherwise; and if not reduced, such cases have greater and more striking impairment and lesion of the bones, fleshy parts, and attitudes; but when the bone has slipped, or been displaced to a less extent, it is easier to reduce such cases than the other; and if the attempts at reduction have failed, or have been neglected, the impairment in such cases is less, and proves less injurious than in the cases just mentioned. The other joints present great differences as to the extent of the displacements which they are subject to. But the heads of the femur and humerus are very similar to one another as to their dislocations. For the heads of the bones are rounded and smooth, and the sockets which receive the heads are also circular, and adapted to the heads; they do not admit then of being dislocated in any intermediate degree, but, not withstanding, from their rounded shape, the bones slip either outward or inward. In the case we are now treating of, then, there is either a complete dislocation or none at all, and yet these bones admit of being displaced to a greater or less extent; and the thigh is more subject to these differences than the arm. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="62">
					<head>Part 62</head>
					<p>
						Wherefore, then, some of these congenital displacements, if to a small extent, may be reduced to their natural condition, and especially those at the ankle-joint. Most cases of congenital club-foot are remediable, unless the declination be very great,  <pb id="p.261"/>or when the affection occurs at an advanced period of youth. The best plan, then, is to treat such cases at as early a period as possible, before the deficiency of the bones of the foot is very great, and before there is any great wasting of the flesh of the leg. There is more than one variety of club-foot, the most of them being not complete dislocations, but impairments connected with the habitual maintenance of the limb in a certain position. In conducting the treatment, attention must be paid to the following points: to push back and rectify the bone of the leg at the ankle from without inward, and to make counter-pressure on the bone of the heel in an outward direction, so as to bring it bring it into line, in order that the displaced bones may meet at the middle and side of the foot; and the mass of the toes, with the great toe, are to be inclined inward, and retained so; and the parts are to be secured, with cerate containing a full proportion of resin, with compresses, and soft bandages insufficient quantity, but not applied too tight; and the turns of the bandages should be in the same direction as the rectifying of the foot with the hand, so that the foot may appear to incline a little outward. And a sole made of leather not very hard, or of lead, is to be bound on, and it is not to be applied to the skin but when you are about to make the last turns of the bandages. And when it is all bandaged, you must attach the end of one of the bandages that are used to the bandages applied to the inferior part of the foot on the line of the little toe; and then this bandage is to be rolled upward in what is considered to be a sufficient degree, to above the calf of the leg, so that it may remain firm when thus arranged. In a word, as if moulding a wax model, you must bring to their natural position the parts which were abnormally displaced and contracted together, so rectifying them with your hands, and with the bandaging in like manner, as to bring them into their position, not by force, but gently; and the bandages are to be stitched so as to suit the position in which the limb is to be placed, for different modes of the deformity require different positions. And a small shoe made of lead is to be bound on externally to the bandaging, having the same shape as the Chian slippers had. But there is no necessity for it if the parts be properly adjusted  <pb id="p.262"/>with the hands, properly secured with the bandages, and properly disposed of afterward. This, then, is the mode of cure, and it neither requires cutting, burning, nor any other complex means, for such cases yield sooner to
						treatment than one would believe. However, they are to be fairly mastered only by time, and not until the body has grown up in the natural shape; when recourse is had to a shoe, the most suitable are the buskins, which derive their name from being used in traveling through mud; for this sort of shoe does not yield to the foot, but the foot yields to it. A shoe shaped like the Cretan is also suitable. </p></div2>

						In cases of complete dislocation at the ankle-joint, complicated with an external wound, whether the displacement be inward or outward, you are not to reduce the parts, but let any other physician reduce them if he choose. For this you should know for certain, that the patient will die if the parts are allowed to remain reduced, and that he will not survive more than a few days, for few of them pass the seventh day, being cut off by convulsions, and sometimes the leg and foot are seized with gangrene. It should be well known that such will be the results; and it does not appear to me that hellebore will do any good, though administered the same day, and the draught repeated, and yet it is the most likely means, if any such there be; but I am of opinion that not even it will be of service. But if not reduced, nor any attempts at first made to reduce them, most of such cases recover. The leg and foot are to be arranged as the patient wishes, only they must not be put in a dependent position, nor moved about; and they are to be treated with pitched cerate, a few compresses dipped in wine, and not very cold, for cold in such cases induces convulsions; the leaves also of beet, or of colt's foot, of any such, when boiled in dark-colored austere wine, form a suitable application to the wound and the surrounding parts; and the wound may further be anointed with cerate in a tepid state. But if it be the winter season, the part is to be covered with unscoured wool, which is to be sprinkled from above with tepid wine and oil, but on no account is either bandage or compress to be applied; for this should be known most especially, that whatever compresses, or is heavy, does mischief in such cases. And certain of  <pb id="p.263"/>the dressings used to recent wounds are suitable in such cases; and wool may be laid upon the sore, and sprinkled with wine, and allowed to remain for a considerable time; but those dressings for recent wounds which only last for a few days, and into which resin enters as an ingredient, do not agree with them; for the cleansing of the sores is a slow process, and the sore has a copious discharge for a long time. Certain of these cases it may be advantageous to bandage. It ought also to be well understood, that the patient must necessarily be much maimed and deformed, for the foot is retracted outward, and the bones which have been displaced outward protrude: these bones, in fact, not being generally laid bare, unless to a small extent; neither do they exfoliate, but they heal by thin and feeble cicatrices, provided the patient keeps quiet for a length of time; but otherwise there is danger that a small ulcer may remain incurable. And yet in the case we are treating of, those who are thus treated are saved; whereas, when the parts are reduced and allowed to remain in place, the patients die. </p></div2>

						The same rule applies to dislocations at the wrist, attended with a wound and projection of the bone, whether the bones of the arm be displaced inward or outward. For this should be well understood, that the patient will die in the course of a few days, by the same mode of death as formerly described, if the bone be reduced, and allowed to remain so. But in those cases in which they are not reduced, nor any attempt made to reduce them, the patients, for the most part, recover; and the same mode of treatment as has been described will be applicable; but the deformity and impediment of the limb must necessarily be great, and the fingers of the hand will be weak and useless; for if the bones have slipped inward, they cannot bend the fingers, or if outward, they cannot extend them. </p></div2>

						When the os tibiae, having made a wound at the knee, has protruded through the skin, whether the dislocation be outward or inward, in such a case, if the bone be reduced, death will be even more speedy than in the other cases, although speedy also in them. But the only hope of recovery is if you treat them without reduction. These cases are more dangerous than the others,  <pb id="p.264"/>as being so much higher up, as being so much stronger joints, and displaced from bones which are so much stronger. But if the os femoris form a wound at the knee, and slip through it, provided it be reduced and left so, it will occasion a still more violent and speedy death than in the cases formerly described; but if not reduced, it will be much more dangerous than those cases mentioned before, and yet this is the only hope of recovery. </p></div2>

						The same rule applies to the elbow-joint, and with regard to the bones of the fore-arm and arm. For when these bones protrude through a wound which they have made in the skin, all cases in which they are reduced prove fatal; but if not reduced, there is a chance of recovery; but to those that survive there is certain impediment. And if in any instance the bones of the upper articulations (<hi rend="ital">shoulder-joint?</hi>), should be dislocated, and project through a wound which they have made in the skin, these, if reduced, are followed by more speedy death; and if not reduced, they are more dangerous than the others. But the mode of treatment which appears to me most suitable has been already described. </p></div2>

						When the joints of the toes or hands are dislocated, and the bones protrude through a wound which they have made, and when there is no fracture of the bone, but merely displacement of the joint, in these cases, if the reduction be made and allowed to remain, there is some danger of spasms (<hi rend="ital">tetanus?</hi>) if not properly treated, and yet it may be worth while to reduce them, having warned the patient beforehand that much caution and care will be required. The easiest, the most efficient method, and the one most conformable to art, is that by the lever, as formerly described when treating of bones which have been fractured and protruded; then the patient must be as quiet as possible, lie in a recumbent position, and observe a restricted regimen. And it will be better also that he should get some gentle emetics. The sore is to be treated with dressings for fresh wounds, which permit of allusions, or with the leaves of camomile, or with the applications for fractured bones of the head, but nothing very cold must be applied. The first (<hi rend="ital">most distant?</hi>) joints are least dangerous, but those still higher, are more so.  <pb id="p.265"/>Reduction should be made the same day, or the next, but by no means on the third or fourth, for it is on the fourth day that exacerbations especially attack. In those cases, then, where immediate reduction cannot be accomplished, we must wait until after the aforesaid days; for whatever you reduce within ten days, may be expected to induce spasm. But if the spasm supervene on its being reduced, the joint should be quickly displaced, and bathed frequently with warm water, and the whole body should be kept in a warm, soft, and easy condition, and more especially about the joints, for the whole body should rather be in a bent than in an extended state. Moreover, it is to be expected, that the articular extremities of the bones of the fingers will for this generally happens, if even the least degree of inflammation take place, so that if it were not that the physician would be exposed to censure, owing to the ignorance of the common people, no reduction should be made at all. The reduction of the bones of joints which have protruded through the skin, is attended with the dangers which have been described. </p></div2>

						When the articular bones of the fingers are fairly chopped off, these cases are mostly unattended with danger, unless deliquium come on in consequence of the injury, and ordinary treatment will be sufficient to such sores. But when resection is made, not at the articulations, but at some other point in the bones, these cases also are free from danger, and are still more easily cured than the others; and the fractured bones of the fingers which protrude otherwise than at the joint admit of reduction without danger. Complete resections of bones at the joints, whether the foot, the hand, the leg, the ankle, the forearm, the wrist, for the most part, are not unattended with danger, unless one be cut off at once by deliquium animi, or if continual fever supervene on the fourth day. </p></div2>

						With regard to the sphacelus of fleshy parts, it takes place in wounds where there are large blood-vessels, which have been strongly compressed, and in fractures of bones which have been bound too tight, and in other cases of immoderate constriction, when the parts which have been strangulated generally drop off; and the most of such patients recover, even when a portion of the  <pb id="p.266"/>thigh comes away, or of the arm, both bones and flesh, but less so in this case; and when the fore-arm and leg drop off, the patients readily recover. In cases then, of fracture of the bones, when strangulation and blackening of the parts take place at first, the separation of the dead and living parts quickly occurs, and the parts speedily drop off, as the bones have already given way; but when the blackening (<hi rend="ital">mortification</hi>) takes place while the bones are entire, the fleshy parts, in this case, also quickly die, but the bones are slow in separating at the boundary of the blackening, and where the bones are laid bare. Those parts of the body which are below the boundaries of the blackening are to be removed at the joint, as soon as they are fairly dead and have lost their sensibility; care being taken not to wound any living part; for if the part which is cut off give pain, and if it prove not to be quite dead, there is great danger lest the patient may swoon away from the pain, and such swoonings often are immediately fatal. I have known the thigh-bones, when denuded in this manner, drop off on the eightieth day; but in the case of this patient, the parts below were separated at the knee on the twentieth day, and, as I thought, too early, for it appeared to me that this should be done more guardedly. In a case which I had of such blackening in the leg, the bones of the leg, as far as they were denuded, separated at its middle on the sixtieth day. But the separation of denuded bones is quicker or slower, according to the mode of treatment; something, too, depends upon whether the compression be stronger or weaker, and whether the nerves, flesh, arteries, and veins are quicker or slower in becoming blackened and in dying; since, when the parts are not strongly compressed, the separation is more superficial, and does not go the length of laying the bones bare, and in some cases it is still more superficial, so as not even to expose the nerves. For the reasons now stated, it is impossible to define accurately the time at which each of these cases will terminate. The treatment of such cases, however, is to be readily undertaken, for they are more formidable to look at than to treat; and a mild treatment is sufficient in all such cases, for they come to a crisis of themselves; only the diet must be attended to, so that it may be as little  <pb id="p.267"/>calculated to create fever as possible, and the body is to be placed in the proper positions: these are, neither raised very high up, nor inclined much downward, but rather upward, until the separation be completed; for at that time there is most danger of hemorrhage; on this account, wounds should not be laid in a declining position, but the contrary. But after a while, and when the sores have become clean, the same positions will no longer be appropriate; but a straight position, and one inclining downward, may be proper; and in the course of time, in some of these cases, abscesses form, and require bandages. One may also expect that such patients will be attacked with dysentery; for dysentery usually supervenes in cases of mortification and of hemorrhage from wounds; it comes on generally when the blackening and hemorrhage have arrived at a crisis, and is profuse and intense, but does not last many days; neither is it of a fatal nature, for such patients do not usually lose their appetite, nor is it proper to put them on a restricted diet. </p></div2>

						Dislocation inward at the hip-joint is to be reduced in the following manner: (it is a good, proper, and natural mode of reduction, and has something of display in it, if any one takes delight in such ostentatious modes of procedure). The patient is to be suspended by the feet from a cross-beam with a strong, soft, and broad cord; the feet are to be about four inches or less from one another; and a broad and soft leather collar connected with the cross-beam is to be put on above the knees; and the affected leg should be so extended as to moved be two inches longer than the other; the head should be about two cubits from the ground, or a little more or less; and the arms should be stretched along the sides, and bound with something soft; all these preparations should be made while he is lying on his back, so that he may be suspended for as short a time as possible. But when the patient is suspended, a person properly instructed and not weak, having introduced his arm between his thighs, is to place his fore-arm between the perineum and the dislocated head of the os femoris; and then, having joined the other hand to the one thus passed through the thighs, he is to stand by the side of the suspended patient, and suddenly suspend and swing himself in the air as  <pb id="p.268"/>perpendicularly as possible. This method comprises all the conditions which are natural; for the body being suspended by its weight, produces extension, and the person suspended from him, along with the extension, forces the head of the thigh-bone to rise up above the acetabulum; and at the same time he uses the bone of the fore-arm as a lever, and forces the os femoris to slip into its old seat. The cords should be properly prepared, and care should be taken that the person suspended along with the patient have a sufficiently strong hold. </p></div2>

						Wherefore, as formerly stated, men's constitutions differ much from one another as to the facility or difficulty with which dislocations are reduced; and the cause of this was also stated formerly in treating of the shoulder. In some the thigh is reduced with no preparation, with slight extension, directed by the hands, and with slight movement; and in some the reduction is effected by bending the limb at the joint, and making rotation. But much more frequently it does not yield to any ordinary apparatus, and therefore one should be acquainted with the most powerful means which can be applied in each case, and use whatever maybe judged most proper under all circumstances. The modes of extension have been described in the former parts of the work, so that one may make use of whatever may happen to be at hand. For, extension and counter-extension are to be made in the direction of the limb and the body; and if this be properly effected, the head of the thigh-bone will be raised above its ancient seat; and if thus raised, it will not be easy to prevent it from settling in its place, so that any ordinary impulse with the lever and adjustment will be quite sufficient; but some apply insufficient extension, and hence the reduction gives much trouble. The bands then should be fastened, not only at the foot, but also above the knee, so that the force of the extension may not be expended on the knee-joint more than upon the hip-joint. The extension in the direction of the foot is to be thus contrived. But the counter-extension is not only to be managed by means of something carried round the chest and armpits, but also by a long, double, strong, and supple thong applied to the perineum, and carried behind along the spine, and in front along the collar-bone  <pb id="p.269"/>and fixed to the point from which counter-extension is made; and then force is to be so applied, by means of this extension and counter-extension, that the thong at the perineum may not pass over the head of the thigh-bone, but between it and the perineum; and during the extension one should strike the head of the femur with the fist, so as to drive it outward. And when the patient is raised up by the stretching, you should pass a hand through (<hi rend="ital">between the legs?</hi>) and grasp it with the other hand, so as at the same time to make extension, and force the dislocated limb outward; while some other person sitting by the knee quietly directs it inward. </p></div2>

						It has been formerly stated by us that it will be of importance for any person who practices medicine in a populous city to get prepared a quadrangular board, about six cubits or a little more in length, and about two cubits in breadth; a fathom will be sufficient thickness for it; and then along it from the one end to the other, an excavation must be made, so that the working of the levers may not be higher than is proper; then at both sides we are to raise short, strong, and strongly-fixed posts, having axles; and in the middle of the bench five or six long grooves are to be scooped out about four inches distant from one another, three inches will be a sufficient breadth for them, and the depth in like manner; and although the number of grooves I have mentioned will be sufficient, there is nothing to prevent their being made all over the bench. And the bench should have in its middle a pretty deep hole, of a square shape, and of about three inches in size; and into this hole, when judged necessary, is to be adjusted a corresponding piece of wood, rounded above, which, at the proper time, is to be adjusted between the perineum and the head of the thigh-bone. This upright piece of wood prevents the body from yielding to the force dragging downward by the feet; for sometimes this piece of wood serves the purpose of counter-extension upward; and sometimes, too, when extension and counter-extension are made, this piece of wood, if susceptible of some motion to this side or that, will serve the purpose of a lever for pushing the head of the thigh-bone outward. It is on this account that several grooves are scooped out on the bench,  <pb id="p.270"/>so that this piece of wood, being erected at the one which answers, may act as a lever, either on the sides of the articular heads of bones, or may make pressure direct on the heads along with the extension, according as it may suit to push inward or outward with the lever; and the lever may be either of a round or broad form, as may be judged proper; for sometimes the one form and sometimes the other suits with the articulation. This mode of applying the lever along with extension is applicable in the reduction of all dislocations of the thigh. In the case now on hand, a round lever is proper; but in dislocations outward a flat lever will be the suitable one. By means of such machines and of such powers, it appears to me that we need never fail in reducing any dislocation at a joint. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="73">
					<head>Part 73</head>
					<p>
						And one might find out other modes of reduction for this joint. If the large bench were to have raised on it two posts about a foot (<hi rend="ital">in diameter?</hi>), and of a suitable height, on each side near its middle, and if a transverse piece of wood like the step of a ladder, were inserted in the posts, then if the sound leg were carried through between the posts, and the injured limb were brought over the transverse piece of wood, which should be exactly adapted in height to the joint which is dislocated (and it is an easy matter so to adjust it, for the step of the ladder should be made a little higher than required, and a convenient robe, folded several times, is to be laid below the patient's body), then a piece of wood, of suitable breadth and length, is to be laid below the limb, and it should reach from the ankle to beyond the head of the thigh-bone, and should be bound moderately tight to the limb. Then the limb being extended, either by means of the pestle-like piece of wood (formerly described), or by any of the other methods of extension, the limb which is carried over the step with the piece of wood attached to it, is to be forced downward, while somebody grasps the patient above the hip-joint. In this manner the extension will carry the head of the thighbone above the acetabulum, while the lever power that is exercised will push the head of the thigh-bone into its natural seat. All the above-mentioned powers are strong, and more than sufficient to rectify the accident, if properly and skill-<pb id="p.271"/>fully applied. For, as formerly stated, in most cases reduction may be effected by much weaker extension, and an inferior apparatus. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="74">

						If the head of the bone slip outward, extension and counter-extension must be made as described, or in a similar manner. But along with the extension a broad lever is to be used to force the bone from without inward, the lever being placed at the nates or a little farther up, and some person is to steady the patient's body, so that it may not yield, either by grasping him at the buttocks with his hands, or this may be effected by means of another similar lever, adjusted to one of the grooves, while the patient has something laid below him, and he is secured, and the dislocated thigh is to be turned gently from within outward at the knee. Suspension will not answer in this form of dislocation, for, in this instance, the arm of the person suspended from him, would push the head of the thigh-bone from the acetabulum. But one might use the piece of wood placed below him as a lever, in such a manner as might suit with this mode of dislocation; it must work from without. But what use is there for more words? For if the extension be well and properly done, and if the lever be properly used, what dislocation of the joint could occur, that might not be thus reduced?  </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="75">
					<head>Part 75</head>
					<p>
						In dislocation of the thigh, backward, extension and counter-extension should be made as has been described; and having laid on the bench a cloth which has been folded several times, so that the patient may lie soft, he is to be laid on his face, and extension thus made, and, along with the extension, pressure is to be made with a board, as in the case of humpback, the board being placed on the region of the nates, and rather below than above the hip-joint; and the hole made in the wall for the board should not be direct over, but should be inclined a little downward, toward the feet. This mode of reduction is particularly appropriate to this variety of dislocation, and at the same time is very strong. But perhaps, instead of the board, it might be sufficient to have a person sitting (<hi rend="ital">on the seat of luxation?</hi>), or pressing with his hands, or with his foot, and suddenly raising himself up, along with the extension. None of the other afore-<pb id="p.272"/>mentioned modes of reduction are natural in this form of dislocation. </p></div2> <div2 type="section" n="76">
							<head>Part 76</head>
							<p>
								In dislocation forward, the same mode of extension should be made; but a person who has very strong hands, and is well trained, should place the palm of the one hand on the groin, and taking hold of this hand with the other, is at the same time to push the dislocated part downward, and at the same time to the fore part of the knee. This method of reduction is most especially conformable to this mode of dislocation. And the mode of suspension is also not far removed from being natural, but the person suspended should be well trained, so that his arm may not act as a lever upon the joint, but that the force of the suspension may act about the middle of the perineum, and at the os sacrum. </p></div2>

						Reduction by the bladder is also celebrated in dislocations at this joint, and I have seen certain persons who, from ignorance, attempted to reduce both dislocations outward and backward therewith, not knowing that they were rather displacing than replacing the parts; it is clear, however, that he who first invented this method intended it for dislocation inward. It is proper, then, to know how the bladder should be used, if it is to be used, and it should be understood that many other methods are more powerful than it. The bladder should be placed between the thighs uninflated, so that it may be carried as far up the perineum as possible, and the thighs beginning at the patella are to be bound together with a swathe, as far up as the middle of the thigh, and then a brass pipe is to be introduced into one of the loose feet of the bladder, and air forced into it, the patient is to lie on his side with the injured limb uppermost. This, then, is the preparation; some, however, do the thing worse than as I have described, for they do not bind the thighs together to any extent, but only at the knees, neither do they make extension, whereas extension should be made, and yet some people by having the good fortune to meet with a favorable case, have succeeded in making reduction. But it is not a convenient method of applying force, for the bladder, when inflated, does not present its most prominent part to the articular extremity of the femur, which is the place <pb id="p.273"/>that ought to be more especially pressed outward, but its middle, which probably corresponds with the middle of the thigh, or still lower down, for the thighs are naturally curved, being fleshy, and in contact above, and becoming smaller downward, so that the natural configuration of the parts forces the bladder from the most proper place. And if a small bladder be introduced, its power will be small, and unable to overcome the resistance of the articular bone. But if the bladder must be used, the thighs are to be bound together to a considerable extent, and the bladder is to be inflated along with the extension of the body, and in this method of reduction both legs are to be bound together at their extremity. </p></div2>

						The prime object of the physician in the whole art of medicine should be to cure that which is diseased; and if this can be accomplished in various ways, the least troublesome should be selected; for this is more becoming a good man, and one well skilled in the art, who does not covet popular coin of base alloy. With regard to the subject now on hand, the following are domestic means of making extension of the body, so that it is easy to choose from among the things at hand:-In the first place, when soft and supple thongs are not at hand for ligatures, either iron chains, or cords, or cables of ships, are to be wrapped round with scarfs or pieces of woolen rags, especially at the parts of them which are to be applied, and in this state they are to be used as bands. In the second place, the patient is to be comfortably laid on the strongest and largest couch that is at hand, and the feet of the couch, either those at the (<hi rend="ital">patient's?</hi>) head, or those at the feet, are to be fastened to the threshold, either within or without, as is most suitable; and a square piece of wood is to be laid across, and extending from the one foot to the other; and if this piece of wood be slender, it should be bound to the feet of the couch, but, not withstanding, if it be thick, there will be no necessity for this; then the heads of the ligatures, both of those at the head and those at the feet, are to be fastened to a pestle, or some such piece of wood, difficult to reduce at either end; the ligatures should run along the line of the body, or be a little elevated above it, and it should be stretched proportionally to the pestles, so that, standing erect, the one may be <pb id="p.274"/>fastened to the threshold, and the other to the transverse piece of wood. Extension is then to be made by bending back the ends of the pestles. A ladder, having strong steps, if laid below the bed, will serve the purpose of the threshold and the piece of wood laid along (<hi rend="ital">the foot of the couch?</hi>), as the pestles can be fastened to the steps at either end, and when drawn back they thus make extension of the ligatures. Dislocation, inward or forward, may be reduced in the following manner: a ladder is to be fastened in the ground, and the man is to be seated upon it, and then the sound leg is to be gently stretched along and bound to it, wherever it is found convenient; and water is to be poured into an earthen vessel, or stones put into a hamper and slung from the injured leg, so as to effect the reduction. Another mode of reduction: a cross-beam is to be fastened between two pillars of moderate height; and at one part of the cross-beam there should be a protuberance proportionate to the size of the nates; and having bound a coverlet round the patient's breast, he is to be seated on the protuberant part of the cross-beam, and afterward the breast is to be fastened to the pillar by some broad ligature; then some one is to hold the sound leg so that he may not fall off, and from the injured limb is to be suspended some convenient weight, as formerly described. </p></div2>

						It should be particularly known that the union of all bones is, for the most part, by a head and socket (<hi rend="ital">cotyle</hi>); in some of these the place (<hi rend="ital">socket?</hi>) is cotyloid and oblong, and in some the socket is glenoid (<hi rend="ital">shallow?</hi>). In all dislocations reduction is to be effected, if possible, immediately, while still warm, but otherwise, as quickly as it can be done; for reduction will be a much easier and quicker process to the operator, and a much less painful one to the patient, if effected before swelling comes on. But all the joints when about to be reduced should be first softened, and gently moved about; for, thus they are more easily reduced. And, in all cases of reduction at joints, the patient must be put on a spare diet, but more especially in the case of the greatest joints, and those most difficult to reduce, and less so in those which are very small and easily reduced. </p></div2>

						If any joint of the fingers is dislocated, whether the first, <pb id="p.275"/>second, or the third, the same method of reduction is to be applied, but the largest joints are the most difficult to reduce. There are four modes of displacement-either upward, downward, or to either side; most commonly upward, and most rarely laterally, and in consequence of violent motion. On both sides of its articular cavity there is a sort of raised border. When the dislocation is upward or downward, owing to the articular cavity having smoother edges there than at the sides, if the joint of it be dislocated, it is more easily reduced. This is the mode of reduction:-The end of the finger is to be wrapped round with a fillet, or something such, that, when you lay hold of it and make extension, it will not slip; and when this is done, some person is to grasp the arm at the wrist, and another is to take hold of the finger which is wrapped in the fillet, and then each is to make considerable extension toward himself, and at the same time the projecting bone is to be pushed into its place. But, if the dislocation be lateral, the same mode of reduction is to be used; but when you think that the extremity of the bone has cleared the rim, at the same time that extension is made, the bone is to be pushed direct into its place, while another person on the other side of the finger is to take care and make counter-pressure, so that it may not again slip out there. The twisted nooses formed from palm-shoots are convenient for effecting reduction, if you will make extension and counter-extension by holding the twisted string in the one hand and the wrist in the other. When reduced, you must bind the part as quickly as possible with bandages; these are to be very slender and waxed with cerate, neither very soft nor very hard, but of middle consistence; for that which is hard drops off from the finger, while that which is soft and liquid is melted and lost by the increased heat of the finger. The bandage is to be loosed on the third or fourth day; but on the whole, if inflamed, it is to be the more frequently loosed, and if otherwise, more rarely; this I say respecting all the joints. The articulation of a finger is restored in fourteen days. The treatment of the fingers and of the toes is the same. </p></div2>

						After all reductions of joints the patient should be confined to a restricted diet and abstinence until the seventh day; <pb id="p.276"/>and if there be inflammation, the bandages are to be the more frequently loosed, but otherwise, less frequently, and the pained joint is to be kept constantly in a state of rest, and is to be laid in the most convenient position possible. </p></div2>

						Accidents at the knee are more mild than at the elbow, from its being compact, regular, and elegant in its construction; and, therefore, it is more readily dislocated and reduced. It is most frequently dislocated inward, but also outward and backward. The modes of reduction are these: by flexion at the knee, or by sudden calcitration, or having rolled a swathe into a ball, and fixed it in the ham, the patient's body is to be suddenly dropped on its bended knees. Dislocation backward, also, as in the case of the elbow, may be reduced by moderate extension, and to either side, either by flexion or calcitration, but also by moderate extension. The adjustment is the same in all cases. In dislocations backward which are not reduced, the patient cannot bend the joint, but neither can he, to any great extent, in the other varieties; the thigh and leg are wasted in front; but if inward the patients become bow-legged, and the external parts are wasted; but if outward they become more bandy-legged, but the impediment is less, for the body is supported on the larger of the bones, and the inner parts are wasted. When these accidents happen at birth or during adolescence, they follow the rule formerly stated.</p></div2>

						When persons jumping from a height pitch on the heel, so as to occasion separation (<hi rend="ital">diastasis</hi>) of the bones, ecchymosis of the veins, and contusion of the nerves; when these symptoms are very violent there is danger of sphacelus, and that the case may give trouble during life, for the bones are so constructed as <pb id="p.277"/>to slip from one another, and the nerves communicate together. And, indeed, in cases of fracture, either from an injury in the leg or thigh, or in paralysis of the nerves (<hi rend="ital">tendons?</hi>) connected with these parts, or from neglect during confinement to bed, when the heel gets blackened the most serious consequences result therefrom. Sometimes, in addition to the sphacelus, there come on acute fevers accompanied with hiccup, aberration of intellect, and speedy death, with lividities of the large blood-vessels. With regard to the symptoms attending exacerbations, if the ecchymosed and blackened parts and those around be somewhat hard and red, and if along with the hardness there be lividity, mortification is to be apprehended; but if the parts be slightly livid, or even very livid, and the swelling diffused, or if greenish and soft, these appearances, in such cases, are all favorable. The treatment, if no fever be present, consists in the administration of hellebore, but otherwise (it is not to be given, but <hi rend="ital">oxyglyky</hi> (<hi rend="ital">decoction of honeycombs and vinegar</hi>) is to be given for drink, if required. Bandaging as in the other articulations: above all, more especially in contusions, the bandages should be numerous and softer than usual, but the compression should be less; most turns should be made around the heel. Position, like the bandaging, should be so regulated as not to determine to the heel. Splints are not to be used. </p></div2>

						When the foot is dislocated, either alone or along with its epiphysis, the displacement is, for the most part, to the inside. If not reduced, in the course of time, the hip, the thigh, and the side of the leg opposite the dislocation, become atrophied. Reduction is the same as in the wrist, but the extension requires to be very powerful. Treatment, agreeably to the general rule for joints. Exacerbations do occur, but less frequently than in dislocations at the wrist, provided the parts get rest. While they remain at rest the diet should be restricted. Those which occur at birth, or during adolescence, follow the rule formerly stated.<pb id="p.278"/></p></div2></div1>

						With regard to the construction of bones<note>The brief description of the bones given in this paragraph is evidently condensed from a larger work on the subject.  A considerable portion of the matter which is found here in an abridged form, is taken from the preceding treatises, On Fractures and On the Articulations, but not the whole of it.</note>, the bones and joints of
						the fingers are simple, the bones of the hand and foot are numerous,
						and articulated in various ways; the uppermost are the largest; the
						heel consists of one bone which is seen to project outward, and the
						back tendons are attached to it. The leg consists of two bones, united
						together above and below, but slightly separated in the middle; the
						external bone (<hi rend="ital">fibula</hi>), where it comes into proximity with the little
						toe, is but slightly smaller than the other, more so where they are
						separated, and at the knee, the outer hamstring arises from it<note>The tendon of the biceps.</note>; these
						bones have a common epiphysis below, with which the foot is moved,
						and another epiphys is above<note>It will be here perceived that by epiphysis is merely meant a close union of the two bones by means of a ligament.  Ther term in this paragraph is not always used in this sense. Strictly speaking, its signification would appear to be a protuberance of a bone.  It is applied to the malleoli, to the head of the tibia, to the head and neck of the femur, to the spinous processes of the vertebrae, to the upper and lower extremities of the humerus and to the lower extremity of the radius.</note> in which is moved the articular extremity
						of the femur, which is simple and light in proportion to its length,
						in the form of a condyle, and having the patella (connected with it?),
						the femur itself bends outward and forward; its head is a round epiphysis
						which gives origin to ligament inserted in the acetabulum of the hip-joint<note>Allusion is evidently made to the ligamentum teres.</note>.
						This bone is articulated somewhat obliquely, but less so than the
						<pb id="p.279"/>humerus. The ischium is united to the great vertebra contiguous to
						the os sacrum by a cartilaginous ligament<note>It will readily perceived that the term ischium is not used here exactly as applied by modern anatomists. It is applied in this place to the ilium where it is articulated with the os sacrum. By the great verebra, as stated in the preceding work, is meant the last vertebra of the loins.</note>. The spine, from the os
						sacrum to the great vertebra, is curved backward; in this quarter
						are situated the bladder, the organs of generation, and the inclined
						portion of the rectum; from this to the diaphragm it proceeds in a
						straight line inclining forward, and the psoae are situated there;
						from this point, to the great vertebra above the tops of the shoulders,
						it rises in a line that is curved backward, and the curvature appears
						greater than it is in reality, for the posterior processes of the
						spine are there highest; the articulation of the neck inclines forward.
						The vertebrae on the inside<note>Meaning before, that is to say, at their anterior part.</note> are regularly placed upon one another,
						but behind they are connected by a cartilaginous ligament; they are
						articulated in the form of synarthrosis at the back part of the spinal
						marrow; behind they have a sharp process having a cartilaginous epiphysis,
						whence proceeds the roots of nerves running downward, as also muscles
						extending from the neck to the loins, and filling the space between
						the ribs and the spine. The ribs are connected to all the intervertebral
						spaces on the inside, from the neck to the lumbar region, by a small
						ligament, and before to the sternum, their extremities being spongy
						and soft; their form is the most arched in man of all animals; for
						in this part, man is, of all animals, the narrowest in proportion
						to his bulk. The ribs are united to each vertebra by a small ligament
						at the place from which the short and broad lateral processes (<hi rend="ital">transverse
							processes?</hi>) arise. The sternum is one continuous bone, having lateral
						pits for the insertion of the ribs; it is of a spongy and cartilaginous
						structure. The clavicles are rounded in front, having some slight
						movements at the sternum, but more free at the acromion. The acromion,
						in man, arises from the scapula differently from most other animals.
						The scapula is cartilaginous toward the spine, and spongy elsewhere,
						having an irregular figure externally; <pb id="p.280"/>its neck and articular cavity
						cartilaginous; it does not interfere with the movements of the ribs,
						and is free of all connection with the other bones, except the humerus.
						The head of the humerus is articulated with its (<hi rend="ital">glenoid?</hi>) cavity,
						by means of a small ligament, and it consists of a rounded epiphysis
						composed of spongy cartilage, the humerus itself is bent outward and
						forward, and it is articulated with its (<hi rend="ital">glenoid?</hi>) cavity by its side,
						and not in a straight line. At the elbow it is broad, and has condyles
						and cavities, and is of a solid consistence; behind it is a cavity
						in which the coronoid process (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) of the ulna is lodged,
						when the arm is extended; here, too, is inserted the benumbling nerve,
						which arises from between the two bones of the forearm at their junction,
						and terminates there.

						When the nose is fractured, the parts should be modeled instantly,
						if possible. If the fracture be in its cartilaginous part, introduce
						into the nostrils a tent formed of caddis, inclosed in the outer skin
						of a Carthaginian hide, or anything else which does not irritate;
						the skin is to be glued to the parts displaced, which are to be thus
						rectified. Bandaging in this case does mischief. The treatment is
						to consist of flour with manna, or of sulphur with cerate. You will
						immediately adjust the fragments, and afterward retain them in place
						with your fingers introduced into the nostrils, and turning the parts
						into place; then the Carthaginian skin is to be used. Callius forms
						even when there is a wound; and the same things are to be done, even
						when there is to be exfoliation of the bones, for this is not of a
						serious nature. </p></div2>

						In fractures of the ears, neither bandages nor cataplasms should be
						used; or, if any bandage be used, it should be put on very tight;
						the cerate and sulphur should be applied to agglutinate the bandages.
						When matter forms in the ears, it is found to be more deeply seated
						than might be supposed, for all parts that are pulpy, and consist
						of juicy flesh, prove deceptious in such a case. But no harm will
						result from making an opening, for the parts are lean, watery, and
						full of mucus. No mention is here made of the places and circumstances
						which render it fatal to make an opening. The cure is soonest effected
						by <pb id="p.281"/>transfixing the ear with a cautery; but the ear is maimed and diminished
						in size, if burned across. If opened, one of the gentle medicines
						for flesh wounds should be used as a dressing. </p></div2>

						The jaw-bone is often slightly displaced (<hi rend="ital">subluxated?</hi>), and is restored
						again; it is dislocated but rarely, especially in gaping; in fact,
						the bone is never dislocated unless it slips while the mouth is opened
						wide. It slips, however, the more readily from its ligaments being
						oblique, supple, and of a yielding nature. The symptoms are: the lower
						jaw protrudes, it is distorted to the side opposite the dislocation,
						and the patient cannot shut his mouth; when both sides are dislocated,
						the jaw projects more, the mouth can be less shut, but there is no
						distortion; this is shown by the rows of the teeth in the upper and
						lower jaw corresponding with one another. If, then, both sides be
						dislocated, and not immediately reduced, the patient for the most
						part dies on the tenth day, with symptoms of continued fever, stupor,
						and coma, for the muscles there induce such effects; there is disorder
						of the bowels attended with scanty and unmixed dejection; and the
						vomitings, if any, are of the same character. The other variety is
						less troublesome. The method of reduction is the same in both:-The
						patient being laid down or seated, the physician is to take hold of
						his head, and grasping both sides of the jaw-bone with both hands,
						within and without, he must perform three manoeuvres at once,-rectify
						the position of the jaw, push it backward, and shut the mouth. The
						treatment should consist of soothing applications, position, and applying
						a suitable bandage to support the jaw-bone, so as to cooperate with
						the reduction.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="5">

						The bone of the shoulder is dislocated downward. I have never heard
						of any other mode. The parts put on the appearance of dislocation
						forward, when the flesh about the joint is wasted during consumption,
						as also seems to be the case with cattle when in a state of leanness
						after winter. Those persons are most liable to dislocations who are
						thin, slender, and have humidities about their joints without inflammation,
						for it knits the joints. Those who attempt to reduce and rectify dislocations
						in oxen, commit a blunder, as forgetting that the symptoms arise from
						the manner in which the ox uses the limb, and that the appearance
						<pb id="p.282"/>is the same in a man who is in a similar condition, and forgetting
						also that Homer has said, that oxen are most lean at that season.
						In this dislocation, then, when not reduced, the patient cannot perform
						any of those acts which others do, by raising the arm from the side.
						I have thus stated who are the persons most subject to this dislocation,
						and how they are affected. In congenital dislocations the nearest
						bones are most shortened, as is the case with persons who are <hi rend="ital">weasel-armed</hi>;
						the fore-arm less so, and the hand still less; the bones above are
						not affected. And the parts (near the seat of the injury) are most
						wasted in flesh; and this happens more especially on the side of the
						arm opposite the dislocation, and that during adolescence, yet in
						a somewhat less degree than in congenital cases. The deep-seated suppurations
						occur most frequently to new-born infants about the joint of the shoulder,
						and these produce the same consequences as dislocations. In adults,
						the bones are not so diminished in size, and justly, seeing that the
						others will not increase as in the former case; but wasting of the
						flesh takes place, for it is increased, and is diminished every day,
						and at all ages. And attention should be paid to the force of habit,
						and to the symptom produced by the tearing away of the acromion, whereby
						a void is left, which makes people suppose that the humerus is dislocated.
						The head of the humerus is felt in the armpit, and the patient cannot
						raise his arm, nor swing it to this side and that, as formerly. The
						other shoulder shows the difference. Modes of reduction:-The patient
						himself having placed his fist in the arm pit, pushes up the head
						of the humerus with it, and brings the hand forward to the breast.
						Another:-Force it backward, so that you may turn it round. Another:-Apply
						your head to the acromion, and your hands to the armpit, separate
						the head of the humerus (<hi rend="ital">from the side?</hi>), and push the elbow in the
						opposite direction; or, instead of your knees, another person may
						turn aside the elbow, as formerly directed. Or, place the patient
						on your shoulder, with the shoulder in his armpit. Or, with the heel,
						something being introduced to fill up the hollow of the armpit, and
						using the right foot to the right shoulder. Or, with a pestle. Or,
						with the step of a ladder. Or, by rotation made with piece of wood
						stretched <pb id="p.283"/>below the arm. Treatment:-As to attitude, the arm placed
						by the side, the hand and shoulder raised; the bandaging and adjustment
						of the parts while in this attitude. If not reduced, the top of the
						shoulder becomes attenuated. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>Part 6</head>
					<p>
						When the acromion is torn away, the appearance is the same as in dislocation
						of the shoulder; but there is no impediment, except that the bone
						does not return to its position. The figure should be the same as
						in dislocation, both as regards bandaging and suspending the limb.
						The bandaging according to rule. </p></div2>

						When partial displacement (<hi rend="ital">sub-luxation?</hi>) takes place at the elbow,
						either inside or outside, but the sharp point (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) remains
						in the cavity of the humerus, make extension in a straight line, and
						push the projecting parts backward and to the sides.</p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>Part 8</head>
					<p>
						In complete dislocations to either side, make extension while the
						arm is in the position it is put in to be bandaged for a fracture,
						for thus the rounded part of the elbow will not form an obstacle to
						it. Dislocation most commonly takes place inward. The parts are to
						be adjusted by separating the bones as much as possible, so that the
						end of the humerus may not come in contact with the olecranon, but
						it is to be carried up and turned round, and not forced in a straight
						line; at the same time the opposite sides are to be pushed together,
						and the bones reduced to their place. In these cases rotation of the
						elbow cooperates; that is to say, turning the arm into a state of
						supination and pronation; so much for the reduction. With regard to
						the attitude in which it is to be put,-the hand is to be placed somewhat
						higher than the elbow, and the arm by the side; this position suits
						with it when slung from the neck, is easily borne, is its natural
						position, and one adapted for ordinary purposes, unless callus form
						improperly: the callus soon forms. Treatment:-By bandages according
						to the common rule for articulations, and the point of the elbow is
						to be included in the bandage. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="9">

						The elbow, when luxated, induces the most serious consequences, fevers,
						pain, nausea, vomiting of pure bile; and this especially in dislocations
						backward, from pressure on the nerve which occasions numbness; next
						to it is dislocation forward. <pb id="p.284"/>The treatment is the same. The reduction
						of dislocation backward is by extension and adaptation: the symptom
						of this variety, loss of the power of extension; of dislocation forward,
						loss of the power of flexion. In it a hard ball is to be placed in
						the bend of the elbow, and the fore-arm is to be bent over this while
						sudden extension is made.</p></div2>

						Diastasis of the bones may be recognized by examining the part where

						In these cases callus is speedily formed. In congenital dislocations,
						the bones below the seat of the injury are shorter than natural; in
						this case, the greatest shortening is in the nearest, namely, those
						of the fore-arm; second, those of the hand; third, those of the fingers.
						The arm and shoulders are stronger, owing to the nourishment which
						they receive, and the other arm, from the additional work it has to
						perform, is still more strong. The wasting of the flesh, if the dislocation
						was outward, is on the inside; or if otherwise, on the side opposite
						the dislocation. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="12">
					<head>Part 12</head>
					<p>
						In dislocation at the elbow, whether outward or inward, extension
						is to be made with the fore-arm at right angles to the arm; the arm
						is to be suspended by a shawl passed through the armpit, and a weight
						is to be attached to the extremity of the elbow; or force is to be
						applied with the hands. The articular extremity being properly raised,
						the parts are to be adjusted with the palms of the hands, as in dislocations
						of the hands. It is to be bandaged, suspended in a sling, and placed,
						while in this attitude. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="13">
					<head>Part 13</head>
					<p>
						Dislocations backward are to be rectified with the palms of the hands
						along with sudden extension. These two acts are to be performed together,
						as in other cases of the kind. In dislocation forward, the arm is
						to bend around a ball of cloth, of proper size, and at the same time
						replaced. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="14">
					<head>Part 14</head>
					<p>
						If the displacement be on the other side both these operations are
						to be performed in effecting the adjustment of the arm. With regard
						to the treatment,-the position and the bandaging are the same as in
						the other cases. For all these cases may be reduced by ordinary distention. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="15">
					<head>Part 15</head>
					<p>
						With regard to the modes of reduction, some act upon the <pb id="p.285"/>principle
						of carrying the one piece of bone over the other, some by extension,
						and some by rotation: these last consist in rapidly turning the arm
						to this side and that. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="16">
					<head>Part 16</head>
					<p>
						The joint of the hand is dislocated inward or outward, but most frequently
						inward. The symptoms are easily recognized; if inward, the patient
						cannot at all bend his fingers, but if outward, he cannot extend them.
						Reduction:-By placing the fingers above a table, extension and counter-extension
						are to be made by assistance, while, with the palm of the hand or
						the heel on the projecting bone, one presses forward, and from behind,
						upon the other bone, and lays some soft substance on it; and, if the
						dislocation be above, the hand is to be turned into a state of pronation;
						or, if backward, into a state of supination. The treatment is to be
						conducted with bandages. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="17">
					<head>Part 17</head>
					<p>
						The whole hand is dislocated either inward, or outward, but especially
						inward, or to this side or that. Sometimes the epiphysis is displaced,
						and sometimes there is displacement (<hi rend="ital">diastasis</hi>) of the one bone from
						the other. Powerful extension is to be made in this case; and the
						projecting part is to be pressed upon, and counter-pressure made on
						the opposite side: both modes being performed at the same time, both
						backward and laterally, either with the hands on a table, or with
						the heel. These accidents give rise to serious consequences and deformities;
						but in time the parts get so strong as to admit of being used. The
						treatment consists of bandages comprehending the hand and forearm,
						and splints are to be applied as far as the fingers; when put in splints,
						they are to be more frequently loosed than in fractures, and more
						copious allusions of water are to be used.</p></div2>

						The symptoms of dislocation of the finger are obvious, and need not
						be described. This is the mode of reduction:-By stretching in a straight
						line, and making pressure on the projecting part, and counter-pressure,
						at the opposite side, on the other. The proper treatment consists
						in the application of bandages. When not reduced, the parts unite
						by callus outside of the joints. <pb id="p.286"/>In congenital dislocations, and in
						those which occur during bones below the dislocation are shortened,
						and the flesh is wasted principally on the side opposite to the dislocation;

						Dislocation at the hip-joint occurs in four modes, inward most frequently,
						outward next, the others of equal frequency. The symptoms:-The common,
						a comparison with the sound leg. The peculiar symptoms of dislocations
						inward; the head of the bone is felt at the perineum; the patient
						cannot bend his leg as formerly; the limb appears elongated, and to
						a great extent, unless you bring both limbs into the middle space
						between them in making a comparison of them; and the foot and the
						knee are inclined outward. If the dislocation has taken place from
						birth, or during one's growth, the thigh is shortened, the leg less
						so, and the others according to the same rule; the fleshy parts are
						atrophied, especially on the outside. Such persons are afraid to stand
						erect, and crawl along on the sound limb; or, if compelled, they walk
						with one or two staves, and bear up the affected limb; and the smaller
						the limb so much the more do they walk. If the accident happens to
						adults the bones remain of their proper size, but the flesh is wasted,
						as formerly described; the patients walk in a wriggling manner, like
						oxen; they are bent toward the flank, and the buttock on the uninjured
						side is prominent; for the uninjured limb must necessarily come below
						that it may support the body, whilst the other must be carried out
						of the way, as it cannot support the body, like those who have an
						ulcer in the foot. They poise the body by means of a staff on the
						sound side, and grasp the affected limb with the hand above the knee
						so as to carry the body in shifting from one place to another. If
						the parts below the hip-joint be used, the bones below are less atrophied,
						but the flesh more. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="21">
					<head>Part 21</head>
					<p>
						The symptoms and attitudes in dislocation outward are the opposite,
						and the knee and foot incline a little inward. When it is congenital,
						or occurs during adolescence, the bones do not grow properly; according
						to the same rule, the bone of the hip-joint is somewhat higher than
						natural, and does not grow proportionally. In those who have frequent
						dislocations outward, <pb id="p.287"/>without inflammation, the limb is of a more
						humid (flabby?) temperament than natural, like the thumb, for it is
						the part most frequently dislocated, owing to its configuration; in
						what persons the dislocation is to a greater or less extent; and in
						what persons it is more difficultly or easily produced; in what there
						is reason to hope that it can be speedily reduced, and in what not;
						and the remedy for this; and in what cases the dislocation frequently
						happens, and treatment of this. In dislocation outward from birth,
						or during adolescence, or from disease, (and it happens most frequently
						from disease, in which case there is sometimes exfoliation of the
						bone, but even where there is no exfoliation), the patients experience
						the same symptoms, but to an inferior degree to those in dislocations
						inward, if properly managed so that in walking they can put the whole
						foot to the ground and lean to either side. The younger the patient
						is, the greater care should be bestowed on him; when neglected, the
						case gets worse; when attended to, it improves; and, although there
						be atrophy in all parts of the limb, it is to a less extent. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="22">

						When there is a dislocation on both sides, the affections of the bones
						are the same; the flesh is well developed, except within, the nates
						protrude, the thighs are arched, unless there be sphacelus. If there
						be curvature of the spine above the hip-joint, the patients enjoy
						good health, but the body does not grow, with the exception of the
						head. </p></div2>

						The symptoms of dislocation backward are:-The parts before more empty,
						behind they protrude, the foot straight, flexion impossible, except
						with pain, extension least of all: in these the limb is shortened.
						They can neither extend the limb at the ham, nor at the groin, unless
						it be much raised, nor can they bend it. The uppermost joint, in most
						cases, takes the lead: this is common in joints, nerves, muscles,
						intestines, uteri, and other parts. There the bone of the hip-joint
						is carried backward to the nates, and on that account it is shortened,
						and because the patient cannot extend it. The flesh of the whole leg
						is wasted in all cases, in which most, and to what extent, has been
						already stated. Every part of the body which performs its functional
						work is strong, but, not withstanding, if inactive, it gets into a
						bad <pb id="p.288"/>condition, unless its inactivity arise from fatigue, fever, or
						inflammation. And in dislocations outward, the limb is shortened,
						because the bone is lodged in flesh which yields; but, not withstanding,
						in dislocations inward, it is longer, because the bone is lodged on
						a projecting bone. Adults, then, who have this dislocation unreduced,
						are bent at the groins in walking, and the other ham is flexed; they
						scarcely reach the ground with the ball of the foot; they grasp the
						limb with the hand, and walk without a staff if they choose; if the
						staff be too long, their foot cannot reach the grounds-if they wish
						to reach the ground, they must use a short staff. There is wasting
						of the flesh in cases attended with pain; and the inclination of the
						leg is forward, and the sound leg in proportion. In congenital cases,
						or when in adolescence, or from disease, the bone is dislocated (under
						what circumstances will be explained afterward), the limb is particularly
						impaired, owing to the nerves and joints not being exercised, and
						the knee is impaired for the reasons stated. These persons, keeping
						the limb bent, walk with one staff or two. But the sound limb is in
						good flesh from usage. </p></div2>

						In dislocations forward the symptoms are the opposite: a vacuity behind,
						a protuberance before; of all motions they can least perform flexion,
						and extension best; the foot is straight, the limb is of the proper
						length at the heel; at its extremity the foot a little turned up;
						they are especially pained at first: of all these dislocations retention
						of urine occurs most frequently in this variety, because the bone
						is lodged among important nerves. The fore parts are stretched, do
						not grow, are diseased, and are obnoxious to premature decay; the
						back parts are wrinkled. In the case of adults, they walk erect, resting
						merely on the heel, and this they do decidedly if they can take great
						steps; but they drag it along; the wasting is least of all in this
						variety of dislocation, owing to their being able to use the limb,
						but the wasting is most behind. The whole limb being straighter than
						natural they stand in need of a staff on the affected side. When the
						dislocation is congenital, or has occurred during adolescence, if
						properly managed, the patient has the use of the limb as well as adults
						(otherwise?) have of it. But, if neglected, it is shortened <pb id="p.289"/>and extended,
						for in such cases the joint is generally in a straight position. The
						diminution of the bones, and wasting of the fleshy parts, are analogous. </p></div2>

						In reduction-the extension of the thigh is to be powerful, and the
						adjustment what is common in all such cases, with the hands, or a
						board, or a lever, which, in dislocations inward, should be round,
						and in dislocations outward, flat; but it is mostly applicable in
						dislocations outward. Dislocations inward are to be remedied by means
						of bladders, extending to the bare part of the thigh, along with extension
						and binding together of the limbs. The patient may be suspended, with
						his feet a little separated from one another, and then a person inserting
						his arm within the affected limb, is to suspend himself from it, and
						perform extension and readjustment at the same time; and this method
						is sufficient in dislocations forward and the others, but least of
						all in dislocations backward. A board fastened under the limb, like
						the board fastened below the arm in dislocations at the shoulder,
						answers in dislocations inward, but less so in the other varieties.
						Along with extension you will use pressure either with the foot, the
						hand, or a board, especially in dislocations forward and backward. </p></div2> 
				<div2 type="section" n="26">

						Dislocations at the knee are of a milder character than those of the
						elbow, owing to the compactness and regularity of the joint; and hence
						it is more readily dislocated and reduced. Dislocation generally takes
						place inward, but also outward and backward. The methods of reduction
						are-by circumflexion, or by rapid excalcitration, or by rolling a
						fillet into a ball, placing it in the ham, and then letting the patient's
						body suddenly drop down on his knees: this mode applies best in dislocations
						backward. Dislocations backward, like those of the elbows, may also
						be reduced by moderate extension. Lateral dislocations may be reduced
						by circumflexion or excalcitration, or by extension (but this is most
						applicable in dislocation backward), but also by moderate extension.
						The adjustment is what is common in all. If not reduced, in dislocations
						backward, they cannot bend the leg and thigh upon one another, but
						neither can they do this in the others except to a small extent; and
						the fore parts of the thigh <pb id="p.290"/>and leg are wasted. In dislocations inward
						they are bandy-legged, and the external parts are atrophied. But,
						in dislocations outward, they incline more outward, but are less lame,
						for the body is supported on the thicker bone, and the inner parts
						are wasted. The consequences of a congenital dislocation, or one occurring
						during adolescence, are analogous to the rule formerly laid down. </p></div2>

						Persons who, in jumping from a height, have pitched on the heel, so
						as to occasion diastasis (separation) of the bones, ecchymosis of
						the veins, and contusion of the nerves,-when these symptoms are very
						violent, there is danger that the parts may sphacelate, and give trouble
						to the patient during the remainder of his life; for these bones are
						so constructed as to slip past one another, and the nerves communicate
						together. And, likewise in cases of fracture, either from an injury
						in the leg or thigh, or in paralysis of the nerves connected with
						these parts, or, when in any other case of confinement to bed the
						heel, from neglect, becomes blackened, in all these cases serious
						effects result therefrom. Sometimes, in addition to the sphacelus,
						very acute fevers supervene, attended with hiccup, tumors, aberration
						of intellect, and speedy death, along with lividity of the large bloodvessels,
						and gangrene. The symptoms of the exacerbations are these: if the
						ecchymosis, the blackened parts, and those around them, be somewhat
						hard and red, and if lividity be combined with the hardness, there
						is danger of mortification; but, not withstanding, if the parts are
						sublivid, or even very livid and diffused, or greenish and soft, these
						symptoms, in all such cases, are favorable. The treatment consists
						in the administration of hellebore, if they be free from fever, but
						otherwise, they are to have <hi rend="ital">oxyglyky</hi> for drink, if re-<pb id="p.291"/>quired. Bandaging,-agreeably
						to the rule in other joints; but this is to be attended to also,-the
						bandages should be numerous, and softer than usual; compression less;
						more water than usual to be used in the allusions; to be applied especially
						to the heel. The same object should be sought after in the position
						as in the bandaging, namely, that the humors may not be determined
						to the heel; the limb to be well laid should have the heel higher
						than the knee. Splints not to be used. </p></div2>

						When the foot is dislocated, either alone, or with the epiphysis,

						wrist; but the extension requires to be very powerful. Treatment:-Agreeably
						to the rule laid down for the other joints. Less apt to be followed
						by serious consequences than the wrist, if kept quiet. Diet restricted,
						as being in an inactive state. Those occurring at birth, or during

						With regard to slight congenital dislocations, some of them can be
						rectified, especially club-foot. There is more than one variety of
						club-foot. The treatment consists in modeling the foot like a piece
						of wax; applying resinous cerate, and numerous bandages; or a sole,
						or a piece of lead is to be bound on, but not upon the bare skin;
						the adjustment and attitudes to correspond. </p></div2>

						If the dislocated bones cause a wound in the skin, and protrude, it
						is better to let them alone, provided only they are not allowed to
						hang, nor are compressed. The treatment consists in applying pitched
						cerate, or compresses dipped in hot wine (for cold is bad in all such
						cases), and certain leaves; but in winter unwashed wool may be applied
						as a cover to the part; neither cataplasms nor bandaging; restricted
						diet. Cold, great weight, compression, violence, restricted position,
						all such are to be accounted as fatal measures. When treated moderately
						(they escape), maimed and deformed; for, if the dislocation be at
						the ankle, the foot is drawn upward, and, if elsewhere, according
						to the same rule. The bones do not readily exfoliate; for only small
						portions of them are denuded, and they heal by narrow <pb id="p.292"/>cicatrices.
						The danger is greatest in the greatest joints, and those highest up.
						The only chance of recovery is, if they are not reduced, except at
						the fingers and hand, and in these cases the danger should be announced
						beforehand. Attempts at reduction to be made on the first or second
						day; or, if not accomplished then, on the tenth, by no means on the
						fourth. Reduction by levers. Treatment:-As in injuries of the bones
						of the head, and the part is to be kept hot; and it is better to give
						hellebore immediately after the parts have been reduced. With regard
						to the other bones, it should be well known, that, if replaced, death
						will be the consequence; the more surely and expeditiously, the greater
						the articulation, and the more high its situation. Dislocation of
						the foot is attended with spasm (tetanus) and gangrene; and if, upon
						its being replaced, any of these symptoms come on, the chance of recovery,
						if there be any chance, is in displacing it anew; for spasms do not
						arise from relaxation, but from tension of the parts. </p></div2>

						Sphacelus of the fleshy parts is produced by the tight compression
						of bleeding wounds, and by pressure in the fractures of bones, and
						by blackening, arising from bandages. And in those cases in which
						a portion of the thigh or arm, both the bones and the flesh drop off,
						many recover, the case being less dangerous than many others. In cases,
						then, connected with fracture of the bones, the separation of the
						flesh quickly takes place, but the separation of the bone, at the
						boundary of its denuded part, is slower in taking place. But the parts
						below the seat of the injury, and the sound portion of the body, are
						to be previously taken away (for they die previously), taking care
						to avoid producing pain, for <hi rend="ital">deliquium animi</hi> may occasion death. The
						bone of the thigh in such a case came away on the eightieth day, but
						the leg was removed on the twentieth day. The bones of the leg, in
						a certain case, came away at the middle of the sixtieth <pb id="p.293"/>day. In these
						cases the separation is quick or slow, according to the compression
						applied by the physician. When the compression is gently applied the
						bones do not drop off at all, neither are they denuded of flesh, but
						the gangrene is confined in the more superficial parts. The treatment
						of such cases must be undertaken; for most of them are more formidable
						in appearance than in reality. The treatment should be mild, but,
						not withstanding, with a restricted diet; hemorrhages and cold are
						to be dreaded; the position, so as that the limb may be inclined upward,
						and afterward, on account of the purulent abscess, horizontally, or
						such as may suit with it. In such cases, and in mortifications, there
						are usually, about the crisis, hemorrhages and crisis, hemorrhages
						and violent diarrhoeas, which, however, only last for a few days;
						the patients do not lose their appetite, neither are they feverish,

						Displacement of the spine, if inward, threatens immediate death, attended
						with retention of urine and loss of sensibility. Outward, the accident
						is free from most of these bad effects, much more so than where there
						is merely concussion without displacement; the effects in the former
						case being confined to the spot affected, whereas in the latter they
						are further communicated to the whole body, and are of a mortal character.
						In like manner, when the ribs are fractured, whether one or more,
						provided there be no splinters, there is rarely fever, spitting of
						blood, and sphacelus, and ordinary treatment without evacuation will
						suffice, provided there be no fever;-bandaging, according to rule;
						and the callus forms in twenty days, the bone being of a porous nature.
						But in cases of contusion, tubercles form, along with cough, suppurating
						sores, and sphacelus of the ribs, for nerves from all the parts run
						along each rib. In many of these cases haemoptysis and empyema also
						take place. The management of this case consists in careful treatment,
						bandaging according to rule, diet at first restricted, but afterward
						more liberal, quiet, silence, position, bowels, and venereal matters
						regulated. Even when there is no spitting of blood, these contusions
						are more painful than fractures, and are more subject in time to relapses;
						and when any mucous collection is left in the part, it makes itself
						be felt in disorders of the body. Treatment:-burning, when the bone
						is <pb id="p.294"/>affected, down to the bone, but not touching the bone itself; if
						in the intercostal space, the burning must not extend through it,
						nor be too superficial. In sphacelus of the ribs, tents are to be
						tried, all other particulars will be stated afterward: but they should
						be learned by sight rather than by words, namely, food, drink, heat,
						cold, attitude; medicines, dry, liquid, red, dark, white, sour, for
						the ulcers, and so with regard to the diet. </p></div2>

						but of a less serious nature. Some individuals have borne this affection
						well, and have turned out to be brawny and fat. But few of them have
						lived to the age of sixty. Lateral curvatures also occur, the proximate
						cause of which is the attitudes in which these persons lie. These

						The rule for the reduction and adjustment:-The axle, the lever, the
						wedge, pressure above; the axle to separate, the lever to push aside.
						Reduction and adjustment are to be accomplished by forcible extension,
						the parts being placed in such a position as will facilitate the conveying
						of the displaced bone over the extremity of the bone from which it
						was displaced: this is to be accomplished either with the hands, or
						by suspension, or axles, or turned round something. With the hands
						this is to be effected properly, according to the structure of the
						parts. In the case of the wrist and elbow, the parts are to be forced
						asunder, at the wrist in the line of the elbow, and the elbow with
						the fore-arm at a right angle with the arm, as when it is suspended
						in a sling. When we want to separate the protruding bones, and force
						them into place, in the case of the fingers, the toes, or the wrist,
						the proper separation may be made by hands, while the projecting part
						is forced into its place by pressing down with the heel or the palm
						of the hand upon some resisting object, while something moderately
						soft is laid under the projecting part, but nothing <pb id="p.295"/>such under the
						other, and then pressure is to be made backward and downward, whether
						the dislocation be inward or outward. In lateral displacement, pressure
						and counter-pressure must be made on the opposite sides. Displacements
						forward can be reduced neither by sneezing, nor coughing, nor by the
						injection of air, nor by the cupping-instrument; and if anything can
						do good in such a case, it is extension. People are deceived in fractures
						of the spinal processes, the pain of which causing the patient to
						stoop forward, the case is taken for dislocation inward; these fractures
						heal speedily and easily. Dislocation outward is to be remedied by
						succussion, when high up, toward the feet; and when situated low down,
						in the contrary direction; the part is to be pressed back into its
						place, either with the foot or a board. Dislocations to either side,
						if they admit of any remedy, are to be treated by extension, and suitable
						attitudes, with regimen. The whole apparatus should be broad, soft,
						and strong; or otherwise, they should be wrapped in rags; before being
						used, they should all be prepared proportionately to the length, height,
						and breadth. In applying extension to the thigh, for example, the
						bands should be fastened at the ankle and above the knee, these stretching
						in the same direction, another band to be passed by the loins, and
						around the armpits, and by the perineum and thigh, one end passing
						up the breast and the other along the back, these all stretching in
						the same direction and being fastened either to a piece of wood resembling
						a pestle or to an axle. When this is done on a couch, either of its
						feet is to be fastened to the threshold, and a strong block of wood
						is to be laid across the other, and the pieces of wood resembling
						a pestle are to be raised on these, to make extension and counter-extension;
						the naves of a wheel are to be fastened in the floor, or a ladder
						is to be adjusted, so that extension may be made in both directions.
						The thing commonly used is a bench six cubits long, two cubits broad,
						one fathom in thickness, having two low axles at this end and that,
						and having at its middle two moderate sized pillars, to which is to
						be adjusted a transverse piece of wood like the step of a ladder,
						which is to receive the piece of wood tied below the limb, as is done
						in dislocation at the shoulder; and the bench is to have <pb id="p.296"/>excavations
						like trays, smooth, four inches in breadth and depth, and at such
						an interval as to leave room for the lever used to reduce the limb.
						In the middle of the bench a square hole is to be scooped out to receive
						a small pillar, which, being adjusted to the perineum, will obviate
						the tendency of the body to slip downward, and being rather loose
						may act somewhat as a lever. In certain occasions a piece of wood
						is required, which is inserted into a hole scooped out of the wall;
						the other end of it is then to be pressed down, something moderately
						soft being placed under it. </p></div2>

						bandaging:<pb id="p.297"/> preparation, presentation of the part, extension, adjustment,
						friction, bandaging, suspension and placing of the limb, attitude,
						seasons, diet. The more porous parts heal fastest, and vice versa.
						Distortions, where the bones are crooked. Flesh and tendons wasted
						on the side of the dislocation. The force used in reduction to be
						applied at as great a distance as possible from the seat of the displacement.
						Of nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>), those which are in motion and in humidity
						(<hi rend="ital">flabby?</hi>) are of a yielding nature; those that are not, less so. In
						every dislocation the most speedy reduction is best. Reduction not
						to be made while the patient is in a febrile state, nor on the fourth
						or fifth day; and least of all, in those of the elbow, and all cases
						which induce torpor; the soonest the best, provided the inflammatory
						stage be avoided. Parts torn asunder, whether nerves, or cartilages,
						or epiphyses, or parts separated at symphyses, cannot possibly be
						restored to their former state; but callus is quickly formed in most
						cases, yet the use of the limb is preserved. Of luxations, those nearest
						the extremities are least dangerous. Those joints which are most easily
						dislocated are the least subject to inflammation. Those which have
						been least inflamed, and have not been subjected to after-treatment,
						are most liable to be dislocated anew. Extension should be made in
						the position most calculated to enable the one bone to clear the extremity
						of the other, attention being paid to configuration and place. Adjustment
						to be made in the direction of the displacement; to push the displaced
						limb straight backward and sideways. Parts suddenly drawn aside are
						to be suddenly drawn back by a rotatory motion. Articulations which
						have been oftenest dislocated are the most easily reduced; the cause
						is the conformation of the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) or of the bones; of
						the ligaments that they are long and yielding; and of the bones, the
						shallowness of the articular cavity, and roundness of the head [of
						the bone that enters it]. Usage, by its friction, forms a new socket.
						The cause-the disposition, and habit, and age. A part somewhat mucous
						is not subject to inflammation. </p></div2>

						In those cases where there are wounds, either at first, or from protrusion
						of the bones; or afterwards, from pruritus, or <pb id="p.298"/>irritation; in the
						latter case you are immediately to unloose the bandages, and having
						applied pitched cerate to the wound, bandage the limb, placing the
						head of the roller upon the wound, and proceeding otherwise as if
						there were no wound in the case; for thus will the swelling be reduced
						as much as possible, and the wound will suppurate most quickly, and
						the diseased parts will separate, and when it becomes clean the wound
						will most quickly heal. Splints are not to be applied to the place,
						nor is it to be bound tight. Proceed thus when no large bones exfoliate,
						but not in the latter case, for then there is great suppuration, and
						the same treatment is not applicable, but the parts require to be
						exposed to the air on account of the abscesses. In such cases where
						the bones protrude, and whether reduced or not, bandaging is not befitting,
						but distention is to be practiced by means of rolls of cloth, made
						like those used upon shackles; one of these is to be placed at the
						ankle, and the other at the knee; they are to be flattened toward
						the leg, soft, strong, and having rings; and rods made of cornel,
						and of a proper length and thickness are to be adjusted to them, so
						as to keep the parts distended; and straps, attached to both extremities,
						are to be inserted into the rings, so that the extremities being fixed
						into the rolls, may effect distention. Treatment:-Pitched cerate,
						in a hot state; the attitudes, position of the foot and hip; regulated
						diet. The bones which have protruded through the skin are to be replaced
						the same day, or next; not on the fourth or fifth, but when the swelling
						has subsided. Reduction is to be performed with levers; when the bone
						does not present any place upon which the lever can rest, a portion
						of the part which prevents this is to be sawed off. But the denuded
						parts will drop off, and the limb become shortened. </p></div2>

						<p>When the disease is very acute, it is attended with extremely severe

						Medicine is of all the Arts the most noble; but, not withstanding,
						owing to the ignorance of those who practice it, and of those who,
						inconsiderately, form a judgment of them, it is at present far behind
						all the other arts. Their mistake appears to me to arise principally
						from this, that in the cities there is no punishment connected with
						the practice of medicine (and with it alone) except disgrace<note>In this passage it would seem to be asserted, that in the time of the writer there was no punishment of <hi rend="ital">mala praxis</hi> except the disgrace which it entailed. Many other passages in the Hippocratic treatises would lead to the inference that a more severe responsibility attached to the physciian for unfortunate practice; as we often find the practitioner warned not to have anything to do with certain cases.  Here the author of this treatise seems to regret the want of a proper medical police.</note>, and
						that does not hurt those who are familiar with it. Such persons are
						like the figures which are introduced in tragedies, for as they have

						Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge of medicine, ought to
						be possessed of the following advantages: a natural disposition; instruction;
						a favorable position for the study; early tuition; love of labor;
						leisure. First of all, a natural talent is required; for, when Nature
						opposes, everything else is in vain; but when Nature leads the way
						to what is most excellent, instruction in the art takes place, which
						the student must try to appropriate to himself by reflection, becoming
						an early pupil in a place well adapted for instruction. He must also
						bring to the task a love of labor and perseverance, so that the instruction
						taking root may bring forth proper and abundant fruits.

						Instruction in medicine is like the culture of the productions <pb id="p.332"/>of
						the earth. For our natural disposition is, as it were, the soil; the
						tenets of our teacher are, as it were, the seed; instruction in youth
						is like the planting of the seed in the ground at the proper season;
						the place where the instruction is communicated is like the food imparted
						to vegetables by the atmosphere; diligent study is like the cultivation
						of the fields; and it is time which imparts strength to all things
						and brings them to maturity. </p></div2>

						Having brought all these requisites to the study of medicine, and
						having acquired a true knowledge of it, we shall thus, in traveling
						through the cities, be esteemed physicians not only in name but in
						reality. But inexperience is a bad treasure, and a bad fund to those
						who possess it, whether in opinion or reality, being devoid of self-reliance
						and contentedness, and the nurse both of timidity and audacity. For
						timidity betrays a want of powers, and audacity a want of skill. There

				<div2 type="section" n="1">
					<head>Part 1</head>
					<p>
						We must avoid wetting all sorts of ulcers except with wine, unless
						the ulcer be situated in a joint. For, the dry is nearer to the sound,
						and the wet to the unsound, since an ulcer is wet, but a sound part
						is dry. And it is better to leave the part without a bandage unless
						a unless a cataplasm be applied. Neither do certain ulcers admit of
						cataplasms, and this is the case with the recent rather than the old,
						and with those situated in joints. A spare diet and water agree with
						all ulcers, and with the more recent rather than the older; and with
						an ulcer which either is inflamed or is about to be so; and where
						there is danger of gangrene; and with the ulcers an inflammation in
						joints; and where there is danger of convulsion; and in wounds of
						the belly; but most especially in fractures of the head and thigh,
						or any other member in which a fracture may have occurred. In the
						case of an ulcer, it is not expedient to stand; more especially if
						the ulcer be situated in the leg; but neither, also, is it proper
						to sit or walk. But quiet and rest are particularly expedient. Recent
						ulcers, both the ulcers themselves and the surrounding parts, will
						be least exposed to inflammation, if one shall bring them to a suppuration
						as expeditiously as possible, and if the matter is not prevented from
						escaping by the mouth of the sore; or, if one should restrain the
						suppuration, so that only a small and necessary quantity of pus may
						be formed, and the sore may be kept dry by a medicine which does not
						create irritation. For the part becomes inflamed when rigor and throbbing
						supervene; for ulcers then get inflamed when suppuration is about
						to form. A sore suppurates when the blood is changed and be-<pb id="p.334"/>comes heated;
						so that becoming putrid, it constitutes the pus of such ulcers. When
						you seem to require a cataplasm, it is not the ulcer itself to which
						you must apply the cataplasm, but to the surrounding parts, so that
						the pus may escape and the hardened parts may become soft. Ulcers
						formed either from the parts having been cut through by a sharp instrument,
						or excised, admit of medicaments for bloody wounds (<hi rend="ital">'enaima</hi>), and
						which will prevent suppuration by being desiccant to a certain degree.
						But, when the flesh has been contused and roughly cut by the weapon,
						it is to be so treated that it may suppurate as quickly as possible;
						for thus the inflammation is less, and it is necessary that the pieces
						of flesh which are bruised and cut should melt away by becoming putrid,
						being converted into pus, and that new flesh should then grow up.
						In every recent ulcer, except in the belly, it is expedient to cause
						blood to flow from it abundantly, and as may seem seasonable; for
						thus will the wound and the adjacent parts be less attacked with inflammation.
						And, in like manner, from old ulcers, especially if situated in the
						leg, in a toe or finger, more than in any other part of the body.
						For when the blood flows they become drier and less in size, as being
						thus dried up. It is this (<hi rend="ital"> blood?</hi>) especially which prevents such
						ulcers from healing, by getting into a state of putrefaction and corruption.
						But, it is expedient, after the flow of the blood, to bind over the
						ulcer a thick and soft piece of sponge, rather dry than wet, and to
						place above the sponge some slender leaves. Oil, and all things of
						an emollient and oily nature, disagree with such ulcers, unless they
						are getting nearly well. Neither does oil agree with wounds which
						have been recently inflicted, nor yet do medicines formed with oil
						or suet, more especially if the ulcer stands in need of more cleansing.
						And, in a word, it is in summer and in winter that we are to smear
						with oil these sores that require such medicines. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2">

						Gentle purging of the bowels agrees with most ulcers, and in wounds
						of the head, belly, or joints, where there is danger of gangrene,
						in such as require sutures, in phagedaenic, spreading and in otherwise
						inveterate ulcers. And when you want to apply a bandage, no plasters
						are to be used until you have rendered the <pb id="p.335"/>sore dry, and then indeed
						you may apply them. The ulcer is to be frequently cleaned with a sponge,
						and then a dry and clean piece of cloth is to be frequently applied
						to it, and in this way the medicine which it is supposed will agree
						with it is to be applied, either with or without a bandage. The hot
						season agrees better than winter with most ulcers, except those situated
						in the head and belly; but the equinoctial season agrees still better
						with them. Ulcers which have been properly cleansed and dried as they
						should be, do not usually get into a the state. When a bone has exfoliated,
						or has been burned, or sawed, or removed in any other way, the cicatrices
						of such ulcers become deeper than usual. Ulcers which are not cleansed,
						are not disposed to unite if brought together, nor do the lips thereof
						approximate of their own accord. When the points adjoining to an ulcer
						are inflamed, the ulcer is not disposed to heal until the inflammation
						subside, nor when the surrounding parts are blackened by mortification,
						nor when a varix occasions an overflow of blood in the part, is the
						ulcer disposed to heal, unless you bring the surrounding parts into
						a healthy condition. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>Part 3</head>
					<p>
						Circular ulcers, if somewhat hollow, you must scarify all along their
						edges, or to the extent of half the circle, according to the natural
						stature of the man. When erysipelas supervenes upon any sore, you
						must purge the body, in the way most suitable to the ulcer, either
						upward or downward. When swelling arises around an. ulcer, and if
						the ulcer remain free from inflammation, there will be a deposit of
						matter in process of time. And whatever ulcer gets swelled along with
						inflammation and does not subside as the other parts subside which
						became inflamed and swelled at the same time, there is a danger that
						such an ulcer may not unite. When from a fall, or in any other way,
						a part has been torn or bruised, and the parts surrounding the ulcer
						have become swelled, and, having suppurated, matter flows from the
						swelling by the ulcer, if in such cases a cataplasm be required, it
						should not be applied to the sore itself, but to the surrounding parts,
						so that the pus may have free exit, and the indurated parts may be
						softened. But when the parts are softened as the inflammation ceases,
						then the parts which are separated are to be <pb id="p.336"/>brought toward one another,
						binding on sponges and applying them, beginning from the sound parts
						and advancing to the ulcer by degrees. But plenty of leaves are to
						be bound above the sponge. When the parts are prevented from coming
						together by a piece of flesh full of humors, it is to be removed.
						When the ulcer is deep seated in the flesh, it is swelled up, both
						from the bandaging and the compression. Such an ulcer should be cut
						up upon a director (specillum) if possible, at the proper time, so
						as to admit a free discharge of the matter, and then the proper treatment
						is to be applied as may be needed. For the most part, in every hollow
						ulcer which can be seen into which can be seen into direct without
						being any swelling present, if there be putrefaction in it, or if
						the flesh be flabby and putrid, such an ulcer, and the parts which
						surround it, will be seen to be black and somewhat livid. And of corroding
						ulcers, those which are phagedaenic, spread and corrode most powerfully,
						and, in this case, the parts surrounding the sore will have a black
						and sub-livid appearance.

					<p> Cataplasms for swellings and inflammation in the surrounding parts.
						Boiled mullein, the raw leaves of the trefoil, and the boiled leaves
						of the epipetrum, and the poley, and if the ulcer stand in need of
						cleansing, all these things also cleanse; and likewise the leaves
						of the fig-tree, and of the olive, and the horehound, all these are
						to be boiled; and more especially the chaste-tree, and the fig, and
						the olive, and the leaves of the pomegranate are to be boiled in like

						with wine, and the leaves of rue, and those of the green origany.
						With all these, linseed is to be boiled up and mixed by pounding it
						as a very fine powder. When there is danger of erysipelas seizing
						the ulcers, the leaves of woad are to be pounded and applied raw in
						a cataplasm along with linseed, or the linseed is to be moistened
						with the juice of strychnos or of woad, and applied as a cataplasm.
						When the ulcer is clean, but both it and the surrounding parts are
						inflamed, lentil is to be boiled in wine and finely triturated, and,
						being mixed with a little oil, it is to be applied as a cataplasm;
						and the leaves of the hip-tree are to be boiled in water and pounded
						in a fine powder and made into a cataplasm; and apply below a thin,
						clean<pb id="p.337"/> piece of cloth wetted in wine and oil; and when you wish to
						produce contraction, prepare the leaves of the hip-tree like the lentil,

						Having pounded the white unripe grape in a mortar of red bronze, and
						passed it through the strainer, expose it to the sun during the day,
						but remove it during the night, that it may not suffer from the dew;
						rub it constantly during the day, so that it may dry equally, and
						may contract as much virtue as possible from the bronze: let it be
						exposed to the sun for as great a length of time as till it acquire
						the thickness of honey; then put it into a bronze pot with the fresh
						honey and sweet wine, in which turpentine resin has been previously
						boiled, boil the resin in the wine until it become hard like boiled
						honey; then take out the resin and pour off the wine: there should
						be the greatest proportion of the juice of unripe grape, next of the
						wine, and third of the honey and myrrh, either the liquid (<hi rend="ital">stacte</hi>)
						or otherwise. The finest kind is to be levigated and moistened by
						having a small quantity of the same wine poured on it; and then the
						myrrh is to be boiled by itself, stirring it in the wine; and when
						it appears to have attained the proper degree of thickness, it is
						to be poured into the juice of the unripe grape; and the finest natron
						is to be toasted, and gently added to the medicine, along with a smaller
						quantity of the flowers of copper (<hi rend="ital">flos aeris</hi>) than of the natron.
						When you have mixed these things, boil for not less than three days,
						on a gentle fire made with fuel of the fig-tree or with coals, lest
						it catch fire. The applications should all be free from moisture,
						and the sores should not be wetted when this medicine is applied in
						the form of liniment. This medicine is to be used for old ulcers,
						and also for recent wounds of the glans penis, and ulcers on the head
						and ears. Another medicine for the same ulcers:-The dried gall of
						an ox, the finest honey, white wine, in which the shavings of the
						lotus have been boiled, frankincense, of myrrh an equal part, of saffron
						an equal part, the flowers of copper, in like manner of liquids, the
						greatest proportion of wine, next of honey, and least of the gall.
						Another:-Wine, a little cedar honey, of dried things, <pb id="p.338"/>the flowers
						of copper, myrrh, dried pomegranate rind. Another:-Of the roasted
						flower of copper half a drachm, of myrrh two half-drachms, of saffron
						three drachms, of honey a small quantity, to be boiled with wine.
						Another:-Of frankincense a drachm, of gall a drachm, of saffron three
						drachms; let each of these be dried and finely levigated, then, having
						mixed, triturate in a very strong sun, pouring in the juice of an
						unripe grape, until it become of a gelatinous consistence, for three
						days; then let them be allowed to macerate in an austere, dark-colored,
						fragrant wine, which is gradually poured upon them. Another:-Boil
						the roots of the holmoak in sweet white wine; and when it appears
						to be properly done, having poured off two parts of the wine, and
						of the lees of wine as free of water as possible one part; then boil,
						stirring it, so that it may not be burnt, at a gentle fire, until
						it appear to have attained the proper consistence. Another:-The other
						things are to be the same; but, not withstanding, instead of the wine,
						use the strongest white vinegar, and dip into it wool as greasy as
						can be procured, and then, moistening it with the lees of oil, boil,
						and pour in the juice of the wild fig-tree, and add Melian alum, and
						natron, and the flowers of copper, both toasted. This cleanses the
						ulcers better than the former, but the other is no less desiccant.
						Another:-Dip the wool in a very little water; and then, having added
						a third part of wine, boil until it attain the proper consistence.
						By these, recent ulcers are most speedily prevented from getting into
						a state of suppuration. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6">

					<p>
						Another:-Sprinkle on it dried wakerobin, and add the green bark of
						the fig-tree, pounding it in the juice: do this with or without wine,
						and along with honey. Another:-Boiling the shavings of lotus with
						vinegar (the vinegar should be white); then mix the lees of oil and
						raw tar-water, and use it as a liniment or wash, and bandage above.
						These things in powder prevent recent wounds from suppurating, or
						they may be used for cleansing the sore along with vinegar, or for
						sponging with wine.

						Another:-Sprinkle (<hi rend="ital">on the sore?</hi>) lead finely triturated with the recrement
						of copper; and sprinkle on it, also, the shavings of lotus, and the
						scales of copper, and alum, and chalcitis, with copper, both alone,
						and with the shavings of lotus. And other-<pb id="p.339"/>wise, when it is wanted to
						use these in a dry state, do it with the Illyrian spodos triturated
						with the shavings, and with the shavings alone. And the flowers of
						silver alone, in the finest powder; and birthwort, when scraped and
						finely pounded, may be sprinkled on the part. Another, for bloody
						sores myrrh, frankincense, galls, verdigris the roasted flower of
						copper, Egyptian alum roasted, vine flowers, grease of wool, plumbago,
						each of these things is to be diluted, in equal proportions, with
						wine like the former. And there is another preparation of the same:-The
						strongest vinegar of a white color, honey, Egyptian alum, the finest
						natron; having toasted these things gently, pour in a little gall;
						this cleanses fungous ulcers, renders them hollow, and is not pungent.
						Another:-The herb with the small leaves, which gets the name of Parthenium
						parviflorum, and is used for removing thymia (<hi rend="ital">warts?</hi>) from the glans
						penis, alum, chalcitis, a little crude Melian alum (?); sprinkle a

						fig much dried, of water two parts, of linseed not much toasted and
						finely levigated, one part. Another:-Of the dried fig, of the flower
						of copper levigated a little, and the juice of the fig. The preparation
						from dried fig:-The black chamaeleon, the dried gall of an ox, the
						other things the same. Of the powders:-Of the slender cress in a raw
						state, of horehound, of each equal parts; of the dried fig, two parts;
						of linseed, two parts; the juice of the fig. When you use any of these
						medicines, apply above it compresses wetted in vinegar, apply a sponge
						about the compresses and make a If the surrounding parts be in an
						inflamed state, apply to them any medicine which may appear suitable.

						If you wish to use a liquid application, the medicine called <hi rend="ital">caricum</hi>
						may be rubbed in, and the bandages may be applied as formerly described
						upon the same principle. The medicine is prepared of the following
						ingredients:-Of black hellebore, of <pb id="p.340"/>sandarach, of the flakes of copper,
						of lead washed, with much sulphur, arsenic, and cantharides. This
						may be compounded so as may be judged most proper, and it is to be
						diluted with oil of juniper. When enough has been rubbed in, lay aside
						the medicine, and apply boiled wakerobin in a soft state, either rubbing
						it in dry, or moistening it with honey. But if you use the caricum
						in a dry state, you must abstain from these things, and sprinkle the
						medicine on the sore. The powder from hellebore and sandarach alone
						answers. Another liquid medicine:-The herb, the leaf of which resembles
						the arum (wakerobin) in nature, but is white, downy, of the size of
						the ivy-leaf: this herb is applied with wine, or the substance which
						forms upon the branches of the ilex, when pounded with wine, is to
						be applied. Another:-The juice of the grape, the strongest vinegar,
						the flower of copper, natron, the juice of the wild fig-tree. Alum,
						the most finely levigated, is to be put into the juice of the wild
						grape, and it is to be put into a red bronze mortar and stirred in
						the sun, and removed when it appears to have attained proper consistence.
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="10">
					<head>Part 10</head>
					<p>
						These are other powders:-Black hellebore, as finely levigated as possible,
						is to be sprinkled on the sore while any humidity remains about it,
						and while it continues to spread. The bandaging is the same as when
						plasters are used. Another, in like manner:-The driest lumps of salt
						are to be put into a copper, or earthen pot, of equal size, as much
						as possible, and not large, and the finest honey, of double the size
						of the salt, as far as can be guessed, is to be poured upon the lumps
						of salt, then the vessel is to be put upon coals and allowed to sit
						there until the whole is consumed. Then, having sponged the ulcer
						and cleansed it, bandage it as before, and compress it a little more.
						Next day, wherever the medicine has not been taken in, sprinkle it
						on, press it down, and bandage. But when you wish to remove the medicine,
						pour in hot vinegar until it separate, and again do the same things,
						sponging it away, if necessary. Another corrosive powder:-Of the most
						finely-levigated misy, sprinkle upon the moist and gangrenous parts,
						and a little of the flower of copper, not altogether levigated. Another
						powder equally corrosive:-Having sponged the ulcer, burn the most
						greasy wool upon a shell  <pb id="p.341"/>placed on the fire until the whole be consumed;
						having reduced this to a fine powder, and sprinkled it on the sore,
						apply the bandage in the same manner. Another powder for the same
						ulcers:-The black chamaeleon, when prepared with the juice of the
						fig. It is to be prepared roasted, and alkanet mixed with it. Or,
						pimpernel, and Egyptian alum roasted, and sprinkle on them the Orchomenian
						powder. For spreading ulcers:-Alum, both the Egyptian roasted, and
						the Melian; but the part is to be first cleansed with roasted natron
						and sponged; and the species of alum called chalcitis roasted. It
						is to be roasted until it catch fire.

						Swellings which arise on the feet, either spontaneously or otherwise,
						when neither the swellings nor the inflammation subside under the
						use of cataplasms, and although sponges or wool, or anything else
						be bound upon the sound part; but the swelling and inflammation return
						of themselves again, an influx of blood  <pb id="p.343"/>into the veins is the cause,
						when not occasioned by a bruise. And the same story applies if this
						happen in any other part of the body. But blood is to be abstracted,
						especially the from the veins, which are the seat of the influx, if
						they be conspicuous; but if not, deeper and more numerous scarifications
						are to be made in the swellings; and whatever part you scarify, this
						is to be done with the sharpest and most slender instruments of iron.
						When you have removed the blood, you must not press hard upon the
						part with the specillum, lest you produce contusion. Bathe with vinegar,
						and do not allow a clot of blood to remain between the lips of the
						wounds, and having spread greasy wool with a medicine for bloody wounds,
						and having carded the woof and made it soft, bind it on, having wetted
						it with wine and oil. And let the scarified part be so placed that
						the determination of the blood may be upward and not downward; and
						do not wet the part at all, and let the patient be put upon a restricted
						diet and drink water. If upon loosing the bandages you find the scarifications
						inflamed, apply a cataplasm of the fruit of the chaste-tree and linseed.
						But if the scarifications become ulcerated and break into one another,
						we must be regulated by circumstances, and otherwise apply whatever
						else appears to be proper.

						When a varix is on the fore part of the leg, and is very superficial,

						of having the blood evacuated from it, such swellings are not, by
						any means, to be cut open; for, generally, large ulcers are the consequence

						When you have opened a vein and abstracted blood, and although the
						fillet be loosed the bleeding does not stop, the member, whether the
						arm or leg, is to be put into the reverse position to that from which
						the blood flows; so that the blood may flow backward, and it is to
						be allowed to remain in this position for a greater or less space
						of time. Then bind up the part while matters are so, no clots of blood
						being allowed to remain in the opening. Then having applied a double
						compress, and wetted it with wine, apply above it clean wool which
						has been smeared with  <pb id="p.344"/>oil. For, although the flow of blood be violent,
						it will be stopped in this way. If a thrombus be formed in the opening,
						it will inflame and suppurate. Venesection is to be practiced when
						the person has dined more or less freely and drunk, and when somewhat
						heated, and rather in hot weather than in cold.

						be retained in the incisions and inflammatory ulcers will arise from
						them. In all such cases the parts are to be bathed with vinegar, after
						which they are not to be wetted; neither must the person lie upon
						the scarifications, but they are to be anointed with some of the medicines
						for bloody wounds. When the cupping instrument is to be applied below

			<div1 type="text" n="Fist."><head>On Fistulae</head>
				
				<div2 type="section" n="1">
					<head>Part 1</head>
					<p>
						Fistulae are produced by contusions and tubercles, and they are also
						occasioned by rowing, on horseback, when blood accumulates in the
						nates near the anus. For, having become putrid, it spreads to the
						soft parts (the breech being of a humid nature, and the flesh in which
						it spreads being soft), until the tubercle break and corrupt below
						at the anus. When this happens, a fistula is formed, having an ichorous
						discharge, and faeces pass by it, with flatus and much and abomination.
						It is produced, then, by contusions when any of the parts about the
						anus are bruised by a blow, or a fall, or a wound, or by riding, or
						rowing, or any such cause. For blood is collected, and it, becoming
						corrupted, suppurates; and the from the the same accidents happen,
						as have been described in the case of tubercles. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2">
					<head>Part 2</head>
					<p>
						In the first place, then, when you see any such tubercle formed, you
						must cut it open while still unripe, before it suppurate and burst
						into the rectum. But if a fistula be already formed when you undertake
						the case, take a stalk of fresh garlic, and having laid the man on
						his back, and separated his thighs on both sides, push down the stalk
						as far as it will go, and thereby measure the depth of the fistula.
						Then, having bruised the root of seseli to a very fine powder, and
						poured in some water, let it macerate for four days, and, mixing the
						water with honey, let the patient drink it, fasting, to the amount
						of three cyathi, and at the same time purge away the ascarides. Those
						who are left without treatment die. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>Part 3</head>
					<p>
						In the next place, having moistened the strip of cotton cloth,  <pb id="p.346"/>with
						the juice of the great tithymallus, and sprinkling on it the flos
						aeris, roasted and triturated, and having made it into a tent equal
						in length to the fistula, and having passed a thread through the ends
						of the tent again through the stalk, and having placed the patient
						in a reclining position, and having examined the ulcerated parts of
						the rectum with a speculum, pass the stalk by it, and when it reaches
						the rectum, take hold of it and draw it out until the tent be pushed
						through, and be brought on a level above and below. When it (<hi rend="ital">the tent?</hi>)
						has been pushed inward, introduce a ball of horn into the rectum (the
						rectum having been previously smeared with Cimolian chalk), and leave
						it there, and when the patient wants to go to stool, let it be taken
						out and again replaced, and let this practice be continued for five
						days. On the sixth day let it be removed, and drawing the tent out
						of the flesh, and afterwards pounding alum and filling the ball (<hi rend="ital">pessary</hi>)
						and introducing it into the rectum, leave it until the alum melts.
						Anoint the rectum with myrrh until the parts appear to be united.
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4">
					<head>Part 4</head>
					<p>
						Another method of cure:-Taking a very slender thread of raw lint,
						and uniting it into five folds of the length of a span, and wrapping
						them round with a horse hair; then having made a director (specillum)
						of tin, with an eye at its extremity, and having passed through it
						the end of raw lint wrapped round as above described, introduce the
						director into the fistula, and, at the same time, introduce the index
						finger of the left hand <hi rend="ital">per anum;</hi> and when the director touches the
						finger, bring it out with the finger, bending the extremity of the
						director and the end of the threads in it, and the director is to
						be withdrawn, but the ends of the threads are to be knotted twice
						or thrice, and the rest of the raw threads is to be twisted around
						and fastened into a knot. Then the patient is to be told that he may
						go and attend to his matters. The rest of the treatment:-Whenever
						any part of the thread gets loose owing to the fistula becoming putrid,
						it is to be tightened and twisted every day; and should the raw thread
						rot before the fistula is eaten through, you must attach another piece
						of raw thread to the hair, pass it through, and tie it, for it was
						for this purpose that the hair was rolled round the raw lint, as it
						is not  <pb id="p.347"/>liable to rot. When the fistula has sloughed through, a soft
						sponge is to be cut into very slender pieces and applied, and then
						the flowers of copper, roasted, are to be frequently applied with
						a director; and the sponge smeared with honey is to be introduced
						with the index finger of the left hand, and pushed forward; and another
						bit of added, it is to be bound on in the same manner as in the operation
						for hemorrhoids. Next day, having loosed the bandages, the fistula
						is to be washed with hot water, and cleansed, as far as possible,
						with the finger of the left hand by means of the sponge, and again
						the flos aeris is to be applied. This is to be done for seven days,
						for generally the coat of the fistula takes that time to fistula takes
						that time to slouch through. The same mode of bandaging is to be persevered
						in afterwards, until the cure be completed. For in this way, the fistula
						being forcibly expanded by the sponge will not fill up and heal unequally,
						but it will all become whole together. During the treatment, the part
						should be bathed with plenty of warm water, and the patient kept on
						a spare diet. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5">
					<head>Part 5</head>
					<p>
						When the fistula does not get eaten through, having first examined
						it with a sound, cut down as far as it passes, and sprinkle with the
						flos aeris, and let it remain for five days. Then pour warm water
						upon it, and above lay flour mixed with water, and bind on it the
						leaves of beet. When the flos aeris comes away, and the fistulous
						sore becomes clean, cure it as before described. But if the fistula
						be in a part which does not admit of this treatment, and if it be
						deep, syringe it with the flowers of copper, and myrrh, and natron,
						diluted with urine, and introduce a piece of lead into the orifice
						of the fistula so that it may not close. Syringe the fistula by means
						of a quill attached to a bladder, so that the injection may distend
						the fistula. But it does not heal unless it be cut open.

						If the anus gets inflamed, and there is pain, fever, a frequent desire
						of going to stool without passing anything, and the anus appears to
						protrude, owing to the inflammation, and if at times strangury come
						on, this disease is formed, when phlegm, collected from the whole
						body, is determined to the rectum. Warm things are beneficial in this
						case; for these, when applied, can attenuate  <pb id="p.348"/>and dissolve the phlegm,
						and dilute the acrid and salt particles, so that the heat subsides,
						and the irritation in the rectum is removed. Wherefore it is to be
						treated thus: The patient is to be put into a hip-bath of hot water,
						and sixty grains of the grana gnidia are to be pounded and infused
						in a hemina of wine, with half a hemina of oil, and injected. This
						brings away phlegm and faeces. When the patient does not take the
						hip-bath, boil eggs in dark-colored fragrant wine, and apply to the
						anus, and spread to the anus, and spread something warm below, either
						a bladder filled with warm water, or linseed toasted and ground, and
						its meal stirred up and mixed equally with dark, fragrant wine, and
						oil, and this applied very warm as a cataplasm; or, having mixed barley
						and Egyptian alum pulverized, form into an oblong ball (<hi rend="ital">suppository?</hi>)
						and warming it gently at the fire, make it into a cataplasm, foment,
						form it into shape with the fingers, and then making it quite tepid,
						introduce it into the anus. The external parts are to be anointed
						with cerate, and a cataplasm of boiled garlic, with dark wine diluted,
						is to be applied. But if you remove these things, let him take the
						hip-bath of hot water, and having mixed together the juice of srychnos,
						the grease of a goose, swine's seam, chrysocolla, resin, and white
						wax, and then having melted in the same and mixed together, anoint
						with these things, and while the inflammation lasts, use the cataplasm
						of boiled garlic. And if by these means he be freed from the pain,
						it is enough; but if not, give him the white meconium (<hi rend="ital">Euphorbia peplus?</hi>),
						or, if not it, any other phlegmagogue medicine. While the inflammation
						lasts, the diet should be light. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>Part 7</head>
					<p>
						The strangury comes on in this way:-The bladder being heated from
						the rectum, phlegm is attracted by the heat, and by the phlegm (<hi rend="ital">inflammation?</hi>)
						the strangury is occasioned. If, then, as is frequently the case,
						it cease with the disease, well; but, not withstanding, if not, give
						any of the medicines for strangury.

				<div2 type="section" n="8">
					<head>Part 8</head>
					<p>If procidentia ani take place, having fomented the part with a soft
						sponge, and anointed it with a snail, bind the man's hands together,
						and suspend him for a short time, and the gut will return. But if
						it still prolapse, and will not remain up, fasten a girdle round his
						loins and attach a shawl behind, and having  <pb id="p.349"/>pushed up the anus, apply
						to it a soft sponge, moistened with hot water in which the shavings
						of lotus have been boiled; pour of this decoction upon the anus by
						squeezing the sponge, then, bringing the shawl below between the legs,
						fasten it at the navel. But if he wish to evacuate the bowels, let
						him do so upon a very narrow night-stool. Or, if the patient be a
						child, let him be placed on the feet of a woman, with his back reclined
						to her knees, and when the bowels are evacuated, let the legs be extended.
						In this way the anus will be the least disposed to fall out. When
						a watery and ichorous discharge flows from the rectum, wash it out
						with burnt lees of wine, and water from myrtle, and having dried maiden-hair,
						pound and sift it, and apply as a cataplasm. But if there be a discharge
						of blood, having washed with the same, and pounded chalcitis, and

						Another:-Take the root of the mandrake, especially the green (fresh)

			<div1 type="text" n="Haem."><head>On Hemorrhoids</head>
				
				<div2 type="section" n="1">
					<head>Part 1</head>
					<p>
						The disease of the hemorrhoids is formed in this way: if bile or
						phlegm be determined to the veins in the rectum, it heats the blood
						in the veins; and these veins becoming heated attract blood from the
						nearest veins, and being gorged the inside of the gut swells outwardly,
						and the heads of the veins are raised up, and being at the same time
						bruised by the faeces passing out, and injured by the blood collected
						in them, they squirt out blood, most frequently along with the faeces,
						but sometimes without faeces. It is to be cured thus: 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="2">
					<head>Part 2</head>
					<p>
						In the first place it should be known in what sort of a place they
						are formed. For cutting, excising, sewing, binding, applying putrefacient
						means to the anus,-all these appear to be very formidable things,
						and yet, after all, they are not attended with mischief. I recommend
						seven or eight small pieces of iron to be prepared, a fathom in size,
						in thickness like a thick specillum, and bent at the extremity, and
						a broad piece should be on the extremity, like a small obolus<note>I would direct the attention of my surgical readers to the form of the ancient cautery <hi rend="ital">or</hi>burning iron; it resembles a small coin, that is to say, it was a disk.  I have often thought that modern practitioners in surgery erred in making their cauteries globular, instead of making them flat disks like the ancient.</note>. Having
						on the preceding day first purged the man with medicine, on the day
						of the operation apply the cautery. Having laid him on his back, and
						placed a pillow below the breech, force out the anus as much as possible
						with the fingers, and make the irons red-hot, and burn the pile until
						it be dried up, and so as that no part may be left behind. And burn
						so as to leave none of the hemorrhoids unburnt, for <pb id="p.352"/>you should burn
						them all up. You will recognize the hemorrhoids without difficulty,
						for they project on the inside of the gut like dark-colored grapes,
						and when the anus is forced out they spurt blood. When the cautery
						is applied the patient's head and hands should be held so that he
						may not stir, but he himself should cry out, for this will make the
						rectum project the more. When you have performed the burning, boil
						lentils and tares, finely triturated in water, and apply as a cataplasm
						for five or six days. But on the seventh, cut a soft sponge into a
						very slender slice, its width should be about six inches square. Then
						a thin smooth piece of cloth, of the same size as the sponge, is to
						be smeared with honey and applied; and with the index finger of the
						left hand the middle of the sponge is to be pushed as far up as possible;
						and afterward wool is to be placed upon the sponge so that it may
						remain in the anus. And having girded the patient about the loins
						and fastened a shawl to the girdle, bring up this band from behind
						between the legs and attach it to the girdle at the navel. Then let
						the medicine which I formerly said is calculated to render the skin
						thick and strong, be bound on. These things should be kept on for
						not less than twenty days. The patient should once a day take a draught
						from flour or millet, or bran, and drink water. When the patient goes
						to stool the part should be washed with hot water. Every third day
						he should take the bath. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="3">
					<head>Part 3</head>
					<p>
						Another method of cure:-Having got the anus to protrude as much as
						possible, foment with hot water, and then cut off the extremities
						of the hemorrhoids. But this medicine should be prepared beforehand,
						as an application to the wound:-Having put urine into a bronze vessel,
						sprinkle upon the urine the flower of bronze calcined and finely triturated;
						then, when it is moistened, shake the vessel and dry in the sun. When
						it becomes dry, let it be scraped down and levigated, and apply with
						the finger to the part, and having oiled compresses, apply them, and
						bind a sponge above. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="4">
					<head>Part 4</head>
					<p>
						Another method:-There grows upon the bleeding condyloma, a protuberance
						like the fruit of the mulberry, and if the condyloma be far without,
						an envelope of flesh is adherent to it. <pb id="p.353"/>Having placed the man over
						two round stones upon his knees, examine, for you will find the parts
						near the anus between the buttocks inflated, and blood proceeding
						from within. If, then, the condyloma below the cover be of a soft
						nature, bring it away with the finger, for there is no more difficulty
						in this than in skinning a sheep, to pass the finger between the hide
						and the flesh. And this should be accomplished without the patient's
						knowledge, while he is kept in conversation. When the condyloma is
						taken off, streaks of blood necessarily flow from the whole of the
						torn part. It must be speedily washed with a decoction of galls, in
						a dry wine, and the bleeding vein will disappear along with the condyloma,
						and its cover will be replaced. The older it is, the more easy the
						cure. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="5">
					<head>Part 5</head>
					<p>
						But if the condyloma be higher up, you must examine it with the speculum,
						and you should take care not to be deceived by the speculum; for when
						expanded, it renders the condyloma level with the surrounding parts,
						but when contracted, it shows the tumor right again. It is to be removed
						by smearing it with black hellebore on the finger. Then, on the third
						day, wash it out with a dry wine. You need not be surprised that there
						is no discharge of blood when you remove the condyloma, for neither,
						if you cut off the hands or legs at the articulations will there be
						any flow of blood; but if you cut them off above or below the joints,
						you will find there hollow veins which pour out blood, and you will
						have difficulty in stopping the bleeding. In the same manner, the
						bleeding vein in the anus, if you cut it above or below the point
						of separation of the condyloma, will pour forth blood; but if you
						take away the condyloma at its junction (<hi rend="ital">with the natural parts?</hi>)
						there will be no flow of blood. If matters then be thus put to rights,
						it will be well; but otherwise burn it, taking care not to touch the
						place with the iron, but bringing it close so as to dry it up, and
						apply the flos aeris in the urine. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="6">
					<head>Part 6</head>
					<p>
						Another method of curing hemorrhoids:-You must prepare a cautery like
						the <hi rend="ital">arundo phragmites</hi>, and an iron that exactly fits is to be adapted
						to it; then the tube being introduced into the anus, the iron, red
						hot, is to be passed down it, and frequently drawn out, so that the
						part may bear the more heat, and no sore <pb id="p.354"/>may result from the heating,
						and the dried veins may heal up. But if you are neither disposed to
						burn nor excise, having first fomented with plenty hot water and turned
						out the anus, levigate myrrh, and having burnt galls and Egyptian
						alum, in the proportion of one and a half to the other things, and
						as much of melanteria; these things are all to be used in a dry state.
						The hemorrhoid will separate under the use of these medicines, like
						a piece of burnt hide. You are to proceed thus until the whole are
						removed, and a half part of burnt chalcitis does the same thing. But
						if you wish to effect the cure by suppositories, take the shell of
						the part fish a third part of plumbago, bitumen, alum, a little of
						the flos aeris, galls, a little verdigris; having poured a small quantity
						of boiled honey on these, and formed an oblong suppository, apply
						until you remove them. 
					</p></div2>
				<div2 type="section" n="7">
					<head>Part 7</head>
					<p>
						An hemorrhoid in a woman may be thus cured. Having fomented with plenty
						of hot water, boil in the water certain of the fragrant medicines,
						add pounded tamarisk, roasted litharge and galls, and pour on them
						white wine, and oil, and the grease of a goose, pounding all together.
						Give to use after fomenting. In fomenting the anus is to be made to
						protrude as much as possible.<pb id="p.355"/></p></div2></div1>
			
			<div1 type="text" n="Morb. Sacr."><head>On the Sacred Disease</head>
				<div2 type="section" n="1"><p>
					It is thus with regard to the disease called Sacred: it appears to
					me to be nowise more divine nor more sacred than other diseases, but
					has a natural cause from the originates like other affections. Men
					regard its nature and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder, because
					it is not at all like to other diseases. And this notion of its divinity
					is kept up by their inability to comprehend it, and the simplicity
					of the mode by which it is cured, for men are freed from it by purifications
					and incantations. But if it is reckoned divine because it is wonderful,
					instead of one there are many diseases which would be sacred; for,
					as I will show, there are others no less wonderful and prodigious,
					which nobody imagines to be sacred. The quotidian, tertian, and quartan
					fevers, seem to me no less sacred and divine in their origin than
					this disease, although they are not reckoned so wonderful. And I see
					men become mad and demented from no manifest cause, and at the same
					time doing many things out of place; and I have known many persons
					in sleep groaning and crying out, some in a state of suffocation,
					some jumping up and fleeing out of doors, and deprived of their reason
					until they awaken, and afterward becoming well and rational as before,
					although they be pale and weak; and this will happen not once but
					frequently. And there are many and various things of the like kind,
					which it would be tedious to state particularly. </p>
					
					<p>They who first referred this malady to the gods appear to me to have
						been just such persons as the conjurors, purificators, mountebanks,
						and charlatans now are, who give themselves out for being excessively
						religious, and as knowing more than other people. Such persons, then,
						using <pb id="p.356"/>the divinity as a pretext and screen of their own inability
						to of their own inability to afford any assistance, have given out
						that the disease is sacred, adding suitable reasons for this opinion,
						they have instituted a mode of treatment which is safe for themselves,
						namely, by applying purifications and incantations, and enforcing
						abstinence from baths and many articles of food which are unwholesome
						to men in diseases. Of sea substances, the surmullet, the blacktail,
						the mullet, and the eel; for these are the fishes most to be guarded
						against. And of fleshes, those of the goat, the stag, the sow, and
						the dog: for these are the kinds of flesh which are aptest to disorder
						the bowels. Of fowls, the cock, the turtle, and the bustard, and such
						others as are reckoned to be particularly strong. And of potherbs,
						mint, garlic, and onions; for what is acrid does not agree with a
						weak person. And they forbid to have a black robe, because black is
						expressive of death; and to sleep on a goat's skin, or to wear it,
						and to put one foot upon another, or one hand upon another; for all
						these things are held to be hindrances to the cure. All these they
						enjoin with reference to its divinity, as if possessed of more knowledge,
						and announcing beforehand other causes so that if the person should
						recover, theirs would be the honor and credit; and if he should die,
						they would have a certain defense, as if the gods, and not they, were
						to blame, seeing they had administered nothing either to eat or drink
						as medicines, nor had overheated him with baths, so as to prove the
						cause of what had happened. But I am of opinion that (if this were
						true) none of the Libyans, who live in the interior, would be free
						from this disease, since they all sleep on goats' skins, and live
						upon goats' flesh; neither have they couch, robe, nor shoe that is
						not made of goat's skin, for they have no other herds but goats and
						oxen. But if these things, when administered in food, aggravate the
						disease, and if it be cured by abstinence from them, godhead is not
						the cause at all; nor will purifications be of any avail, but it is
						the food which is beneficial and prejudicial, and the influence of
						the divinity vanishes.</p> 
					
					<p>Thus, they who try to cure these maladies in this way, appear to me
						neither to reckon them sacred nor divine. For when they are removed
						by such purifications, and this method of cure, what is to prevent
						them<pb id="p.357"/> from being brought upon men and induced by other devices similar
						to these? So that the cause is no longer divine, but human. For whoever
						is able, by purifications conjurations, to drive away such an affection,
						will be able, by other practices, to excite it; and, according to
						this view, its divine nature is entirely done away with. By such sayings
						and doings, they profess to be possessed of superior knowledge, and
						deceive mankind by enjoining lustrations and purifications upon them,
						while their discourse turns upon the divinity and the godhead. And
						yet it would appear to me that their discourse savors not of piety,
						as they suppose, but rather of impiety, and as if there were no gods,
						and that what they hold to be holy and divine, were impious and unholy.
						This I will now explain.</p>
					
					<p>For, if they profess to know how to bring down the moon, darken the
						sun, induce storms and fine weather, and rains and droughts, and make
						the sea and land unproductive, and so forth, whether they arrogate
						this power as being derived from mysteries or any other knowledge
						or consideration, they appear to me to practice impiety, and either
						to fancy that there are no gods, or, if there are, that they have
						no ability to ward off any of the greatest evils. How, then, are they
						not enemies to the gods? For if a man by magical arts and sacrifices
						will bring down the moon, and darken the sun, and induce storms, or
						fine weather, I should not believe that there was anything divine,
						but human, in these things, provided the power of the divine were
						overpowered by human knowledge and subjected to it. But perhaps it
						will be said, these things are not so, but, not withstanding, men
						being in want of the means of life, invent many and various things,
						and devise many contrivances for all other things, and for this disease,
						in every phase of the disease, assigning the cause to a god. Nor do
						they remember the same things once, but frequently. For, if they imitate
						a goat, or grind their teeth, or if their right side be convulsed,
						they say that the mother of the gods is the cause. But if they speak
						in a sharper and more intense tone, they resemble this state to a
						horse, and say that Poseidon<hi rend="ital">(Neptune)</hi> is the cause. Or if any excrement be
						passed, which is often the case, owing to the violence of the disease,
						the appellation of Enodia (<hi rend="ital">Hecate?</hi>)is adhibited;<pb id="p.358"/> or, if it be passed in smaller
						and denser masses, like bird's, it is said to be from Apollo Nomius.
						But if foam be emitted by the mouth, and the patient kick with his
						feet, Ares<hi rend="ital">(Mars)</hi> then gets the blame. But terrors which happen during the
						night, and fevers, and delirium, and jumpings out of bed, and frightful
						apparitions, and fleeing away,-all these they hold to be the plots
						of Hecate, and the invasions the and use purifications and incantations,
						and, as appears to me, make the divinity to be most wicked and most
						impious. For they purify those laboring under this disease, with the
						same sorts of blood and the other means that are used in the case
						of those who are stained with crimes, and of malefactors, or who have
						been enchanted by men, or who have done any wicked act; who ought
						to do the very reverse, namely, sacrifice and pray, and, bringing
						gifts to the temples, supplicate the gods. But now they do none of
						these things, but purify; and some of the purifications they conceal
						in the earth, and some they throw into the sea, and some they carry
						to the mountains where no one can touch or tread upon them. But these
						they ought to take to the temples and present to the god, if a god
						be the cause of the disease. Neither truly do I count it a worthy
						opinion to hold that the body of man is polluted by god, the most
						impure by the most holy; for were it defiled, or did it suffer from
						any other thing, it would be like to be purified and sanctified rather
						than polluted by god. For it is the divinity which purifies and sanctifies
						the greatest of offenses and the most wicked, and which proves our
						protection from them. And we mark out the boundaries of the temples
						and the groves of the gods, so that no one may pass them unless he
						be pure, and when we enter them we are sprinkled with holy water,
						not as being polluted, but as laying aside any other pollution which
						we formerly had. And thus it appears to me to hold, with regard to
						purifications.</p>
					
					<p>But this disease seems to me to be no more divine than others; but
						it has its nature such as other diseases have, and a cause whence
						it originates, and its nature and cause are divine only just as much
						as all others are, and it is curable no less than the others, unless
						when, the from of time, it is confirmed, and has became stronger than
						the remedies applied. Its origin is hereditary, <pb id="p.359"/>like that of other
						diseases. For if a phlegmatic person be born of a phlegmatic, and
						a bilious of a bilious, and a phthisical of a phthisical, and one
						having spleen disease, of another having disease of the spleen, what
						is to hinder it from happening that where the father and mother were
						subject to this disease, certain of their offspring should be so affected
						also? As the semen comes from all parts of the body, healthy particles
						will come from healthy parts, and unhealthy from unhealthy parts.
						And another great proof that it is in nothing more divine than other
						diseases is, that it occurs in those who are of a phlegmatic constitution,
						but does not attack the bilious. Yet, if it were more divine than
						the others, this disease ought to befall all alike, and make no distinction
						between the bilious and phlegmatic.</p> 
					
					<p>But in them, the brain is the cause of this affection, as it is of other very
						great diseases, and in what manner and from what cause it is formed,
						I will now plainly declare. The brain of man, as in all other animals,
						is double, and a thin membrane <hi rend="ital">(meninx)</hi>divides it through the middle, and
						therefore the pain is not always in the same part of the head; for
						sometimes it is situated on either side, and sometimes the whole is
						affected; and veins run toward it from all parts of the body, many
						of which are small, but two are thick, the one from the liver, and
						the other from the spleen. And it is thus with regard to the one from
						the liver: a portion of it runs downward through the parts on the
						side, near the kidneys and the psoas muscles, to the inner part of
						the thigh, and extends to the foot. It is called vena cava. The other
						runs upward by the right veins and the lungs, and divides into branches
						for the heart and the right arm. The remaining part of it rises upward
						across the clavicle to the right side of the neck, and is superficial
						so as to be seen; near the ear it is concealed, and there it divides;
						its thickest, largest, and most hollow part ends in the brain; another
						small vein goes to the right ear, another to the right eye, and another
						to the nostril. Such are the distributions of the hepatic vein. And
						a vein from the spleen is distributed on the left side, upward and
						downward, like that from the liver, but more slender and feeble.</p>
					
					<p>By these veins we draw in much spirit<hi rend="ital">(gas?)</hi>, since they are the spiracles
						of our bodies inhaling air to <pb id="p.360"/>themselves and distributing it to the
						rest of the body, and to the smaller veins, and they and afterwards
						exhale it. For the breath <hi rend="ital">(pneuma)</hi>cannot be stationary, but it passes upward
						and downward, for if stopped and intercepted, the part where it is
						stopped becomes powerless. In proof of this, when, in sitting or lying,
						the small veins are compressed, so that the breath<hi rend="ital">(pneuma)</hi> from the larger
						vein does not pass into them, the part is immediately seized with
						numbness; and it is so likewise with regard to the other veins.</p>
					
					<p>This malady, then, affects phlegmatic people, but not bilious. It
						begins to be formed while the foetus is still <hi rend="ital">in utero</hi>. For the brain,
						like the other organs, is depurated and grows before birth. If, then,
						in this purgation it be properly and moderately depurated, and neither
						more nor less than what is proper be secreted from it, the head is
						thus in the most healthy condition. If the secretion (melting) the
						from the brain be greater than natural, the person, when he grows
						up, will have his head diseased, and full of noises, and will neither
						be able to endure the sun nor cold. Or, if the melting take place
						from any one part, either from the eye or ear, or if a vein has become
						slender, that part will be deranged in proportion to the melting.
						Or, should depuration not take place, but it (<hi rend="ital">the secretion?</hi>) accumulate in
						the brain, it necessarily becomes phlegmatic. And such children as
						have an eruption of ulcers on the head, on the ears, and along the
						rest of the body, with copious discharges of saliva and mucus,-these,
						in after life, enjoy best health; for in this way the phlegm which
						ought to have been purged off in the womb, is discharged and cleared
						away, and persons so purged, for the most part, are not subject to
						attacks of this disease. But such as have had their skin free from
						eruptions, and have had no discharge of saliva or mucus, nor have
						undergone the proper purgation in the womb, these persons run the
						risk of being seized with this disease.</p>
					
					<p>But should the defluxion make its way to the heart, the person is
						seized with palpitation and asthma, the chest becomes diseased, and
						some also have curvature of the spine. For when a defluxion of cold
						phlegm takes place on the lungs and heart, the blood is chilled, and
						the veins, being violently chilled, palpitate in the lungs and heart,
						and the heart palpitates, so that <pb id="p.361"/>from this necessity asthma and orthopnoea
						supervene. For it does not receive the spirits (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) as much breath as he
						needs until the defluxion of phlegm be mastered, and being heated
						is distributed to the veins, then it ceases from its palpitation and
						difficulty of breathing, and this takes place as soon as it obtains
						an abundant supply; and this will be more slowly, provided the defluxion
						be more abundant, or if it be less, more quickly. And if the defluxions
						be more condensed, the epileptic attacks will be more frequent, but
						otherwise if it be rarer. Such are the symptoms when the defluxion
						is upon the lungs and heart; but if it be upon the bowels, the person
						is attacked with diarrhoea.</p> 
					
					<p>And if, being shut out from all these outlets, its defluxion be determined
						to the veins I have formerly mentioned, the patient loses his speech,
						and chokes, and foam issues by the mouth, the teeth are fixed, the
						hands are contracted, the eyes distorted, he becomes insensible, and
						in some cases the bowels are evacuated. And these symptoms occur sometimes
						on the left side, sometimes on the right, and sometimes in both. The
						cause of everyone of these symptoms I will now explain. The man becomes
						speechless when the phlegm, suddenly descending into the veins, shuts
						out the air, and does not admit it either to the brain or to the vena
						cava, or to the ventricles, but interrupts the inspiration. For when
						a person draws in air by the mouth and nostrils, the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>)goes first
						to the brain, then the greater part of it to the internal cavity,
						and part to the lungs, and part to the veins, and from them it is
						distributed to the other parts of the body along the veins; and whatever
						passes to the stomach cools, and does nothing more; and so also with
						regard to the lungs. But the air which enters the veins is of use
						(to the body) by entering the brain and its ventricles, and thus it
						imparts sensibility and motion to all the members, so that when the
						veins are excluded from the air by the phlegm and do not receive it,
						the man loses his speech and intellect, and the hands become powerless,
						and are contracted, the blood stopping and not being diffused, as
						it was wont; and the eyes are distorted owing to the veins being excluded
						from the air; and they palpitate; and froth from the lungs issues
						by the mouth. For when the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) does not find <pb id="p.362"/>entrance to him, he
						foams and sputters like a dying person. And the bowels are evacuated
						in consequence of the violent suffocation; and the suffocation is
						produced when the liver and stomach ascend to the diaphragm, and the
						mouth of the stomach is shut up; this takes place when the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>)
						does not enter by the mouth, as it is wont. The patient kicks with
						his feet when the air is shut up in the lungs and cannot find an outlet,
						owing to the phlegm; and rushing by the blood upward and downward,
						it occasions convulsions and pain, and therefore he kicks with his
						feet. All these symptoms he endures when the cold phlegm passes into
						the warm blood, for it congeals and stops the blood. And if the deflexion
						be copious and thick, it immediately proves fatal to him, for by its
						cold it prevails over the blood and congeals it; or, if it be less,
						it in the first place obtains the mastery, and stops the respiration;
						and then in the course of time, when it is diffused along the veins
						and mixed with much warm blood, it is thus overpowered, the veins
						receive the air, and the patient recovers his senses.</p>
					
					<p>Of little children who are seized with this disease, the greater part
						die, provided the defluxion be copious and humid, for the veins being
						slender cannot admit the phlegm, owing to its thickness and abundance;
						but the blood is cooled and congealed, and the child immediately dies.
						But if the phlegm be in small quantity, and make a defluxion into
						both the veins, or to those on either side, the children survive,
						but exhibit notable marks of the disorder; for either the mouth is
						drawn aside, or an eye, the neck, or a hand, wherever a vein being
						filled with phlegm loses its tone, and is attenuated, and the part
						of the body connected with this vein is necessarily rendered weaker
						and defective. But for the most it affords relief for a longer interval;
						for the child is no longer seized with these attacks, if once it has
						contracted this impress of the disease, in consequence of which the
						other veins are necessarily affected, and to a certain degree attenuated,
						so as just to admit the air, but no longer to permit the influx of
						phlegm. However, the parts are proportionally enfeebled whenever the
						veins are in an unhealthy state. When in striplings the defluxion
						is small and to the right side, they recover without leaving any marks
						of the disease, but there <pb id="p.363"/>is danger of its becoming habitual, and
						even increasing if not treated by suitable remedies. Thus, or very
						nearly so, is the case when it attacks children.</p> 
					
					<p>To persons of a more advanced age, it neither proves fatal, nor produces
						distortions. For their veins are (<hi rend="ital">large?</hi>) and filled with hot
						blood; and therefore the phlegm can neither prevail nor cool the blood,
						so as to coagulate it, but it is quickly overpowered and mixed with
						the blood, and thus the veins receive the air, and sensibility remains;
						and, owing to their strength, the aforesaid symptoms are less likely
						to seize them. But when this disease attacks very old people, it therefore
						proves fatal, or induces paraplegia, because the veins are empty,
						and the blood scanty, thin, and watery. When, therefore, the defluxion
						is copious, and the season winter, it proves fatal; for it chokes
						up the exhalents, and coagulates the blood if the defluxion be to
						both sides; but if to either, it merely induces paraplegia. For the
						blood being thin, cold, and scanty, cannot prevail over the but being
						itself overpowered, it is coagulated, so that those parts in which
						the blood is corrupted, lose their strength.</p> 
					
					<p>The flux is to the right rather than to the left because the veins
						there are more capacious and numerous than on the left side, for on
						the one side they spring from the liver, and on the other from the
						spleen. The defluxion and melting down take place most especially
						in the case of children in whom the head is heated either by the sun
						or by fire, or if the brain suddenly contract a rigor, and then the
						phlegm is excreted. For it is melted down by the heat and diffusion
						of the but it is excreted by the congealing and contracting of it,
						and thus a defluxion takes place. And in some this is the cause of
						the disease, and in others, when the south wind quickly succeeds to
						northern breezes, it suddenly unbinds and relaxes the brain, which
						is contracted and weak, so that there is an inundation of phlegm,
						and thus the defluxion takes place. The defluxion also takes place
						in consequence of fear, from any hidden cause, if we are the at any
						person's calling aloud, or while crying, when one cannot quickly recover
						one's breath, such as often happens to children. When any of these
						things occur, the body immediately shivers, <pb id="p.364"/>the person becoming speechless
						cannot draw his breath, but the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) stops, the brain is
						contracted, the blood stands still, and thus the excretion and defluxion
						of the phlegm take place. In children, these are the causes of the
						attack at first. But to old persons winter is most inimical. For when
						the head and brain have been heated at a great fire, and then the
						person is brought into cold and has a rigor, or when from cold he
						comes into warmth, and sits at the fire, he is apt to suffer in the
						same way, and thus he is seized in the manner described above. And
						there is much danger of the same thing occurring, if his head be exposed
						to the sun, but less so in summer, as the changes are not sudden.
						When a person has passed the twentieth year of his life, this disease
						is not apt to seize him, unless it has become habitual from childhood,
						or at least this is rarely or never the case. For the veins are filled
						with blood, and the brain consistent and firm, so that it does not
						run down into the veins, or if it do, it does not master the blood,
						which is copious and hot.</p> 
					
					<p>But when it has gained strength from one's childhood, and become habitual,
						such a person usually suffers attacks, and is seized with them in
						changes of the winds, especially in south winds, and it is difficult
						of removal. For the brain becomes more humid than natural, and is
						inundated with phlegm, so that the defluxions become more frequent,
						and the phlegm can no longer be the nor the brain be dried up, but
						it becomes wet and humid. This you may ascertain in particular, from
						beasts of the flock which are seized with this disease, and more especially
						goats, for they are most frequently attacked with it. If you will
						cut open the head, you will find the brain humid, full of sweat, and
						having a bad smell. And in this way truly you may see that it is not
						a god that injures the body, but disease. And so it is with man. For
						when the disease has prevailed for a length of time, it is no longer
						curable, as the brain is corroded by the phlegm, and melted, and what
						is melted down becomes water, and surrounds the brain externally,
						and overflows it; wherefore they are more frequently and readily seized
						with the disease. And therefore the disease is protracted, because
						the influx is thin, owing to its quantity, and is immediately overpowered
						by the blood and heated all <pb id="p.365"/>through.</p> 
					
					<p>But such persons as are habituated to the disease know beforehand
						when they are about to be seized and flee from men; if their own house
						be at hand, they run home, but if not, to a deserted place, where
						as few persons as possible will see them falling, and they immediately
						cover themselves up. This they do from shame of the affection, and
						not from fear of the divinity, as many suppose. And little children
						at first fall down wherever they may happen to be, from inexperience.
						But when they have been often seized, and feel its approach beforehand,
						they flee to their mothers, or to any other person they are acquainted
						with, from terror and dread of the affection, for being still infants
						they do not know yet what it is to be ashamed.</p> 
					
					<p>Therefore, they are attacked during changes of the winds, and especially
						south winds, then also with north winds, and afterwards also with
						the others. These are the strongest winds, and the most opposed to
						one another, both as to direction and power. For, the north wind condenses
						the air, and separates from it whatever is muddy and nebulous, and
						renders it clearer and brighter, and so in like manner also, all the
						winds which arise from the sea and other waters; for they extract
						the humidity and nebulosity from all objects, and from men themselves,
						and therefore it (the north wind) is the most wholesome of the winds.
						But the effects of the south are the very reverse. For in the first
						place it begins by melting and diffusing the condensed air, and therefore
						it does not blow strong at first, but is gentle at the commencement,
						because it is not able at once to overcome the and compacted air,
						which yet in a while it dissolves. It produces the same effects upon
						the land, the sea, the fountains, the wells, and on every production
						which contains humidity, and this, there is in all things, some more,
						some less. For all these feel the effects of this wind, and from clear
						they become cloudy, from cold, hot; from dry, moist; and whatever
						ear then vessels are placed upon the ground, filled with wine or any
						other fluid, are affected with the south wind, and undergo a change.
						And the a change. And the sun, and the moon, it renders blunter appearance
						than they naturally are. When, then, it possesses such powers over
						things so great and strong, and the <pb id="p.366"/>body is made to feel and undergo
						changes in the changes of the winds, it necessarily follows that the
						brain should be disolved and overpowered with moisture, and that the
						veins should become more relaxed by the south winds, and that by the
						north the healthiest portion of the brain should become contracted,
						while the most morbid and humid is secreted, and overflows externally,
						and that catarrhs should thus take place in the changes of these winds.
						Thus is this disease formed and prevails from those things which enter
						into and go out of the body, and it is not more difficult to understand
						or to cure than the others, neither is it more divine than other diseases.</p>
					
					<p>And men ought to know that from nothing else but (<hi rend="ital">from the brain</hi>) come joys,
						delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and
						lamentations. And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom
						and knowledge, and see and hear, and know what are foul and what are
						fair, what are bad and what are good, what are sweet, and what unsavory;
						some we discriminate by habit, and some we perceive by their utility.
						By this we distinguish objects of relish and disrelish, according
						to the seasons; and the same things do not always please us. And by
						the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors
						assail us, some by night, and some by day, and dreams and untimely
						wanderings, and cares that are not suitable, and ignorance of present
						circumstances, desuetude, and unskilfulness. All these things we endure
						from the brain, when it is not healthy, but is more hot, more cold,
						more moist, or more dry than natural, or when it suffers any other
						preternatural and unusual affection. And we become mad from humidity (<hi rend="ital">of the brain</hi>).
						For when it is more moist than natural, it is necessarily put into
						motion, and the affection being moved, neither the sight nor hearing
						can be at rest, and the tongue speaks in accordance with the sight
						and hearing.</p>
					
					<p>As long as the brain is at rest, the man enjoys his reason, but the
						depravement of the brain arises from phlegm and bile, either of which
						you may recognize in this manner: Those who are mad from phlegm are
						quiet, and do not cry out nor make a noise; but those from bile are
						vociferous, malignant, and will not be quiet, but are always doing
						something improper. If the <pb id="p.367"/>madness be constant, these are the causes
						thereof. But if terrors and fears assail, they are connected with
						derangement of the brain, and derangement is owing to its being heated.
						And it is heated by bile when it is determined to the brain along
						the bloodvessels running from the trunk; and fear is present until
						it returns again to the veins and trunk, when it ceases. He is grieved
						and troubled when the brain is unseasonably cooled and contracted
						beyond its wont. This it suffers from phlegm, and from the same affection
						the patient becomes oblivious. He calls out and screams at night when
						the brain is suddenly heated. The bilious endure this. But the phlegmatic
						are not heated, except when much blood goes to the brain, and creates
						an ebullition. Much blood passes along the aforesaid veins. But when
						the man happens to see a frightful dream and is in fear as if awake,
						then his face is in a greater glow, and the eyes are red when the
						patient is in fear. And the understanding meditates doing some mischief,
						and thus it is affected in sleep. But if, when awakened, he returns
						to himself, and the blood is again distributed along the veins, it
						ceases.</p> 
					
					<p>In these ways I am of the opinion that the brain exercises the greatest
						power in the man. This is the interpreter to us of those things which
						emanate from the air, when it (<hi rend="ital">the brain</hi>) happens to be in a sound state.
						But the air supplies sense to it. And the eyes, the ears, the tongue
						and the feet, administer such things as the brain cogitates. For in
						as much as it is supplied with air, does it impart sense to the body.
						It is the brain which is the messenger to the understanding. For when
						the man draws the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) into himself, it passes first to the brain,
						and thus the air is distributed to the rest of the body, leaving in
						the brain its acme, and whatever has sense and understanding. For
						if it passed first to the body and last to the brain, then having
						left in the flesh and veins the judgment, when it reached the brain
						it would be hot, and not at all pure, but mixed with the humidity
						from flesh and blood, so as to be no longer pure.</p> 
					
					<p>Wherefore, I say, that it is the brain which interprets the understanding.
						But the diaphragm has obtained its name (<hi rend="ital">frenes</hi>) from accident and
						usage, and not from reality or nature, for I know no power which it
						possesses, either as to <pb id="p.368"/>sense or understanding, except that when the
						man is affected with unexpected joy or sorrow, it throbs and produces
						palpitations, owing to its thinness, and as having no belly to receive
						anything good or bad that may present themselves to it, but it is
						thrown into commotion by both these, from its natural weakness. It
						then perceives beforehand none of those things which occur in the
						body, but has received its name vaguely and without any proper reason,
						like the parts about the heart, which are called auricles, but which
						contribute nothing towards hearing. Some say that we think with the
						heart, and that this is the part which is grieved, and experiences
						care. But it is not so; only it contracts like the diaphragm, and
						still more so for the same causes. For veins from all parts of the
						body run to it, and it has valves, so as to as to perceive if any
						pain or pleasurable emotion befall the man. For when grieved the body
						necessarily shudders, and is contracted, and from excessive joy it
						is affected in like manner. Wherefore the heart and the diaphragm
						are particularly sensitive, they have nothing to do, however, with
						the operations of the understanding, but of all but of all these the
						brain is the cause. Since, then, the brain, as being the primary seat
						of sense and of the spirits, perceives whatever occurs in the body,
						if any change more powerful than usual take place in the air, owing
						to the seasons, the brain becomes changed by the state of the air.
						For, on this account, the brain first perceives, because, I say, all
						the most acute, most powerful, and most deadly diseases, and those
						which are most difficult to be understood by the inexperienced, fall
						upon the brain.</p> 
					
					<p>And the disease called the Sacred arises from causes as the others,
						namely, those things which enter and quit the body, such as cold,
						the sun, and the winds, which are ever changing and are never at rest.
						And these things are divine, so that there is no necessity for making
						a distinction, and holding this disease to be more divine than the
						others, but all are divine, and all human. And each has its own peculiar
						nature and power, and none is of an ambiguous nature, or irremediable.
						And the most of them are curable by the same means as those by which
						any other thing is food to one, and injurious to another. Thus, then,
						the physician should under-<pb id="p.369"/>stand and distinguish the season of each,
						so that at one time he may attend to the nourishment and increase,
						and at another to abstraction and diminution. And in this disease
						as in all others, he must strive not to feed the disease, but endeavor
						to wear it out by administering whatever is most opposed to each disease,
						and not that which favors and is allied to it. For by that which is
						allied to it, it gains vigor and increase, but it wears out and disappears
						under the use of that which is opposed to it. But whoever is acquainted
						with such a change in men, and can render a man humid and dry, hot
						and cold by regimen, could also cure this disease, if he recognizes
						the proper season for administering his remedies, without minding
						purifications, spells, and all other illiberal practices of a like
						kind.<pb id="p.370"/></p>
