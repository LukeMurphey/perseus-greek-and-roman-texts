Ancient Greek and Roman Texts
=============================

Contains various Greek and Roman works of antiquity that were originally provided as part of the Perseus project (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/).

Purpose
-------------

This project was started after I began development on [TextCritical.net](TextCritical.net) which uses the XML documents from the [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/). I discovered that many of the of XML files from the Perseus project had problems. These problems not only affected TextCritical.net but also the Perseus project website. For example, Samuel Butler's English translation of Homer's Odyssey is missing the first few lines because the XML document is missing a milestone. From what I can tell, Tufts University doesn't host the works in a source code repository and thus makes it difficult to fix problems or monitor changes to the documents.

Therefore, I decided to upload the current works to a repository where I could fix the problems and provide them to others who may want to use them.
