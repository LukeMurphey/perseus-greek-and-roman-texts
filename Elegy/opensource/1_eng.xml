Now Callinus speaks of the Magnesians as a still prosperous people and succesful in their war against the Ephesians, while Archilochus clearly knows of their destruction when he says: &lsquo;I bewail the woes of Thasos, not of Magnesia&rsquo; from which we may judge that he comes later than Callinus. It is an earlier invasion of the Cimmerians of which Callinus speaks in the line &lsquo;Now comes upon us the army of the dastard Cimmerians,&rsquo; which he connects with the taking of Sardis.</quote> <bibl>Strabo <title>Geography</title> &lsqb;the temple of Apollo Smintheus&rsqb;</bibl></cit>

<p>and let every man cast his javelin once more as he dies. For 'tis an honourable thing and a glorious to a man to fight the foe for land and children and wedded wife; and death shall befall only when the Fates ordain it. Nay, so soon as war is mingled let each go forward spear in poise and shield before stout heart; for by no means may a man escape death, nay not if he come of immortal lineage. Oftentime, it may be, he returneth safe from the conflict of battle and the thud of spears, and the doom of death cometh upon him at home; yet such is not dear to the people nor regretted, whereas if aught happen to the other sort he is bewailed of small and great. When a brave man dieth the whole people regretteth him, and while he lives he is as good as a demigod; for in their eyes he is a tower, seeing that he doeth single-handed as good work as many together.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0243.1</bibl></cit>

<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.1"><quote><p>Tyrtaeus: &mdash;&lpar;1&rpar; Son of Archembrotus, a Laconian or a Milesian, writer of Elegy and fluteplayer, who is said to have encouraged the Lacedaemonians by his songs in their war with the Messenians, and in this way to have given them the upper hand. He is of very ancient date, being contemporary with the Seven Sages as they are called, or even before them. He flourished in the 35th Olympiad &lpar;640-37 B.C.&rpar;. He wrote for the Lacedaemonians a poem called <hi>Citizenship</hi> and
 <hi>Exhortations</hi> in Elegiac verse, as well as War-Songs, five Books. &lpar;2&rpar; The Lacedaemonians had sworn that they would take Messena or perish, and when the oracle told them to take a general from among the Athenians, took the lame poet Tyrtaeus, who put fresh heart into them and took Messena in the twentieth year of the war. They razed the city to the ground and made Helots of the prisoners.<note>cf. Hes. Mil. 67</note></p></quote> <bibl>Suidas <title>Lexicon:</title></bibl></cit>
</div3>


<div3 type="biodata">
<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.2"><quote>Ath. Let us cite in support the Athenian born who was given Lacedaemonian citizenship, Tyrtaeus, who stands without a rival in his zeal for such things, saying &lsquo;I would neither call a man to mind nor put him in my tale, no not if he were&rsquo; the richest of men nor possessed of many good things &mdash;and then he gives a pretty complete list of them &mdash;, if he did not show himself always best in war. Probably you, Cleinias, have heard these poems; of course Megillus knows them almost too well. &mdash;Meg. Yes, almost. &mdash;Clein. Yes, they have been imported into Crete from Lacedaemon; so we know them, too.</quote> <bibl>Plato <title>Laws</title> &lpar;Athenian Stranger, Megillus the Spartan, and the Cretan Cleinias&rpar;</bibl></cit>

<div3 type="biodata">
<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.3"><quote>This Tyrtaeus was an obscure Athenian, being a lame schoolmaster, thought little of at Athens. When they had come to their wits' end in fighting the Messenians, the Spartans were told by Apollo's oracle to fetch this man; he would be able to make them see what was to their advantage. Indeed the oracle bade them make him their adviser. When he arrived in Lacedaemon he became inspired, and urged them to renew the war by all and every means in his power, including the well-known line &lsquo;Messena is good to plough and good to plant.&rsquo; This then is the man mentioned by the Athenian Stranger as an example of one who counselled war.</quote> <bibl>Scholiast <title>on the passage:</title></bibl></cit>

<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.4"><quote>The Spartans were bidden by the Delphic oracle to get &lsquo;the Athenian&rsquo; for their counsellor, and accordingly sent Athens word of the answer they had received, and asked for a man to advise them what to do. Neither desiring that the Lacedaemonians should annex, with no great risk run, the richest part of the Peloponnese, nor yet willing to turn a deaf ear to the words of the God, the Athenians found the man they sought in a schoolmaster called Tyrtaeus who appeared to have little sense and was lame in one leg, and despatched him to Sparta, where he sang Elegiac verse and the Anapaestic lines<note> <hi>Lyra Graeca</hi> iii. 534</note> both privily to the government and to any he could gather to hear him.</quote> <bibl>Pausanias <title>Description of Greece</title> &lsqb;the Second Messenian War&rsqb;</bibl></cit>

<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.5"><quote>This behaviour of the Athenians is not peculiar to the case of Socrates but is found in a great many others.

But really, is it not right that the lawgiver should be the only writer to advise on what is beautiful and what is good and what is just, teaching us both what they are and how they should be practised by a people that is to be happy? &mdash;Cl. Of course it is. &mdash;Ath. And is it not more disgraceful for Homer and Tyrtaeus and the other poets to have laid down evil precepts about life and institutions in their writings, than for Lycurgus and Solon and the other men who became men of letters after they had become legislators?</quote> <bibl>Plato <title>Laws:</title></bibl></cit>

<div3 type="biodata">
<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.8"><quote>When the Spartans were about to engage the Messenians, and, having resolved to conquer or die, had inscribed each man's name on a letter-stick attached to the left hand so that his friends could recognise him when the dead were taken up for burial, Tyrtaeus, desiring to strike terror into the Messenians by letting them know what the Spartans had done, gave orders that no great heed should be taken of deserting Helots, and the watch being relaxed these deserted as they chose, and told the Messenians of the desperate valour of their enemies. Terror weakened their resistance, and it was not long before they had given the Spartans the victory.</quote> <bibl>Polyaenus <title>Stratagems:</title></bibl></cit>

<div3 type="biodata"><head><bibl>Athenaeus <title>Doctors at Dinner</title> &lsqb;the pyrrhic dance&rsqb;</bibl></head>


<p>The warlike character of the dance proves it a Spartan invention. The Lacedaemonians are a warlike people, and not only do their sons learn by rote the
 <hi>Embateria</hi> or Songs of the Battle-Charge which are also called <hi>Enoplia</hi> or Songs-under-Arms,<note>cf. <hi>Lyra Graeca,</hi> l.c.</note> but in war they themselves recite the poems of Tyrtaeus from memory and move in time to them. We are told by Philochorus that after the Spartans had defeated the Messenians by the generalship of Tyrtaeus, they made it the custom of their military expeditions that when the Paean had been sung after supper the songs of Tyrtaeus should be given one by each man, the polemarch to decide who sang the best and give the winner a prize of meat.</p>

<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.29"><quote>So great was the energy, both public and private, of the men who then inhabited Athens, that the bravest people of Greece, in their war of long ago against the Messenians, received an oracle which bade them if they would defeat their enemies to take a leader from us. Now if the God preferred a general of Athens above the two Heracleid kings who rule at Sparta, that general must have been a man of extraordinary valour. Everyone in Greece knows that the general they took from our city was Tyrtaeus, by whose aid, with a wisdom that looked far beyond the dangers of that day, they both defeated their enemies and established their system of education. Tyrtaeus left behind him Elegiac Poems which are used to teach them courage, and a people whose practice is to take no account of poets, have made so much of Tyrtaeus as to pass a law that whenever they take the field under arms they shall all be summoned to the king's tent to hear his poems, in the belief that this will make them most willing to die for their country. And it would be well for you to hear the Elegiac verses, so that you may know what it was that made men famous among them:
<cit id="tlg-0266.cit.30"><quote><p>For 'tis a fair thing for a good man to fall and die fighting in the van for his native land, whereas to leave his city and his rich fields and go a-begging is of all things the most miserable, wandering with mother dear and aged father, with little children and wedded wife. For hateful shall such an one be among all those to whom he shall come in bondage to Want and loathsome Penury, and doth shame his lineage and belie his noble beauty, followed by all evil and dishonour. Now if so little thought be taken of a wanderer, and so little honour, respect, or pity, let us fight with a will for this land, and die for our children and never spare our lives.</p>

<p>Abide then, O young men, shoulder to shoulder and fight; begin not foul flight nor yet be afraid, but make the heart in your breasts both great and stout, and never shrink when you fight the foe.<note>cf. <hi>Il.</hi> 9. 327</note> And the elder sort, whose knees are no longer nimble, fly not ye to leave them fallen to earth.<note>reading doubtful</note> For 'tis a foul thing, in sooth, for an elder to fall in the van and lie before the younger, his head white and his beard hoary, breathing forth his stout soul in the dust, with his privities<note> <hi>or perh. emending the Gr.</hi> entrails</note> all bloody in his hands, a sight so foul to see and fraught with such ill to the seer, and his flesh also all naked; yet to a young man all is seemly enough, so long as he have the noble bloom of lovely youth, aye a marvel he for men to behold, and desirable unto women, so long as ever he be alive, and fair in like manner when he be fallen in the vanguard.

So let each man bite his lip and abide firm-set astride upon the ground, covering with the belly of his broad buckler thighs and legs below and breast and shoulders above; let him brandish the massy spear in his right hand, let him wave the dire crest upon his head; let him learn how to fight by doing doughty deeds, and not stand shield in hand beyond the missiles. Nay, let each man close the foe, and with his own long spear, or else with his sword, wound and take an enemy, and setting foot beside foot, resting shield against shield, crest beside crest, helm beside helm, fight his man breast to breast with sword or long spear in hand.

Ar. <hi>Eq.</hi> 1173 ff</note>Now take and recite, pray, these elegiac lines of Solon, that the jury may know that Solon, like us, hated such men as the defendant. The point is, Aeschines, not that you should keep your hand in your cloak when you play the orator, but that you should do so when you play the ambassador; instead of which you held it out and opened it wide in Macedonia and brought your colleagues to disgrace; and now you hold forth here, and you just con and mouth some miserable rigmaroles, and then think, I suppose, that you will escape the penalty of a long list of heinous crimes if you merely don a little cap<note>as a &lpar;sham&rpar; invalid &lpar;and cf.

<cit id="tlg-0263.cit.23"><quote><p>But Athens, albeit she will never perish by the destiny of Zeus or the will of the happy Gods immortal &mdash;for of such power is the great-hearted Guardian, Daughter of a Mighty Sire, that holdeth Her hands over us &mdash;, Her own people, for lucre's sake, are fain to make ruin of this great city by their folly. Unrighteous is the mind of the leaders of the commons, and their pride goeth before a fall; for they know not how to hold them from excess nor to direct in peace the jollity of their present feasting ... but grow rich through the suasion of unrighteous deeds ...<note>as line 11 appears sound, it is supposed that an hexameter is lost before and after it</note> and steal right and left with no respect for possessions sacred or profane, nor have heed of the awful foundations of Justice, who is so well aware in her silence of what is and what hath been, and soon or late cometh alway to avenge. This is a wound that cometh inevitable and forthwith to every city, and she falleth quickly into an evil servitude, which arouseth discord and waketh slumbering War that destroyeth the lovely prime of so many men. For in gatherings<note>perh. associations or clubs</note> dear to the unrighteous a delightful city is quickly brought low at the hands of them that are her enemies. Such are the evils which then are rife among the common folk, and many of the poor go slaves into a foreign land, bound with unseemly fetters, there to bear perforce the evil works of servitude.<note>this line is of doubtful ms-authority</note> So cometh the common evil into every house, and the street-doors will no longer keep it out; it leapeth the high hedge and surely findeth a man, for all he may go hide himself in his chamber. This it is that my heart biddeth me tell the Athenians, and how that even as ill-government giveth a city much trouble, so good rule maketh all things orderly and perfect, and often putteth fetters upon the unrighteous; aye, she maketh the rough smooth, checketh excess, confuseth outrage; she withereth the springing weeds of ruin, she straighteneth crooked judgments, she mollifieth proud deeds; she stoppeth the works of faction, she stilleth the wrath of baneful strife; and of her all is made wise and perfect in the world of men.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0263.4</bibl></cit>

Aye, one payeth to-day, another to-morrow; and those who themselves flee and escape the pursuing destiny of Heaven, to them vengeance cometh alway again, for the price of their deeds is paid by their innocent children or else by their seed after them.</p>

<p>We mortal men, alike good and bad, are minded thus: &mdash;each of us keepeth the opinion he hath ever had<note>reading doubtful</note> till he suffer ill, and then forthwith he grieveth; albeit ere that, we rejoice open-mouthed in vain expectations, and whosoever be oppressed with sore disease bethinketh himself he will be whole; another that is a coward thinketh he be a brave man; or he that hath no comeliness seemeth to himself goodly to look upon; and if one be needy, and constrained by the works of Penury, he reckoneth alway to win much wealth. Each hath his own quest; one, for to bring home gain, rangeth the fishy deep a-shipboard, tossed by grievous winds, sparing his life no whit, another serveth them whose business lieth with the curvad ploughshare, ploughing the well-planted land for them throughout the year<note> <hi>or</hi> every year?</note>; one getteth his living by the skill of his hands in the works of Athena and the master of many crafts, Hephaestus, another through his learning in the gifts of the Olympian Muses, cunning in the measure of lovely art; others again as physicians, having the task of the Master of Medicines, the Healer &mdash;for these men too there's no end of their labours, for often cometh great pain of little and a man cannot assuage it by soothing medicines, albeit at other times him that is confounded by evil and grievous maladies maketh he quickly whole by the laying on of hands; another again the Far-Shooting Lord Apollo maketh a seer, and the mischief that cometh on a man from afar is known to him that hath the Gods with him, for no augury nor offering will ever ward off what is destined to be.</p>

<p>Aye, surely Fate it is that bringeth mankind both good and ill, and the gifts immortal Gods offer must needs be accepted; surely too there's danger in every sort of business<note>cf. Theogn. 585, Stob. <hi>Fl.</hi> 111. 16</note>; nor know we at the beginning of a matter how it is to end<note> <hi>or</hi> where we shall come to shore</note>; nay, sometimes he that striveth to do a good thing falleth unawares into ruin great and sore, whereas God giveth good hap in all things to one that doeth ill, to be his deliverance from folly.

<p>In this poem he champions either party alternately and then exhorts both together to make up their quarrel.

<p>From which it is quite clear that he stood in high repute even before his legislation. And with regard to the ridicule heaped upon him for shirking supreme power, he writes as follows:</p>

<p>Thus he makes the baser sort speak of him.

He had a daughter Cleobulina, a poetess who wrote riddles in hexameter verse and is mentioned by Cratinus in the play which bears her name in the plural number. He is also said to have rebuilt the temple of Athena founded by Danaus. He wrote Songs and Riddles amounting to 3000 lines. Some authorities ascribe to him the Epitaph on Midas:<note>cf. <hi>A.P.</hi> 7. 153, Philop. in Arist. 77 b. 32 &lpar;p. 156 Wall.&rpar;</note>.

<p>And they find evidence for this in a poem of Simonides<note>31 <hi>L.G.</hi> </note> where he says: &lsquo;Who that hath understanding would praise Cleobulus the man of Lindus for his pitting of the might of a grave-stone against the ever-running rivers and the flowers of the Spring, against the flame of Sun and of golden Moon, and against the eddies of the ocean-wave? All these are subject to the Gods; but a stone, even mortal hands may break it. This is the rede of a fool.&rsquo; For they deny that the epitaph is Homer's, who lived, say they, many years before Midas.</p> <p>Pamphila's <hi>Notes</hi> preserve the following Riddle of his:<note>cf.

She has an admirable judgment, a political mind, and a sweet disposition, and her father's rule is the lighter for it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Say no more,&rsquo; cried Neiloxenus; &lsquo;one has only to look at her simple and unstudied behaviour. But why this affectionate tendance of Anacharsis? &lsquo;For the reason&rsquo; he replied &lsquo;that he is so wise a man and so learned, and has given her such full and generous knowledge of the regimen, the way of purification, which the Scythians use upon the sick. And as she treats him with all this tenderness, I make no doubt she is meanwhile learning something by disputation with him.&rsquo;</quote> <bibl>Plutarch <title>The Seven Sages</title></bibl></cit>

But even if he were not of Sicily, the present passage does him no wrong, but the reverse; for the speaker shows no bias, Athenian as he is, on behalf of an Athenian, but although his object is to compare him with an Athenian, namely Tyrtaeus, he has kept to the truth in deciding between them, and preferred Theognis though a foreigner.

The beginning<note> <hi>or</hi> basis</note> of it therefore seems to me to be quite as it should be: the author begins with<note> <hi>or</hi> basis</note> the question of breeding or good birth, believing, no doubt, that nothing can be good of its kind, whether man or any other creature, unless its progenitors are good. And that is why he chose to do with men as he would with the other animals, which we do not keep without consideration, but give each kind the particular skilled attention which will produce the finest strain. This is proved by the following lines: &lpar;183-90&rpar;. The meaning of these verses is that men do not know how to produce their kind properly, and the result is that the human race is not so good as it might be because the good is always mingled with the bad. But the generality of men take these lines as proving<note>cf. Thuc. i. 1 <foreign lang="greek">e)k tekmhri/wn . . ou) nomi/zw</foreign> </note> that the poet accuses his fellowmen of busying themselves in vain matters, and of knowing<note> <hi>or amending the Greek</hi> as knowing</note> how to make money compensate for low-birth and viciousness.

Hipparchus on the other hand lacked seriousness. He was of an amorous disposition and an aesthete. It was he who sent to fetch Anacreon and Simonides and the other poets to Athens. Thettalus, who was much younger, was a self-confident bully, and this was the cause of all their trouble. Becoming the lover of Harmodius and failing to win his friendship, he put no restraint upon his anger but gave frequent expression to his resentment, and finally when the sister of his beloved was going to carry a sacred basket in the Panathenaic Festival he prevented her doing so and called Harmodius a weakling; which incensed Harmodius and Aristogeiton and prompted them and many others with them to hatch the plot. On the day of the festival they were lying in wait in the Acropolis for Hippias, who was to receive the procession while Hipparchus was to dispatch it, when, seeing one of the conspirators in friendly converse with Hippias, they jumped to it he was revealing the plot, and in order to do at least something before they were taken, went down into the city, and starting before the others were ready, slew Hipparchus in the act of marshalling the procession before the Leocorium, thus bringing the whole plot to ruin; and were themselves killed, Harmodius by the bodyguard on the spot, and Aristogeiton when he was seized later and had undergone some hours of torture.</quote> <bibl>Aristotle <title>Constitution of Athens</title></bibl></cit>

<p>The tragic poet Aeschylus was by birth an Athenian, of the deme of Eleusis, son of Euphorion and brother of Cynegeirus, by descent a Eupatrid. He began writing his tragedies young, and far surpassed his predecessors in the style of his poetry and in stage-craft, in the splendour of the staging, the dress of the actors, and the dignity of the chorus; compare Aristophanes :

He was contemporary with Pindar, his birth falling in the 63rd Olympiad &lpar;528-5 B.C.&rpar;.. He lived sixty-nine years, during which he wrote seventy dramas as well as about five satyr-plays.

Being highly thought of by his fellow-countrymen, he had a greater ambition than his income justified with respect both to the rearing of race-horses and to other expensive pursuits. And this it was which more than anything else eventually caused the downfall of Athens. For alarmed by the great unconventionality of his private life, as well as by the surpassing genius he displayed in every detail of whatever came to hand, the common people, believing him to be desirous of the supreme power, became his enemies; and thus though he was eminently successful publicly in the prosecution of the war, they each and all were incensed at his private conduct, and by intrusting their future to other hands, quickly brought ruin on their country.</quote> <bibl>Thucydides  <title>Histories</title></bibl></cit>

Moreover after such drinking the tongue is loosened<note>the unknown grammatical subjt. was supplied from the lost line or lines above; it can hardly be the &lpar;apparently Athenian, cf. l. 14&rpar; guests</note> unto foul tales, and the body gropeth; a darkling mist settles on the eye, oblivion melts the memory from the wits, and the arrows of the mind go wide; the serving-men become out of hand, and ruinous expenditure befalls. But at Sparta young men drink only so much as to bring all hearts into a merry confidence, and all lips into goodfellowship and moderate laughter. Such drinking advantageth alike body, understanding, and estate; it well befitteth the works of Aphrodite and sleep that's our haven after toil, befitteth also Health the God most pleasing unto man, and Piety's neighbour Discretion.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0319.2</bibl></cit>

<cit id="tlg-0319.cit.19"><quote><p>For toastings beyond due measure make present delight only to bring lasting pain afterward, whereas the Spartan manner lieth evenly, namely to eat and drink proportional to keeping thy wits and the power to act; there's no day appointed<note>apparently a colloquial phrase meaning &lsquo;you ought not&rsquo;</note> for making the body drunk with immoderate drinking.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0319.3</bibl></cit>

When he had grown up he took part in the military expeditions to Amphipolis and Potidaea, and fought at Delium . . .

Now if you would like me to have some answer to give Euenus when he repeats his question, as I know he will, tell me what reply to make.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very well, Cebes,&rsquo; he replied: &lsquo;tell him the truth, that I composed these poems with no desire to compete with him or his works &mdash;for I knew how difficult that would be &mdash;but because I wanted to test the meaning of certain dreams I had, and acquit my conscience of any obligation they might lay upon me to make this literary venture. . Thus it was that I first composed a poem to the God whose festival was being held; and then,<note> <hi>lit.</hi> after the God, <hi>i.e.</hi> following the ancient custom, first sacred and then secular; cf. <hi>L.G.</hi> iii. 591</note> believing that the poet, if he is to be worth the name, should compose myth or fable and not history &mdash;and I had no expert knowledge of fiction myself, &mdash;I took the fables I had at hand and knew, namely Aesop's, and put the first I happened on into verse. Here then is your reply to Euenus, and pray bid him farewell for me, and say that if he is wise he will lose no time in coming after me.
