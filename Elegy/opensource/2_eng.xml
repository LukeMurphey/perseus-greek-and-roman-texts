<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.1"><quote>Plato &mdash;Son of Ariston son of Aristocles, and Perictione\ ... who was a descendant of Solon ... He was born in Aegina in the 88th Olympiad &lpar;428-5 B.C.&rpar;, just after the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. He lived to be eighty-two, dying in the 108th Olympiad &lpar;348-5&rpar;. His first lessons were given him by a certain Dionysius, and he learnt gymnastics of Ariston of Argos. Later, he learnt the art of petry, and wrote dithyrambs and tragedies, but in the end he threw this up in favour of philosophy, which he studied under Socrates for twenty years... Plato made three journeys to Sicily, to the courts of the two despots Dionysius, and was sold as a slave by one of them, being bought by Anniceris the Libyan, who set him free. He spent his life teaching in the Academy. His successors at that school were these, Speusippus, Xenocrates, Polemo, Crantor, Crates ... His genuine <hi>Dialogues</hi> number fifty-six...</quote> <bibl>Suidas</bibl></cit>

<div3 type="elegiac" n="1-9">
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.2"><quote>In the 4th Book of his <hi>Luxury of the Ancients</hi> Aristippus tells us that Plato became attached to a youth named <hi>Aster</hi> or Star with whom he studied astronomy, and also to the above-mentioned Dion
 &lpar;and as some say, to Phaedrus&rpar;, the depth of his affection being revealed in the following &lsquo;inscriptions&rsquo; or epigrams which he wrote upon them:
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.3"><quote><p>Thou gazest at the stars, my star; would I were Heaven, that I might gaze at thee with many eyes!<note>cf. Apul. Apol. 10 &lpar;with the next&rpar;, A.P. 7. 669 <foreign lang="greek">ei&rpar;s *a)ste/ra to\n maqhth/n</foreign> , Plan. &lsqb; <foreign lang="greek">P. tou= filoso/fou</foreign> &rsqb;; translated by Ausonius Ep. 144</note></p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0059.1</bibl></cit>
<p>And this:</p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.4"><quote><p>Even as you shone once the Star of Morn among the living, so in death you shine now the Star of Eve among the dead.<note>cf. A.P. 7. 670</note></p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0059.2</bibl></cit>
<p>And on Dion this:</p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.5"><quote><p>The Fates once decreed tears unto Hecuba and the women of Troy at their birth; thy widespread<note>or, emending the Gk. firm-set, like &lpar;pointed-ended&rpar; amphorae in the soil of a wine-cellar, cf. Dem. 55. 24 <foreign lang="greek">a)pokliqh=|nai</foreign> </note> hopes, Dion, the Gods did spill upon the ground when thou hadst triumphed in the doing of noble deeds; and so in the spacious city that bare thee liest thou honoured by thy fellow-countrymen, O Dion who didst make my heart mad with love of thee.<note>at Plato's first visit to Syracuse he was about 40 and D. about 20; cf.

<p>This, according to Aristippus, was inscribed on Dion's tomb at Syracuse. It is also said that when enamoured of Alexis<note>this might be the comic poet born c. 394 when Plato was 31</note> and Phaedrus<note>Ph. seems to have been a younger contemporary of Socrates rather than of Plato</note> he wrote in the following way:</p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.6"><quote><p>Now, when I have but whispered<note> <hi>lit.</hi> said just &lpar;o&lpar;/son, cf. the use with numerals&rpar; only nothing</note> that Alexis is fair, he is the observed of all observers; why, my heart, dost reveal the dogs a bone?

<p>He is said, too, to have had a mistress, Archeanassa, on whom he wrote thus:</p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.7"><quote><p>My mistress is Archeanassa of Colophon, on whose very wrinkles there is bitter love. O hapless ye that met such beauty on its first voyage; through what a burning did ye pass!<note>cf.

<p>There is this too on Agathon:<note>as A. was born 20 years before Plato, this poem, like the next but one, seems to have been written, like the <hi>Dialogues</hi> , by Plato personating Socrates: cf. Gell. 19. 11. 1, Macr. <hi>Sat.</hi> 2. 2. 15, A.P. 5. 77, Cram. <hi>A.P.</hi> 4. 384. 1</note></p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.8"><quote><p>When I kiss Agathon my soul is on my lips, whither it comes, poor thing, hoping to cross over.<note> <hi>i.e.</hi> like a soul across the Styx into Elysium</note></p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0059.6</bibl></cit>
<p>And another:</p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.9"><quote><p>I cast the apple at you, and if you truly love me, take it and give me of your maidenhood; but if your thoughts be what I pray they are not, then too take it and consider how short-lived is beauty.<note>cf. <hi>A.P.</hi> 5. 78</note></p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0059.7</bibl></cit>
<p>&lt;And this:&gt;</p>
<cit id="tlg-0059.cit.10"><quote><p>I am an apple; one that loves you casts me at you. Say yes, Xanthippe; we fade, both you and I.<note>cf. A.P. 5. 79 &lpar; <hi>Plan.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">filodh/mou</foreign> &rpar;1</note></p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0059.8</bibl></cit>
<p>It is also said that the lines on the Eretrians who were swept into captivity<note>by the Persians in 490 B.C., cf. Hdt. 6. 101; the burial &lpar;if this is Plato's&rpar; is metaphorical</note> are his:</p>

<cit id="tlg-0247.cit.7"><quote>As time wore on, Dionysius, growing both jealous of Dion and fearful of his popularity in Greece, kept back his revenues and entrusted his wealth to his own stewards. Desiring to repair the ill-name he had with the philosophers because of Plato, he now gathered about him many of the reputed wise and learned, and being ambitious of the first place in dialectic, was constrained to make ill use of his misunderstandings of Plato's teaching. Moreover he began to wish for him once more, and to blame himself for making so poor use of him when he had him, nor paying heed to him as he ought. And like the despot he was, always at the mercy of his own caprices and quick to respond to every impulse, it was suddenly all Plato with him, and after using every means in his power he persuaded Archytas the Pythagorean, who had first brought them together, to be his security for his <hi>bona fides</hi> and summon Plato to his side. Archytas sent off Archedemus to Plato, and Dionysius also dispatched a trireme and some friends of his to beg him to come, and himself wrote in no ambiguous terms to say that it would not go well with Dion if Plato refused to come to Sicily, whereas if he came it would be to his friend's great profit. Many requests too reached Dion from his wife and sister to entreat Plato to comply and to take no excuse. Thus, as Plato says, he came for the third time into the strait of Scylla:

Some time afterwards he was shipwrecked off Myconos and was saved by a dolphin when all hands were lost but he. When he died an old man in his native country and the funeral was being held near the seashore, a shoal of dolphins happened to appear in the harbour on the very day, within a stone's throw of the funeral procession, as though accompanying Coeranus to his grave and sharing the grief of the mourners.</quote> <bibl>Phylarchus</bibl></cit>

His kindness did not go unrewarded. For he was sailing one day, we are told, in a fifty-oared galley which was conveying some Milesians, when, in the strait between Naxos and Paros, the ship capsized and all aboard perished except Coeranus, who was saved by dolphins &mdash;a prompt return for his kindly action. A promontory and a cliff with a cave in it are shown where they swam ashore with him, and the place is called after him. Some time afterwards, when this man Coeranus died and his body was being burnt near the sea, the dolphins somehow learnt of it and assembled as though they had come to the funeral, and remained, like faithful friends, till the fire burnt itself out.</quote> <bibl>Aelian <title>Natural History:</title></bibl></cit>

Soon afterwards, they say, he was at sea in a fifty-oared galley, which was carrying certain of the Milesians, when, in the strait between Naxos and Paros, the ship capsizing and all but he being lost, it is said that a dolphin ran under him and supported him, and put him ashore in a cave of Sicynthus<note>prob. = Paros &lpar; <hi>see below</hi> &rpar;; as Plut. adds a similar story told &lsquo;by the Zacynthians&rsquo; of Telemachus, there may have been some old confusion between Sicynthus and Zacynthus</note> which is shown to this day and called after him.

<cit id="tlg-0232.cit.293"><quote>Demeas wrote an account not only of the fame of others, but of the virtues of the poet Archilochus, his outstanding piety,<note>genitive due to confusion</note> the love he bore to his country, Paros, and the many great benefits he bestowed on the Parians &mdash;about these he wrote five Books, besides the Book which assigns them to the Archon of each year. And Demeas has given each of the things done and written of by Archilochus under the name of the archon to whose year it belongs, beginning with the first archonship of Eureas, when it seems that a fifty-oared galley which had brought ambassadors from the Milesians and was on the way back to Miletus, was lost in the &lsqb;strait&rsqb; of Naxos and only one of her company saved, a man named Coeranus, who was taken on its back by a dolphin, and cast up into e.g.a cave on the coast of the Syra-ward district,<note>see Appendix, p. 321</note> whence he &lsqb;was allowed&rsqb; safe-conduct under guard by right of his status as ambassador. And we hold the cave sacred to this day, and it is called after him the Cave of Coeranus. This Coeranus was associated with Archilochus in the &lsqb;second&rsqb; colonisation of Thasos and in the war, of which the poet makes the following mention: &lpar;1&rpar;

The refrain employed was this, <foreign lang="greek">th/nella kalli/nike</foreign> ... &mdash;&lpar;c&rpar; The word &lsquo;threefold&rsquo; is used because they shouted the word <foreign lang="greek">kalli/nike</foreign> thrice, that is not to say thrice in immediate succession, but the strophe is threefold and the refrain repeated with each. But according to Eratosthenes the chant of Archilochus is not really a victory-song but a hymn to Heracles, and the word &lsquo;threefold&rsquo; does not refer to its being composed of three strophes, but because the word <foreign lang="greek">kalli/nike</foreign> was used three times as a refrain. With regard to the word <foreign lang="greek">th/nella</foreign> we are told by Eratosthenes that when the fluteplayer or lyre-player was not present the chorus-leader took it up and spoke it &lsquo;outside of the song,&rsquo; and then the chorus of revellers joined in with <foreign lang="greek">kalli/nike,</foreign> and thus came the combination <foreign lang="greek">th/nella kalli/nike.</foreign> The song begins &lsquo;O hail victorious,&rsquo; etc. &mdash;&lpar;d&rpar; Having composed a hymn to Heracles, Archilochus was at a loss for a lyre-player and imitated the tune in speech. Thus he made this word <foreign lang="greek">th/nella</foreign> as a start for what followed, and himself spoke the tune of the lyre, that is <foreign lang="greek">th/nella,</foreign> in the midst of the chorus, and they did the rest. From this it came about that when a lyre-player was not to be had, this word <foreign lang="greek">th/nella</foreign> was used instead.

There's no mind in us men, but we live each day as it cometh like grazing cattle, knowing no whit how God shall end it. Yet Hope and Trust keep us all a-pondering the impracticable; some abide till a day come, others for the turning of years. There 's none alive but thinketh he will come home winged with wealth and good things next year; yet one of us ere he reach his goal is taken with unenvied Age, another's mind is wasted by miserable Disease, or Death sendeth him below dark Earth whelmed by War. Some die at sea when they have laden a ship with their substance, confounded by storm and the many waves of the purple brine; others tie a noose about their miserable neck and leave the sunlight of their free choice. So true is it that nothing is without ills, nay, ten thousand the Dooms of men, and their woes and sorrows past reckoning. If they would be advised by me, we should not set our hearts on good things, nor yet do ourselves despite by letting our minds dwell upon evil troubles.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.tlg-0260.1</bibl></cit>

<cit id="tlg-0260.cit.19"><quote>&lsqb;censure of women, and concerning marriage&rsqb;: Semonides: &mdash;
<cit id="tlg-0260.cit.20"><quote><p>In the beginning God made woman's mind apart from man's.<note>or made mind apart from woman</note>
</p>

<p>One made He of a bristly Sow; all that is in her house lies disorderly, defiled with dirt, and rolling upon the floor, and she groweth fat a-sitting among the middens in garments as unwashed as herself.
</p>

<p>Another did God make of a knavish Vixen, a woman knowing in all things, who taketh note of all, be it bad or good; for the bad often calleth she good and the good bad; and she hath now this mood and now that.
</p>

<p>Another of a Bitch, a busybody<note>the mss have <foreign lang="greek">litorgo/n</foreign> , a form which occurs nowhere else and is prob. corrupt.; two ancient glosses prob. belong here; one, <foreign lang="greek">li/targon</foreign> , explained by &lsquo;running fast,&rsquo; seems etymologically unsound, the other, <foreign lang="greek">litourgo/n</foreign> &lsqb; <foreign lang="greek">leitourgo/n</foreign> ?&rsqb;, explained by &lsquo;scoundrelly,&rsquo; can hardly have that meaning; but the latter, besides its official use as &lsquo;doer of public works,&rsquo; may have had the meaning given above</note> like her mother, one that would fain hear all, know all, and peering and prying everywhere barketh e'en though she see nothing; a man cannot check her with threats, no, not if in anger he dash her teeth out with a stone, nor yet though he speak gently with her, even though she be sitting among strangers &mdash;she must needs keep up her idle baying.
</p>

<p>Another the Olympians fashioned of Earth, and gave to her husband all wanting in wits; such a woman knoweth neither evil nor good; her only art is to eat; and never though God give a bad winter draweth she her stool nigher the fire for the cold.
</p>

<p>Another of the Sea, whose thoughts are in two minds; one day she laughs and is gay &mdash;a stranger seeing her within will praise her, saying &lsquo;There's no better wife in all the world, nay, nor comelier&rsquo;; the next she is intolerable to behold or draw nigh to, for then she rageth unapproachably, like a bitch with young; implacable and nasty is she to all, alike foe and friend. Even as the sea in summertime often will stand calm and harmless, to the great joy of the mariners, yet often will rage and toss with roaring waves, most like unto it is such a woman in disposition, nor hath the ocean a nature of other sort than hers.<note> <hi>or keeping the Greek</hi> but the ocean hat a different nature</note>
</p>

<p>Another's made of a stubborn<note>reading doubtful</note> and belaboured She-Ass; everything she doeth is hardly done, of necessity and after threats, and then 'tis left unfinished; meanwhile eateth she day in day out, in bower and in hall, and all men alike are welcome to her bed.
</p>

<p>Another of a Cat, a woeful and miserable sort; for in her there's nought of fair or lovely or pleasant or desirable; she is wood<note>mad</note> for a love-mate, and yet when she hath him turneth his stomach; she doeth her neighbours much harm underhand, and often eateth up unaccepted offerings.<note>cf. Ath. 5. 179 d &lsqb; <foreign lang="greek">p. th=s a)ko/smou gunako\s</foreign> &rsqb;</note>
</p>

<p>Another<note>11. 57-70 are also in Ael. <hi>H.A.</hi> 16. 24, cf. 11. 36</note> is the child of a dainty long-maned Mare; she refuseth menial tasks and toil; she'll neither set hand to mill nor take up sieve, nor cast forth the muck, nor, for that she shunneth the soot, will she sit beside the oven. She taketh a mate only of necessity. Every day will she wash herself twice, or even thrice, and anointeth her with unguents. She ever weareth her hair deep-combed and wreathed with flowers. Such a wife may be a fair sight for other men, but she's an ill to her husband if he be not a despot or a king, such as take pride in adornments like to her.
</p>

<p>Another cometh of an Ape; she is the greatest ill of all Zeus giveth man. Foul of face, such a woman maketh laughter for all men as she goeth through the town; short in neck, she moveth hardly, hipless, leanshanked &mdash;alas for the wretched man that claspeth such a mischief! Like an ape she knoweth all arts and wiles, nor recketh of men's laughter. Neither will she do a man any kindness; all her care, all her considering, is how she shall do the greatest ill she may.
</p>

<p>Another of a Bee; and happy he that getteth her. On her alone alighteth there no blame, and life doth flourish and increase because of her; loving and loved groweth she old with her husband, the mother of a fair and name-honoured progeny; she is pre-eminent among all the women, and a divine grace pervadeth her; neither taketh she delight in sitting among women where they tell tales of venery. Such wives are the best and wisest that Zeus bestoweth upon men; these other kinds, thanks unto Him, both are and will ever be a mischief in the world.
</p>

<p>For this is the greatest ill that Zeus hath made, women. Even though they may seem to advantage us, a wife is more than all else a mischief to him that possesseth her; for whoso dwelleth with a woman, he never passeth a whole day glad, nor quickly shall he thrust out of doors Hunger the hated housefellow and hostile deity. But when a man thinketh withindoors to be gladdest at heart by grace of God or favour of man, then of all times will she find cause for blame and gird herself for battle. For where a woman is, they e'en cannot receive a stranger heartily. And she that most seemeth to be discreet, she is all the time doing the greatest harm; her husband is all agape for her, but the neighbours rejoice that yet another is deceived. And no man but will praise his own wife when he speaketh of her,<note> <hi>not</hi> when he remembers her after her death &lpar;which would be put more explicitly&rpar;</note> and blame another's, yet we cannot see<note> <hi>or, emending the Gk.</hi> we know well</note> that we be all alike. Aye, this is the greatest ill that Zeus hath made, this hath he put about us as the bondage of a fetter irrefragable, ever since Death received them that went a-warring for a woman.<note>Helen, cf.

<div2 type="section"><!--fragments--><head>A SELECTION FROM THE ANONYMOUS INSCRIPTIONS</head>



<div3 type="hexameter" n="1">
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.1"><quote><note>mainly from the collections of Kaibel and Cougny; for those preserved in the <hi>Palatine</hi> and <hi>Planudean Anthologies</hi> see Paton <hi>The Greek Anthology</hi> in the Loeb Series; see also inscr. ascribed to Sappho, Anacreon, Simonides, etc. in <hi>Lyra Graeca</hi> </note>... The Chest is made of cedar with figures of ivory upon it, some also of gold, and others carved in the wood itself. This is the chest in which Cypselus despot of Corinth was hidden by his mother when the Bacchidae searched for him after his birth. Because it thus saved his life, it was dedicated at Olympia by his descendants, who are known as the Cypselids, <hi>cypsele</hi> being the contemporary Corinthian word for a chest, and the child himself, it is said, named Cypselus for this reason. To most of what is depicted thereon there are explanatory inscriptions in the ancient letters, some of which are written straight and others in the style which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">boustrofhdo/n</foreign> &lpar;or to and fro like oxen ploughing&rpar;, that is to say that the second line begins on the turn at the end of the first, as we run the <foreign lang="greek">di/aulos</foreign> or two-lap race; others of the inscriptions are written in spirals difficult to make out<note>there follows a detailed description of the carvings</note> ... The man and a woman who follows him are explained by the hexameters, which say:
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.2"><quote><p>Marpessa the fair-ankled whom Apollo had taken from him is brought back again by Idas from the temple a willing follower.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.1</bibl></cit>
<p>... Medea is seated in a chair with Jason standing on her right and Aphrodite on her left, with the following inscription:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.3"><quote><p>Jason weds Medea, and Aphrodite counsels them.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.2</bibl></cit>
<p>And the Muses are depicted singing and Apollo leading the song,<note>i.e. dancing lyre in hand</note> and the inscription is:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.4"><quote><p>This is the far-shooting Lord Apollo Son of Leto, and about him the Muses, whom he leadeth in a delightful dance.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.3</bibl></cit>
<p>Moreover there is Atlas holding up Heaven and Earth upon his shoulders as in the story, and bringing the apples of the Hesperides. And who the man is who is coming towards him with the sword is not explained by any particular inscription, but he is clearly Heracles. The following is the inscription on the whole scene:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.5"><quote><p>This is Atlas upholding the Heavens and about to give up the apples.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.4</bibl></cit>
<p>... The Chest also depicts the Dioscuri, one of them still beardless, and between them Helen, at whose feet lies Aethra daughter of Pittheus, in black garments. The inscription is an hexameter line with one word over:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.6"><quote><p>The sons of Tyndareus bring Helen, and carry off Aethra from Aphidna.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.5</bibl></cit>
<p>So runs the verse; and there is Coon fighting with Agamemnon for the corpse of Iphidamas son of Antenor; and Agamemnon's shield is blazoned with Fear with a lion's head. The inscription on Iphidamas is this:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.7"><quote><p>This is Iphidamas; Coon fighteth for him;</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.6</bibl></cit>
<p>and that on the shield of Agamemnon:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.8"><quote><p>This is men's Fear and he that holdeth him Agamemnon.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.7</bibl></cit>
<p>And there is Hermes, too, bringing the Goddesses to be judged for their beauty by Alexander<note>i.e. Paris</note> son of Priam; the inscription runs thus:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.9"><quote><p>Hermes here showeth Hera and Athena and Aphrodite unto Alexander for to judge of their beauty.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.8</bibl></cit>
<p>... There is also a representation of Ajax dragging Cassandra from the image of Athena, thus inscribed:</p>
<cit id="adespota-001.cit.10"><quote><p>The Locrian Ajax draggeth Cassandra from Athena.</p></quote> <bibl>CURFRAG.adespota-001.9</bibl></cit>
<p>... Now we could by no means guess who was the maker of the Chest, but as for the author of the inscriptions upon it, while they may, of course, be the work of some other man, my impressions on the whole point to Eumelus of Corinth, particularly in view of his <hi>Processional to Delos</hi> .<note>see <hi>Lyra Graeca</hi> i. p. 14; the date are against P.'s view</note></p></quote> <bibl>Pausanias <title>Description of Greece</title> &lpar;Preger 186&rpar; &lsqb;the Chest of Cypselus&rsqb;</bibl></cit>

<cit id="adespota-001.cit.43"><quote>When the Greeks enquired of the Oracle what sacrifices they should make, the God replied that they should build an altar to Zeus Eleutherius, and not sacrifice upon it till they had extinguished all fire, as being defiled by the Barbarians, throughout the country, and kindle a pure flame thereon from the common hearth at Delphi. The Greek commanders accordingly went round and had all fires put out, and the Plataean Euchidas, who undertook to fetch the fire from the God with all possible speed, departed to Delphi. There, after purifying and besprinkling himself and setting a wreath of laurel on his head, he took the fire from the altar, and running back again reached Plataea before sunset, thus covering more than a hundred miles<note>the Gk. has &lsquo;1000 stades,&rsquo; i.e. 112 miles; as the crow flies the distance there and back is 92 miles</note> in one day. And no sooner had he greeted his fellow-citizens and handed them the fire than he fell to the ground and shortly after expired. In their admiration the Plataeans gave him burial in the precinct of Artemis Eucleia, and inscribed upon the tomb the following tetrameter:
