<head>PENELOPE ULYSSI</head>
<p>This epistle is supposed to be addressed by Penelope to her husband Ulysses, upon occasion of his long absence from her after the reduction of Troy. This war had been first kindled by the perfidy of Paris, who, being sent into Greece by his father Priam upon some embassy, carried off Helen, the wife of Menelaus king of Sparta. The Greeks, having in vain applied for redress, determined to right themselves by force of arms. Ulysses, unwilling to embark in this expedition, counterfeited madness; but, being discovered by the artifice of Palamedes, he went with the rest of the Greeks to Troy, where his valor and prudence eminently contributed to the overthrow of that city. The Grecian fleet, in its return, was overtaken by a storm, which widely dispersed the ships. Many of them were driven upon unknown coasts; and the fugitives were involved in severe distress. Among others, Ulysses wandered through different regions and climes for above ten years, exposed to numberless hazards, and unable in all that time to regain his own country. Penelope, whom he had married before his departure for Troy, ignorant of the cause of his absence, but very solicitous for his return, writes this epistle, in which she chides him for his long stay, and, by the most persuasive arguments, urges him to come home to his wife and family, as Troy was now overthrown, and he could frame no reasonable excuse for his absence.  The story of his absence and return is told in the <title>Odyssey</title>.
</p>
<div2 id="cp1l1" type="commline" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Penelope</lemma>; daughter of Icarius, who, during the long absence of her husband, preserved an inviolable chastity, and resisted the earnest importunities of a multitude of lovers, who were constantly soliciting her to a compliance. At last her husband returning, delivered her from this tedious persecution.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ulysse.</lemma> Ulysses was the son of Laertes and Anticlea, and king of Ithaca and Dulichium. He was famous for his valor and prudence, his extraordinary sagacity and cunning; and is proposed by Homer as a model for all princes and rulers.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l3" type="commline" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Troia</lemma>; a celebrated city of Asia Minor, so called from Tros, one of its kings. It was formerly called Teucria from Teucer, and Dardania from Dardanus. The Greeks, after a siege of ten years, utterly destroyed it.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Dana&iuml;s.</lemma> The Greeks were called <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Danai</lemma> from Danaus king of the Argives in Peloponnesus.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l4" type="commline" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Priamus</lemma>; the son of Laomedon, and king of Troy at the time of the Grecian expedition.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tanti totaque Troia fuit.</lemma> Commentators differ as to the meaning of this passage. The most general opinion will have it thus: <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tota iactura, quam Priamus caeterique Troiani acceperunt, non fait tanti, quanti mea, quod te marito ob bellum Trojanum carui.</lemma> The reader will see, however, that I have given a different turn to it in the translation.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l5" type="commline" n="5">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Lacedaemona</lemma>; Lacedaemon, the most remarkable city of Peloponnesus, called also Sparta, where Menelaus reigned. It derived its name from Lacedaemon, the son of Jupiter and Taygete.  Taygete, in turn, was daughter of Atlas and Pleione.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l6" type="commline" n="6">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Adulter</lemma>; Paris, the son of Priam, who carried off Helen the wife of Menelaus; which gave rise to the Trojan war. Her resentment would not suffer her to call him by his proper name, but suggested one, which, while it sufficiently distinguished him, reproached him at the same time with his crime.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l9" type="commline" n="9">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">fallere noctem</lemma>:  In the Epistle of Hero to Leander there is a similar expression, <cit><quote lang="la">decptae pars noctis,</quote> <bibl>Her. 19.55</bibl></cit>, <gloss>a portion of the beguiled night</gloss>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l10" type="commline" n="10">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Lassaret viduas peudula tela manus.</lemma> It is related of Penelope, that, being greatly importuned by her lovers, some of whom threatened to carry her away by force, she begged a respite till she had finished the web she had in hand; and that, to lengthen out the time, she undid in the night what she had woven in the day. Hence arose the proverb, <quote lang="la">Penelopes telam texere</quote>, to do and undo.  See <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.124">Odyssey 19.124-163</bibl>.</p>
<p>The term <foreign lang="la">pendula</foreign> is used because the warp (<foreign lang="la">stamen</foreign>, from <foreign lang="la">stare</foreign>) stood erect in the loom, and did not lie horizontally, like those of the present day.  Though weaving was a trade among the Greeks and Romans, every house of distinction, especially in the country, contained a loom, with the requisite apparatus for working wool.  This occupation was supposed to be especially pleasing to Minerva, who was regarded in this character as the guardian of female industry and decorum.  The work was mostly carried on by the female slaves, under the supervision of the mistress of the house, who, with her daughters, occasionally took a part in the more tasteful portion of their labors.  The Greeks and Romans supplied themselves from their own looms with the ordinary articles of clothing;  but the finer textile works of scarfs, shawls, carpets, and tapestry were mostly supplied them from the East.  In the earlier ages of Greece and Rome, it was the duty of the matron, assisted by her daughters, to weave clothing for her husband and sons.  Thus Lucretia is depicted by Ovid, in the Second Book of the Fasti, as weaving a cloak for her husband (<bibl n="Ov. Fast. 2.741">2.741-742</bibl>);  see also <bibl n="Liv. 1.57">Livy 1.57-59</bibl>.  In the Ion of Euripides, Creusa proves herself to be the mother of Ion by describing the pattern of a shawl which she had made, and in which she had wrapped her infant son (<bibl n="Eur. Ion 1417">l. 1417</bibl>).  In the Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides, Iphigenia recognizeds Orestes (<bibl n="Eur. IT 812">812 ff</bibl>), and in the Choephori of Aeschylus, Electra also recognizes him (<bibl n="Aesch. Lib. 231">l. 231</bibl>), by the figured clothing which he wears, and which they had respectively long before woven for him.  Shawls and fine garments were frequently woven as offerings to the temples of the divinities.

<div2 id="cp1l14" type="commline" n="14">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Hectoreo</lemma> Hector, the son of Priam, was the most valiant of all the Trojans. It was by his bravery chiefly that Troy held out so long against the Greeks.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l15" type="commline" n="15">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Antilochum.</lemma> He was the son of Nester, and not slain by Hector, as is here said, but by Memnon. We may easily conceive that a woman, ignorant of the minute circumstances of war, and taking things by report, might mistake one person for another.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l17" type="commline" n="17">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Menoetiadem</lemma>; Patrochis, the son of Menoetius, greatly beloved by Achilles. This hero, offended at Agamemnon, who had unjustly taken his captive Briseis from him, retired from the Grecian camp. Patroclus, appealing in his friend's armour to terrify the Trojans, was slain by Hector. Hence he is said to have fallen <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sub falsis armis.</lemma>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l19" type="commline" n="19">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tlepolemus,</lemma> the son of Hercules and Astyoche, slain by Sarpedon king of Lycia, a country between Caria and Pamphylia.

</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l26" type="commline" n="26">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Barbara praeda</lemma>; that is, the spoils taken from the Trojans; for the Greeks looked upon all other nations as barbarous.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l28" type="commline" n="28">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tra&iuml;a fata.</lemma> As every thing that happensis by the order and decree of Fate, the poets have sometimes taken the liberty of using the word <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">fata</lemma> for the things done by Fate, as in the passage now before us. By Fate the ancients understood a succession of events which must unavoidably take place, and which gave rise alway the one to the other. Thus the whole train of events that preceded and occasioned the destruction of Troy were said to be the Trojan Fates.</p>
<p>There were several circumstances upon which the fate of Troy was said to depend.  First, the life of Troilus, the son of Priam, who was slain by Achilles.  Secondly, the preservation of the Palladium, or image of Pallas Athena, which was kept in the city;  thi swas carried off by Ulysses and Diomedes, who entered the city by night, and slew the guards of the place where it was deposited.  Thirdly, the horses of Rhesus;  if they shoud not be captured before they "had tasted of the pastures of Troy, and the waters of Xanthus," as Virgil says (<bibl n="Verg. A. 1.469">Aen. 1.469-473</bibl>);  they were also carried off by Ulysses and Diomedes.  And lastly, the sepulchre of Laomedon, in the Scaean gate, which was to remain untouched;  this was partly destroyed, when that gate was taken down by the Trojans, for the purpose of admitting the wooden horse.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l32" type="commline" n="32">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pergama,</lemma> properly the towers and citadel of Troy; here taken for the whole city.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">exiguo mero</lemma>:  Compare the love-notes written on the table in wine, in Helen's letter to Paris, <bibl n="Ov. Ep. 17.51">17.88</bibl>, and in the Amores, <bibl n="Ov. Am. 1.4">1.4.19-20</bibl>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l33" type="commline" n="33">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sim&ouml;is,</lemma> a river of Troas that ran into the Seamander, and filled all the neighbouring ground with marshes.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sigeia telius.</lemma> The Trojan fields are so called from Signum, a promontory of Troas, where Achilles, Patroclus, Antilochus, &amp;c. had their sepulchres.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l35" type="commline" n="35">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">aeacides</lemma>; Achilles, the son of Peleus, and grandson of aeacus.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l36" type="commline" n="36">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Liter Hector.</lemma> This refers to Achilles' behaviour to Hector after he had slain him. He fastened the body to his chariot, and dragged it thrice bound the walls of Troy.  See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.14">Iliad 24.14-21</bibl>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l38" type="commline" n="38">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nestor</lemma>; king of Pylos, and son of Neleus.
</p>
<p>He was particularly remarkable for his great age, being almost three hundred years old at the siege of Troy. By his long acquaintance with life and mankind, he arrived at the most consummate wisdom and experience.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l39" type="commline" n="39">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Rhesus</lemma>; the son of Eioneus, and king of the Thracians. Coming to the assistance of Priam in the night, he was obliged to pitch his camp withour the city. Ulysses, hearing of it, went with Diomedes, and, surprising the guards (who, after the fatigue of their march, had fallen asleep), slew Rhesus, and carried off the horses white as snow, and compared to the wind for fleetness, before they tasted the Trojan pastures, or drank of the Xanthus.  See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.274">Iliad 10</bibl> and the play <title>Rhesus</title> attributed to Euripides.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Dolonaque.</lemma> Dolon was a Trojan by birth, the son Eumedes. He was sent by Hector as a spy into the Grecian camp; and the horses of Achilles were promised to him, as a reward for eventual success. When he was discovered by Diomedes and Ulysses, they offered to spare his life, if he would reveal the counsels and schemes of the Trojans. He consented; and the <soCalled rend="italic">heroes</soCalled> treacherously slew him.  Some commentators note that it seems implausible that Penelope would remind her husband of an incident like this.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l46" type="commline" n="46">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ismariis equis</lemma>; Thracian horses, from Ismarus, a mountain of Thrace.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l53" type="commline" n="53">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">seges</lemma>:  Lucan, in the ninth book of his Pharsalia, introduces Cato as visiting the site of Troy:  "and he seels the famous vestiges of the Phoebean walls &mdash; the memorable name of burned Troy &mdash; now become barren woods, and the rotten trunks of trees. &mdash;  The whole of Troy is covered with shrubs;  even its ruins are gone."
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l54" type="commline" n="54">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Phrygio sanguine</lemma>; Phrygian or Trojan blood; for Troy was a city of Phrygia Minor, or Troas.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l63" type="commline" n="63">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pylon.</lemma> Telemachus, without his mother's knowlege, went to Pylos, to make inquiries respecting his father. There were three cities of this name in Peloponnesus. It is uncertain which of them belonged to Nestor; most are of opinion that his capital was situated between the others, to the south of the river Alpheus.  The form <foreign lang="la">Pylon</foreign> is a Greek accusative.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nele&iuml;a arva</lemma>; the same as Pylos; because there Neleus the father of Nestor reigned.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l65" type="commline" n="65">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sparten</lemma>; Sparta or Lacedaemon, where Menelaus reigned.

<div2 id="cp1l67" type="commline" n="67">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Moema Phoebi</lemma>; Troy. It is related that Apollo and Neptune assisted in building the walls of Troy, on the promise of a reward from Laomedon; but that, after the work was finished, he refused to adhere to his word.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l75" type="commline" n="75">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">vestra libido</lemma>:  She says <foreign lang="la">vestra</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="la">tua</foreign> because she is thinking of husbands in general.  Judging from what they do, she thinks Ulysses may be doing the same.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l76" type="commline" n="76">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Peregrino amore.</lemma> Penelope here only intimates the suspicions that were sometimes apt to rise in her mind As she was ignorant of what had happened to Ulysses since his departure from Troy, we can in no wise suppose that she alludes here to Calypso and Circe, as some have injudiciously imagined.  A later tradition says that Ulysses and Circe had a son, Telegonus, and that Ulysses and Calypso had a son, Auso, from whom Italy received the name Ausonia.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l81" type="commline" n="81">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Icarius.</lemma> Penelope was the daughter of Icarius and Polycaste. Her father, concluding from Ulysses' long absence that the would never return, importuned her incessantly to give over all thoughts of him, and marry Eurymachus, whom he favored beyond every other suitor.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l87" type="commline" n="87">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Dulichii</lemma>; Dulichium, an island to the west of Peloponnesus. It belonged to Ulysses and made a part of his kingdom.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Samii.</lemma> Samas was a name common to diverislands; but it is here meant of one adjacent to Ithaca, called more frequently Cephalenia. In it there was a city named Same.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Zacynthos</lemma>; an islaud south of Cephalenia.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l91" type="commline" n="91">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quid tibi Pisandrum.</lemma> Here she names a few of her lovers, to excite his indignation, and hasten his return to deliver her from their persecution.  Pisander was the son of Polyctor;  Medon was a herald.  It is hard to say why he is called <foreign lang="la">dirum</foreign>, since Ulysses spared him for his comparative inoffensiveness;  he had treated Ulysses well when Ulysses was a child (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 22.357">Od. 22.357</bibl>).
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l92" type="commline" n="92">

<div2 id="cp1l98" type="commline" n="98">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">La&euml;rtes</lemma>; the commonly reputed father of Ulysses, though some pretend that he was the son of Sisyphus. For, which his mother Anticlea was on the way to La&euml;rtes, she was ravished by Sisyphus; of which rape Ulysses was born. Ajax reproaches him with this in the 13th book of the Metamorphoses, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 13.26">26-31</bibl>.  See also Sophocles' <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 190">Ajax 190</bibl> and <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 417">Philoctetes 417</bibl>.  This version is not in Homer.

<div2 id="cp1l99" type="commline" n="99">

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sed neque La&euml;rtes.</lemma> She still continues to use the most persuasive arguments for his return. She lays before him the many inconveniences arising from his absence, all of which he could casily redress. La&euml;rtes was old, and unfit for arms; Telemachus young, and standing in need of the attention and instructions of a father. Her lovers were numerous, and threatened to use force: it was only from him therefore that relief could be expected.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp1l115" type="commline" n="115">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Certe ego.</lemma> Here she endeavours to move his compassion from a regard to herself. He had married her when young, and soon after marriage, left her. She had languished out the flower of her life in his absence; now age was growing upon her, her bloom and beauty began to fade; so that she must appear, at the time of his return, very different from what she was. 'Hasten then, my dear Ulysses, before all the remains of what formerly recommended me to you are lost.'

<head>PHYLLIS DEMOPHOONTI</head>
<p>Demopho&ouml;n, the son of Theseus king of Athens and Phaedra, as he was returning from the Trojan war, being attacked by a tempest, was obliged to put into Trace, at that time governed by Phyllis, the daughter of Lycurgus. He met with a very hospitable reception from her, and after some time was admitted to share her bed. But hearing of the death of Mnestheus, who, after the expulsion of Theseus, had taken possession of the government at Athens, and urged by a desire of rule, he resolved to sail for Athens, promising Phyllis that he would return in a month. But, when he had reached that city, he forgot his promise. Phyllis, therefore, after an absence of four months, wrote to him the above epistle, complaining of his breach of faith, and threatening herself with a violent death if he continued to neglect her.  This story is relatively unfamiliar because there are no other extensive treatments in surviving classical literature;  see the epitome of Apollodorus <bibl n="Apollod. Epit. E.6.16">6.16</bibl>, and note also Virgil, <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 5">Ecl. 5.10</bibl>, with Servius's note.

<head>BRISEIS ACHILLI</head>
<p>Upon the arrival of the Greeks in Phrygia, they attacked in a hostile manuer all the cities in the neighbourhood of Troy, particularly those over against Lesbos. Among the rest Achilles, the son of Peleus and Thetis, assaulted Theb&egrave; and Lyrnessus, and carried off two beautiful virgins; the one Astyone, daughter of Chryses priest of Apollo Smintheus, the other Hippodamia daughter of Brises, who were both afterwards named from their parents. Chryseis was given by Achilles to Agamemnon: Briseis he reserved for himself. But Agamemnon, being afterwards obliged (in compliance with the will of the gods) to restore Chryseis to her father, violently and unjustly deprived Achilles of his other captive (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 1">Iliad 1</bibl>). The hero, emaged at this insult, withdrew his forces, and refused to assist his country against the Trojans. The Greeks being several times worsted in the sequel, Agamemnon sent deputies to Achilles to appease him, with offers of Briseis, and considerable presents; all which he rejected (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.308">Iliad 9</bibl>). Upon this Briseis is supposed to write to him the following epistle, blaming his over-violent resentment, entreating him to accept the offers of Agamemnon, and take up arms against the Trojans.

She would even submit to ill treatment from the lady whom he might choose for the partner of his bed, rather than be absent from her beloved hero.

Upon this a war arising between the Curates and Calydonians, Meleager, terrified by the imprecations of his mother, would neither drive away the enemy, nor assist his country, though in the most imminent danger.

'It would be better to deprive me of life altogether, than keep me in this cruel uncertainty; but better still to preserve my life and happiness together, and prolong those days which are your own gift.

<head>PHAEDRA HIPPOLYTO</head>
<p>The Athenians having basely murdered Androgeos, the son of Minos king of Crete, he made war upon them, and compelled them to give seven of the sons of their nobility yearly, to be devoured by the Minotaur. The lot among others falling at last upon Thescus the king's son, he went into Crete, where he slew that monster, and at the same time happily escaped the Labyrinth by means of a clue, which he received of Ariadne, Minos' daughter. For this signal piece of service be engaged to marry her; and leaving Crete, took her and her sister Phaedra with him. But having afterwards, by the admonition of Bacchus, left Ariadne at Naxos, or as others will have it, at Chios, he married Phaedra her sister. Theseas had a son named Hippolytus, whom he had begotten on Hippolyte the Amazon. Of him Phaedra afterwards became enamoured, in her husband's absence. He, fond of a single life, and delighted only with hunting and the like exercises, made no returns to her passion. She is therefore supposed to write to him the following epistle, in which she confesses her love to him, and endeavours, by all the ways of art and persuasion, to inspire him with a mutual tenderness, and efface the horror which their being so nearly related might create against that infamous commerce.  Euripides treats the story in his <title>Hippolytus</title> and Seneca in his <title>Phaedra</title>.

He married Proeris, an Athenian princess, whom he loved in the highest degree. Aurora, who loved him, endeavored to gain him over, by making him jealous of Proeris. For this purpose she sent him hon e to her in the shape of a merchant. He, by offering her presents, at last brought her to yield to him; upon which, resumming his own shape, he reproached her with her baseness. Being at length reconciled to him, she gave him a dart which should never miss its aim. With this he afterwards slew her by mistake in a thicket, to which she had retired to watch him. We are not therefore to suppose, when the poet says,

Her love was at last changed into hatred; and, burning with a desire of revenge, she accused him, to Theseus, of having offered violence to her person. He, finding his father inclined to believe her, fled. But his chariot-horses being frighted by some seacalves, that were by chance on the shore, ran towards the mountains, where his chariot was dashed to pieces, and himself slain.

<head>OENONE PARIDI</head>
<p>When Hecuba, the daughter of Cisscus and wife of Priam, was pregnant with Paris, she dreamed that she was delivered of a burning terch, which set all Troy in flames. Priam, terrified at the presage, applied to the Oracle; and being told that he should have a son who would prove the cause of his country's ruin, ordered that the child as soon as born should be slain. But Hecuba, unable to shake off the feelings of a mother, delivered him to the king's shepherds, with orders to bring him up privately. He, when he grew up, became enamored of the Nymph Oenone, and, as some will have it, married her.

Oenone reminds Paris of those once agreeable seenes, when they were sharers in the same amusements: when he had indulged his poetic vein in her praise, and carved her name on the barks of trees.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Qua Venus et Juno.</lemma> The story here alluded to, is one of the most remarkable in antiquity. From this seemingly small beginning, arose the rape of Helen, the confederacy of the Greeks, the overthrow of Troy, and the dispersion of the victorious fleet, whence so many Grecian colonies were planted in different parts of the world. The story itself was of the following tenor. The gods and goddesses being invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, Discord only was overlooked. The goddess, enraged at the neglect, waited for an opportunity of revenge. With this view, while Jupiter, Juno, Venus, and Pallas, were sitting together, she threw an apple amongst them, on which were written these words; 'Let it be given to the fairest.' Upon this a dispute arose, which of the three goddesses had the best pretension to the prize; for, as it is natural to be partial in our own cause, each maintained that it could belong only to her. Jupiter, unwilling to decide in a matter so nice and intricate, as foreseeing that to whichsoever candidate it was adjudged, he must incur the displeasure of the other two, referred them to the determination of Paris. This youth had been bred up among Priam's shepherds, and was at that time attending the flocks on mount Ida. Thither the goddesses repaired; and, as they were eagerly bent upon the prize, each endeavored to influence his decision by large offers. Juno promised him a kingdom; Pallas, wisdom and prudence; and Venus, the finest woman in the world. Paris gave sentence in favor of Venus, either from a regard to justice, or because her promises best
</p>
<p>suited his temper. Soon after, he was acknowleged by Priam; and, being sent ambas-ador to Sparta, was received in a hospitable and friendly manner by Menclaus the king. Being captivated by the beauty of Helen, and having gained her by his artifices and solicitations, he perfidiously carried her off, while her husband Menelaus was in Crete. This gave rise to the Trojan was, and all the memorable events that attended it; in which the gods and goddesses bore so large a share. Oenone therefore had just reason to complain of this fatal day, because it eventually deprived her of her beloved husband.

<head>HYPSIPYLE JASONI</head>
<p>Pelias, the son of Neptune, was warned by an oracle, that his death would approach, when one barefooted should come to him as he was sacrificing: it happened that, as he was engaged in the celebration of some annual sacred rites, Jason the son of Aeson, having left his shoe in the mud of the river Anaurus, and hastening to be present at the sacrifice, met him. Pelias, mindful of the oracle, endeavoured to persuade Jason to undertake an expedition to Colchis, in order to make himself master of the golden fleece, hoping he would never return, because he had heard it was a work beyond human power to accomplish. Jason, a youth of great courage and magnanimity, readily engaged in the attempt; and, having associated with him a great number of gallant adventurers, set sail in the ship Argo from Thessaly, and soon after arrived at the isle of Lemnos.  Not long before this, the women had with common consent murdered, in one night, all the men in the island, except one. Hypsipyle, the daughter of Thoas, had saved her father by the pretence of having killed him, and was at this time queen of the Lemnians. She, conceiving a passion for Jason, admitted him both to her house and bed. After continuing here two years, his companions urged him to proceed on the promised expedition; he left Hypsipyle pregnant, and set sail for Colchis. Medea, the king's daughter, having an amorous regard for him, by her magic art lulled asleep the vigilant dragon, and tamed the brazen-footed bulls; by which means he obtained the golden fleece; and, leaving Colchis, carried off Medea also, who desired to follow him. Hypsipyle, enraged that Medea was preferred to her, sends this letter, congratulating Jason on his safe return. Afterwards exposing the cruelty and enchantments of Medea, she endeavours to bring her into contempt, and make him sensible of her own superior merit. Lastly, she loads both him and Medea with imprecations.</p>
<p>The story of Jason's quest appears in Pindar's <bibl n="Pind. P. 4">Pythian 4</bibl> and in the <title>Argonautica</title> of Apollonius of Rhodes.  The episode of the Lemnian Women is summarized in Apollodorus <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.17">1.9.17</bibl>.

Hypsipyle, however, spared secretly her father Thoas; and he was carried by Bacchus into the island Thoas.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Scilicet ut tauros.</lemma> Let us here admire the artifice and ingenuity of the poet, what different shapes he assumes, and how artfully he makes every thing serve his purpose. Hypsipyle endeavours here to withdraw Jason's affection from Medea. For this purpose she represents her in such a light as may create horror; she alarms his fears, and would persuade him that he cannot safely trust himself with her. Lastly, under an appearance of weakening her own arguments, she adds double strength to them. She insinuates that his case was desperate, and that he was a mere slave unable to shake off the yoke. She knew his generous heroic temper, and hoped that, to clear himself from such an imputation, he would endeavour to subdue that hated passion.

She also sent wild-fire in a cabinet to Creusa, who opening it, the fire burst forth and consumed her and the whole palace. Hyginus tells us, that Jason perished also in this conflagration. But others assure us to the contrary, and that he intended to have killed Medea for this outrage; but that she, for farther revenge, then, and not before, slew both his children in his sight, and fled to Athens, where she married old aegeus, and had by him a son called Medus. At last she raised clouds and winds, by which she was carried through the air, with her son, into that part of Asia which from him was called Media.

<head>DIDO AENEAE</head>
<p>After the destruction of Troy by the Greeks, Aeneas, the son of Anchises and Venus, having saved his domestic Gods and those of his country from the flames, and collected what number he could of the vanquished Trojans, put to sea in a fleet of twenty ships. Being overtaken by several storms, and tossed from sea to sea, he was at last thrown upon the coast of Libya, where at that time, according to the fiction of Virgil, Dido reigned (<bibl n="Verg. A. 1.340">Aen. 1.340</bibl>). This princess was the daughter of Belus, and wife to Sichaeus the priest of Hercules. Her brother Pygmalion, king of Tyre, being of an avaricious disposition, and imagining that Sichaeus possessed great treasures, murdered him for the sake of his wealth. As soon as this was known by Dido, she left Tyre, accompanied with such as were disgasted at the tyrant, and, landing in Africa, built Carthage. The town was approaching to completion, when Aeneas was driven upon that coast. He applied to the queen, and was hospitably received. Being after some time admonished by Mercury (<bibl n="Verg. A. 4.265">Aen. 4.265</bibl>), he prepared to sail for Italy, the country promised to him by Fate. Dido, who had been seized with a violent passion for him, upon hearing the fatal news, endeavors by this epistle to divert him from his intention, and threatens, in case of refusal, to put an end to her own life.

According to him, Aeneas, missing his wife, whom he had ordered to follow him, went back in quest of her, and exposed himself to infinite dangers amidst the crowds of his enemies, but in vain; the Fates had decreed their separation, and destined for Aeneas another country and spouse.

<head>HERMIONE ORESTAE</head>
<p>Hermione, the daughter of Menelaus and Helena, was, in the absence of her father, who had engaged in the Trojan war, betrothed to Orestes, the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, by Tyndareus, her grandfather by the mother's side; to whom Menelaus had committed the care of his family in his absence. Menelaus, in the mean time, ignorant of what had been done by Tyndareus, had promised his daughter to Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, who, by virtue of this, claimed her at his return from Troy, and carried her away by force. But Hermione, averse to an union with Pyrrhus, and passionately fond of Orestes, admonishes him by a messenger, that she might easily be recovered out of the hands of Pyrrhus. Orestes readily took the hint. Having revenged his father's death, by killing Aegisthus and his mother, he slew Pyrrhus in the temple of Apollo, and brought back his Hermione.</p>

<div1 type="poem" n="9">
<head>DEIANIRA HERCULI</head>
<p>Jupiter loved Alcmena; and, assuming the appearance of her husband Amphitryon, he by that stratagem obtained her, and begot Hercules (cf. Plautus, <title>Amphytrion</title>). Juno, inflamed with jealousy, and full of hatred to the offspring of this stolen embrace, persuaded Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, to join with her in attempting to destroy it; which he endeavoured to effect by urging Hercules to bold and perilous undertakings. But he had the good fortune to be always victorious. Yet this hero, though superior to all monsters, proved an unequal match for love. He married Deianira, daughter of oeneus, king of aetolia, who had before been betrothed to Achelous; with whom Hercules disputing for her, had the advantage. Afterwards in crossing a river, Nessus the Centaur offered his assistance to carry her over. Waiting till Hercules was on the other side, he attempted to ravish her. The hero, perceiving his design, pierced him with an arrow that had been poisoned in the blood of the monster Hydra. Nessus, dying, presented Deianira with a garment dipped in his own blood; assuring her, that it would prevent her husband from wavering in his affections. It was not long before Hercules gave proof of his inconstancy; for, becoming enamored of Iole, the daughter of Eurytus king of oechalia, he applied to her father for permission to espouse her. His suit being rejected, he captured the city, slew the king, and carried off the princess. His passion for her rose to such a degree of extravagance, that at her desire he laid aside his club, lion's skin, and other badges of heroism, and, putting on woman's apparel, was not ashamed to spin among her maids. Deianira, hearing of this degeneracy, and giving credit to the words of the Centaur, sent him the poisoned shirt. This present was soon after followed by the epistle now before us, in which she upbraids him with his unmanly weakness, and endeavours to awaken him to a sense of glory, by reminding him of his past actions. But hearing, before she concluded her letter, the fatal effects of the shirt, she exclaims against her own rashness, and threatens to end her life by her own hands.  Sophocles treats this story in his <title>Trachiniae.</title></p>
<p>Some writers take notice of a distich prefixed also to this epistle, as we have before observed with regard to several others:
<quote lang="la"><l>Mittor ad Alciden a conjuge conscia mentis</l>

Juno, wishing to destroy Hercules, applied to him; and by her solicitations prevailed so far, that he set Hercules upon several hazardous attempts, in the hope that in some he might miscarry. But all this tended only to increase his fame, and to place his glory in a more conspicuous point of view; for he had the good fortune to be always conqueror, and thus gained the character of a complete hero.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Una recens.</lemma> This is not to be understood of Iole, but of Omphale, queen of Lydia, to whom Hercules subjected himself in the most servile manner, receiving with submission all her commands.

<head>ARIADNE THESEO</head>
<p>Minos, the son of Jupiter and Europa, offended with the Athenians, because they had murdered his son Androgeos, made war upon them, and obliged them to send yearly seven young men, and as many virgins, to be devoured by the Minotaur. At last the lot fell upon Theseus, who, arriving in Crete, slew the Minotaur; and being instructed by Ariadne how to escape out of the labyrinth, afterwards fled with her to the isle of Naxos. There, admonished by Bacchus, he left Ariadne, and carried Phaedra her sister (whom he had also brought with him,) forward to Athens. She, awaking, and not finding him, writes this epistle, in which she accuses him of perfidy and inhumanity, and endeavours to move him to compassion, by a mournful representation of her misery.

He is industrious in tormenting himself, and collects in his mind all the images of misery with which he can be assaulted. This is exactly the case of Ariadne. She is left in a desert island, without a friend to protect her; and, as she apprehends, surrounded with wild beasts. We are not to wonder, therefore, that she is alarmed with the foresight of imaginary dangers. Such fear is natural, and what might be expected from her in these circumstances.

For this reason she here paints, in the strongest colors, her distressed situation, her fears and anxieties, and the mischief which she had committed upon herself in her despair. The whole forms such a lively picture of misery and distress, that we cannot enough admire the happy imagination of the poet, in being thus able to assemble a set of ideas so well fitted to answer his aim of exciting sympathy and compassion. With her bitterest reproaches she mingles tenderness and affection. One may easily perceive, that love is deeply looted in her heart, while her invectives proceed from a sense of injury. She concludes in the most affecting manner: 'Return, if it be only to pay me the last duties, and collect my scattered bones.' For the

<p>ancients thought it a great misfortune to go without a burial. We have different accounts given us of the fate of Ariadne.

<head>CANACE MACAREO</head>
<p>Macareus and Canace, son and daughter of Aeolus, God of the winds, indulging a criminal passion for each other, concealed their familiarity under the pretence of consanguinity. At last, Canace, proving with child, was, by the contrivance of her old nurse, privately delivered of a son. Aeolus sitting at that time with his council in the great hall, through which the only passage out of the palace from Canace's chamber lay; the nurse found means to carry off the child, under pretence of being engaged in the celebration of sacred rites. But when the nurse had almost made her way through the hall, the unhappy infant betrayed himself to his grandfather by crying. Aeolus, astonished at what he heard, and discovering the real case, was incensed in the highest degree at the impiety of his children, and commanded the innocent babe to be exposed to wild beasts. Reflecting upon the disgrace of such an amour, he sent an officer to Canace with a drawn sword, and ordered her to use it as she was conscious her late impiety deserved. Canace is supposed to have slain herself with it. But before she gave the fatal blow, she writes this letter to Macareus, who had taken refuge in the temple of Apollo; in which she pathetically represents her case, inveighs against her father's cruelty, and begs he will gather up the hones of the exposed innocent, and deposit them in the same urn with her own.</p>
<p>Although the story is not well known any more, it must have been more familiar in antiquity.  Plato uses Macareus, along with Thyestes and Oedipus, as an example of a particularly horrendous type of crime (<bibl n="Plat. Laws 838c">Laws 838c</bibl>).

And this he might easily have done, since, according to some, Aeolus was the son of Jupiter. But, not to be too rash in passing a censure on the poet, it must be owned that the race of Aeolus is very obscure, and little known, and that mythologists differ very much in their sentiments about it. Hence it was the poet's business to derive Canace from Jupiter by a long series of ancestors, both on the father's and mother's side."

<head>MEDEA JASONI</head>
<p>Jason, upon his arrival in Colchis, was kindly treated by Medea, the daughter of Aeetes, king of that country; and she soon become enamored of him. The conditions of obtaining the prize being proposed to Jason, he, despairing of success without assistance, applied to Medea, who, when he promised marriage, enabled him by her instructions to surmount every difficulty. After obtaining the golden fleece, he fled privately from Colchis his with Medea; who, hearing that Aeetes was in close pursuit of her, cut in pieces the body of her brother Absyrtus, and strewed his mangled limbs along the road, that her father might be retarded in gathering up the bones of his son. By this artifice the fugitives were enabled to reach Thessaly in safety; and Medea restored Aeson, Jason's father, worn out with years, to youth. Jason afterwards transferred his love to Creusa, daughter of Creon king of Corinth, and married her. Medea, enraged at his perfidy, writes this epistle, in which she charges him with the highest ingratitude, and threatens a speedy revenge, unless he would restore her to her former place in his affections.  Both Euripides and Seneca wrote plays called <title>Medea</title>;  so did Ovid, but only two lines of it survive:  <quote lang="la">Servare potui: perdere an possim, rogas?</quote>, quoted by Quintilian, and <quote lang="la">Feror huc illuc, vae, plena deo</quote>, quoted by Seneca.
</p>
<p>Critics, in this Epistle, as in the rest, have furnished us with two lines for an exordium.
<quote lang="la"><l>Exul, inops, contempta novo Medea marito</l>
<l>Dicit, an a regnis temporo nulla vacant.</l></quote>

Many of Ovid's Epistles begin thus: and it is a particular beauty in them, though some injudicious crities have pretended to supply these seeming defects.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Colchorum.</lemma> The Colchi were a people of Scythia, inhabiting the eastern side of the Euxine Sea. She calls herself the queen of this country, as being the daughter of Aeetes the king.</p>

The poets represent this by a thread in which each Sister had a separate province. The first was employed to spin it out, the second to wind it up, and the third to cut it, and thereby put an end to life. This may serve to illustrate the manner of expression used in the next verse, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Fusos evoluisse meos</lemma>; 'ought to have wound up the thread of my life,' <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">i. e.</lemma> finished my days.

His charms were such as might easily ensnare an innocent unpractised heart. Add to all this, the irresistible eloquence of a smooth and deceitful tongue. It is certain, that where a man's person has already prepossessed us in his favour, we (but more particularly females) are willing to believe every thing he says, especially if it be what we ourselves with for. This weakness every one feels in himself in some degree or other, and therefore will be the more apt to excuse it.

<p>Virgil was, without doubt, a greater master in every kind of poetry than Ovid; and it must be owned there are some soft and tender strokes in these lines that affect us strongly; yet both poets have suited their subject to their design, and in that light equally merit our praise. Virgil depicts a tender complaining passion, that urges the lover to end his misery with his life: Ovid describes a strong and violent one, that, slighted, pushes on to revenge. They both imitate Theocritus. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ut vidit, ut periit, ut in profundum satlavit amorem.</lemma> Idyll. iii. ver. 42.

When Jason was in the Colchian capital, pressed with the dangers that attended his enterprise, and saw no other relief but in Medea, he addressed her with suppliant humility. He thought it the greatest happiness to enjoy her favor, and dreaded that she might despise him as a stranger. Now the case is changed. He had obtained his great object, brought his enterprise to a successful issue, and escaped safe with Medea into Thessaly. As he has now no pressing interest to bias him, his heart is more open to impressions from others. A more advantageous match offering itself, Medea is soon abandoned, and reduced to supplicate in her turn.</p>

It was thought extremely dangerous to sail between them, because, if by any accident the ship should be detained longer than was expected, these rocks, running together, would be sure to crush her in pieces. Jason is related to have passed between these rocks with imminent danger of his ship; for it is said, that the rocks, meeting before the ship had passed quite through, carried off her stern. What probably gave rise to this fable was the appearance of these rocks to ships that sail between them; for, in bearing down upon them, while the ship is yet at some distance, they seem to be joined in one: but, as she approaches nearer, they by degrees open; and, when ressels have passed through them, and have proceeded to some distance on the other side, they again seem to run together and unite. This, in the first ages of he world, while navigation was yet in its infancy, and the plgenomena of vision were little understood, might pass among ignorant people for a real motion in these rocks; and hence arose this monstrous fiction.

Scylla was a huge rock, round which the waves constantly dashing, and throwing up great quantities of foam, the poets, on account of the great noise and roaring always heard in this place, feigned that she was a monster, resembling in the upper part a woman, but from the middle downward surrounded with sea-dogs and wolves, or other noisy harking monsters. They tell us that she was a nymph of Crete, and daughter of Phorcus: that Glaucus the sea-god fell in love with her, and met with an equal return of passion. Circe loved Glaucus at the same time; and being fille! with indignation that her rival Scylla was preferred, poisoned the fountain in which she used to wash herself. The nymph, ignorant of what had been done against her, came to the fountain, according to custom, to bathe; which she had no sooner entered, than she perceived that from the middle downward she was a monster and an object of horror. Deeply regretting the loss of her former beauty, she threw herself into the neighbouring sea, where she was changed into a rock that afterwards became famous for shipwrecks. This is the Scylla most commonly referred to by the poets. But Ovid here seems to confound her with another Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, king of the Megarensians. She, becoming enamored of Minos while he besieged Mesara, betrayed to him her father and country; but he afterwards despised and abandoned her. Hence we have the reason of Medea's saying,
<quote lang="la"><l>Debuit ingratis Scylla nocere viris:</l></quote></p>

In this train of reflection it would naturally come into her mind, that their discourse must sometimes turn upon her; and as she was no stranger to the structure of the human heart, especially of a heart in love, she easily concludes, that Jason, upon these occasions, would endeavour to recommend himself to his new mistress, by depreciating and undervaluing her charms, and that she, on the other side, would feel a sensible joy to be thus preferred to her rival.

<div1 type="poem" n="13">
<head>LAODAMIA PROTESILAO</head>
<p>While the Greeks were preparing for their expedition against Troy. Protesilaus, the son of Iphiclus, as we learn from Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.695">Il. 2.695 ff</bibl>), joined them with forty ships. The fleet being detained by contrary winds at Aulis, the oracle was consulted; and the answer imported, that, as Agamemnon, the general of the confederates, had offended Diana by killing one of her stags, nothing less would appease the goddess for that offence, than the sacrifice of one of his children. Iphigenia was proposed as the victim for a propitious voyage. During the time that the fleet lay thus wind-bound, Laodamia, the daughter of Acastus, and wife to Protesilaus, (one who sincerely loved her husband, and had often been alarmed by ominous dreams), is supposed to have written this epistle, in which she endeavours to dissuade him from engaging in the war. The Greeks had been told by the oracle, that whoever should first set foot upon Trojan ground was doomed to fall. Laodamia is unable to dissemble her concern; and knowing him to have a brave undaunted soul, desires him, for her sake, not to be too forward, but remember that her life depends upon his, and that the same wound must prove equally fatal to both. In fine, she exacts this as a testimony of the continuance of his affection; and tells him that she will judge of his love for her, by the care he takes of himself.

Nothing is more common, when any disaster happens to us, than to examine all the minute circumstances which contributed to it, and lament that they were not prevented.

As Menelaus was determined, if possible, to recover Helen, and avenge the injury done him by Paris, he had engaged almost ail Greece to take up arms in his cause, and was conducting into Asia a set of troops healed by the flower of the Grecian princes. As Troy was a very powerful city, it was natural to think that much blood must be shed in this war, and many thousands lose their lives. Laodamia, who was apprehensive for her husband, quickly foresees this, and prays God to avert the omen from her. "Alas, Menelaus, the revenge you now take will he mournful to many: wives shall grieve for the loss of their husbands, and children for their parents; but grant, Heaven, that I may avaid so terrible a calamity."

The fame and wealth of Troy, the number of tributary provinces, and improbability that Paris would have engaged in an attempt so hazardous, had he not known that his strength was equal to it, must all appear terrible to her. The sentiments are admirably adapted both to the person and her circumstances. Fear multiplies dangers, and begets a thousand foreboding apprehensions.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Parcite, Dardanidae.</lemma> This name was given to the Trojans by Dardanus, one of their kings. There is great eloquence in the manner in which the poet makes her address the Trojans.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Fortius ille potest.</lemma> The sentiment is beautiful, and happy beyond expression. Laodamia had felt the power of Protesilaus in the combats of love, and, as she found her heart wholly devoted to him, might easily think him invincible in that respect. But to his talent for war she was quite a stranger, and was, moreover, desirous that his inclinations might not lead him to it, lest it should prompt him to expose himself too much to danger. We shall see that Protesilaus distinguished himself no less by his bravery, than by his turn for gallantry.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sors quoque nescio quem.</lemma> The Greeks had been informed by the oracle, that he of their number who should first set foot upon Trojan ground was doomed to fall. Laodamia, whose fears gave her a thousand apprehensions, begs that he will not be too rash, and expose himself to an unavoidable fate. This proved to be his case in the sequel: for, when the Grecian fleet arrived in Phrygia, almost every one, mindful of the prediction of the oracle, scrupled to be the first that landed: till at length Protesilaus, full of indignation at such unmanly delays, boldly leaped on shore, and was soon after slain by Hector.

She cannot forbear entertaining her mind with the agreeable imagination of his return, and the happy scenes that will then pass between them. Her near concern for him will make her anxious to know all that happened to him during his absence: he must gratify her curiosity, by relating every thing distinctly. As he will have frequent occasion to mention his dangers and narrow escapes, her joy to find him still safe, will be apt to express itself in fond and endearing caresses. These will produce an agreedle interruption of his recital, and make him enter again upon the story with fresh pleasure.

<p>Heinsius, on the other hand, thinks that it ought to be,</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sed quid ego hos revoco? revocaminis omen abesto.</lemma></p>
<p>But however we determine as to the reading, the
</p>
<p>sense is plain. Laodamia fearing that her recalling might imply some bad omen, stops short, and wishes a prosperous gale, and speedy arrival on the coast of Troy.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp13l137" type="commline" n="137">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Troasin invideo.</lemma> The sentiment is ingenious, and agrees with that strength of passion which Laodamia breathes through this whole epistle. Every one knows, that nothing is more irksome to lovers than absence. Laodamia is so impatient under it, that she thinks any condition preferable to hers. The Trojan matrons were far happier, although spectators of the danger and fate of their husbands. They were employed in many grateful offices about them, buckled on their armour, charged them with their last commands, and were at once delivered from the tortures of a cruel suspense; whereas her fate was to be distracted between hope and fear, while her foreboding mind suggested a thousand dangers, and kept her under perpetual anxieties and alarms.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Illi blanditias, illi tibi debita verba.</lemma> One may observe of this epistle, what has been so
</p>
<p>often observed of Homer's poems; that the poet, far from shewing his whole strength at the entrance of his work, still grows upon his reader, and increases his admiration the farther he proceeds. After the endearing expressions of love and tenderness which we meet with in the foregoing parts of this epistle, and the natural and strong images by which Laodamia paints so powerfully her affectionate feelings, one would think it impossible to carry this passion to a greater height. And yet, behold a new seene presented to us; a seene, that nothing less than the happy imagination of an Ovid could have devised. Her only compensation for the absence of Protesilaus, is an image of him which she often took a pleasure in viewing. To this she contracts a fondness, and gives it the same caresses which she was wont to give her Protesilaus. To such a height is her love carried at last, that she is apt to imagine it more than barely an image. She fancies, it wants only a voice to be Protesilaus himself, and vainly complains to it, as if she expected an answer.

<head>HYPERMNESTRA LYNCEO</head>
<p>Danaus, the son of Belus, had by several wives fifty daughters; Aegyptus his brother, who had the like number of sons, wished to have them for his daughters-in-law, and applied to Danaus for this purpose. But he having been told by an oracle that he should fall by the hands of a son-in-law, and willing, if possible, to avoid the danger, took shipping, and possessed himself of Argos. Aegyptus, enraged to find himself thus slighted, levied a great army; and, putting his sons at the head of it, sent it into Greece, with an express command not to return till they had either slain Danaus, or obliged him to consent to receive them as his sons-in-law. He, finding himself pressed by a close siege, was under the necessity of promising them his daughters: but they having all received swords from their father, by his command killed their husbands on the first night, while warm with wine and joy they lay fast asleep; Hypermnestra only excepted, who spared her husband Lynceus, and, acquainting him with the treachery of Danaus, advised him to fly with all speed to his father Aegyptus. Danaus, finding that his commands had been strictly followed by all his daughters, except Hypermnestra, was so enraged at her disobedience, that he loaded her with chains, and threw her into prison. Upon this she wrote the following epistle to her husband, in which she begs him to come to her assistance, or, if she should be put to death before he can bring her relief, to bestow upon her the rites of burial. Lynceus, after revenging the murder of his brothers by her father's death, restored her to liberty.</p>
<p>Aeschylus treated this story in a connected trilogy.  The first play, <title>Suppliant Women</title>, survives but the other two are lost.  Pindar begins <bibl n="Pind. N. 10">Nemean 10</bibl> with an allusion to the story.

<div2 id="cp14l1" type="commline" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Mittit.</lemma> Hypermnestra, in her application to Lynceus, artfully begins with such a representation of her case as may most effectually awaken his resentment, and beget in him a desire of revenge. She reminds him that he was the only surviving brother of fifty, all the rest having been cut off by the barbarous contrivance of her father; and that all her sufferings were occasioned by her tenderness for him. Yet far from repenting of it, the reflection always gave her pleasure; nor would all the tortures and miseries in the world be able to make her own the contrary. How could Lynceus deny his aid to one that had treated him so generously, or avoid attempting to rescue her from that bondage into which she was thrown for preserving his life?

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ultima pars lucis, primaque noctis erat.</lemma> Heinsius, upon the authority of some manuscripts, gives a very different reading of this verse; which he thinks ought to be thus:
<quote lang="la"><l>Ultima pars noctis primaque lucis erat.</l></quote></p>
<p>Whatever ground that celebrated critic may have for this conjecture, we do not think proper to follow it in this place; for the commonly received reading agrees better with the notion of the marriage ceremonies. Besides, Hypermnestra speaks afterwards of their going to sleep; that during this the massacre was committed, while all Argos was in profound quiet; and that at length morning approached.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Et tamen audibam.</lemma> The force of the particle <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tamen,</lemma> in this verse, deserves particular notice. Hypermnestra would intimate by it, that she was so disturbed by fear, and a consciousness of the baseness of the crime, as to be deprived almost of her senses, and doubtful whether she really heard the groans of people dying round her, or might be deceived by the suggestions of fancy.

</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l49" type="commline" n="49">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sed timor et pietas.</lemma> The inward struggles between her piety, the fear of disobeying a father's command, and a horror of the guilt, are here very happily described. She knew that by saving her husband she would draw upon herself her father's resentment, to whose revengeful temper she was no stranger. This sense of danger urges her several times to the attempt; but still an inward restraint withholds her hand; till at length her piety prevailing, she resolves to run all hazards, rather than shed innocent blood.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l61" type="commline" n="61">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quo meruere necem.</lemma> This speech of Hypermnestra, is not without its propriety. The poet artfully puts into her mouth a set of arguments the most proper for one of her sex and condition; such as, that her father's commands were cruel and unjust; that it was not for a woman to handle deadly weapons: besides, her husband could be charged with no crime that deserved so severe a fate; or, even if his guilt should be admitted, hers was an unfit hand to punish him. The whole is mixed with a certain tenderness that pleases the reader, and produces an esteem for Hypermnestra.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l85" type="commline" n="85">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Scilicet ex illo.</lemma> The poet observes the same conduct here, as he has in other epistles; that is, he makes Hypermnestra, after the manner of her sex, trace her disasters from remote events. She considers them as the vengeance of Juno still pursuing her race, because Io had rivaled her in the affections of Jupiter.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l86" type="commline" n="86">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quo bos ex homine est.</lemma> Io, the daughter of Inachus, captivated Jupiter by her remarkable beauty. Juno having almost surprised them together, the God, to avoid suspicion, changed Io into a cow. His jealous wife, suspecting the device, begged that he would make her a present of the cow. Fearing that a denial would only inflame her suspicions, he complied with her request; and the transformed favourite was given in charge to Argus, who had a hundred eyes. Jupiter, after some time, sent Mercury to restore Io, and destroy Argus. The God, by the power of his music, lulled him asleep, and then slew him. Io was at length restored to her former shape in aegypt, and worshiped by the people of that country as a goddess, under the name of Isis. We have already seen that Danaus and Aegyptus were among her descendants.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l89" type="commline" n="89">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Liquidi parentis</lemma>; she being, as was said above, the daughter of the river Inachus. This description of Io's astonishment and behaviour, after being changed into a cow, is extremely poetical. Ovid had a great command of wit; and critics have not failed to accuse him as too lavish of it. This is perhaps an instance. He may appear to some rather too long and circumstantial in the account; and, toward the end of it, degenerates into a mere play upon words: but, after all, we ought in justice to acknowlege the beauty of the first part of this description. Io's alarm at her new shape, upon first perceiving it in her father's stream, is finely imagined, and one of those happy pictures for which Ovid is so justly admired.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l94" type="commline" n="94">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quid numeras</lemma>; Because she had now four feet. These interrogations involve the idea of commiseration.

<div2 id="cp14l98" type="commline" n="98">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Et ne te feriant quae geris, arma times.</lemma> The thought is natural and well-judged. As that sex is apt to be frightened at the appearance of danger, we are not to wonder that Io was startled when she observed her horns, and under some dread that she might wound herself with them.

<div2 id="cp14l102" type="commline" n="102">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Dat mare, dant amnes.</lemma> The sense of this verse is the same with that of the preceding, though they differ in words: for <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">dent ciam</lemma> means no other than <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">you force your way through them.</lemma>

<quote lang="la"><l>Tu tibi dax comiti, tu comes ipsa duci,</l></quote></p>
<p>is an instance of that trifling with words, for which, as has been before observed, our poet is often severely censured by the critics.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l107" type="commline" n="107">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nilus</lemma>; a famons river of aegypt, that runs into the sea through seven mouths, which the poet calls <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">partus,</lemma> flood-gates. It was in aegypt that Io recovered her former shape, and was advanced to by a goddless.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ultima quid referam.</lemma> The celebrated Heinsius imagines that we ought to read <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">refero</lemma>; which he thinks so necessary to the sense, as to insist strongly for it, contrary to the authority of the majority of manuscripts. It is, however, difficult to discover upon what he can found so strong a conjecture; for this other reading seems rather to embarrass and couture the sense, which is abundantly clear without any such alteration. Hypermnestra intimates to her husband, that she could relate much more concerning Io, by which her hard fate, and the merciless rage of Juno toward all of that race, would appear, did not the present times afford her ample matter of complaint. The sense, in this way of explaining, is plain and pertinent. Perhaps it may be said that she had already related the whole story of Io. But to this is may he answered, that, if she had memioned the chief circumstances of it, she had not displayed it with ail those strong figures and expressions which poetry allows.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quorum mihi cana senectus auctor</lemma>; that is, <gloss lang="la">Quae a senibus didici</gloss>; for it is probable that there were yet no written histories of past transactions, which were handed down only by tradition.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l111" type="commline" n="111">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Bella pater patruusque gerunt.</lemma> She descends now to what had happened within her own time: her father and uncle are at war. This, as we have related above, was occasioned by the refusal of Danaus to match his fifty daughters to the fifty sons of Aegyptus. Fearing his brother's resentment, he fled into Peloponnesus, whither Aegyptus sent an army after him, under the command of his fifty sons. Thus a war commenced between the brothers.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l112" type="commline" n="112">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ultimus orbis.</lemma> So she calls Peloponnesus, either because she really fancied so, being ignorant of the true extent of the world, as Peloponnesus seemed to her to be at a vast distance from aegypt; or because, being surrounded by the sea, it appeared to be the boundary of that part of the world. It was in this last sense that the ancients called Britain, another world.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l117" type="commline" n="117">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Periere sorores.</lemma> She considered her sisters as lost to her, because they had forfeited that title by their barbarity.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l121" type="commline" n="121">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Centesima</lemma>; for there were fifty daughters of Danaus, and a like number of sons of Aegyptus; and, as they were cousins to each other, they are called, by Hypermnestra, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">consanguinea turba.</lemma>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp14l123" type="commline" n="123">

<head>SAPPHO PHAONI</head>
<p>Phaon, a youth of exquisite beauty, was deeply enamored of Sappho, from whom he met with the tenderest returns of passion: but his affection afterwards decaying, he left her, and sailed for Sicily. She, unable to bear the loss of her lover, hearkened to all the mad suggestions of despair, and seeing no other remedy for her present miseries, resolved to throw herself into the sea from Leucate, a promontory of Acarnania, which was thought a care in cases of obstinate love, and therefore had obtained the name of the Lover's Leap. But before she ventured upon this last step, entertaining still some fond hopes that she might be able to reclaim her inconstant, she wrote this epistle, in which she gives a strong picture of her distress and misery, occasioned by his absence; and endeavours, by artful insinuations and pathetic expressions, to soothe him to softness and a mutual feeling.  Strabo mentions this story in his description of Leucas (<bibl n="Strab. 10.2.9">10.2.9</bibl>).
</p>
<div2 id="cp15l1" type="commline" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ecquid.</lemma> This manner of beginning serves very much to heighten the compassion of the reader; who has here before his eyes a lady full of her tenderest sentiments of love, and yet so far neglected by the person beloved, that, notwithstanding the mutual endearments which had often passed between them, he had entirely banished her from his remembrance, insomuch that he would not know even her writing, but by seeing her name subscribed.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp15l4" type="commline" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sapphus.</lemma> As Sappho made a considerable figure in the poetical world, and as her remaining fragments are still in the highest esteem, the render will probably expect a particular account of her. She was of Lesbos; and as she grew up, discovered a great genius for lyric poetry. She seems to have had no great reputation for chastity, even in her youngest years: and is even taxed with an impure and guilty love towards the Lesbian ladies her contemporaries. But at last an unhappy passion for Phaon engrossed her whole soul, and proved the occasion of great calamities to her. He at first returned her passion, but afterwards neglected her. Love, however, had taken too deep root in her heart to be extinguished by this slight. She resolved to find him at all hazards, and made a voyage into Sicily for that purpose. In that island, and on this occasion, she is supposed to have written her hymn to Venus, so justly celebrated and admired. It did not procure her the happiness for which she prayed. Phaon still continued obdurate; and Sappho, raving with passion, resolved to seek the Acarnanian promontory, on the summit of which was a temple sacred to Apollo. In this temple it was usual for despairing lovers to make their vows, and beg the favor and protection of the God. This done, they threw themselves from the precipice into the sea, where they were sometimes taken up alive. Whether the fright they had been in, or the resolution that could push them to so dreadful a remedy, or the bruises which they often received in their fall, banished all the tender sentiments of love, and gave their spirits another turn, it was observed, that those who had taken this leap, never relapsed into that passion. Sappho tried the cure, but perished in the experiment. Besides the hymn to Venus, there is also preserved to us the fragment of another Ode, in no less reputation among the poets and critics. It seems to have been written in the person of a lover sitting by his mistress, and is generally allowed to be the truest picture of one in that situation, that imagination can frame. Plutarch tells us in the famous story of Antiochus, that, being enamored of Stratonice his mother-in-law, and not daring to discover his passion, he pretended to be confined to his bed by sickness. Stratonice was in the room with the amorous prince when the physician
</p>
<p>Erasistratus came to visit him; and it is probable that his symptoms were the same with those which Sappho describes of a lover sitting by his mistress in the above Ode; for it is said the physician found out the nature of his distemper by those symptoms of love which he had learned from Sappho's writings. Hence we may conclude that she had a soul made up of love and poetry. As she was one who had felt that passion in all its warmth, so she has described it in all its workings and turns. She is called by ancient authors the Tenth Muse, and, by Plutarch, is compared to Cacus the son of Vulcan, who breathed out nothing but flame. From the character that is given of her works, it may be made a question, whether it is not for the benefit of mankind that they are lost. They were filled with such bewitching ten-derness and rapture, that a perusal of them might have been dangerous. This note may perhaps appear too long; but Sappho's character required a particular illustration.

<div2 id="cp15l5" type="commline" n="5">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Alterna requiras carmina</lemma>; for all Sappho's compositions were written in the lyric kind: whereas this epistle is of the manner of elegiac poetry, which consisted of alternate verses; one an hexameter, the other a pentameter.

Critics have observed, that this Epistle seems to be the most finished of all Ovid's works; and I am inclined to consider this passage as a strong proof of in; for I very much question whether in all his writings we meet with any thing that equals it. What can be more happily painted than her fond behaviour to her lover in her nightly dreams? or how can imagination form a more interesting scene than that of her retiring to the caves and groves which they had formerly frequented together, and soothing her mind by the remembrance of past joys? Ovid has omitted no circumstance that might serve to heighten the description, or awaken the attention of the reader; and, if some parts should seem to be too highly colored, the empassioned character of Sappho will furnish an excuse for the poet.

She, after some time, being desirous of seeing her sister Philomela, whom she had left at Athens, prevailed upon Tereus to sail thither, with a view of conducting her to Thrace. He, becoming enamored of her in the voyage, and finding it impossible for him to obtain the gratification of his passion by her own consent, ravished her; and then, to prevent her from disclosing the secret, and drawing upon him the vengeance of Progne, cut out her tongue, and imprisoned her. However, she found means to work the whole story into a web, which she sent as a present to her sister, who took the opportunity of a festival to rescue her; then killing her own son Itys, served him up in a dish to his father; who, discovering what had been done, would have slain both. But, as he pursued them, Progne was suddenly changed into a swallow, Tereus into a lapwing, Itys into a pheasant, and Philomela into a nightingale. It is to be observed, however, that Ovid differs from common tradition, in making Progne to have been changed into the nightingale, although several others who relate that fable agree with him.

<head>PARIS HELENAE</head>
<p>Paris the son of Priam, who was also called Alexander, having, for a judgement given in favor of Venus, received a promise of the possession of Helen, at that time the greatest beauty in the world, sailed for that purpose to Sparta, where he was honorably and kindly received by her husband Menelaus. After some time Menelaus went to Crete, to obtain the inheritance left him by Aeneas, and at parting recommended to helen a particular care of the stranger. Paris, who was deeply enamored of Helen, imagining that this opportunity ought not to be neglected, endeavoured by every artihec to seduce her. By this Epistle he informs her of his passion, insinuating himself into her good graces, by all those engaging virtues and charms, which usually serve to recommend a lover; and, being no stranger to the sex and their foible, and knowing well what influence form and address had upon them, he omits nothing which he thinks may engage the affections of Helen to himself, and make her husband appear contemptible. In fine, he urges her to receive him to her bed, and endeavours to palliate the guilt by tolling her he desired to muhe her his wife; for which purpose he concludes with persuading her to fly with him to Troy, where he promises to make her a great queen, and assures her that he shall be able to defend her against all attempts, by the strength of that kingdom.

This is the reason why Paris commends the wealth and opulence of Phrygia, and extols it above that of Lacedaemon. He endeavours to tempt her by a prospect of the honors that will be paid to her upon her arrival in her new kingdom, and artfully dwells upon that which is most apt to engage the notice of the fair sex,--dress and finery. Sparta, and Greece in general, were far removed from the luxury of Asia. Here the refinements in dress, equipage, and gallantry, even in that early age of the world, were carried to a great height.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nec proavo.</lemma> Tantalus was the father of Pelops, and consequently the great-grandfather of Menelaus. History, as related by the poets, has something in it very remarkable. He was king of Corinth, and entertaining the Gods at a banquet, to make trial of their divinity killed his son Pelops, and set him before them baked in a paste. They all abstained from the feast except Ceres, who tasted a part of his shoulder; for which reason, when he was restored to life, he had a shoulder given him of ivory. Tantalus, as a punishment for his impiety, was condemned in hell to a perpetual hunger and thirst, and obliged to stand up to the chin in water, and to have apples hanging just to his lips, without being able to touch either. There are some who give a different account of this matter: they tell us, that his crime was divulging the secrets of the Gods, and his punishment the fear of a great stone, always ready to fall upon his head. Ovid, Amor. lib. 3, makes the latter his crime, but gives the same account of his punishment as in the first part of this note:

Paris, as a lover, was attentive to every motion and every look: he could not bear that Helen should shew any signs of tenderness, even for her own husband; and, upon such occasions, his uneasiness was so great, that he was scarcely able to conceal it. At the same time, as he found that Helen was not quite a stranger to what he endured for her sake, he omitted no opportunity of giving her hints of his passion. While he affect-

Upon this he takes occasion to mention several others who had before engaged in the like attempts, that he might represent them as examples of that courage which he was ready to exert. The first instance is that of Hippomenes, the son of Macareus and Merope. He overcame Atalanta in running, by the help of three golden apples he had received from Venus, out of the gardens of the Hesperides. for, when Atalanta was like to get the better of him, he cunningly threw one of these apples in her way; the beauty of which tempted her so far, that she stooped to take them up, and by that delay fell behind.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Acheloia cornua fregit.</lemma> Achelous was the name of a famous river of Epirus, that took its rise in Mount Pindus, and divided aetolia from Acarnania. Its modern name is Pachicolmo. The ancients have handed down many fables concerning this river. They tell us, that he was the son of Oceanus and Tethys, or, according to some, of the sun and earth; and that, as he had equal pretensions to Deianira with Hercules, they engaged in single combat. Hercules was the conqueror, notwithstanding all the artifices of Achelous, who during the fight transformed himself into a variety of shapes, and among others that of a bull; in which form Hercules broke his horns. The most common solution of the fable is this. As Achelous was a considerable river, the poets feigned him to be the son of Oceanus. His course was full of turnings and windings, for which reason in the combat with Hercules he is said to have changed himself into a serpent. The roaring noise he makes when he overflows his banks, gave rise to the fiction of changing himself into a bull; and perhaps this may be the reason that the ancients painted rivers with horns, and that the poets so often describe rivers under the figure of a bull. Thus Horace, speaking of the Aufidus, gives it the epithet <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tauriformis:</lemma>
<quote lang="la"><l>Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus.</l></quote></p>
<p>As Achelous branched itself into two channels, these are fitly represented by the two horns; and, as one branch was dammed up by Hercules to prevent its overflowing the country, the poets have dressed this up into the fable of his cutting off the God's born.

However, like one expert in the art of insinuating himself into the favor of the softer sex, he has recourse to prayers and flattery, and paints the violence of his passion with all the lively strokes he is able to collect. But before he comes to the point, that he might by degrees prepare her for so open a discovery of his intentions, he endeavours to make her believe that he was moved to address her by a heavenly impulse; and that to resist would be opposing the will of the Fates. This was well imagined by the poet; who (since it was not his design to represent Helen as a vicious abandoned character, but as one who, having naturally something soft and amorous in her complexion, was gained over by flattery and an insinuating address) found it necessary to give this turn to the matter, that Helen might not be too much shocked at the proposal, or reject the lover's addresses with indignation and disdain.

That shame and reluctance which she would be apt to feel upon his proposal, he ascribes to simplicity, and want of knowledge of the world. Beauty, he tells her, was formed for soft and tender compliances; and the practice even of the Gods might convince her that it was no crime. He farther urges her from the fair opportunity they had by the absence of her husband; whom he endeavours to depreciate, and make appear contemptible. In a word, importunity and opportunity, the two grand engines established by men of elegance and art in this way of passion, are here played off to the utmost.

There may, however, be some ground to question its justness. Beauty, indeed, ever attracts the attention of the world; and they who re distinguished by it, are more exposed to attacks and solicitations; besides that a false step, in them, is always more noticed, and makes a greater noise than in another. Hence both history and private observation often furnish more examples of frailty in great beauties, than in those of a less remarkable character. This has given occasion to men of wit to throw that reproach upon beauty itself, which is merely imputable to some accidental circumstances, which for the most part accompany it.

<head>HELENA PARIDI</head>
<p>Helen, after reading the epistle sent by Paris, as if offended at his boldness, begins by reprimanding him; and then, with a counterfeit modesty, seems to reject his proposals, as contrary both to virtue and honor; yet in such a manner, that she would not have herself thought entirely insensible to his passion. By degrees she opens herself more plainly, and at last shews her inclination to be favorable to him. The whole is a remarkable example of the extreme artifice of females, and places their inconstancy, and seeming reluctance to comply, even when it is their most earnest desire, in the strongest light. The same poet, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">de Arte Amandi,</lemma> admirably describes this foible of the sex in a few lines:
<quote lang="la"><l>Forsitan et primo venit tibi litera tristis,</l>
<l>Quaeque roget ne se solicitare velis.</l>
<l>Quod rogat illa timet; quod non rogat, optat ut</l>

<p>'Perhaps you may at first receive a letter that reproves your boldness, and begs you will no farther solicit her for a favor which she cannot grant: she trembles lest you should comply with her desire, and wishes you may persist in demanding what seemingly she denies.' It is conjectured by some, that this Epistle was not written by Ovid, but Sabinus. But it is so much in Ovid's manner, and is moreover allowed by all to be so complete a model in its kind, that I am unwilling to deprive our poet of the honor of it. Some manuscripts have these two verses written upon the margin, to serve as a beginning to this Epistle:

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Si non, &amp;c.</lemma> Helen seems to wonder whence he could form a notion so much to her disadvantage, as to believe he might hope for any success in his attempts upon her virtue. Her smiling looks, her easy and frank behaviour, were most likely to raise this presumption. She begins therefore here, and observes, that as her fame was hitherto spotless, this ought to have given him no encouragement. Men who pretend to know the sex tell us, that those who affect a rigid severity, are sooner won than the free and open. Paris, whose character was that of a man well acquainted with all the ways of love and gallantry, must not be supposed ignorant of this: but as Helen, in the latter part of this Epistle, plainly discovers how much she was already prepossessed in his favor, we may conclude that he, who could not be insensible of it, was thence encouraged to make known his passion.

<div2 id="cp17l21" type="commline" n="21">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">An quia. &amp;c.</lemma> This was another particular from which Paris might draw hope. 'I have been carried away before, and partly (you may think) by my own consent.' To this she pleads her innocence, that when force was used, all that she could do was to shew resistance; and that she kept so good a guard over herself, that nothing dishonorable was offered.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nec tamen irascor.</lemma> All Helen's former protestations were merely to save appearances, and the affectation of a false modesty. She now begins to discover her real sentiments, but, we may observe, with all the artifices common to her sex; for she frequently breaks out in praise of chastity, and insinuates her own resolution not to break it; as if all the concessions she makes were purely accidental, and had slipped from her unperceived

<div2 id="cp17l47" type="commline" n="47">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nil ego, si peccem.</lemma> We see here what notion we are to form of all Helen's mighty boasts of chastity. It was more the fear of reproach and infamy, than any detestation of vice, that kept her from giving way to her passion; and accordingly we find in the end, that this restraint was too feeble to retain her long in her duty. True virtue is of a very different nature, and derives its value from itself, without any regard to the opinion of others.
<quote lang="la"><l>Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore,</l></quote></p>
<p>says Horace. Hopes of escaping undiscovered can be no motive to a man of this character; because he places his happiness in self-approbation, and dreads the reproach of his own mind, more than that of the world.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quintus.</lemma> His genealogy, as delivered to us by the ancients, is this: Paris, Priam, Laomedon, Ilus, Tros, Erichthonius, Dardanus, Jupiter. According to this account Paris is the seventh from Jupiter, whereas Helen makes him only the fifth. We must therefore conclude, that either the text is corrupted, or that the genealogy here referred to by Ovid, differs from that which is commonly received. Perhaps he designedly makes Helen fall into this error, as she was not supposed to be conversant in these points. We meet with several examples of this kind in our poet.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Primus</lemma>; for Jupiter was the father of Helen. It is therefore with reason she boasts of her own pedigree, as more illustrious than that of Paris, because she was nearer to Jupiter. The notions that now prevail with regard to birth and a noble descent, seem to be of a very different kind. The farther any one is removed from some distinguished hero who ennobles the race, the more honorable is he reckoned, from an imaginary value put upon the antiquity fo their line. If true nobility consists in personal merit, one should think the nearer to this, the greater the honor. It is hard, according to my apprehension, to conceive, how a hero who lived a hundred years age, cannot give the same credit to his descendants now, as he will do five hundred years hence.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l63" type="commline" n="63">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Siiam.</lemma> Helen allows that Asia was more wealthy, and better stocked with inhabitants; but then, as it was a country of barbarians, (for so the Greeks accounted all other nations,) it could be no temptation to her to abandon Sparta. This passage deserves a particular remark. Paris, in his Epistle to Helen, endeavours to draw her over by great promises, boasting of his illustrious descent, and the wealth and opulence of Phrygia. Helen is equally eager to convince him that none of these things can be of any weight with her. But all this was only to ingratiate herself the more with him, by insinuating that he was the only temptation, and that no other passion but what he had inspired, could make herswerve from virtue. The poet can never be enough commended for his artful manner and address.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l72" type="commline" n="72">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Auctor quoe pretiosa facit.</lemma> Helen still continues the same artifice to gain upon Paris. She had before seemingly slighted his gifts; here she retracts, and speaks of them as what were very acceptable to her; but, at the same time, takes care to intimate, that they derived their value entirely from the giver. This has been always looked upon as a sure sign that the passion of love has taken deep root; whence Paris might form great hopes of success. Terence in his Eunuch, when he brings in the parasite flattering his master, that he was greatly in favor with Thais, makes him offer, as an evidence of it, the value she set upon his present:
<quote lang="la"><l>Loeta est, non tam ipso quidem dono,</l>
<l>quam abs te datum esse: id vero serio triumphat.</l></quote></p>
<p>'She is pleased, not so much with the gift itself, as that it comes from you; for that in reality is what gives her the greatest joy.'
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l84" type="commline" n="84">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Non satis occultis erubuique notis.</lemma>  Helen does not censure Paris for these signs and tokens of his affection;  she only blames him for not taking care to dissemble better, lest he should raise suspicions in Menelaus.  All the circumstances are finely cnceived, and with that happy luxuriance of imagination which was peculiar to our poet.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l88" type="commline" n="88">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Amo</lemma>.  Love is fertile in expedients to attract the notice of the object beloved.  The reader is highly pleased with observing the manner and ingenuity of Paris, and the notice taken of it by Helen was a sure sign both that she had remarked it with pleasure and that it had not been without effect.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l97" type="commline" n="97">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Disce meo exemplo</lemma>.  This verse is thus explained by Hubertinus:  <gloss lang="la">Disce meo exemplo, quae, licet non habeam maritum pulchrum, tamen eo sum contenta</gloss>;  which, it must be owned, is ingenious enough.  If we can, however, credit Homer's account of Menelaus, he appears to have had a fine person.  Even Paris himself, in his Epistle to Helen, does not deny him that merit;  he only things that a comparison would not be to his own disadvantage.  Yet Helen, indeed, plainly gives the preference to Paris, adn even owns that she loves him, and that virtue only restrained her from yielding in everything to his desires.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l98" type="commline" n="98">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Est virtus placitis abstinuisse bonis</lemma>.  This indeed is a degree of virtue which very few are able to attain.  It comprehends a compleete mastery over our passions, and a well-informed judgment, able to distinguish between what is really profitable, and what hurtful;  for virtue does not absolutely forbid us all pleasures and enjoyments, but only such as are injurious to others, and prejudicial to ourselves.  Epictetus, that consummate moralist, was wont to say, that the perfection of virtue was comprised in these two words, <quote lang="la">Sustine et abstine.</quote>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l105" type="commline" n="105">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Priums de mille</lemma>.  Helen, while she is seemingly endeavouring to convince Paris of the impossibility of what he aims at, still goes on to give him all th proofs of her affection that he could wish for, and thus artfully encourages his hopes that he may one day bring her to yield to his utmost wishes.  Had you addressed me (say she) while I was yet under no engagement, and free to bestow my heart wherever my inclinations led me, you would have gained the prize from a thousand suitors, and Menelaus himself must have justified my choice.

Thus, in the Elegy upon the death of Drusus, he says,
<quote lang="la"><l>Fingebas redcucem, praeceptaque mente fovebas</l>

<div2 id="cp17l110" type="commline" n="110">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Invitam sic me nec.</lemma> Helen still maintains the character of an admirable dissembler, and occasionally drops some expressions which seem to bespeak a steady and virtuous mind. If she was not able to conquer entirely her growing inclination for Paris, she yet pretends to struggle with spirit against it, and to retain that regard for Menelaus, which decency and her engagements required. She therefore prays Paris not to urge her to what was so contrary to her honor and duty, or to take advantage of the strong and seemingly irresistible inclination which she had for him. There is great artifice in this; for she insinuates, that it would not be in her power to hold out long, if he persisted in his solicitations; and, from what passed in her own mind, she did not believe that her faint entreaties would prevail upon him to desist.

</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l123" type="commline" n="123">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ut me.</lemma>] Helen here speaks of Venus's promise to Paris, as a circumstance too much to her honor to be hastily credited. We see confirmed by this a common observation made upon the sex; that they are generally more concerned for the reputation of beauty, than virtue. Helen's fancy is so full of the imaginary honor done her by the Goddess, in preferring her beauty to that of every other woman, that she does not consider how far it implied infidelity to her husband, and breach of the marriage vow.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l129" type="commline" n="129">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Succense nimium miki.</lemma> It is pleasing to trace Helen through all the windings and turnings of her affection, and observe how she gradually rises in her advances to her lover. She owns that she is pleased with the promise made to him by Venus, and wishes it to have been true. She even proceeds so far as to shew an anxiety, lest he should be offended at her backwardness to credit his relation; and, to soften the matter, pretends that she considered it as an affair of too great moment to be rashly believed, because a disappointment would expose her to the most cruel mortifications.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l135" type="commline" n="135">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ergo ego sum virtus,</lemma> &amp;c. Helen's reasoning is admirably ealealated to excuse her weakness, and quiet the alarms and checks which her own reflection would be apt to give her. She dresses up the merit of Paris, and what he had done for her, in the most bewitching light, to make her compliance appear a point of gratitude. When the mind has once determined upon a thing, it is never at a loss to find out excuses and palliating reasons to avoid its own reproaches. What would appear horrid and shocking to it when well-disposed and untainted, will now be decorated with such circumstances. as will disarm it of all its terrors and guilt. This is exemplified in the most lively manner in Helen. How different does she now appear from what she was at the beginning of this Epistle? There she is full of resentment, accuses Paris accuses Paris of violating the sacred rights of hospitality, and wonders at his insolence in offering to make any attempt upon her honor. How much is the case changed here? She views every thing he had done with a different eye. His preferring her to valor and a kingdom, exposing himself to the dangers of the sea for her sake, and suffering all the anguish of a smothered love, are now placed to the account of merit. She no longer considers him as an enemy to her virtue and honor, one who intended to rob her of what should be most valuable and dear to her, and expose her to eternal infamy: but as a suffering lover, one more deserving of pity and compassion, than severity and frowns. By this she is led to think that gratitude and humanity require her to make some returns, and would, if possible, persuade herself, that her weakness in not rejecting at once his addresses, was rather a virtue than a crime.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l139" type="commline" n="139">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quid bikulum.</lemma> It is more, we see, from an apprehension of the impossibility of the thing, than any abhorrenes of the crime, that Helen shews so great a resistance. She looks upon it as a vain project to indulge a passion for a stranger, and like to yield to more profit, than ploughing up the sandy beach.  Many obstacles would intervene to obstruct their happiness:--busy whispers, the suspicions of her husband, and the necessity of his speedy return to his own country; all which are represented with a happy vein of wit and fancy.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l146" type="commline" n="146">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Difficilem culpoe suspicor.</lemma> The poet paints after truth and nature: and therefore his sentiments are just, and what every one's experience will teach him. It is certain that they who have been trained up to virtue, are very much shocked at the first advances to vice. They feel a reluctance which disquiets and makes them unhappy, and are apt to fancy that every thing betrays them. Helen very naturally descabes this to be the case with her. Although no particular familiarities had passed between her and Paris, yet, being conscious of what was likely to happen, she already imagines that it had taken air. Guilt made her quick-sighted in observing every nod and whisper. Looks and gestures that at another time would have passe: unobserved, are now construed to have a meaning. Nothing could have been more finely conceived.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l153" type="commline" n="153">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Maior non maxima.</lemma> Helen is now disposed to approve his passion, and to allow him whatever liberties he could take with prudence. Paris had told her, that Menelaus by his own behaviour urged her to a compliance, as his absence afforded her the best opportunity in the world, to indulge the stolen delights of love. She allows it; but, at the same time, thinks they ought to act with great circumspection, because, notwithstanding her husband's absence, there were still spies upon her conduct, who would not fail to aggravate every circumstance severely. What was this but telling him that she would withhold none of her favors from him, when a fair opportunity offered of granting them without danger of a discovery?
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l161" type="commline" n="161">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Vix tenui risum.</lemma> The reader may perhaps be shocked at this behaviour of Helen upon her husband's going to Crete. The concessions she has hitherto made, have been accompanied with an air of modesty and reserve. She would rather have them ascribed to pity and tenderness, than to any loose inclination. Here, on the other hand, she seems to own, that even before her husband's departure, she had not only received favorable impressions of Paris, but determined to grant him all without reserve; and had gone so far, as to ridicule Menelaus, and despise him, for his easy simple credulity. But this must be understood with some softenings: it is plain, from her manner of relating it, that she wished for his absence; but her smiling at his committing the Trojan guest to her care, might not proceed so much from contempt, as her own consciousness that she was fully disposed to obey his commands, and a certain pleasure she might take in perceiving he had no suspicion of their private. designs.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l169" type="commline" n="169">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Eadem mihi gloria dammo est.</lemma> The greater part of commentators give but a confused and unsatisfactory explication of this passage. Helen says, that the reputation of beauty, which on many accounts could not be disagreeable to her, was in the present case rather a disadvantage, because it made her remarkable, and the object of general notice. This obliged her to a strict attention over her actions, even over her looks and words, it being almost impossible that the least slip should pass unobserved. She feared therefore that her present sentiments for Paris could not long be a secret, and wished that her fame had been less, rather than be thus exposed to the hazard of a discovery. This I take to be the true meaning of the passage.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l171" type="commline" n="171">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nec, quod abest, mirare.</lemma> We see here a confirmation of what I have advanced in a former remark; that we are not to interpret Helen's smiling at her husband's recommending the Trojan to her care, as done in contempt of his easy temper and simplicity. She is so far from viewing it in that light, that, on the contrary, she thinks he had all the reason in the world to trust her; for that, however her beauty and fame might expose her to solicitations, her known virtue was sufficient to secure him against all suspicion of her ever proving unfaithful to him.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l172" type="commline" n="172">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Vitae cred dit ille meae.</lemma> Helen, as she more than once tells us, had hitherto lived without reproach; Menelaus therefore cannot be charged with imprudence in leaving her with this stranger, whom probably he thought well of, and in whose honor and virtue he reposed great confidence. However, the event made it appear, that a woman's being hitherto chaste, is no security for her future chastity.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l179" type="commline" n="179">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Et vir abest nobis.</lemma> This detail in the mouth of Helen is very happily imagined by the poet. She collects all the circumstances that invited her to a compliance, with a minuteness and strength of fancy, that give us plainly to understand her thoughts were often employed this way: and that her only concern was how to bring it about without ruining her reputation with the world, or shocking the delicacy of her lover.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp17l185" type="commline" n="185">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Utinam bene cogere possis.</lemma> Helen here throws off the mask entirely, and owns her willingness, if proper care should be taken to afford her some excuse for her weakness. There is nothing more here than what is to be met with in all her sex. What favors they grant of this kind, proceed usually from the warmest inclinations: yet they would rather have them appear extorted by violence and force, than a free grant. They fear that their lover may despise a victory too easily gained.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Utilis interdum est ipsis iniuria passis</lemma> because it is by this seeming injury that they excuse their fault. Whoever reads over this Epistle with attention, will see that Ovid has exhausted all his wit and ingenuity upon it; nor is there in all his writings so strong a view of the turns and artifices of women. I cannot therefore sufficiently wonder how it ever entered into the head of a critic, that this Epistle was not written by Ovid.

None of them are drawn from the amiableness of virtue, or the baseness of the crime itself. these had no weight with her. She is concerned only for her reputation, and particularly wishes to avoid infamy. She foresees too, and with good reason, that such a step might bring her into contempt, even with the person in favor of whem it was taken. What security, says she to paris, can you afterwards have of my fidelity? will not my easy consent to your proposal make you suspect me with every stranger that lands upon your coasts? This reasoning is unanswerable. No union can be firm and permanent, unless it be founded upon virtue. Where a false step has once been made, every temptation alarms; and we are apt to suspect that she who could not resist in one case, will he as little able to resist in another.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pulsa est aesonia,</lemma> &amp;c. Paris had made great promises to Helen; but these were usual in soliciting favours of this kind; and, though given with the greatest air of sincerity, were very little regarded afterwards. She therefore tells him, that these promises could give her little security, since it appeared from numberless examples, that those who trusted to them were in the end deceived. She instances particularly in Medea, and insinuates her fears of a like fate to herself.

I am terrified too by the flaming torch, which, in your mother's dream, seemed to spring from her womb before your birth. Add to this the prophecies which foretell that Ilium shall be consumed with Grecian fire. It is true that Venus favors us, because she carried off the prize, and by your judgment triumphed over two.

<p>The Hellespont is a narrow sea that divides Europe from Asia. Sestos and Abydos were two cities that stood directly opposite to each other, one on the side of Europe, the native place of Hero, and the other in Asia, where Leander lived. These young persons being violently enamored of each other, and fearing to let their passion be known to their parents, Leander could devise no other expedient for obtaining the temporary society of his mistress, than by swimming ever the Hellespont in the night; which he and so often, that it at last became easy and habitual. But a storm arising by which he was detained from his mistress for seven days, he writes her this epistle, and engages a bold mariner, notwithstanding the storm, to cross over with it to Sestos. He endeavours first to convince her that his love is steady and unalterable, and then breaks out into complaints, that by the unrelenting fury of the waves he was precluded from an opportunity of swimming over to her. In fine, he promises that he will be with her very soon; and, should the sea even continue to rage, will rather expose himself to danger, than be for any length of time deprived of the pleasure of seeing and conversing with her.

The story runs, that this nymph (who was one of Diana's train) suffering herself to be seduced by Jupiter, and having a son by him, Juno, whose jealousy soon led her to discover it, changed them both into bears.

Her mother contending with the Nymphs for the prize of beauty, they in revenge bound Andromeda naked to a rock, and exposed her to be devoured by a sea-monster. She was delivered by Perseus, who thereupon married her. She was, by the particuiar favor of Minerva, enrolled with her husband and mother among the stars.

He had no sooner tasted it, than, following the example of the fishes, he threw himself

<div2 id="cp18l175" type="commline" n="175">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">An malim dubito.</lemma> Leander here expresses himself in the language of a man who is in the utmost anxiety and distress. He is almost within sight of his mistress, and yet as much deprived of her company, as if they were separated from each other by the greatest distance. The nearness gives him hope of being with her soon, but accidents intervene to prevent it: thus hope changes into impatience and distraction. In this anxiety of mind he thinks it would he better for him to be at a distance from her, because in that case he must endeavour quietly to submit to his fate, and would not thus feel himself exposed to the mortification of frequent disappoint ments.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Flamma propiore calesco</lemma>; that is, as Crispinus well expresses it, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Flamma ardentiore, et impatientiore.</lemma> And this is the reason why Leander doubts whether it would not be better for him to be so far removed from his mistress, that the could have no hopes left of seeing her at all; for the greater the desire and expectation, the more insupportable the pain of a disappointment.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp18l180" type="commline" n="180">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Lacrymas hoc mihi pene movet.</lemma> We have here an admirable picture of a man fluctuating between hope and disappointment. His manner and expressions betray the impatience of his soul; and his compating himself afterwards to Tantalus, is extremely well judged. For, besides that there is a great resemblance in the two cases, it is natural for these gloomy and disagreeable ideas to present themselves to a mind under such a series of perplexities.

<div2 id="cp18l188" type="commline" n="188">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Plcias</lemma>; the Pleiades; seven stars, placed near the knee of Taurus, and tail of Aries.

Jupiter, when a child, was fed by the milk of this goat, by some called Amalthaea. Others say, that Amalthaea was the name of Jupiter's nurse, who mixed the goat's milk with honey. However that may be, the goat was translated into heaven, and there made a stormy constellation. She was called <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Olenia capra,</lemma> from Olenos, a city of Peloponnesus, where she is said to have nursed Jupiter. Others derive this appellation from one Olenus, the son of Vulcan, and father of the nymphs aega and aelice, Jupiter's nurses. Whoever would wish to observe the confusion, into which the ancient poets ran with respect to these fables, may consult Hyginus.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Aut ego non novi.</lemma> "Either I mistake in judging to what a degree of rashness love will carry a man, &amp;c.' This way of speaking may sometimes occasion a little obscurity; but the sense of the passage is plain enough. Leander had been complaining, that even in summer the sea was sometimes too rough to be passed without great danger;--What then, adds he, can I propose to myself when winter comes on? But either love is not so rash and headstrong as I am apt to fancy, or even then he will push me to hazard myself amidst storms and tempests.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp18l197" type="commline" n="197">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Optabo tamen, &amp;c.</lemma> Nothing can be more affecting than this wish of Leander, as it gives us a strong picture of the violence of his passion, and shews at the same time the tender and pathetic sentiments with which it had inspired him. It is certain, that love, when strongly rooted in the heart, is attentive to a thousand little particulars, which a mind not affected in the same manner would overlook, or perhaps despise as trifling. Leander seems here to take a pleasure in the imagination of what may happen, should his body be thrown upon the coast within sight of Hero. Her tender complaints and tears are all foreseen and numbered; and he considers them as a recompence for his hard fate. A thought like this must come from a mind extremely sensible to all the soft emotions of love. It is to be remarked here, that this in the end proved to be Leander's fate. He made some attempts with success; but, astorm arising one fatal night, Hero in the morning saw his body floating near the shore.

<head>HERO LEANDRO</head>
<p>Hero, after receiving Leander's letter, returns this answer. her chief design is to make him sensible of the ardor of her passion, and prompt his way to the mutual embraces of love. Sometimes she accuses him of sloth, but with no other view than to demonstrate a constant unaherable love. At other times she chides the perverse waves. Again she fears that Leander may have transferred his affections to another; but she soon rejects the unjust suspicion, ami ascribes all to the well-known anxiety of lovers, who are apt to fancy themselves threatened with every disaster. In fine, terrified by a foreboding dream, she counsels him not to venture until the sca is calm.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ponitis in vari&acirc; tempora, &amp;c.</lemma> Hero gives some reasons why so long a separation must be more irksome to her than to him.  Men, as having naturally more resolution and strength of mind, might justly be supposed more capable of enduring distress. They had it, moreover, in their power to drive away anxiety by a variety of amusemen's. Women, on the contrary, were deprived of the se reliefs: and she, in particular, could do nothing but think and talk of her Leander. Her whole reasoning is wonderfully adapted, not only to prove what she had advanced, but also to win the affection of her lover, by in innating, with he greatest delicacy, how dear he was to her.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Unctae palaestrae.</lemma> It is known, that the contenders in wrestling, and other exercises, anointed themselves with oil: hence the <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">palaestra,</lemma> the place or the act of contest, had the epithet <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">uncta</lemma> sometimes given to it.

<div2 id="cp19l28" type="commline" n="28">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Impositas tanquam servet arena notas.</lemma> Nothing can be more natural, or better conceived, than this. Lovers are ready to believe every thing that serves to soothe their passion. Even impossibilities are by them strongly fancied. What is more unlikely, than that sand constantly washed by the sea should retain the traces of feet? and yet Hero, as if fully persuaded of it, runs to the beach to look for them. Even in cases of less impatience than seems to be that of Hero, something of the like kind is observed to happen. Who, having experienced the loss of a friend really dear to them, have not sometimes entertained a vain hope of his appearing to them again, and perhaps repaired to his tomb, and called him aloud, in a fond expectation that he might hear and answer? This passion is finely touched in Dr. Watts' beautiful poem upon the death of his friend Mr. Gunston.

<div2 id="cp19l29" type="commline" n="29">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Utque rogem de te, et scribam tibi.</lemma> Heinsius complains very much of this verse, as harsh, and offensive to the ear. he thinks that the whole distich ought to run in this manner:
<quote lang="la"><l>Utque rogem de te quaeramque, huc si quis Abydo</l>
<l>Venerit; aut scribam si quis Abydon eat.</l></quote></p>
<p>He moreover conjectures that the distich which follows, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quid referam, &amp;c.</lemma> ought to go before this. Penelope says much the same in her Epistle to Ulysses:

<p>4.4 <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pallade iam pingui. Pallade</lemma> is here instead of <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">oleo</lemma>; for Pallas, or Minerva, is said to have first taught men the use of oil. Such as excelled in swimming, especially when they knew they should have occasion for the utmost extent of their art, were accustomed to anoint themselves with this, as being of great service to them; for it not only made their joints nimble and pliable, but prevented them from being numbed by the coldness of the water.

<div2 id="cp19l47" type="commline" n="47">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Jam certe navigat, inquam.</lemma> The poet's art appears here in its full dimensions. The more narrowly it is examined, the more of its worth we discover. Any one who has allowed himself to reflect at all must be sensible, that the imagination is never more busy, than when conversant about an absent beloved object. It is not only apt to run over all the scenes that have passed between them, but also to fancy the manner in which it may be employed at present. Hero's discourse with her nurse is a true and natural example of it; and she more so, as she imagines her lover setting about what she most earnestly desired, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">viz.</lemma> preparing to swim across to her.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pancaque cum tacta.</lemma> The accurate Heinsius rejects the common reading here, as not being able to understand what the poet meant by <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tacta terra.</lemma> Several copies, he observes, have <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tela</lemma>; which emendation he highly approves. He further conjectures, that, by a mistake of transcribers, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tacta</lemma> has been put instead of <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tracta</lemma>; for <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">trahere telam</lemma> was a common phrase, as <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">trahere lanam, trahere pensam.</lemma> So <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">facere telam</lemma> was used instead of <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">facere lanam.</lemma> The conjecture is ingenious. Orispinus, however, thinks there is no necessity for so far-fetched an explication, because the words, according to the common reading, may be very easily understood; for, in lengthening out a thread, it is usual to let the spindle gradually descend till it touches the ground; after which it is wound up, and the same is repeated in a constant succession.</p>
<p>5.5 <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Deceptae noctis. Decipere noctem</lemma> means, 'to elude the night, or get over the tedious hours by some pleasing amusement." Some rather think, that <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">decept&aelig;</lemma>; ought to be referred to Hero herself, who, after passing the night in an uneasy expectation of her lover, found herself in the morning disappointed:  <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ubi pars maxima noctis acta est mihi deceptae.</lemma>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l67" type="commline" n="67">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Firmius &pound;o cupidi.</lemma> This wish is introduced with great propriety. Hero, after recounting her dreams, and the short unsatisfactory joy they gave, could not conclude in a more natural way, than by expressing her earnest wishes, that those fleeting transitory pleasures might be soon turned into real joys.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l73" type="commline" n="73">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Cur ea praeterita est.</lemma> Hero, in all parts of this letter, maintains fully the character she had given herself at first, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">viz.</lemma> that of an ardent solicitous lover. She watches times and seasons, and complains if she is disappointed in what she might expect from them. As, the night before, the storm had somewhat abated, she wonders he did not take the opportunity of coming to her.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l76" type="commline" n="76">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Hoc melior certe.</lemma> Although she owns in the following verse, that the storm remitted for a very short time, yet here she does not aseribe his stay to that consideration, but is rather apt to fear that his concern for her begins to diminish, and that, having been with her before, he is not willing to incur the same hazard for a second interview. We have in this a true picture of the human heart, which, in proportion to the value it sets upon any thing, is extremely apprehensive about losing it. the case is still more remarkable in lovers, whom the most trivial circumstance in life often fills with a thousand anxieties and alarms.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l77" type="commline" n="77">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">At cit&ograve;.</lemma> This, as Crispinus observes, is to be considered as an objection and excuse offered upon the part of Leander: as if Hero had said, "I know you will plead that the interval of the storm was short, and that, dreading this with reason, you were unwilling to venture." She immediately replies in the next verse, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tempore, cum properas, &amp;c.</lemma> "Alloa that you were afraid of the raging sea, yet why did you not come when it was clam? The interval, though short, continued longer than you usually take to swim across." This answer, rejecting Leander's excuse, was well judged in the poet: for, however good his plea might be, yet passion, we all know, pays very little regard to the voice of reason.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l79" type="commline" n="79">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nil quod querereris haberes.</lemma> Leander had owned this in his own letter; but we are to consider it on both sides as the language of thought-less love. Their chief concern was to conceal their passion from their parents; and yet such an accident as this must have discovered all. But it was not to be supposed, that, in the height of their anxiety at disappointment, they would be in such a frame of mind as to attend to the consequences of things.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l89" type="commline" n="89">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Unde novus timor hie? &amp;c.</lemma> Hero still discovers the height of her passion by her anxiety. The anxiety too that she discovers, is that of an ardent lover, such as magnifies every difficulty, and fills with false fears. She knew well enough that since his first swimming over to her, there had been no storm nearly equal to the present. There was no cause then to wonder why his courage was abated, as it had never been put to the same trial before. But Hero, attentive only to his long absence, will not allow herself to reflect upon the danger, but charges him with want of courage for not attempting to do what was impossible.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l100" type="commline" n="100">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Thressa puella.</lemma> Heinsius gives his opinion in favor of this reading, moved by the general contempt in which the Thracians were held by the Greeks, as we learn from their history. Thus aemilius Probus tells us of its being objected to Themistocles, that he was born of a Thracian mother. Athenaeus too remarks, that Timotheus, the celebrated general, had for his mother a Thracian and a courtezan. Hence also in Valerius Flaccus, book 3, Zethes and Calais are called by Jason, in a way of contempt, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Thracia proles:</lemma>
<quote lang="la"><l>Nunc Parthaonides, nunc dux mihi Thracia proles:</l>
<l>Aspera nunc pavidos contra ruit agna leones.</l></quote></p>

</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp19l102" type="commline" n="102">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nescio qua pellice captus.</lemma> Jealousy is said to be inseparable from love, especially where the lovers by distance are obliged to be often absent from each other. This, I believe, is an observation that experience will confirm in all cases: at least it is plain our poet thought so, who was no ill judge of these matters; for we find that it seldom fails to creep into his Epistles. I do not know, however, whether the ladies may not be apt to think him a little too partial in the case. Jealousy is a weakness, without doubt; and we meet in history with instances where great minds, if they were not able wholly to guard against it, yet, from a sense of shame, maintained a hard struggle to conceal it. Accordingly we find that Ovid throws it for the most part into the female epistles, as more likely to attack that frail sex; but with what justice I will not say. All allow that it is strongest in women; but perhaps we may find it most frequent among men; and I am apt to think it not altogether without reason that it should be so.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Omnia sed vereor,</lemma> (<lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quis enim securus amavit?</lemma>) If Hero cannot wholly hide her suspicious from her lover, yet they are expressed in so delicate and handsome a manner, that it is impossible he should take offence. She owns he never gave her any cause for them, and that they are nothing more than those unavoidable disquiets which ever attend upon love. This was absolutely necessary for the poet's design. He was to represent in Leander and Hero a chaste and mutual passion, that he might raise the greater compassion in his reader, when he reffects upon their unhappy fate. It would have been altogether inconsisted it with this to introduce a passion sullied with black suspicions on either side. The poet was more a master of his subject, and has made Hero say no more than might naturally be expected from any one in her circumstances, how well soever assured of her over's affections. Accordingly we find that the poet's intention has been fully answered; never have any two lovers been more frequently mentioned, or with greater marks of compassion for their fate.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Crimina vera iubet, &amp;c.</lemma> There is no state of mind more uneasy than that of uncertainty, especially in cases where it highly concerns us to be resolved, and where of consequence there must be a high degree of impatience. The reflection therefore which Hero makes is just; and, as she was herself in a state of uncertainty, comes from her with great propriety.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Si neque Amymone.</lemma> Hero now addresses herself to Neptune, and expostulates with him for keeping her Leander so long from her. She tells him, that this was least of all to have been expected from him, who had himself been so often sensible of the power of love. She then mentions several virgins, of whom the poets had represented Neptune enamored. Amymone is mentioned first. She was the daughter of Danaus, and one of the fifty who afterwards rendered themselves so famous by the murder of their husbands. As she was hunting one day in a wood, being elosely pursued by a Satyr, she implored aid from Neptune, who came and rescued her, but was so enchanted with her beauty, that she proved with child by him, and, according to Strabo, brought forth Nauplius.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Circeque, it Alymone nata.</lemma> Commentators have been much perplexed by this passage. Heinsius observes, that some fault must have crept into the text, because we find so great a variety of readings in ancient manuscripts. Instead of <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Circe,</lemma> many have <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ceyce, Ceiceque, Ceyceque</lemma>; for <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Alymone,</lemma> some exhibit <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Aleone, Amemone, Anthcone,</lemma> with about thirty others, which need not here be repeated. It is to be observed, however, that the greater number of manuscripts agree in <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Avcone</lemma> or <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Aneone.</lemma> To say truth, the explications given are for the most part so confused, that one is at a lost what to make of them. I shall only therefore remark, that some crities are for retaining the commonly received reading, but differ in their manner of pointing it; for they make it run thus: <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Circe et Alymone nata</lemma>; as if the poet meant the daughter of Circe and Alymone. This, they tell us, was Iphimedia the wife of Alocus, mentioned by Homer in his Odyssey; who also tells us, that she was ravished by Neptune, and bore to him two great giants, Orus and Ephialtes, that every month grew nine inches.

The poet makes this observation come rather from Hero than Leander, it being most usual for that sex, to indulge in these little superstitious observances.

Ovid, in this epistle, is of the same mind. Theocritus, in his Idyllium called Europa, which some ascribe to Moschus, marks distinctly the time of night when dreams are true:</p>

<head>ACONTIUS CYDIPPAE</head>
<p>Delos was an island of the aegean sea, and the most distinguished of all the Cyclades. Here Diana had a temple, and was worshiped with a particular solemnity. Acontius, a young man, being present at the celcbration of these sacred rites by a numerous assembly of the finest ladies of the island, happened to cast his eyes upon Cydippe, a lady of high rank and beauty, and became deeply enamored of her. But not daring to make known his passion, as he was so unequal in rank, having devised a new method of deceit, he took one of the fairest apples he could find, and wrote upon it the two following verses.
<quote lang="la"><l>Juro tibi sane, per mystica sacra Dianae,</l>
<l>Me tibi venturam comitem, sponsamque futuram.</l></quote></p>
<p>"I swear to you inviolably, by the sacred mysteries of Diana, that I will join myself to you for ever as your companion and bride."</p>
<p>This done, he throws it at the feet of the young lay, who, not suspecting the deceit, took it up and read it, and thereby solemnly devoted herself to Acontius. For at that time there was a law in force at Delos, that whatever any person should swear in the temple of Diana, should stand good, and be inviolably observed. But her father having some time after (not knowing what had passed promised her to another, she was seized with a sudden and violent fever, just at the time when the marriage solemnities were to have been performed. Acontius hearing of it, and willing if possible that the business should take a turn in his own favor, writes to Cydippe this epistle, in which he endeavours to persuade her, that the fever was sent from Diana, as a punishment of the breach of the vow made in her presence. This, and the other arguments which on such an occasion would occur to a lover, form the whole subject of this letter.
</p>
<div2 id="cp20l1" type="commline" n="1">
<p>Heinsius observes of this epistle, that it has suffered more, perhaps, than any other from the carelessness and incorrectness of transcribers, and that in many places it is so defaced, one is at a loss how to gather any consistent sense. I have been deeply sensible of this in the translation, and must own that there are several passages about which I am not myself satisfied. However, I have taken all possible pains not to mistake the author's meaning, and have generally fixed upon that sense which seemed to be most natural and easy, and to agree best with the whole tenor of the epistle. The oldest editions, and some manuscripts, present us with the following distich, as fit to be prefixed to this epistle:
<quote lang="la"><l>Accipe, Cydippe, despecti nomen Acont&icirc;,</l>
<l>Illius in pomo qui tibi verba dedit.</l></quote></p>
<p>"Receive, Cydippe, this, subscribed by your despised Acontius, by him who deceived you with the inscription upon an apple."</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pone metam.</lemma> Acontius, as we have seen, had already deceived Cydippe: she might therefore be apprehensive of some now fraud, and in this notion refuse to read his letter. Acontiu, endeavours to prevent this, by assuring her that he had no farther intentions of that kind, and that, satisfied with having once obtainad her promise, he meant no more, than to remind her of her engagements, and give such advice as might tend to her recovery.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp20l4" type="commline" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Uila parte dolente.</lemma> If Acontius was the cause of any disaster to Cydippe, he would easily persuade her that he has so purely by accident. He intended no more than to secure her to himself. Her own disregard of her vow had occasioned that illness, of which he suffered all the anguish in the most sensible manner.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp20l13" type="commline" n="13">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sed idem tamen acrius illad.</lemma> This is one of these passages I have already mentioned which cannot easily be explained. It is uncertain what we are to understand by this <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">idem</lemma> twice mentioned, or to what it ought to be referred. The sense I have affixed to it, though perhaps not altogether satisfactory, was yet what, upon due consideration, appeared to me the most probable.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp20l22" type="commline" n="22">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Fiaudis causa feratur amor.</lemma> Acontius seems here to accuse himself, but with the greatest cunning and art. He has discovered the way of owning his crime in such a manner, as to give it rather the air of a merit. It was excess of love that hurried him to that bold step. A fault arising from this, can plead many little circumstances to alleviate it; and the person against whom it is committed, is usually the first to forgive it.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp20l24" type="commline" n="24">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Id me, &amp;c.</lemma> Heinsius remarks severely upon this line, and is so far displeased with it, that he rejects the couplet entirely, as unworthy of Ovid. But whoever considers our poet's manner, and how much he delights in these and iguities and pointed turns, will see no reason for so harsh a criticism. Crispinus has very well paraphrased the passage, and so as to give as the sense clear and distinet. <gloss lang="la">"Id, nempe tibi jungi, quod tibi querimoniae causam praebuisse putas, id ipsum est quod potest nos conciliare."</gloss> Marriage not only joins our persons, but reconciles minds that were before at variance.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Adstrinxit verbis, &amp;c.</lemma> The reader cannot fail to be pleased with the ingenious manner in which Acontius excasus his fraud, by throwing the blame wholly upon love. He pretends that he had neither a natural turn for expedients of this hind, nor an apiness acquired by use and practice. This is extremely well calculated to gain upon Cydippe, as it speaks a passion strong and lively, and at the same time insinuates, that she was the first who had made a conquest of his heart.

<div2 id="cp20l29" type="commline" n="29">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sponsalia</lemma>; a contract of marriage; for, as we have before seen, the vow into which Cydippe was so artfully betrayed, bound her to join herself for ever to Acontius in wedlock.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Silamen est.</lemma> Ovid is remarkable for the ingenious turns he gives to things. This reflection, thrown in naturaily after owning the fraud, quite effaces that idea, and leads us insensildy to excuse a step for which he alleges so plausible a plea.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp20l33" type="commline" n="33">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">En iterum.</lemma> It is worth while to observe with how much artifiee and ingenuity Acontius blends his former fraud of the inseription upon the apple, with this latter one of writing her a love epistle, and, in each case, throws the blame entirely upon the person and attractive charns of Cydippe. By this he means to insinuate, that, as in the latter instance there was nothing read, criminal, it might in like manner he inferred that the former was equally harmless.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp20l39" type="commline" n="39">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Plures imponere nodos.</lemma> It may at first seem strange to the reader, that Acontius, who had just before owned his crime, and endeavoured to alleviate it from the circumstances in which he found himself, should suddenly so far change his mind, as to avow it openly, and profess himself ready to repeat it a thousand times, did the case admit. But, as we have aheady remarked, he had quite changed the idea of the thing, and, by the ingenious turn he gives it, makes it appear rather as a merit. It was therefore well judged after this, to boast rather of an action that spoke the strength of his passion, and to avow, that far from repenting of it, he was ready to repeat it, to give that fresh testimony of a continued unalterable love. He had already bound her with one chain; and so earnest was he to secure her to himself, that were it possible to tie her down by a thousand more, he would gladly take that method, to prevent a possibility of losing her.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Non sum qui soleam.</lemma> Acontius introduces this, to show that his resolution was fixed and unalterable, and that he was not to be deterred by any views of danger.

<div2 id="cp20l55" type="commline" n="55">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tufaeis hoc.</lemma> Acontius studiously softens what he says, by giving it such a turn as was most likely to make it agreeable to his mistress. Cydippe could scarcely refuse to forgive a fault, that took its rise from an admiration of her charms.

But whether she had been so far duped, as to be under an obligation to marry Acontius, was the point in question.

Here he was accused without any hopes of the desired recompence; for his mistress was upon the point of being given up to another. This naturally calls into his mind the fate of others, who in like circumstances had yet been far more fortunate.

'You refuse to use the right you have over me as a slave, when you condemn me in my absence, though you are empowered to summon me before you, and manage the trial in my own hearing.'

<head>CYDIPPE ACONTIO</head>
<p>Cydippe, having received the foregoing epistle from Acontius, and, after perusing it, finding reason to suspect that her present illness proceeded from Diana's resentment of her broken vow, is inclined to yield to the desires of Acontius, though her parents stood differently affected, rather than continue under her present load of affliction. She begins by pretending a certain unwillingness to be too free in acquainting him with her sentiments, lest, as formerly in the case of the apple, she may be insensibly led to bring herself under new engagements. Upon this she takes occasion to mention her first coming to Delos, and the manner in which she was ensnared by the artifice of her lover. The narration is wonderfully beautified by a just collection of circumstances, and occasionally enlivened with proper reflections. Towards the conclusion of her epistle, after inveighing against his treachery, she gradually softens to a compliance, and is even under some concern to remove the jealousies and suspicious he might entertain of his rival. In fine, she consents altogether, and ends with a wish that their marriage may be consummated without delay.
</p>
<div2 id="cp21l1" type="commline" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sine murmure</lemma>; that is, in perfect silence, without so much as a murmur; fearing that she might commit another oversight, and bring herself under some new engagements.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quos vereor.</lemma> It is observable, that in all manuscripts, two or three excepted, there is a deficiency of the rest of this epistle. Many therefore are of opinion, that the verses which follow this are not Ovid's, but have been supplied by some other poet. This notion receives yet greater weight from the authority of the critics, who have remarked that the whole epistle falls very much short of the usual spirit and elegance of Ovid. For this reason we are to consider it as at best of doubtful authority.

They could not imagine it probable that Ovid, so distinguished by a certain plainness and evenness of style, would have used the figure called by grammarians <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tmesis</lemma> in this word especially, and at the end of a verse. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Tmesis</lemma> is derived from the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">te/mnw</foreign>, <gloss lang="la">scindo</gloss>, <gloss lang="en">I divide</gloss>, and is a figure by which the parts of a compound ward are divided by the interposition of another, as in Plautus: <cit><quote lang="la">Sed ne stultus ego, qui rem curo publicam</quote> <bibl n="Pl.

According to the common reading, the passage seems destitute of consistent meaning.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Decipe.</lemma> Cydippe hints at her sufferings, and the cause of them, which, according to her own account, was love. If then his love was so fatal to her, what had she not to fear from his hatred? This gives rise to her injunction, that he should still persist to deceive her; having reason to apprehend less danger from that, than if he should change his mind.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp21l57" type="commline" n="57">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Si laedis quod amas.</lemma> If there be anything in what we have remarked before, that Ovid was not the author of this epistle, it is certain that whoever supplied it has copied him closely; for his ingenious turns and witticisms are imitated with the greatest exactness. The present distich is an undeniable instance of this. Any one in the least acquainted with our poet's way, would at first sight conclude it to be his, so great is the resemblance.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp21l58" type="commline" n="58">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Velle velis.</lemma> Heinsius strongly contends, that there must here be some mistake of the transcribers. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Velle velis</lemma> is a way of speaking to which he can never be reconciled, as it appears extremely harsh and unpoetical. He therefore substitutes for it, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">perdere dure velis.</lemma> This conjecture of Heinsius is not altogether without reason.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp21l59" type="commline" n="59">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Aut tibi iam nulla est.</lemma> This reasoning of Cydippe, however specious, is manifestly fallacious. Whatever degree of favour Acontius might be in with the Goddess, his prayers could not avail to pacify her resentment, unless Cydippe at the same time resolved to make good her engagements. For, as breach of vows had first provoked her rage, there was no way left to remove her anger, but by a removal of the offence. Acontius therefore had done all that could be expected from him: he had acquainted Cydippe in what manner she was to hope for relief; and, if she refused the terms, no blame could lie upon him. This will be better understood, by considering attentively what follows, near the conclusion of the epistle.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cp21l63" type="commline" n="63">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Elige quid fingas.</lemma> The argument that Cydippe here uses against Acontius, is what we commonly call a dilemma, in which way of reasoning an adversary is puzzled whatever part he take. But Cydippe is not contented with this she urges her lover still farther, and tells him, that he can find nothing in either branch of the argument, in the least favorable to his cause. Her way of stating it is this: "Aut non vis, aut non potes placare Dianam. Prius si dicas; ergo immemor es nostri, nec nos curas: posterius si fingas; ergo Diana est tui immemor, nec te curat." Her manner of reasoning is ingenious and puzzling; but, when narrowly examined, will, as we have observed already, be found a mere sophism.

<div2 id="cp21l69" type="commline" n="69">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Quo pede processi.</lemma> These repeated interrogations, expressed with an air of admiration, have a wonderful effect in painting the passions, especially where compounded of detestation and grief.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Mota loci fama.</lemma> Ovid's descriptions are generally consistent with truth and nature. There is nothing more common, when any disaster happens to us, than to trace in our mind all the little circumstances and particulars that concurred to it. We are apt to imagine a certain fatality in things, and see ourselves hurried on by a train of circumstances that rendered it unavoidable. As almost every one has some time or other felt this to be his own case, he will be the better able to judge how far the poet in this description copies nature. Cydippe, from a reflection upon her misfortune, is led to run back to its first origin, and the several steps by which it arrived. The narration is enlivened with very apt reflections, and all the particulars that served either to promote or retard it, are mentioned with great exactness. Delos was an island of the aegean sea, and chief of the Cyclades, famous especially for the birth of Apollo and Diana, to whom it was therefore in a particular manner sacred. It was formerly a floating island, concealed mostly under water; hence it is called by our poet in his Metamorphoses, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Delos erratica.</lemma>

Cydippe therefore means, that Acontius, in triumphing over her, can acquire no such glory, as did Hercules by vanquishing Hippolyte.

It would have been both a more honorable and secure way of succeeding. He had now nothing to trust to but the shadow of an oath, which, as it was pronounced without assent of the will or judgment, could not with any appearance of reason be thought binding.

<div2 id="cp21l147" type="commline" n="147">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Fac iurent reges.</lemma> Cydippe endeavours here to put Acontius out of conceit with his own device, by representing it as absurd, and contrary to common sense.
